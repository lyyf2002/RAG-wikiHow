, This will act as the chiller.

, You will need to drill a lot of holes in the top of this.

, Be sure not the tape over any of the holes you drilled!

, If you can get your hands on dry ice, it will work much better. Take the PVC pipe (the end with the piece of wood attached facing the floor/ground) and fill up the pipe with ice, or dry ice. If you are using dry ice, you will have it break it up into small pieces to fit into the tube. Since dry ice is very hard to break up, you will need a hammer. Make sure not to fill it right to the top of the pipe.

, Take the tube and put it right over the nozzle of the fog machine. Make sure it's right over it, or else the fog won't even make it through the entire pipe.

Make a couple of templates in different sizes ranging from small to large. The easiest way is to fold a piece of paper in half and draw out half a bat and then when you’re happy with the opened shape use this as a template to create the rest using black paper. Then simply place on the walls and ceilings using blue tack. It looks especially effective when the bats flock across a wall and into the corner of the room and up onto the ceiling.

Such symbols can be seen in Egyptian art.

,  These little symbols represented and communicated ideas.  What do you think these stand for?  Wings, birds, crocodiles, a grain of wheat, a cat, a flower, and a tree. Can you draw small pictures to tell about your life?

, Look up these topics: mummy cases, Egyptian writing and art.  This information will help you to see how mummy cases actually looked and to visualize what this project is about.

,  On practice paper, draw a series of rectangles, triangles, squiggly lines, scallops, fish scales, dots and stripes.  These patterns can be used either horizontally or vertically.  This type of repeated design is used on mummy cases.

,  First, make an outline of the mummy case.  Obtain an 11"" X 14"" piece of watercolor paper from a pad.  Position it vertically and at the top, draw a circle the size of a ping-pong ball.  Beneath that, draw a horizontal shoulder line.  Use a ruler to drop a vertical line down the center to the bottom of the paper and make a long triangle for the body.

,  Sketch the mummy's features, eyes, ears, nose and mouth.  Remember to elongate the eyes, as the Egyptians did. Put a crown and an Egyptian headdress on the figure.  Flare the tails of the head piece out on either side and have it end on the chest.

, Draw lines and shapes to fill in the body area.  Try for symmetry, keeping both sides the same.

, This will make coloring it easier. The finished drawing will look a lot like a coloring page ready to be colored.,  Make brilliant patterns, stripes, zig-zags, etc.  Press hard on the crayon to deposit a lot of wax on the sheet.  Later, you can add glitter glue and gold and silver acrylic paint to mimic the richness of a mummy case.

,  Remember, it is fun to blend two shades on top of each other.  Outline the eyes with black and extend them like ""cat eyes."" Color the beard dark, keeping it slender and neat.

,  Work upward to make a crown. On top of that, place a small rectangular shape representing a cone of fragrant beeswax. The more colors and shapes, the better.  Often a snake was depicted on the crown standing out from the forehead.,  Work until there is no white paper showing.

,  Follow with a line of black.  Now is the time to add metallic paint, as much as you desire. You could even glue on sequins or jewels.,  Mount it on a richly colored board.  Use foam dots to adhere it to the board if you wish.  It will stand out slightly. Pretend it is being displayed in a museum case.

Build the frame.,
Put the shirt on.,
Stuff the shirt.,
Put the overalls on.,
Give him hands.,
Give him feet.",How to Make a Scarecrow1," Begin by centering a 5 foot (1.5 m) stick near the top of a 6 to 8 foot (1.8 to 2.4 m) stick, rake handle or garden pole. This creates the shoulders of the scarecrow. Fasten the shorter stick in place using a screwdriver and screw, some twine, or hot glue., Dress your scarecrow with an old plaid shirt, using the horizontal stick for his arms. Button the shirt up the front, then tie the arm ends and bottom of the shirt using twine or wire.

, Strategically stuff the shirt to fill out your scarecrow. Straw, hay, leaves, grass clippings, wood chips and rags are all acceptable stuffing materials.Try to avoid using newspaper to stuff your scarecrow, however, as rainfall may cause it to become soggy and shapeless.Use extra stuffing to give your scarecrow a potbelly if desired.

, Make a hole in the seat of the overalls for the vertical stick to pass through. Put the overalls on the scarecrow, placing the straps on the shoulders. Tie the cuffs with twine or wire. Fill out the legs of the overalls using the same stuffing as you used for the shirt.

, Old fashioned scarecrows had straw sticking out the cuffs of the shirt sleeves, but to make a more realistic human form, you can use old work gloves or gardening gloves. Fill the gloves with enough stuffing to keep them in shape, tuck in the ends of the shirt sleeves, then secure with wire or twine.

, Stick the cuffs of the pants into the tops of some old work boots, or other shoes. Secure using either string sewn into each component, or hot melt glue.


Alternatively, try using double sided tape, such as carpet tape, to attach the boots.
Whatever method you use, make sure the attachment is secure, or your scarecrow will lose his feet.

Using burlap.,
Using a pumpkin.,
Using a pillowcase.,
Using other household items.",How to Make a Scarecrow2," A burlap sack, used to protect trees, or carry potatoes and coffee beans, is perfect for making a scarecrow head. To make a burlap head:


Stuff one plastic grocery bag full of other plastic bags until you have the right size for a head.
Place the bag in the center of a piece of burlap then cut a wide circle around it. There is no need to measure it or cut a perfect circle.
Gather the burlap around the plastic bag, and place on top of the vertical pole (the scarecrow's neck) before tying tightly with twine or wire.

, Use a jack o' lantern to make a seasonal scarecrow head. First, choose a nice, round pumpkin. Cut a large, round hole on the top of the pumpkin (around the stem) and scoop out the insides. Use a sharp knife to cut out the facial features of your scarecrow. Skewer the bottom of the pumpkin onto the scarecrows neck and secure with glue or tape if necessary.


Do not place a candle inside the pumpkin as you normally do with jack o' lanterns. The rest of the material used to make your scarecrow is flammable.
Other vegetables, such as gourds and turnips, could also be used for this purpose.
Be aware that pumpkins and other vegetables will eventually rot, so if you want your scarecrow head to last longer, consider using an alternative method.

, A pillowcase is another option for making a scarecrow head and is something which you are likely to have around the house. To make your scarecrow head with a pillowcase:


Half fill the pillowcase with straw or the stuffing material of your choice.
Pin the pillowcase with safety pins to prevent the stuffing from falling out the bottom, but don't close the bottom up entirely.
Insert your scarecrow head onto the vertical pole (neck of the scarecrow).
Push until the top of the pole is at the top of the pillowcase, right through the straw.
Secure the pillowcase to the pole using twine or wire, then cut off the excess material and remove the safety pins.

, The are any number of possibilities when it comes to making your scarecrow's head. If you're trying to keep the cost of building your scarecrow down to a minimum, just use whatever items you have lying around. Here are some ideas:



Pantyhose. Select a natural skin tone pair of pantyhose. Cut the upper part of the leg off on one side, tie a knot in it, and fill it with stuffing, letting it taper to a ""neck"" before tying the other (lower) end onto the vertical pole.

Bucket. Impale a bucket filled with dirt right-side-up on the scarecrow's neck, for an unconventional yet functional head.Milk jugs. One-gallon plastic milk jugs are another great choice for scarecrow heads. Their smooth surface is perfect for drawing facial features on and is waterproof. You're also sure to have one or two lying around the house. Again, just impale on the vertical pole, and secure with glue or tape if necessary. "

Give your scarecrow facial features.,
Give your scarecrow some hair.,
Accessorize.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Scarecrow3," You can give your scarecrow facial features using an endless array of materials. Decide whether you want him to look smiling and happy or grumpy and menacing. Here are some ideas:


Draw on his eyes, nose and mouth using a black magic marker.
Cut out triangular shapes from pieces of colored felt for eyes and nose. You can sew them on or attach with hot glue.
Use different sized or colored buttons for eyes, nose and mouth. Sew on or attach with hot glue.
Use bits of black plastic or pipe cleaner to make eyebrows. Slant them downwards to make an angry scarecrow.

, Glue some straw to your scarecrows head to give the effect of hair. Don't worry about making it look neat, he's supposed to look scary, after all! Alternatively, glue an old wig to his head or use an old mop.

, You can personalize your scarecrow by accessorizing it any way you like. His most important accessory, however, is a straw hat. Use any old hat you have lying around and secure to his head with hot glue. Here are some other (optional) accessorizing ideas:


Tie a red bandana around his color, or leave a bright handkerchief peeking out of his pocket.
Jazz up his hat using some brightly colored plastic flowers.
Stick an old pipe in his mouth.
Tie reflective or shiny ribbon to your scarecrow to add movement and reflect light.,"

These can all be used to create decorations. You might have construction paper that is leftover from your children’s school projects. Tissue paper, popcorn, and jars are also useful materials that most people have., You can generally find pumpkins at your local grocery store. Artificial jack o’ lanterns are generally pretty cheap. You might want to buy balloons and streamers to use as decorations. Felt is also useful and inexpensive., You can carve a pumpkin or buy a plastic jack o'lantern from your local convenience or dollar store. This is one sure-fire way of creating a haunted atmosphere. You can place them in a line on your front porch.

, Fill a black trash bag full of leaves, old magazines, or any paper you can find. This will be the spider’s thorax. Stuff a second trash bag with similar material. Twist this bag in the shape of a leg. Make several other ""legs"" in this manner and connect them to the spider. You can do this with glue or duct tape. Place googly eyes on the head of the spider. You can put these on your lawn., Draw a bat shape on felt or construction paper. You can use an online template for this. You may want to make bats of varying sizes. You should use a white pen when you make this sketch, so that you can see the design. Cut felt or construction paper using your sketch as a guide. Then, you can hang the bats on your walls or string them together for a haunted look., Find a balloon, preferably made of Mylar, fill it up with air, and throw an old white cloth, towel, or blanket over it. Then, you should cut circles out of black tape. Attach these to the balloon to create a ghost face., Try to turn off all the lights in your house. Light the space with candles. This lighting will have an eerie effect. You can also try setting your house lights on a timer, so they flash at odd intervals. This will create the illusion of dark forces at work.

, It's not hard to make a spider web. You can use yarn, doilies, or cheesecloth to make them. Once they're done, put them around your house. If you make them big enough, you can even put plastic spiders on them. Don't make them too big, unless you want your guests to get stuck in them.

, You only need everyday household materials to do this. Fill a jar with water, sprinkle in food coloring, and then place the head of a teddy bear or doll in it.Try to make several of these and put them on your kitchen counters. Give the jars odd, weird labels, like ""Witches' Brew"" or ""Blood of the Innocent."" This will make them seem more realistic.

, Make fake blood, then splatter it all over your bathroom's surfaces. This will make your bathroom look like a scene from a horror movie. Try dipping your hands in fake blood or ketchup and pressing them on the curtains for an extra touch.

, Tell your neighbors and friends a couple of weeks in advance that you need them to populate your haunted house for a night. They will probably be willing to aid you. You may even find that they will be excited to play the treacherous ghouls in your haunted house.


Give your guests instructions such as ""Jump out whenever somebody comes a foot-length distance from you"" or ""Scream very loudly occasionally to freak guests out.""
If there are children coming, you might want to ask your actors to be mindful of your guests' young age and not make the house too scary.

, Tell your actors to dress up in simple costumes. For example, you could have them pretend to be zombies. To create a zombie, you just need fake blood and old clothes. Don't forget to have them practice the all important stumbling zombie walk!


Provide your guests with blankets with holes cut out for eyes and have them pretend that they are ghosts.

, For example, if you have an actor who is playing the grim reaper, they can say “It’s time to take some souls.” Or, perhaps, if an actor is playing a vampire, they can scream “I want to suck your blood!” Zombies are simple to write for. They just need to moan.

, Set the miter saw to an angle of 40.8 degrees (90 – 49.2). Cut one chamber. Reverse the work piece and cut the same chamfer on the other side. Cut it long and then make a few extra cuts until you match the bottom length.

, Cut the 40.8 degree angle on one side – leave the work piece long since you will be cutting a different angle on the other end. Do a fit check at this point. The bottom side and long side should mate nicely when positioned on the bottom work piece.

, Angle should be 36.8 degrees. Again, match the side length to the bottom length.

, Cut the 36.8 degree angle on one side – leave the work piece long since you will be cutting a different angle on the other end. Again, do a fit check.

, For reference, marked a number on the bottom and the matching side since each length could be slightly different.

, If not, adjust as needed. Attach the sides to the bottom and to the other sides. Use glue and clamps. Wood filler could be used at this point.

Gather your supplies.,
Create a bone shape out of several pieces of newspaper.,
Connect the balls to the tube shape with masking tape.,
Make tea using a gallon of water.,
Dip 1 piece of plaster cloth into a bowl of the tea.,
Remove the plaster cloth from the tea.,
Smooth the plaster cloth over your newspaper bone.,
Paint your bones white or some other color.,
Scatter the bones around your yard or stick them in the ground.

",How to Make Halloween Props1," To make fake bones you will need old newspapers, masking tape, sheets of plaster cloth, a gallon of water, and several tea bags. You also have the option to paint your bones if desired.;
, Roll up several pieces into a tube shape. Roll others into small balls of various sizes. Make enough newspapers balls and tubes so that the ratio is 4 newspapers to balls to every 1 tube.

, Place two newspaper balls onto each end of the tube to create the most realistic bone shape.

, Use tea bags; loose tea is not good for this project because you do not want any tea leaves to get on your finished product. The tea will be used to dye the plaster cloth used in the next step., Plaster cloth is a cloth that hardens into an outer shell when it becomes wet and is then wrapped around a surface (such as your newspaper bones.) Dipping the plaster cloth into the tea will dye the cloth a yellowish grey and will give your bones an aged look.

, Squeeze the tea out of it by running the cloth between your middle and index fingers. If your plaster cloth is too wet when applied to the newspaper, your newspaper bone might lose some of its shape.

, Start at one of the ends of the bone and work your way down to the other end. Cover the bone in plaster cloth pieces. When the bone is entirely covered, place it somewhere safe to let it dry.Small bones should take several hours to dry. Larger bones may take up to a day to dry. Test your bones for dryness by touching them. If the plaster cloth still feels wet or slightly sticky, continue to let the bones dry.

, Only do this if you do not care for the aged coloring that the dyed plaster cloth gives your bones.

Decide on the extent of your decorating.,
Look for parameters or guidelines if you are decorating your car for a special event.

,
Choose a theme.,
Coordinate the theme of your car decorations with your own costume.,
Purchase decals and easy to apply decorations from craft stores, department stores and online.

,
Turn your car into a famous vehicle from popular culture.,
Pick decorations that will fit the size of your car.,
Ask for help.,
Choose a theme and decorate around that theme.,
Set up some props in, on and around your car.,
Include music.,
Pass out candy.",How to Decorate a Car for Halloween," You can do simple decorations, such as small decals of spiders and ghosts on your windows or major projects like decorating your entire truck and giving out candy from your car.

,, You might choose one Halloween character and decorate your car with things that relate to it. For example, choose a witch theme and decorate with witch hats, cauldrons and broomsticks.


Do something scary, such as a vinyl monster that looks like he is sitting in your backseat, or something amusing like a pirate theme with treasures and swords on display.

, For example, if you are dressing as a clown, fill your car with balloons. If you are dressing as a vampire, place fang decals on your car.

,, Celebrate Halloween by decorating it like a race car or a car from the movies and television such as K.I.T. from Knight Rider or the General Lee from the Dukes of Hazard.

, If you have a truck with a bed in the back, you will have a lot more flexibility than if you have a small car with limited trunk space.


Utilize all your space. Use your trunk, your seats and the outside of your car to complete the theme you are decorating around.;
, The more people you enlist in your car decorating, the more fun you will have and the quicker you will get it decorated.

, For example, turn your car into a zoo and decorate it with animals. Or, go with a graveyard theme and put some coffins in the back of your truck and turn seats into headstones.

, If your car is going to be stationary, you can surround your car with zombies. Open all the windows so vampires can peek out and place scary or funny items consistent with your theme on your hood and roof.


Visit a craft store or party retailer for supplies. For example, use thumb tacks to hang ghosts or webs from your ceiling. Pick up some spray paint to create a spooky or glow in the dark effect on windows. Silly string can make a convincing spider web, and so can a rope web, which can be found at Party City.

, Use your car stereo to play festive Halloween music such as ""The Monster Mash"" or ""Thriller.""


Take advantage of digital music services like Sirius XM. They often have holiday music stations that will be helpful.

, Halloween treats are essential in a decorated car.

Gather supplies.,
Purchase pieces of blue or pink insulating foam boards.,
Pick out a gravestone you would like to create.,
Use a utility knife, jigsaw, or regular serrated knife to cut the foam into the shape you would like your gravestone to be.,
Glue pieces of foam together if you want to make your gravestones thicker.,
Glue the gravestone onto a base.,
Paint your gravestone.,
Paint the name, date and epitaph onto the gravestone.,
Paint your gravestone with lighter paint on top of the previous, darker layers.,
Place your gravestones on your lawn.",How to Make Halloween Props2," You will need large foam boards, a utility knife, dark grey paint and light grey paint, a plywood board, a paintbrush, and a sponge. You should also get a stencil if you would like to stencil your letters on rather than freehand them.

, These can be purchased at Home Depot or other hardware stores. Foam boards take paint well and are sturdy and durable., Look at photos or go to a cemetery and take notes on the shape you would like your gravestone to be.

, Give it a rounded top, make it rectangular, or make the top pointed-it is up to you.For a more ornate look, cut multiple pieces of foam out. These can be glued side by side for a wider gravestone. Play around with shapes. Cut the foam pieces into arches, circles, triangles, etc.

, Make sure that the two pieces are cut in the same shape. Use a construction adhesive (like PowerGrab or DAP) to glue the pieces together. , The base can be made out of plywood, plastic, etc. it just has to be heavier than the foam tombstone (so that the gravestone doesn’t tip over.) Apply the glue to the bottom of the gravestone and hold it onto the base until it dries. Once relatively dry, let it stand and dry on its own for several minutes.

, The most effective paint is exterior grade, latex house paint. Start with darker paint first and ‘stain’ your gravestone. Paint on any cracks or weather stains with this darker color., Use a dark paint to do this. Use a stencil for the letters or paint them on freehand. Your gravestones can be funny, realistic, or scary. For realistic headstones, head to your local cemetery to get a sense of what normally goes on a gravestone.


You can also choose to paint your letters on last, after all of the others layers of paint have been put on. They will stand out more if you choose to paint them last. You can also paint them in red to give them a spooky, less-realistic look.

, Make sure to paint around the name and epitaph (these should remain dark). Use a wet sponge to blend the light and dark paints for a more realistic, weather-stained look. Let the paint dry., For an even spookier look, place them near homemade ghosts or cover them in fake cobwebs.

Gather your supplies.,
Select a pair of old shoes that you know you will not be wearing again.,
Stuff the toes and bodies of the old shoes with newspapers.,
Tape a bone into the shoe.,
Pour or paint red paint onto the top of the protruding bone.,

, They can be any type of shoe-tennis shoes, high heels, dress shoes etc. but do not use open toed shoes.

, Make sure that you can’t see any of the newspaper from the mouth of the shoe. This will give the shoes the appearance that there is actually a foot inside of them.

, Take a bone that you have made (see Making Fake Bones above) and tape it up against the back of the inside of the shoe with duct tape or masking tape. Make sure you put enough tape on so that the bone does not fall over and out of the shoe.

, Let the red paint drip down the leg and into the shoe for a more realistic look. Splatter the paint onto the shoe. Let the paint dry.

, You could also have it propped against your car or leaning against a homemade gravestone.

Purchase a large glass or plastic vase or tank.,
Place stones, glass beads, or aquarium ground coverings on the bottom of the vase.,
Fill the vase or tank with water.,
Add the doll heads to the water.",How to Make Halloween Props4," You will need several dolls (that you can take the heads off of), a utility knife, weights, a vase or tank, red glass beads, water, glue, red dye, and a wooden spoon.

, The number of doll heads is up to you. You can use old Barbies or other types of dolls. Dolls can also be purchased cheaply at dollar stores. Make sure you are not using a doll that somebody cares about; the heads will be very challenging to reattach to the body.


It is best to use doll heads that are hollow because it will be easier to cut the eyes out and it looks spookier.

, Use utility knife to cut the eyes out of the head. Be very careful, as utility knives are incredibly sharp.

, Vary the weights from head to head so they don’t all sink to the bottom of the tube. Leave some heads without weights. Construction adhesive (like PowerGrab or Gap) works best for this project.


Weights can be bought at a hardware store. You can also substitute weights for rocks.

, This will give the doll a bloody, scary look. Let the paint dry.

, Make sure that the vase or tank is large enough to hold all of the doll heads you have made. The vase can be any shape but some typical styles are rectangular or round.

Vases can be substituted for actual aquariums if you have one you wish to use.







, Use red glass beads for an extra creepy look.

, If desired, add red dye to the water and still with a wooden spoon. This will make the water look like it is blood.

, Let them sink to the bottom or float on the top. Adjust their positions for the spookiest possible effect. Make sure you put the aquarium somewhere where there is enough light to admire it by.


If you are using the doll head aquarium as an indoor decoration, use it as a center piece on a table or place it next to a bowl of candy.

",How to Decorate with Alien Cocoons for Halloween," Lay out a roll of dark paper or fabric large enough to cover your space, and spray paint them to add dimension and give them the color you want.;
, This is like wallpapering, only not as precise or sturdy. Measure the height of your walls and cut sheets three or four inches longer off your prepared paper or cloth. Attach them to the wall with duct tape (rolled to be two-sided), black thumbtacks, carpentry staples, cord and hooks, or any way they stay up. Use the remaining paper to cover your ceiling and any bare patches.

, Light this with large black lights for an eerie glowing effect.

, Fill the room with thick fog to add atmosphere.

,, Unpack and stretch a rope of spiderweb, following the instructions on the bag. Hang most of the length where it can stay clean, and get a hook or helper to hold it still, a few feet from the free end. Fan out the free web until it's one or two feet wide. Inflate about 5 balloons taped together, or stuff and tie shut a large garbage bag, and wrap it evenly in the fanned cobweb. Cut the cobweb away with the scissors and twist it around the top of the bag or balloon to gently secure it, so it has a twisted tail of web on the same side as the bag's handles or the knot of the balloon. Repeat with the remaining balloons or bags, until you have a large cluster of web-covered globules to hang from the walls and ceilings. The more you make, the better it will look. Reserve 5 or 6 bags of web for the mother alien egg.

, Layer on gray, black, and any other colors you want on them to hide the print on the grocery bags or the surface of the balloons, tone down the white webbing, etc.

, Hang them by their tails using tape, carpentry staples, or whatever works best on your ceiling, keeping the large ones toward the back and concealing any Albertsons logos that might show through. Let them bunch up and rest against one-another.

, Deepen the shadows, hide flaws, spray the tails to blend into the backdrop, etc.

, Uncoil and stretch your last bag of web, tear off a large chunk, and spread it evenly all across a cluster, reinforcing the cocoons and further screening them in mystery. Repeat for the other clusters, spread remaining web decoratively around the front of the entryway, or wherever you can think of. Spray paint the webbing that covers the clusters so it blends into the walls and doesn't appear so stark white.

,, Add food coloring to the gel to give it a tinted look.

, This method will create a very realistic blood pattern, and if you have covered all surfaces, will not make a mess.

,, (non toxic for the children)

,, Remove the chain from a chainsaw, and when the children enter the room, jump from the closet, chainsaw roaring, and chase them around the room. The slippery surfaces of the hanging alien egg sacks will frighten and gross-out all involved. This is a variation of the 'peeled grapes as eyeballs"" kiddie haunted house of our youth.

, Use the sounds of hogs squealing in reverse, chains rattling, and strange outer space synthesizer effects to finish this frightening haunted basement!

, Lay down newspaper, butcher's paper, a tarpaulin, etc., to protect the floor or ground surface from spray paint.


This location should be somewhere that is well ventilated; outdoors is even better.

, Add supports on the edges of the curtain, to keep it firmly stretched across the floor or ground.

, Make sure that the cutout is placed straight, and does not slant at all. If needed, place some weights on the template to stop if from moving or blowing away (if you're outside). The weights may get sprayed, so only use things you don't mind this happening to, such as rocks, items to be recycled, etc.

, The paint should be sprayed only lightly (spraying it too thickly will reduce the effect that you are aiming to achieve).


The cutout will prevent the area it covers from getting dyed.

,,, Spray paint each of these curtains green but do not use the cardboard cutout. Now you have some plain green curtains which will help to make the scary curtain seem even scarier.

, Hang the scary curtain in one of the most prominent and easily noticeable places of the room.

, Now you will be able to see that in the dark, all the curtains glow green. The scary curtain with the man's image will give the impression of a shadow with glowing red eyes, waiting behind that curtain.

, Watch the fun as they scream.

Make the menorah the centerpiece.,
Burn scented oils.,
Place a few dreidels around the table.,
Display the Star of David.,
Serve tasty fried foods.,
Hand out small gifts.",How to Set a Hanukkah Tablescape1," As the title “Festival of Lights” suggests, the most exalted Hanukkah tradition is the ritual lighting of a new candle for each day of the celebration. The menorah itself will be your most important decoration, and should assume the central position on the table so that it commands the most attention. Let a different member of the family light one of its eight candles every night.Ordinarily, the menorah is placed in front of a window or in sight of the front door so that it can be seen from outside.Start your own tradition of using a menorah that’s a family heirloom.;
, Oil also has an important history with Hanukkah, as it was used to keep the candles lit and purify the temple in Jerusalem after it was reclaimed. Carry on tradition by placing small bowls or basins of olive oil at either end of the table. This way, you can purify and invite blessings into your own home.


For a more modern touch, you can set up scent diffusers to incorporate oil into your Hanukkah decorations while also filling the room with pleasant fragrances.
Make sure the oils you use are permissible under kosher laws., The dreidel is as much a symbol of Hanukkah as the menorah. In historical times, these simple spinning toys were made by Jewish children, who used them to amuse themselves during holiday festivities. Include a dreidel with each place setting on the table so everyone can have a little fun once dinner has concluded.Many dreidels are inscribed with words, numbers or symbols, allowing you to use them to play games for special prizes.Bring the beloved toy to your table in the form of dreidel-shaped napkin rings or candle holders.

, The six-pointed symbol represents the Jewish people and their beliefs. As one of the key images of the Jewish faith, it can often be found in the foreground of major celebrations. Proudly show off the Star of David on your dinnerware, clothing or in standalone decorations.You can also craft your own Star of David decorations by creatively arranging different materials.The Star of David serves as a visual reminder of the covenant that exists between God and the Israelites.

, Prepare a few standard Hanukkah dishes like latkes (fried potato pancakes) and doughnuts as part of the meal. Fried foods are in keeping with the holiday’s oil motif and call to mind the single jar of oil that miraculously lit the Jewish temple for eight full days. This is one of everyone’s favorite parts of the celebration!Take a look at recipes for favorites like latkes and sufganiyot.
Have a special dessert like rugelach ready to cap off a delicious meal., Another Hanukkah custom is to surprise loved ones with gifts to show generosity and appreciation. The gifts are usually simple and small enough to fit at each of the table’s place settings. Though it’s not a hard and fast rule of celebrating Hanukkah, exchanging gifts is a good way to get in the giving spirit.One time-honored Hanukkah gift is gelt, or chocolate coins wrapped in shiny metallic foil.Nowadays, families can give clothing, jewelry or even gift cards.

Go with a blue and white color scheme.,
Pick out simple yet sophisticated place settings.,
Use inspired lighting.,
Hang a banner.,
Make room for guests.",How to Set a Hanukkah Tablescape2," Your Hanukkah table setup can be as fancy and formal or playful and casual as you want. Have fun trying out different ideas and keep your guests in mind while putting everything together. Use this chance to let your personal sensibilities shine through while remaining faithful to the air of humility surrounding the holiday.


A quieter, subdued presentation may be preferable if you're hosting older or more traditional guests.
You could also turn your Hanukkah celebration into a true party. Hang dazzling decorations, play games and hand out fun gifts or party favors.
Put together a special Hanukkah playlist to have going in the background, complete with holiday favorites like ""The Dreidel Song,"" ""Mi Y'Malel"" and ""Light One Candle.""

, Just as red and green have become associated with Christmas, blue and white are the colors historically used to designate Hanukkah and the Jewish people in general. You can introduce blue and white into your holiday decor by making the colors part of the table cloth or runner, china and ornamental table toppers. The colors complement one another elegantly and look beautiful in a variety of displays.A tremendous amount of items can be found in blue and white, giving you a wide range of options for decorating.If you’re shopping around for a fresh look, try decorating with metallic blues and silvers instead of plain colors.

, Hanukkah is primarily about reverence and paying tribute to the victories of faith, but that doesn’t mean your home’s decor has to be a bore. Handpick silverware, linens, glasses and other dining accessories in sleek, attractive designs that catch your eye. Set out a lavish runner as the focal point of the table, or fashion handmade name cards to go at each guest's seat. The possibilities are nearly endless!Include extra color and flair in the form of under plates or place mats.
Scatter metal or plastic coins over the tabletop or string them together into garlands to craft a grown-up version of gelt.
If you'd rather not bother with lots of dishes and cleanup, just pick up some plastic tableware and keep things casual.

, Accent the table with candles and decorative lights of all sorts. Try turning down the overhead lights and letting the candles do most of the work. For a more modern take, you can update classic conventions by finding candle holders in blue and white tones or shapes that play off the eight-armed, staggered structure of the menorah. Get as extravagant as you please—after all, it’s called the “Festival of Lights” for a reason!Place dozens of small tea lights around the room to create a warm, surrounding glow.
String up blue, white and gold paper lanterns for a contemporary twist on Hanukkah lighting.

, Whether it’s the flag of Israel or a jovial runner bearing a “Happy Hanukkah!” message, a vibrant banner or more traditional sukkah (paper-chain) may be just what you need to complete the look of your dining area. You could also drape blue and silver garlands around the room to stay in keeping with other holiday traditions. Arrange these accents directly over the table or pin them up them in the background and enjoy the occasion in style.Most party supply stores sell Hanukkah decorations which can help you lend some flair to your home.
Make sukkah with young kids as a Hanukkah art project., These days, many of us have friends and loved ones who we cherish that come from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds. Reserve a spot for these people at your table and invite them to take part in the food, laughter, joy and togetherness of your Hanukkah celebration. The essence of the holidays is to extend love and kindness to those who are dear to us, regardless of whether or not they share our faith.Non-Jewish friends and relations are often more than welcome to join in celebrating the holiday.
Many people convert or marry into the Jewish religion, meaning that there can be a mixture of religious traditions within a single family.

Finished.

",How to Make a Haunted House in Your Front Yard," Before spending your Halloween savings, it's a good idea to have a plan in mind to guide your purchasing. It's very likely that you'll be able to reuse existing decorations and recycle items in your home as well as purchasing decorations, and this will keep down the costs considerably. Things to plan include:


An overall design or theme for your front yard haunted house (see next step).
Areas that will be ""out-of-bounds"" (such as mom's favorite rose garden) and how you'll prevent people from accidentally wandering into such areas.
A color theme (if relevant).
What you'll use to provide the ""house"" walls - a tent, a marquee, or simply draping sheets, black plastic, or tarpaulins up as ""walls"".
Lighting and electrical requirements – you'll need outdoor quality electrical fittings as well as safe means for running cords outdoors without them becoming tripping hazards.;
, As part of the planning, you'll need to design a layout. It's important to have at least three interesting things in your haunted house display for the trick-or-treat bunch to be thrilled by, so think carefully about what you'll include that's different from the usual Halloween decorations. Some suggestions for your haunted house theme include:



A graveyard theme: dedicate the area to graves, coffins, crosses, zombies, and skeletons; the color theme will be dark, with grays, browns, and blacks being predominant. Your surprise elements might include a grave or coffin that opens with lots of squeaking noises, dry ice smoke billowing up, a very ugly zombie effigy, etc.

A ghoul theme: have lots of phantoms, ghostly figures, and flying, flapping elements in the front yard; the color theme will have lots of white and light grays. Your surprise elements might include a ghoul that rushes out now and then (use a person for this), strange ghostly noises, things brushing against cheeks, etc.

A wizard and witches theme: include effigies of wizards, witches, their familiars such as black cats and wolves, cauldrons, broomsticks, etc. Your surprise elements might include cackling noises or thunderbolt cracks, a bubbling cauldron with some unidentifiable concoction brewing,
Try to find unique items that provide a scare, thrill, or amusement element for all ages.

, There are a number of things you can make yourself at home, or you can purchase items at stores specializing in Halloween decorations. Some ideas of things to make include:


Gravestones: Get some gray cardboard, and cut them into the shape of grave stones. Write some ""cutesy"" names on it, such as Frank N. Stein, Zom B., Jack O. Lantern, or I. M. Dead, etc.
Spider webs: Take rolls of toilet paper, and ""string"" them along the branches on the trees outside of your house, in the shape of spider webs. An alternative to toilet paper is cotton wool.

Ghosts: Take white kitchen garbage bags, and fill with old newspapers. Tie up, and then, with a black marker, draw two eyes and a mouth on each of them, to make little ghosts.
Jack-o-lanterns: When raking up leaves, purchase orange biodegradable leaf bags which look like jack-o-lanterns, and leave on the lawn for the big night.

, If you're using a tent or marquee, put it up according the instructions. If you're using sheets, black plastic, or tarpaulins, you'll need to find items to hang them from (such as sturdy tree branches or fences) or place bamboo or similar posts into the ground to secure them to. Tape and rope on firmly to prevent falling during the evening.


Make sure that the entrance way to the house is clear of clutter, garden beds, fragile plants, etc. that you don't want people to accidentally tread on. Also try to close off any sides that might encourage people to wander off into the rest of your garden and become lost. Use simple props like chairs, cardboard signs, etc., to direct people away and back into the haunted house.

, Follow your plan when setting up the items. Keep checking that your theme is being evolved clearly and that any color theme is adhered to.


Ensure that it's easy for visitors to move around.
Ensure that all electrical cords are out of the way of feet and that nothing presents a fire hazard.
A strobe light can be excellent inside the haunted house – it will add to the eerie effect.
Set up music. Scary music CDs can be purchased from dollar stores, or you can download Halloween themed music online.
Make space for standing and sitting either inside the haunted house or just outside it – this will allow you to keep an eye on the trick-or-treat bunch viewing the haunted house and to give out the treats.

, Perhaps a row of old-fashioned or antique lanterns could lead the way? Or a series of fairy lights? Or signs? The choice is up to you. Whatever you use, make sure the pathway is easy to navigate and free of obstacles.


Buy a nice, big fat pumpkin, or several. On a piece of paper, draw a design of the kind of face you'd like to put into your jack-o-lantern. Once you've chosen the face you like, carve it into the pumpkin.
Light the lanterns for Halloween. The only lights that should be evident from your haunted house are those emanating from decorations, lanterns, strobes, and jack-o-lanterns, with your house kept dark. This is why it's important to ensure that there is nothing for visitors to trip over!

Cut the base of the coffin.,
Cut the lid of the coffin (optional).,
Assemble the coffin.,
Finish the coffin.,
Attach the lid of the coffin.",How to Make a Coffin," All of the materials are inexpensive and can be picked up at your local builders supply store.;
, Use shelf paper or some other large sheets of paper (the plain white back of gift wrap or newspaper end rolls can work if you're on a budget), and tape the pieces together so that you have one sheet that is large enough to hold the design for the ""footprint"" of the coffin. Note that this is not the template for the base, which will be slightly smaller, but rather it is the template for the coffin with the side panels secured to the outside edges of the base. This template allows you to obtain the correct measurements for the sides of the coffin and the correct angles at which to cut the sides. See figure 1 for the dimensions of the coffin. Use a t-square or carpenter's square, and first draw the two perpendicular lines in the middle. Then draw the top and bottom edges, and finally connect the endpoints of the lines to form the sides as shown.
, The sides of the coffin will be 1' high, so take one of the 4' X 8' plywood panels and cut it lengthwise into four 1' X 8' pieces (you'll need three of these to make the sides). Use a circular saw to cut the side panels according to the dimensions in figure 1. Make sure to cut the side edges of the panels at the correct angles so that they will fit together. For example, the panel at the ""head"" of the coffin should be 24"" (2') wide, and the edges should be cut at 53-degree angles.

, The side panels will be nailed to the outside edges of the base, so the base is slightly smaller (3/4"" smaller on each side, assuming you are using 3/4"" thick plywood) than the overall footprint you drew before. Tape sheets of shelf paper together as you did in step 2, and draw the base--once again drawing the two perpendicular lines first--according to the dimensions in figure 2.

, Clamp your paper template over the remaining 4' X 8' sheet of plywood, so that the vertex of the widest point of the coffin touches the edge. Use your circular saw to cut out the base of the coffin around the template.
, Use this step only if you want a top for the coffin. Place the base over what is left of the 4' X 8' sheet of plywood so that it fits entirely on top of the wood. Trace around the edges, and then remove the base. Cut out the top of the coffin following the lines you traced.

, Now it's time to put it all together.


Dry fit the sides of the coffin together and to the base. You just want to make sure that everything will fit together correctly before you start gluing the pieces.
Glue or screw the side panels to the base and to each other. The bottom edge of each side panel should be flush with the bottom of the base. Drive 1 5/8"" screws through the side panels and into the base, and use glue, screws, or biscuits to secure the side edges of the panels together.

, If there are any holes or dents in your plywood, fill them with wood plugs or filler. Then stain the wood or paint it as desired. You can be as creative as you like in your decorations. If you wish to line the inside of the coffin with drapery or other fabric, you needn't worry about staining the inside. Simply glue or staple the fabric to the inside.

, If you're using the coffin for burial purposes, you can just nail the lid on. Otherwise, attach a piano hinge to one of the long edges of the coffin, and attach the hinge to the lid.

,  Place it horizontally under the collar and twist two or three times to secure it.  Trim an inch off each end.  Create the hands by turning the ends back and twisting at the wrist.

,  Separate the two pipe cleaners beneath the skirt for legs.  Turn up the ends if the pipe cleaners an inch or so and twist around the ankle to form feet.


,  Decorate the legs by twining small flowers or leaves around the legs.  Secure these decorations with a dab of tacky glue or hot glue if needed.,  Simple works well, just eyes and a tiny mouth are all that is needed.,  Embellishments such as glitter or sequins are fun to add, but not necessarily everyone's taste,,  This will give you a way to hang the figure.

Decorate your lawn.,
Decorate your front porch.,
Decorate your front door and windows.",How to Decorate for Halloween1," If you have a lawn that you'd like to make Halloween-ready, there are many creepy things you can do to decorate the outside of your home. The lawn sets the tone for the rest of the home, so if it's spooky enough, it'll make people even curious to see what you have in store up-close. Here are some easy ways to decorate your lawn:Old crunchy fall leaves should cover the ground. If there haven't been many fallen leaves, you should avoid raking your lawn during the days leading up to Halloween to make the most of what you have.
Take an old pair of boots and have them emerging out of a big pile of leaves or dirt. This will make it look like there's a dead body on your lawn!
Stick tombstones out of the ground. Remember that Halloween is all about things being old, dingy, and falling-apart, so your lawn does not have to be perfectly arranged. Have a tombstone here, a tombstone there, and another tombstone that is completely crooked or falling over.
If you have trees, cover them with spider webs. Bonus points if you can stick some creepy-crawly critters in them, or if you can add a stuffed owl or raven to a low-hanging branch.
Don't underestimate the power of a scary scarecrow. You can get a special Halloween scarecrow, or take your ordinary corn-husk fall scarecrow and paint it with blood.
Throw some skulls around the ground. Kudos if one of your guests accidentally stumbles on one of them.
Have a skeleton popping out of your yard.
If you really want to do it up for Halloween, have your car parked out on the lawn. Paint the windows to make it look like they're cracked, and make it look like a person is trapped inside by putting in a dummy with its hands pushed against the windows.;
, Your front porch will be the portal to all of the creepy things inside your home, so it should be as scary as possible to lure your unsuspecting guests (or victims) inside your house of horrors. Here are some great ways to add some Halloween spice to your front porch:


Add some more spiderwebs to your porch. Your guests could get caught in them without knowing it.
The silhouette of a black cat or two will raise the creep factor.
A few stuffed rats on the floor will help set the scene.
A bucket of dead white flowers will look perfect on your porch.
Scatter some tree branches on the ground.
A few pumpkins will add a nice touch to your porch. They can be carved with ghoulish designs, or painted black, silver, or with glitter.
Hang a ghost from your porch. Just cut some holes in an old sheet and throw it over an old beach ball that you hang from the ceiling.
If you have an old rocking chair, cover it with spider webs and put it in a place where it will rock and creak as much as possible.

, The door and window are the eyes and mouth of your home's Halloween soul, so you should make the most of them. Adding just a few ghoulish touches to your front door and windows will make your house look haunted. Here are a few things to try:


Have a spooky doormat. It can have a picture of a spiderweb or a ghost on it.
Hang a wreath covered in bats on the front door.
Splatter some fake blood on your front door. Just make sure it can easily come off.
If you're really going all out, make it look like you've boarded up your windows by sticking some light wood beams over the glass and sticking them to the glass with duct tape. This will make your house look abandoned, and therefore spooky.
Take an old mannequin and cover it in a formal black or red dress. Stick it in a window that everyone will see, preferably a second-floor or attic window if you have one. Shine a flashlight under the mannequin to create a ghostly effect.

, Cut around the stem of the pumpkin using the kitchen knife. Once open, scoop out both the seeds and the pulp.

, Using a marker, make a thin and long rectangular shape across the central front portion of the pumpkin.


However this is drawn, it must be the right shape, length and width to accommodate the flashing LED lights, so you might like to hold them up to make measurements as you're detailing the shape.

,, Place the pumpkin on a surface covered widely with newspaper (to protect the surface from being sprayed with paint). Using the silver or gray spray paint, spray the whole pumpkin to cover. Leave to dry.


Once dried, outline the Cylon helmet design above the eye hole region.






Using black paint, fill in the helmet outline.






Painting the whole pumpkin is optional. If you choose to leave the pumpkin unsprayed, instead of using black paint, simply mark out the helmet outline and file down the helmet area using a microplane. This will create a relief design. See the alternative method below for more details.

, If you need to see the schematics of the ""Larson Scanner"" kit, it's available online for free.

, Seal the bag so that moisture cannot penetrate through to the battery and scanner.

Make your furniture look halloween-ready.,
Light up your home.,
Play up the pumpkins.,
Add a few specimen jars to your home.,
Have spooky walls.,
Cover your home with creepy surprises.",How to Decorate for Halloween2," There are a few small but effective tricks to making your home look abandoned, creepy, and ready for Halloween. Here are a few things to try:


Cover your couches and chairs with white sheets. Pick the oldest sheets you have to make it look like your home hasn't been used for years. Brownie points if the sheets have some natural-looking holes in them.
Cover your tables with tattered black tablecloths. Take an old black sheet and cut ragged edges all over it.
Drape your bookshelves in spiderwebs. If you have spooky books that are particularly perfect for Halloween, such as the works of Edgar Allen Poe, display them prominently on the shelf or even place them on a side table.
Strategically place a few fake skulls to spice up drab pieces of furniture.

, Your lights will help set the eerie ambiance for your home, so you should make the most of the lights you have while keeping the house looking fairly dim, so that something spooky could pop up at any time. If it's too bright in your home, you won't have enough room for mystery. Here are some ways to have the perfect Halloween lights:


Tape plastic bats to the inside of the shade of an ordinary lamp. When you light the lamp, the bats will stick out. Just make sure you don't put them too close to the light bulb.
Light some white candles with ""blood"" dripping down them. Simply put some white candles over a towel or paper towel, and light a red candle over them until you've dripped enough wax over it to make it look like fake blood is oozing down the sides.
Light a few orange paper lanterns and drape them all over the house.
Carve a spooky face, a silhouette, or another spooky design on a pumpkin and light the inside.
Keep a few small white candles lit throughout the house. Scatter some fake black bugs around them for effect.
If all of your lamps are really bright, replace the bulbs with dimmer ones to maximize the scary lighting.

, Halloween would not be the same without pumpkins, so you should use your pumpkin decorations to your advantage. You don't have to overdo it with the pumpkins, but thinking of clever ways to introduce more pumpkins into your decor will make your home boo-tiful.Hang some pumpkin balloons. Just take a few orange balloons and paint a scary face on them in a black sharpie. Scatter them on the floor or hang them from the ceiling.
Take some pumpkins and paint them black, silver, or cover them in glitter. Arrange them in the corners of your home.
Open up a pumpkin and use it to hold potpourri.
Use pumpkin dishes to hold your Halloween treats.
If you've made a special pumpkin punch, serve it from a pumpkin bowl.

, Take some big glass jars, fill them with water, and throw in a drops of green dye until water is a nice, gross green hue. Put the jars on display in your kitchen under some lights or in another part of your home where they can be prominently displayed. Here's what you can place in the jars:Any old unidentifiable items, like an old doll's arm, a child's toy from ten years ago, or any random nick knacks that have been floating around your house for years.
Put in some dead flowers, poppy pods, or pine cones.
Throw in a small skull or some fake eyeballs that will float to the top.

, Your walls can do a lot to make your home look even more spooky. Just adding a few things to the paintings and walls you already have will make your haunted home come alive. Here are a few things you can do:


Cover up some of your paintings with white cloth. This will help further your ""abandoned home"" look.
Draw creepy eyes on your mirrors, so people will get scared when you look into them.
Cover your paintings with fake blood. Just make sure you put it over paintings that are framed behind glass and that it washes off.
Hang spiderwebs all over your walls. You can pull apart big chunks of cotton, use old cheesecloth, or get some spiderwebs at the store.

, Make the ordinary extraordinary by adding a few additional touches to complete your home's Halloween look. Here are a few things you can try:


Place an old birdcage on the floor. Make sure the door is hanging open. Scatter some fake rats on the bottom.
Take a bunch of tree branches from outside, and stick them in flower pots.
Set up a bouquet of nice white roses, and then cover them with little fake black ants, spiders, and caterpillars.Make a bat garland out of black construction paper and drape it all over your home.

Done!",How to Make a Star of David from Popsicle Sticks," Using the construction paper, colored pencils and one popsicle stick, make a drawing of the Star of David. Start by drawing an inverted triangle with the tip of the triangle pointing to the bottom of the construction paper. Use the popsicle stick to measure the length of each of the sides of the triangle. Next, draw a normal or upside right triangle. The upside right triangle should be drawn inside the upside down triangle, with its’ peak pointing straight up to the top of the construction paper. You should have a star with six points.If you are teaching your children how to make a Star of David, you can draw the inverted triangle and then ask them to copy you on their own sheets of construction paper.
If you want to make the exercise more educative, you could also tell the kids about the Star of David. The Star of David is a significant symbol in Jewish culture and can be seen on the flag of the State of Israel.;
, Using your sketch of the Star of David as a guide, lay the popsicle sticks on top of the inverted triangle on the construction paper. Next, glue the ends of the popsicle sticks together to make the first triangle. Start with one corner of the triangle and work your way around until all three corners are glued together:, Put a dab of glue on the end of the popsicle stick that forms the right side of the triangle, which is the end pointing to the top of the paper. Then, place the popsicle stick that runs parallel to the top of your paper on top. Hold the sticks together firmly for a couple seconds to let partially dry.

, Put a dab of glue on the end of the far left end of the popsicle stick that forms the base of your triangle, which runs parallel to the top of your paper. Then, place a dab of glue on the end of the popsicle stick pointing towards the bottom of your page.


Place the third popsicle stick on top so that it connects with the glue you have placed on the other two popsicle sticks.

, Using your sketch of the Star of David as a guide, lay the popsicle sticks on top of the upwards facing triangle on the construction paper. Glue the ends of the popsicle sticks together to shape your second triangle. Work your away around the triangle until all three points or vertices are glued together:Using two popsicle sticks, glue the base of your triangle to the right side of your triangle. Put a dab of glue on the bottom right corner of the popsicle stick that will be the right side of your triangle. Then, put the other popsicle stick on top so that the ends attach to make a point.
Put a dab of blue at the end of each of the two popsicle sticks that are not attached to anything.
Connect the third popsicle stick to the open ends of the other two sticks.

, If you are using a glue gun, this should only take a minute or two. If you are using white craft glue, it takes an hour to completely set. However, you should be fine to continue after waiting twenty minutes. You might want to take it off the construction paper while it is setting, so that it doesn’t get stuck to the paper., Using your sketch of the Star of David as a guide, attach the two triangles together. Place the upside right triangle on top of the upside down triangle. The tips of the triangles should be pointing in opposite directions. Use your colored pencil to make a mark on the bottom popsicle sticks to indicate where the two triangles meet. Using these pencil marks as a guide, put a dab of glue on the bottom triangle. Then, place the top, upward facing triangle on top. Press the two triangles together firmly.

, Leave the Star of David for a period (e.g., 1 hour) to let the glue set prior to painting and decorating. You might want to take it off the construction paper to make sure it isn’t stuck to the paper. You will have a sturdy Star of David to decorate with your guests or children.


If you are showing your children how to make the Star of David, you could get them doing another activity for an hour while you wait.
If you are preparing the Star of David for your children to decorate, you can have them start decorating one hour after making the Star of David.

, Using a paintbrush and your paint, paint the Star of David. Brush the paint on one popsicle stick at a time and work your way around the triangle until all three popsicles sticks are entirely blue. Blue is a traditional color to paint the Star of David.If you are painting with children, you should use child-grade paint.If you will not be decorating the Star of David, you may want to apply two coats of blue paint.
If you wrapped your popsicle sticks in yarn, you should avoid applying paint to them. Instead, use glue and glitter.

, Another traditional combination for the Star of David is blue and white. Try painting one triangle in blue and the other triangle in white. Start with the white triangle for the upside down triangle and then paint the upside right triangle in blue.


If you prefer, you could also paint the tips of the Star of David in white and the rest of it in blue.
Blue and white are the colors of the flag of Israel., You may find this is the best option if you are working with children. They will be able to choose their own colors schemes.


You can find sets of child-grade paint.

, If you prefer a softer feel for your Star of David, you may want to wrap the popsicle sticks in white knitting yarn. To wrap the popsicle sticks in yarn, start by applying a thin coat of white glue to one of the popsicle sticks. Then, wrap the popsicle stick in a single layer of white yarn. Beginning at one end, wind the yarn around the popsicle stick in a single layer and work your way to the opposite end of the stick. The glue will hold the yarn to the stick., In a small plastic container, mix half part water with half part white glue. If you are just making one Star of David, you should only need a teaspoon of glue and a teaspoon of water. Using your finger or a stick, mix the glue into the water., Use a paintbrush to apply a small amount of the glue and water mixture to the surface of the Star of David. Paint all sides of the triangle., Using your favorite colors, sprinkle a small amount of glitter on the Star of David. You may decide to just use blue or you may decide to use a combination of colors.If you wrapped your Star of David in white yarn, you could try sprinkling blue glitter overtop so that it doesn’t cover the whole star. It will end up being blue and white with a soft feel.
You could try covering it with gold glitter., If you would like to hang the Star of David on a wall or elsewhere, you could attach a ribbon. Cut a short, three to six inch piece of ribbon. Start by gluing the two ends of the ribbon together to form a circle. Then, on the top point of the Star of David, put a dab of glue. Attach the ribbon to the Star of David.

, You can now enjoy your Star of David.

For example, you may opt for three dimensional dreidels and print out a template from an online source that you can cut out, fold, and use for the garland., You will use the ribbon or string to hang the dreidels to make the garland. Use colored ribbon or string for added decoration. If you have a spot in mind for the garland, you may measure out the ribbon or string so it will fit that spot.For example, you may measure out enough string to stretch over your mantle piece at home. Or you may measure out enough ribbon to stretch over a doorway.

, The scissors will be useful for cutting out the dreidel template and the dreidel pieces. You will use the glue to attach the dreidels to the string. You can use a glue stick or wet glue. The clothespins will be used to keep the dreidels in place on the ribbon or string while they dry.You will need enough clothespins for the number of dreidels you plan to make. For example, if you plan to make four dreidels for the garland, you will need four clothespins.

, Start by creating a template in the shape of the dreidel. You can draw the template on the piece of cardboard or sheet of stiff paper. Draw the thin top of the dreidel and then the wide body of the dreidel. Make the dreidel fairly large so it can hang from the ribbon or string.If you are using an existing template for the dreidels, you do not need to do this step., Once you have the template, place it the craft paper. Use a pencil to lightly trace the template onto the craft paper. Space the dreidels a few inches apart on the craft paper so they are easy to cut out. Trace out double the number of dreidels you want, as you will be attaching the two pieces together to form one dreidel.Make as many dreidels as you’d like for the garland based on the length of the string and the size of the dreidels. For example, if the dreidels are fairly big and you have a four to five foot long string, you may trace out eight to ten dreidels (four to five dreidels times two) for the garland. If the dreidels are small and the string is long, you may trace out twelve to sixteen dreidels (six to eight dreidels times two).

, Use the scissors to carefully cut out the dreidels drawn on the craft paper. If there are pencil marks on the cut out dreidels, use an eraser to remove them so the dreidels appear clean and polished. You should have double the number of dreidels you want, as you will then attach the two pieces together to make one dreidel.For example, if you want to have four dreidels on the garland, you should have eight dreidels total. Or if you want six dreidels for the garland, you should have twelve dreidels total.
If you are making the garland with a child, you can let them use child-proof scissors to cut out the dreidels.

, Lay the string or ribbon out on a flat surface. Then, place one set of dreidel pieces under the ribbon or string. Arrange the dreidels so they are evenly spaced a few inches apart. The handles of the dreidels should be under the string. Then, place the other set of dreidel pieces over the ribbon or string so the handles are aligned. Glue the two pieces together by placing a dot of glue on the handles of the dreidels and pressing them together on the string with your fingers.Use the clothespins to hold the two pieces of paper together on the string so they can dry. You can hang the garland in the intended spot to dry. Remove the clothespins once the glue dries and enjoy your dreidel garland.

, If you want to jazz up the paper dreidel garland, you may decide to add personal details to the dreidels, such as the names of your family members or personal family sayings. You may write, paint, or stencil on these details on the dreidels before hanging up the garland.If you are making the garland with a child, you may encourage them to decorate the dreidels to make them more personal and unique.
Use colored pencils, paints, and glitter to personalize the garland. You can even draw the faces of your family members on the dreidels to really make them personal to your family.

, Traditionally, dreidels will have a letter from the Hebrew alphabet on each side that read “Nun,” “Gimel,” “He,” and “Shin.” The letters are an acronym for the Hebrew saying, “Nes Gadol Hayah Sham”, which translates to “A great miracle happened there.” You may decide to add these traditional Hebrew words to your dreidel garland.You can also spell out “Hanukkah” in Hebrew or another Hebrew word or saying on the dreidels if you’d prefer.

, You can also make the garland more festive by adding images that relate to Hanukkah and the Jewish faith. You may draw menorahs on the dreidels or the Star of David. Or you may spell out “Hanukkah” on the dreidels or another Hanukkah themed saying. Get creative and make use of the space on the dreidels to really make the garland festive.


If you are making the dreidel garland with a child, you may encourage them to add Hanukkah themed decorations to the dreidels. You may need to help them draw a Star of David or a menorah and then suggest that they color in the images as they see fit.

Cheap rubber masks can be found at dollar stores during Halloween season. Choose your masks also to fit the mood of your gateway. Do you want to go for horrifying, humorous or a mixture of the two? Cut or rip off any backing to the mask. Most of the cheap masks have a fabric hood to hold them on a wearer's head. This is not needed for your gateway. Use a staple gun to attach the masks at various places on your gateway. Vary the angles and positions for chaotic effect.
Another option is to use fake skulls to decorate the gateway. Soft plastic skulls (including ones that glow) can be found relatively cheap at certain stores during the Halloween season (especially during post-Halloween sales!). Use a utility knife to remove the portion of the skull you wish to have ""sunken"" inside the gore. Cut it so that you create a few tabs to work with while attaching the skull to the wood frame. Use the staple gun on the tabs to attach them to the gateway frame.
Yet another option is to use fake body parts; rubber hands, limbs, hearts, brains, bones, eyes, etc. Let your imagination go wild. This a point where you can really add some personality to your design. Attach them to your frame with a staple gun or nails (whatever gets the job done). Pose them for a variety of effects.

, This can be found at your local hardware store and is typically used to fill gaps and cracks in the weatherization of homes. A common brand is Great Stuff foam insulation. While taking care not to get any spray foam on yourself, hold the tip of the spray nozzle to the wood and begin spraying. The foam expands for a time after leaving the can, so use it sparingly in sections until you get an idea as to how much to put down for the effect you wish to achieve. Move the spray can around in chaotic loops and whorls to create a disgustingly tendril/intestine appearance. Take care not to completely cover the objects you have already attached to the frame. Bring the foam up to their edges and slightly on to them. Occasionally get more foam on some masks/props to make them further buried in the gore. Spray so that the foam covers all of the wood and hides all edges. Once you start using a can of insulation, make sure to use it up. If you set the can down for too long the foam will dry in the nozzle. This plugs the nozzle and possibly the can, possibly making it useless.

, It can also lead to the effect of having gore and blood oozing from the nostrils, mouths and eyes of the faces. You may wish to give some or all of the masks eyes. This can be accomplished with fake eyes purchased from a costume shop or by using ping pong balls. Use your gloved hands to pop the eyes into the eye holes of the mask and the still gooey insulation inside.

, Check on the gateway and see if it needs any more insulation to cover any missed spots and that the effect you wish has been achieved. If you do touch it up, give it a few more hours to dry. Otherwise proceed to the next step.

, Latex paint will not stick to the foam and will peel off. Do not use spray paint directly on the foam, as it may eat away at the foam. Choose a color that best fits your design idea. Blood red is the obvious choice, but a bile green could achieve an interesting (and less gore) effect.

, It is going to take days for the oil paint to dry. Keep checking back on it after the first couple of days. Using a solvent to cause the paint to dry is ill-advised, as it may cause a reaction with the spray foam.

, Spraying a pit of dark purple on some parts of a gory design can make it appear more like guts and viscera. Using a slightly lighter shade of red on the parts of your design that jut out the furthest can add further depth to it (though at night this effect will be less noticeable). Once again, use your imagination to achieve the effect that you have pictured in your head. Another option is to use an airbrush if you have access to one.

, Once dry, your ""Gateway of Gore"" is ready. Use wood screws to attach the pieces around the entrance-way you intend to decorate. Using an extension on the drill will allow you to sink the screws through the gaps between whorls of insulation. If you don't want to drill holes into your entrance-way, you'll have to figure out some other means of attaching the gateway decoration to the entrance-way.

Explain the big difference—the real difference.,
Compare the candles.,
Discuss the presents.,
Talk about the food.,
Respond to the argument about ""time off."",
Sum it up.",How to Explain That Hanukkah is Not the Jewish Christmas," While the two holidays occur at roughly the same time, the reasons for the celebrations are not at all the same.


Hanukkah is a celebration of a different kind of miracle. Upon Judah Maccabee's defeat of the Syrians, the Second Temple in Judea was rebuilt. During the dedication, a menorah was to be lit, its candles burning every night. Though there was only oil enough to keep the candles lit for a single night, they burned for eight. Those eight nights are celebrated each year during Hanukkah.
Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus, the son of God. For them, it's a miracle of the most profound sort, and is the most important Christian holiday other than Easter.;
, This may be the closest the two holidays come to being similar. Each tradition was born of persecution, though like the holidays themselves, the differences are profound.


Though the long persecution by the Greek and final defeat of the Syrians lead to the cleansing of the temple—and the subsequent miracle—the menorah is a symbol of victory over a cruel, but vanquished enemy. Like Christmas candles, the menorah is often displayed prominently in a window as a reminder to the faithful.
The placing of candles in the windows, for Christians, came about as a result of the persecution of Irish Catholics by the Protestant English. Catholicism was forbidden during the Reformation, and the penalties were harsh—up to and including death. At Christmas time, Irish Catholic families—wanting a priest to visit their home and give them their sacraments (in return for a warm place to sleep)—would leave the doors unlocked, with candles in the windows as a signal., ""Ah ha!"", say the Christians. ""Do you not exchange presents, just like Christmas?"" they ask. Explain to them that it's a time of family celebration, and if gifts are given, they are generally small trifles. The rampant gift-giving mania that surrounds Christmas, and to a much lesser extent, Hanukkah, has more to do with the unbridled consumerism than anything religious.


During Hanukkah, children (and adults, too) play with the dreidel, in an effort to collect the most Hanukkah gelt.
Many Jewish people do not even exchange/receive/give presents.
On Christmas, children play with Barbie, or their new radio-controlled helicopter (attacking Barbie, no doubt), and shred open present after present. Adults play with their new What's its.

, The obvious difference is that on Christmas Day, Christians have a feast, usually involving eating too much turkey with too many relatives never seen the rest of the year. Jews take advantage of that, and go to the uncrowded movies, and eat Chinese food (as the Chinese don't generally celebrate Christmas, either, and their restaurants are open).


Much ""Hanukkah food"" alludes to the miracle itself: many of the traditional foods are things like latkes (potato pancakes), and sufganiyot (jelly donuts), which are fried in oil.
The Christian feast has its origins in pagan times. The holiday itself, while celebrating the birth of Jesus, doesn't celebrate his actual (quite unknown) birthday. Christians co-opted Saturnalia, which in turn is based on the winter solstice—the shortest day of the year, after which the sun is reborn. With that celebration came a feast: there's nothing better to do in the dead of winter than make a nice, hot meal!

, On Christmas Day, most business are closed down. Nobody goes to work, because there's no work to go to that day. For Jews, it's a nice day off. For Christians, it's origins were in being a day to celebrate the birth of Jesus.

, Put it simply, Hanukkah is a (relatively) minor Jewish holiday that celebrates the Miracle of Light. Christmas is the major Christian holiday. It combines the birth of the Holy Savior with the pagan festival of Saturnalia. Any similarity between Christmas and Hanukkah is purely coincidental.

Make sure that it is pressed far into marshmallow, but doesn’t fully pierce through it.Use short, thin pretzel sticks as opposed to large, thick ones.;
, Break off one square of white chocolate from the bar, then place the square in a microwaveable bowl and microwave it for 20 seconds or until melted., Unwrap a Hershey’s kiss, then dip the bottom in the white chocolate. Only use enough chocolate to coat the bottom of the kiss.The white chocolate will act as a kind of edible glue that will stick the Hershey’s kiss to the marshmallow.

, After you dip the bottom of the Hershey’s kiss in the chocolate, press the sticky side of the Hershey’s kiss into the bottom of a marshmallow, the flat side opposite from the side with the pretzel. Press the Hershey’s kiss against the marshmallow for around 15-20 seconds to help it stick in place.Repeat the process of dipping the Hershey’s kisses in the chocolate, then sticking them to the bottom of the marshmallows.

, After you have finished sticking the kisses to the marshmallows, place the dreidels on a plate or a baking sheet and put them in the freezer for 15 minutes. Freezing the dreidel pops will help them set so that the Hershey’s kisses stay stuck to the bottom of the marshmallows., While the dreidels are in the freezer, you can make the Hebrew letters that adorn the outside of the dreidels. To start making the letters, break the remaining bar of chocolate into squares, then place the squares in a bowl.Microwave the white chocolate in 20 second spurts, taking out the chocolate and stirring it in between each microwave session. Stop microwaving when the chocolate is melted, as over-microwaving can cause the chocolate to scald.

, Wait until the chocolate is around room temperature, then pour it into a plastic sandwich bag. You may have to scrape the bowl to get out all the chocolate. After all the chocolate is in the bag, snip off one of the bottom corners, making a small cut.Cut off only a tiny corner, so that the bag can function as a kind of frosting piper.
If you have a frosting piper, you can also simply pour the chocolate in the piper bag.

, Spread a piece of wax paper on a counter or tabletop. Hold the bag of melted chocolate in both of your hands, then slowly squeeze the bag until the white chocolate starts to come out of the snipped corner in a thin line.


Pipe out each of the four Hebrew letters that are found on a dreidel: Nun, Gimel, Hey, and Shin. Refer to other dreidels you may have at home or pictures of dreidels online if you are unsure of what these letters look like.Make 12 sets of the four Hebrew letters. You will eventually stick one set on each of the 12 marshmallow dreidel pops you are making.
Nun and Gimel are similar-looking letters, so make sure to add the heel of the Gimel, which differentiates it from the more rounded Nun.

, After you finish making all 12 sets of letters, put the wax sheet of letters in the freezer while you work on the dreidels. Freezing them will help the letters to harden., Open the package of candy melts and pour them into a microwaveable bowl. Then microwave them for 1 minute on 50% power. Take the candy melts out from the microwave and stir for about 10 seconds. Then microwave them for 30 seconds on 50% power and stir. Microwave them one more time for 30 seconds on 50% power. Stir the candy melts for 1-2 minutes until they are completely melted.You can also melt candy melts in a double broiler. Place an inch (2.54 cm) of water in the bottom of a double broiler, then place the candy melts in the top of the broiler. Place the double broiler on medium heat. Stir the candy melts continuously until they have completely melted.

, Candy melts often melt into an extremely thick mixture, so thick that if you dipped a spoon into it, the candy melt mixture would glob onto the spoon instead of drip off. If your mixture is extremely thick and hard to stir, add a tablespoon (14.7 ml) of vegetable shortening and stir until the shortening is integrated and the candy melt mixture is smooth.Ideally, if you dip a spoon in the candy melt mixture, you want the mixture to stick to the spoon and slowly drip off.
If your candy melt mixture is already the right consistency, you don’t need to add the vegetable shortening.

, Lay down a piece of wax paper on the counter next to the bowl of candy melt mixture. Take the dreidels out of the freezer and one by one, then dip each dreidel into the blue candy melt.Hold the dreidel by the pretzel handle and dunk it in so that the entire marshmallow and Hershey’s kiss base is submerged.
After you dunk the dreidel , take the dreidel out and hold it above the bowl, letting any excess candy melt drip off. Then lay the dreidel down on its side on the sheet of wax paper. Repeat until each dreidel is coated in the blue candy melt!
Reserve the excess candy melt.

, Set aside the dreidels for about 30 minutes to let the blue candy melt set on the outside of the dreidels. If you want to speed up the process, stick the dreidels in the freezer for about 15 minutes., While the candy melt sets on the dreidels, take the sheet of chocolate Hebrew letters out of the freezer. Carefully peel the letters from the wax paper with your fingers, or use a knife like a spatula to unstick the letters from the wax paper.


Take your time unsticking the letters, as they are quite delicate and can easily break.

, Once you have scraped up the Hebrew letters and the candy melt has set on the dreidels, use a toothpick to transfer some excess candy melt to the back of a Hebrew letter. Then stick the letter on one face of the marshmallow dreidel pop.Stick the next three letters on the remaining three sides of the dreidel, then carefully set the dreidel on one side and let the letters set.
Repeat until all the dreidels have Hebrew letters on each side.
Let the dreidels sit for about half an hour so that the letters can set. Then the dreidel pops should be ready to eat!

Because the Jewish and Roman calendars are different, Chanukah begins on a different day each year on the Roman calendar.In 2016, Chanukah begins in the evening of Saturday, December 24, and ends in the evening of Sunday, January 1.
In 2017, Chanukah begins in the evening of Tuesday, December 12, and ends in the evening of Wednesday, December 20.
In 2018, Chanukah begins in the evening of Monday, December 10, and ends in the evening of Tuesday, December 19.
In 2019, Chanukah begins in the evening of Sunday, December 22, and ends in the evening of Monday, December 30.;
, All Jewish holidays begin at sunset, so you should get your friends or family together with you to light the candles just after the sun sets.The exception is Friday night, when the menorah should be lit before sunset. This is because Friday night is the start of Shabbat, or the day of rest, and lighting the menorah constitutes as work (which should not be done after Shabbat begins).
Including friends and family in the candle lighting ritual a very important aspect of Chanukah. A large part of Judaism is sharing the miracle of Chanukah and passing the tradition onto your children. For this reason, try to include others in the candle lighting!, On your chanukiah, you should see 9 slots for candles, with eight slots on one level and one slot elevated above the rest. This is the spot for the shamash, or the candle used to light all the other candles. Place one candle in this elevated spot.


Every night of Chanukah, you place and light the shamash first before the other candles.
The word “shamash” means “attendant” in Hebrew, and its elevation away from the other candles is meant to separate it from the candles that represent each day of Chanukah. Its position also alludes to its important role of lighting the other candles.It doesn’t matter what color candles you use. Some choose traditional blue and white candles, while others prefer differently colored candles!
An electric chanukiah is a great decoration, but it can’t be used to properly fulfill the ceremony of Chanukah. You need to use a candle or oil chanukiah to fulfill the mitzvah (the commandment or good deed) of lighting the chanukiah.The candelabra Jewish people use for Chanukah is actually a ""chanukiah,"" which has nine branches, not a menorah, which has seven. People incorrectly call the chanukiah a menorah, but they have become accepted as the same thing. If you wish to be technically accurate, call the candelabra a chanukiah.

, Every night of Chanukah, you add one more candle. On the first night of Chanukah, place a candle in the right-most slot. After the first night of Chanukah, add one candle for each night, starting from the right-most slot and going left.For instance, on the second night of Chanukah, place the shamash candle in its slot and the candle representing the first night of Chanukah in the right-most slot. Place the candle representing the second night of Chanukah in the slot next to the previous candle (the second to the right-most slot).
On the third night, place the candles as you did on the second night, adding a fourth candle in the slot third to the right.

, Once the sun has set (unless it’s Friday), light the shamash candle using a match, lighter, or other flame source. It’s very important to light the shamash first. The shamash is what you will be using to light the other candles, so you should never light the other candles before it.On Friday night, start the candle lighting before sunset. Use long-lasting candles so that the candles burn for at least thirty minutes after the sun sets.

, Whenever candles are lit in a Jewish ceremony, a blessing is always said over the candle lighting. This is the first blessing that you will say on each night of Chanukah.Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech Ha'olam, asher kidshanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu l’hadlik ner shel Hanukkah.
Blessed are You, O Lord Our God, Ruler of the Universe, Who has sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded us to kindle the lights of Chanukah.


You can sing the blessing with the traditional tune, or simply recite it. You can also say it in English if you can’t pronounce the Hebrew, though you should use the Hebrew if you can.
It’s traditional to say “amen” after each blessing has been recited.

, The second blessing thanks God for the miracle that God performed for the Jewish ancestors, and is recited every night of Chanukah after the candle lighting blessing.Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech Ha'olam, she’asah nisim l’avoteinu, b’yamim haheim bazman hazeh.
Blessed are You, O Lord our God, Ruler of the Universe, Who made miracles for our forefathers in those days at this time.

, If it is the first night of Chanukah, recite the Shehecheyanu after the other two blessings. The Shehecheyanu is a special blessing that is traditionally said every time you do something for the first time, or do a specific ritual for the first time in this year. Because you will be lighting the Chanukah candles for the first time this year, say this blessing on the first night, but not on the following nights of Chanukah.



Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech Ha'olam, shehekheyanu, v’kiyamanu vehegianu lazman hazeh.
Blessed are You, O Lord Our God, Ruler of the Universe, Who has kept us alive, sustained us and brought us to this season.

, After you finish reciting the blessings, pick the shamash candle up with your dominant hand. Use the shamash to light the candle/s, going from left to right. In other words, light the newest candle first, then light the preceding candles.


Always use the shamash to light the candles. Never use an already lit candle to light the others.
Although you placed the candles from right to left, you always light the candles from left to right in order to acknowledge the new candle representing the new night of Chanukah before the others.

, After you finish lighting the candles, place the shamash candle back in its slot. You have just finished lighting your chanukiah!

, Another important part of Chanukah is placing your chanukiah in the window after you light it. Placing the chanukiah in the window is a way of proudly showing your Jewish heritage and traditions.


A key part of the Chanukah story is the defeat of the Hellenistic forces by the ancient Jewish Maccabees. The Greeks had taken over the ancient Jewish temple and were trying to smother the Jewish religion. This is why displaying the chanukiah and expressing your Judaism is an integral part of the holiday.Custom says to place the chanukiah in a window to the left of the door, if possible. The chanukiah belongs on the left side of a doorway, opposite the mezuzah on the right side, so that the family can be surrounded by mitzvot (commandments) as they celebrate Chanukah., Instead of blowing out or extinguishing the candles, let them run their course. Make sure that they burn for at least a half an hour after sunset. If you have to leave the house, time it so that they burn for at least 30 minutes after you have lit them.If it is Shabbat, use long-lasting candles and make sure that they burn for at least a half an hour after the sun sets.
If you have to leave the house, let the candles burn for at least 30 minutes after sunset, then extinguish them for safety purposes.

Get a dreidel.,
Gather friends.,
Ante up.,
Take turns spinning the dreidel.,
Pass the dreidel on to the next player.

,
Keep playing until someone wins by collecting all the tokens.

",How to Play Dreidel," The dreidel you will get will depend on where you live. Outside of Israel, the four letters on the sides of the dreidel are Nun, Gimmel, Hay, and Shin, which stand for ""A Great Miracle Happened There,"" referring to the miracle of the oil. In Israel, where the miracle happened, the dreidel has the letters Nun, Gimmel, Hay, and Pey, which means ""A Great Miracle Happened Here."";
, You can play with as few as two, but the more the merrier!


Distribute tokens evenly among all of the players. The tokens can be any little thing: pennies, nuts, raisins, matchsticks, etc. A lot of people use gelt.

, Before each spin, players put one token in the middle of the circle to create ""the pot.""


Every time the pot is emptied, or there's only one token left, every player should put a token in the pot.

, When it's your turn, spin the dreidel once. The letter which comes up once it stops spinning determines whether you win, lose, or draw. According to the letter appearing, the player should perform the following action:



Shin (""shtel"" or ""put in"" in Yiddish) - Put one more token in the pot.







Nun (""nisht""or ""nothing"" (in Yiddish) - Do nothing.







Gimmel (""gantz""or ""everything"" in Yiddish) - Take all tokens from the pot.







Hay (""halb""or ""half"" in Yiddish) - Take half of all tokens lying in the pot. In case of an odd number of tokens, round up.






If you run out of tokens, you are either ""out,"" or you may ask another player for a loan.

Know the basics.,
Fill small terracotta pots with sand.,
Use a line of bottles.,
Add the lights.",How to Make a Menorah1," A menorah does not have to be ornate, or even in the traditional candelabra shape. You don't even need to glue the nine light holders into one object. All you need to know are these basic rules:


The eight main lights should be in a straight line, all at the same height or along a steady diagonal line.
The ninth helper light (shamash) should be easily identified. It's usually placed in the center or end of the row, but higher or lower than the rest. If it's the same height as the others, offset it so it's not in the same row.
Ideally, set up the menorah near a window so passersby can see it.;
, Nine small plant pots make a simple but beautiful display, even if you're craft-challenged. Make sure the pots are wide enough to catch any drips from the candles.


Bury small candle holders just underneath the sand for stability, so the openings are at the surface.







, Pick eight narrow-neck bottles of the same height, plus a ninth at a different height. Tear off the labels and wash off the label residue with soap and water. You can now fit candles into the necks, or fill the bottles partway with water, float olive oil on the top, and hang a cotton wick from the neck to the olive oil.


If you use candles, place a non-flammable plate underneath to catch the drips.

, The light should last at least 30 minutes before it burns down. You'll need 44 lights to last the eight days of Hanukkah, but keep a few extra around just in case. The most common option is Hanukkah candles, which should last well over 30 minutes.


To represent the original miracle more closely, you may use glass cups of flammable oil instead, ideally olive oil. See the Tips section below for instructions on making your own wick.
On the last day, the candles are lit before sundown. Many people use larger candles to make sure they keep burning until the Shabbat.

",How to Create a Marshmallow Menorah," If you wish to make an edible menorah, use frosting instead of the glue. If this is just a decoration project, use glue instead of the frosting.;
, Line up nine of the marshmallows next to each other in a row. Place the tenth marshmallow on top of the stack, in the middle.

, Pick a marshmallow and put a dab of either glue or frosting on the side of it. Place and glue it against another marshmallow. Dab some on the bottom of the tenth marshmallow. It's up to the creator of the menorah if the presentation gets glued on the cardboard or not.

, In a bowl, pour a little amount of milk and a few drops of food coloring. Mix them together to get your ""paint"". Have a variety of dyed milk colors for kids to choose.

, Gloss each marshmallow and try to avoid poking at them or leaving ""skid"" marks.

, Slowly and gently, push either pretzel sticks or birthday candles in the middle of each marshmallow.

Purchase a convincing werewolf mask.,

Go for a walk with friends during a full moon.,

Slip to the back of the group and “disappear”.,

Follow your friends silently.,

Wait until they notice you're “missing"".,
Get loud.,

Reveal yourself.,

The next time you see your friends, behave strangely.,

Tell one of your friends what you’ve been up to, and ask them to play along.,

Reveal yourself as a werewolf.,

Be sure to build tension before you jump out and scare your friends.",How to Scare Your Friends1," These are available at costume shops all year round and at most stores near Halloween. If you can find one with glowing eyes, all the better!
, Make sure you’re somewhere that has good places to hide — ideally a cemetery, the woods, or a road lined with trees and bushes.

Don’t be obvious about the full moon to your friends, but do make sure they notice it — while you’re walking you can just say “Wow, the moon is so huge tonight!” or something like that.

, You can “disappear” by hiding behind a bush or a tree, for example. Do this after you’ve been walking for a while — at least 10 or 15 minutes — otherwise your goal (the prank) might become obvious.

Note that it’ll have to be a larger group in order for you to disappear easily. Aim for at least 3 other people: the more the better.
If you can’t find a good time to slip away, tell your friends you need to pee and that they can keep walking — you’ll catch up.

, You can do this from behind, beside, or even in front of your friends — just make sure that they don’t see or hear you.

Resist the urge to laugh here. If you think you might laugh, make sure you’re far enough away from them that they won’t hear you, and try to stifle the sound by burying your face in your jacket and hands.

, You’ll know they’ve noticed you’re missing when they begin to look around and/or wonder out loud where you are. If they call out to you, don’t answer., Once your friends notice you’re missing, you can make noise; just don’t let them know it’s you making the noise! You might start by making a low howling noise from where you’re hiding — low enough that they’re not totally sure they’ve heard it.

If you don’t think you can make a good howling noise, maybe play one on your smart phone or some other recording device.
After making the howling noise, remain hidden while you run past them. If you’re on a tree-lined street or in the woods, run quick and loudly, being sure that they hear your footsteps. If it’s very dark, you may need to move more slowly to avoid tripping and falling.
If you can’t get close to them without them seeing you, throw large rocks towards (not at) them instead. You can also snap branches in your hands. These thudding and snapping sounds should startle your friends, too.

, When your friends seem a bit more frightened (after a minute or two of you making sounds), scream loudly and run out from where you’re hiding as you look behind you.

When they ask what’s wrong, tell them that you think you saw something in the woods — that it looked kind of like a large wolf. Say that you felt it brush past you.
To heighten your story, you might even rub a small amount of fake blood on your wrist. If you do this, don’t mention it. Just rub your wrist lightly as if it’s in pain, and if your friends ask about it, say you think you must have scratched it on something while you were running away.

, Make sure your friends notice you eating more than normal (especially meat) and doing dog-like things.

Dog-like things might include sniffing at food before you eat it or scratching at the couch to make it more comfortable before you sit down on it.
You’ll also get your friends wondering what’s wrong if you act weird whenever they mention that night where you supposedly saw the wolf. If they mention the night, look serious and scared for a minute, and then change the subject.

, This friend could tell the others that you’ve been acting strangely, and that he/she’s beginning to wonder if werewolves are real and if you were bitten by one.

He can say he even thought he saw you chasing someone’s cat the other day, for example.

, You can do this in a number of ways. One way would be to go for another walk with your friends the next full moon, and then disappear and reappear as a werewolf (wearing the werewolf mask).

Another thing you could do is get your friend who’s in on the prank to tell your friends he saw you go into a certain space — an abandoned house or a creepy schoolyard, or the woods, for example. Your friend can bring your other friends there, and you can hide then jump out at them wearing a werewolf mask.

, Just as you did at the start of the prank, get your friends nervous by making noises around them, and making low howling sounds.

You can even make the howling sounds get louder right before you jump out and scare them.
Don’t forget to make sure you reveal yourself as a werewolf on the next full moon — your friends might still get scared if it’s not a full moon, but a full moon will be the most effective time to reveal yourself as a werewolf.

Gather your supplies.,
Glue eight nuts onto the wood in one row.,
Glue the nut for the helper candle.,
Decorate.",How to Make a Menorah2," Parents and synagogues often teach young kids to make their own menorah this way. All you need is nine or ten metal hex nuts, nine candles that fit inside the nuts, a long slab of wood, and strong glue. You can find all of these at a hardware store.


Pick up any decorations you'd like to use as well. See below for some suggestions.
If you can't find nuts that will hold up your candles, you can glue tea candles directly onto the wood instead.

, Place all eight nuts first to make sure they are evenly spaced, in a straight row, and that there's room left for the ninth nut. Glue each nut onto the wood and wait for it to dry.


Weighing down the nuts with heavy objects will help the glue bond.

, The ninth nut will hold the shamash, or helper candle. This candle is the one that will light all the rest, so it has to stand out from the rest. If you have ten nuts, you can stack two on top of each other so the shamash is higher. Otherwise, just glue the ninth nut anywhere that's not in the same line as the other eight.

, Make the menorah your own with mini decorative tiles, paint, glitter glue, or your favorite kind of decoration.

Set up your workstation.,
Cut a block of the clay into eight evenly sized cubes using a craft knife.,
Make a taller ninth cube.,
Wrap foil around a candle.,
Form the holes for the candles.,
Press together four of the clay cubes.,
Repeat with the other four cubes.,
Make the Chanukiah menorah structure.,
Make the structure stable by adding a base and support beams as you see fit.,
Check again that the unit is stable and that all bases are flat.,
Transfer the unit to a flat baking tray.,
Decorate (optional).,


",How to Make a Menorah3," Buy polymer clay such as Fimo or Premo at any craft store. Lay down a piece of wax paper on your work surface — you don't want raw clay touching surfaces you may later use for food.


Wear gloves. Some clay colors can slightly stain your hands. Alternatively, coat your hands lightly with hand cream to make cleaning up easier.

, A craft knife will make good straight, thin cuts for the cubes and is recommended over a regular knife. Make sure that all eight structures have a flat, stable base.

, Elongate another piece of clay into a rectangle that is slightly thinner and taller than the eight cubes. This will hold the shamash, or helper candle used to light the eight main lights.

, Wrap a small amount of aluminum foil around the base of a small, thin Hanukkah candle. This covering will prevent the candle from sticking to the clay as you make candle holes.

, Push this wrapped candle into the top center of each of the nine clay cubes to create the hole to hold the candle. Make this hole of equal width, and deep enough to securely hold the candle.


Remove the candle but leave the foil intact, as you'll need it again later.

, Line up four of the cubes in a row. Keep them flat on the work surface. Firmly press four of them together one by one to create a solid unit. You should now have one straight row of cubes of equal height, displaying four equally-spaced holes on top.


Smooth the edges, making sure that this structure is firmly stuck together.
Check that the bottom of the four-holed structure is still flat and stable.

, You will now have two units of clay, each with four holes.

, Check that the base of each rectangle is flat and stable, then connect all nine:


Place one four-candle holder on the left side of the tall rectangle.
Place the other four-candle holder on the right of the tall rectangle.
Press the rectangle from both sides to join it to the other units. Press firmly to ensure joining and smooth the seams by rubbing the clay together with your fingers or a clay tool.
You should now have one long, solid unit of clay with nine holes in total: four holes of equal height situated on either side of the middle candle hole, which will sit slightly higher.

, A wide base, tall pillar, and two supporting arms should be enough.

, If needed, flatten each cube and rectangle slightly to make it stable, being careful not to close the candle holes. Make sure that the unit holds together as one long piece.

, Bake according to manufacturer's instructions, being careful to judge baking time by the thickness of the cubes. Cool according to manufacturer's instructions. Note: If you plan to decorate the menorah, please read the next step first prior to baking.

, If you choose to decorate, read the manufacturer's instructions for any tips related to the specific clay you're using, such as sticking pieces together or using paints. This determines whether painting should be done before or after baking. There are lots of techniques for decorating clay prior to baking with common tools, such as toothpicks and toothbrushes to create textures. A six-pointed star made from 2 overlapping triangles is a traditional symbol used on menorahs.


See How to light a Chanukah Menorah for instructions on use.
Prior to lighting the candles, place a small amount of aluminum foil around the bottom of each candle, shaping it into a small cup so that drips from the candle will catch in the foil and not drip onto your creation.

Gather your materials:10 to 20 feet of clear fishing line (more if you have high ceilings)
1 hook
1 large but realistic fake spider (you can also go big and hairy if you want!),
Screw a hook into the ceiling above your couch.,
Tie clear fishing line around the spider.,
Drape the fishing line over the hook.,
Drop the spider.",How to Scare Your Friends2,"

, If you’re planning to prank someone who comes over often, screw the hook above where they normally sit., Be sure the fishing line is securely around the spider and that you've tied a strong knot. You don’t want the spider falling off the line!, To make sure you have enough line, cut it after you know where you’ll be standing when you pull it.

You may want to leave the line near a light or the TV instead of where you’re sitting on the couch if you think that your friend might sit close enough to you on the couch that he/she can see you pulling the fishing line.
The best setup is to be able to control the spider from behind the couch or curtain, when your friend isn’t even aware you’re in the room.

, Once your friend is sitting down on the couch, find a way to drop the spider on to him/her without him/her noticing you pulling on the fishing line.

Exactly how you do this will depend on the layout of your room. You may need to get creative!
If you live with other people, ask them to tell your friend you’ll be there in a minute, and to have a seat. Then, once they’ve sat down, you can drop the spider on them from your hiding place.

Gather your materials:

1 balloon
Duct tape
Cake plate
A medium-small box (size of a cake)
Icing (make sure it’s thick and opaque)
Sprinkles
Friend who likes cake
Real cake to say you’re sorry (optional)

,
Cut the top off a box.,
Inflate a balloon.,
Place the balloon in the box and tape it in.,
Place the balloon-box on a cake plate.,
Ice the balloon and box.,
Add sprinkles and any other decorations.,
Give the cake to your friend.,
Have them cut the cake.,
Laugh hysterically.,
Apologize and give them a real cake (optional but recommended).",How to Scare Your Friends3,", You can use any type of box for this, but something the size of a medium-small cake (roughly 9 inches by 9 inches) would be perfect. You’ll also want to make sure that the sides are high enough to hold in an inflated balloon.

A huge sheet-cake-sized box could also work but isn’t ideal, as it would just require more balloons and more icing.

, Inflate a balloon large enough that it fills the box as much as possible without distorting the sides of the box., Once the balloon is in the box, use some duct tape to secure it there — 1 strip of tape vertically and 1 horizontally should be fine, but you can use more if you think you need to.

You can also use painting tape or electrical tape if you don’t have duct tape. Just don’t use Scotch tape, as this will be too thin and not sticky enough to properly hold in the balloon.
You want to use enough tape that the balloon sits firmly in the box and doesn’t move around when you touch it.

, You’ll want to do this before you begin icing the “cake” so that you don’t make a mess on your counter — also, it will be easier to transport once it’s iced., Use a spatula to cover the balloon and box with icing. You want to cover the entire thing so that it looks like a cake.

Make sure the icing is thick and opaque — you don’t wan it to be runny or see-through, or it’ll be easier to tell what’s underneath it.

, Do whatever else you want to do to make the cake look extra tasty and alluring. You might even write your friend’s name on it with icing., Your friend will probably be pretty excited to get a cake. If it’s not their birthday, you’ll need to find some other convincing reason for offering them cake.

For example, if you’re having a movie night, you could say that you were bored at home and felt like making some cake. If you do this, you can’t push them to eat it otherwise they might know something’s up. You’ll have to wait for them to want the cake and cut it.

, If your friend is excited about the cake, he/she will probably want it right away. Make sure he/she’s the one to cut it, but don’t act too obvious about wanting them too. You can just hand them the knife and say you’ll get plates.

If your friend doesn’t seem to want the cake, you can ask them to cut you a slice, but this might be more obvious. If they go into the kitchen to get themselves a drink, you could say, “Hey do you mind cutting me a piece of that cake?” and then act like you’re busy on your phone.

, When your friend cuts the cake, he/she’ll likely scream when it pops loudly. This is when you laugh, and hopefully he/she will laugh too., Getting a balloon cake isn’t as funny as giving one. If you give someone a balloon cake, make it up to them by giving them a real one afterwards. At the very least, give them a cupcake!"

Keep the transmitter off until you’re ready to use it.,
Wait until it’s dark.,
Sit somewhere far away from the speaker and begin.,
Make sure you’re not too far from the speaker.,
Do it without the monitor.",How to Scare Your Friends4," This prank involves transmitting spooky sounds to a place of your choosing, to scare people of your choosing. You don’t need much for this — just your voice, a spooky setting, and a baby monitor set (transmitter and receiver)., You could do this to your friends, family, or even your kids, if you have them and are confident it won’t scar them for life., Think about where it would be really frightening to hear scary voices coming from. Imagine what would terrify you if you were alone at night and began to hear frightening noises.

What if you heard frightening noises coming from under your bed? Would this scare you?
What if you heard noises coming from your closet, or maybe the bathroom down the hall?
You could even do this outside at night if you’re camping, but it might be a bit more tricky!

, Make some noises into the transmitter to get a sense of how you sound. You might try out different creepy voices to see what works best., You’ll be speaking into the transmitter (the unit a parent would leave next to the baby to monitor it), and the sounds you make will come out of the speaker (the unit the parent would normally have).

Possible locations for the speaker include under the bed, in the closet, in the bathtub behind the shower curtain, or anywhere else where you’re planning to have the scary noises come from.
Be sure that no one catches you hiding the speaker, and that it’s well-hidden, or the prank will be over. Remember that at night, the speaker’s light might glow in the dark, so you’ll want to make sure it’s properly hidden.
Make sure the speaker is on and that the batteries are well charged when you hide it.

, Make sure the transmitter is off until you’re ready to use it, otherwise every sound you make will be transmitted to the place where you’ve hidden the speaker!, This prank works best at nighttime when it’s dark and quiet, and everyone has gone to bed but isn’t yet asleep., Whispers are a great way to start, and are especially frightening when they build up into a loud exclamation.

Example: “Where is she where is she where is she I know she was here I know it I saw her … … yes that’s her name, that’s her — Shhh shhh shhhhhh. I think she hears us!” Then be quiet for a few moments, then shout “LET ME OUT!” then start whining or crying, or laughing maniacally.
Ideally you don’t want to stop until you can hear the person freaking out.
If you’re trying to scare children, keep it tame — for example, “What’s that smell? What’s that smell? I smell smelly feet … they make me hungry, I’m going to EAT THEM!”

, If you’re too far from the speaker, your voice might not transmit to it clearly. If you’re unsure of the transmission distance, double-check the instructions for your baby monitor set., You can also do this prank without the monitor, just by hiding beneath someone’s bed, in their closet etc. The thing is, it’s scarier if they see you before they go to bed — that way they won’t expect that you're in the room trying to scare them."

Read scary stories.,
Put your scary story together.,
Practise it.,
Choose your moment wisely.,
Build intrigue.,
Don’t over do it.,
Tell the story.,
Make the ending count.",How to Scare Your Friends5," Even if you’re planning on telling a scary story that you’ve made up, you can benefit from reading other scary stories. You can find great collections of scary stories at your local library or even online.

Forums like Reddit No Sleep or Reddit Ghost Stories are great sources for frightening tales.One way to create your own scary story is to use another story as a template and then change the details to fit your location — for example, instead of “at a scary house somewhere” you can name a spooky-looking house in your city and say that you heard about something that happened there.

, Tailor it to where you’ll be and what you’ll be doing. If you’re having a sleepover at your house, an effective scary story would be one that takes place in a house late at night.

The more things your scary story has in common with where you are and who you’re with, the scarier it will be.

, Don’t just write a story down and then hope you can remember it well enough to tell it — and definitely don’t read from a book or piece of paper. Telling the story from memory will engage your listeners and have the strongest effect.

You might even want to record yourself telling the story so that you can get a sense of how you sound and (if you have a video camera/smart phone with video function) look while telling the story.

, You don’t want to just start telling a spooky story in the middle of a busy cafeteria at lunchtime; scary stories are best told late at night amongst small groups of people., Before telling your story, you can build it up by acting a bit nervous and afraid before you start telling it. You can say that you want to tell your listeners something, but you’re nervous to because it scares you.

You can say that you don’t like to think about it because when you do, you get bad dreams and feel uneasy in the days following it, but it’s a good story so you’ll try to share it.
You can even look behind you uneasily, or glance from side to side nervously.

, Don’t be too obvious in your attempts to build intrigue, or it’ll come off as fake and funny instead of making your listeners nervous., As you tell the story, speak slowly and clearly, and most importantly, speak quietly. Don’t speak so quietly that people can’t hear you, but speak quietly enough that it sounds like you're sharing a secret with your listeners.

You don’t want to be overdramatic, but you can definitely pause for dramatic effect during the story, and you can adjust the volume of your voice, too.

, Depending on the nature of the story, it might end with you clapping or shouting loudly, or you lunging towards your listeners. It might also end with you intensely looking at your listeners as you quietly deliver the punchline.

Making a loud noise such as clapping, stomping, or shouting is a fun way to finish a scary story — if done right, this is sure to get a scream from your audience.

Start the prank.,
Sit in the chair.,
Stare at a point on the ceiling.,
Begin making sounds.,

Come clean.",How to Scare Your Friends6," It’s a common scene in horror movies to have someone sitting facing the wall, responding to some unknown entity. Most often they have their back to the audience, and are gently rocking back and forth in a rocking chair., This is not something you want to do in broad daylight around a large group of people. It’s a great prank for a sleepover if you have up to 3 other people over.

If you’re doing this at a home where there will be parents present, make sure the parents know about the prank, otherwise they might wonder what's going on when they hear someone laughing maniacally in the middle of the night.

, Sitting in a big cushy armchair facing the wall won't have the same effect as sitting in a wooden chair or rocking chair. You want to be easily seen, and you want your body language to be as clear as possible., Practice what you’re going to do before you do it. Make sure no one hears or sees you doing this unless you want them in on the prank., You may want to act completely normal all the way up to the point that your friends find you sitting in the chair, or, you might want to give little hints that something isn’t right with you throughout the night.

You could eat and then say you’re not feeling well, and say that you haven’t been feeling well a lot lately — something up with your stomach.
You could mention that you’ve been having bad dreams, and then describe dreams in which a weird face appears in the darkness above you, or in which shadow people hover over you in your sleep.

, Once everyone is in the bedroom and lying down/ready to go to sleep, lie down and then within seconds toss and turn, and then stand up and walk towards the door.

If no one says anything as you leave, say “Ugh I have to pee again already” as you walk out, just to make sure they notice you’re gone.
If you’re worried no one will notice you, or that you might wake up other people in the house, you can even do the prank in the bedroom — in this case, you’ll want to be the first one in the bedroom so that when everyone comes in, you’re already sitting in the chair in your “trance”.

, Position a chair so that it’s facing a wall or even the corner of a room, and sit down in it. It’s important to consider your body language as you sit:

Will you slump in the chair or sit perfectly upright, almost as if something is pulling you up toward the ceiling?
Your body language is important here, so whatever you do, keep it in mind.

, Begin by staring at a point on the wall or ceiling. You can move your head or keep staring at the one spot. Have an idea of what you’re looking at — really imagining it will help you behave more realistically.

To figure out how to move your head, imagine there is something moving around on the wall or ceiling and that your gaze is following it.
You might even imagine that something is something crouched in the top corner of the room staring down at you.

, Start quietly, but not so quietly that no one can hear you — ultimately you want to get the attention of your friends. You can speak to the “thing” you see, or laugh lightly and then get louder.

Really you can make whatever sounds you want — just make sure they’re creepy!
If you’re planning on screaming when your friends find you, keep your noises fairly quiet. That way, the abrupt change in volume will be extra frightening.

, When your friends find you, you can react in a number of ways. Don’t let them know that you notice them until they come right up to you and try to talk to you or touch you.

When a friend tries to touch/talk to you, you can stare at them blankly and then scream, or you could stare at them blankly for a moment before blinking your eyes and shaking your head a bit, then returning to normal.
If you do the second option, make sure that you act defensive or like you have no idea what they’re talking about when your friends try to mention the incident.

, Unless you want your friends thinking you’re actually crazy, you’ll want to come clean to them at some point. When you do is up to you; just don’t keep it going on too long."

Messages like “Help me” or “Stuck in here” or even “Watching you” would be good., The message won’t be invisible until it dries, so make sure that you write it on the mirror when no one will need to use the bathroom right away. Give yourself at least 30 minutes to let it dry.

You can use a blow-dryer on it to help it dry more quickly, if you’re in a rush.

, Ideally your victim will have a shower and steam up the bathroom, and the message will appear. Maybe they won’t scream, but it might still creep them out., When your victim asks you about the message, play stupid. Ask to see it and then act afraid, too. You might even tell them a story that goes with the message.

For example, you might say that you heard a cracking noise last night when you were in there, and have been feeling uneasy going in there since, like something is watching you.

Practice Tikkun Olam.",How to Celebrate Hanukkah," Hanukkah is about God's protection of the Israelites, and the miracles that occurred on the day.The holiday celebrates the triumph of faith and courage over military might, when a band of Israelites stood up for their right to be Jewish. They were prohibited under penalty of death from studying their sacred texts or performing important mitzvot. Their holy Temple had been defiled, and they were ordered to worship other gods. However, a small band of faithful Israelites, known as the Maccabees, rose up and defeated the invaders, reclaimed the Temple, and rededicated it to God. The eternal flame in the Temple's great menorah (lamp stand) had to be lit. But the sacred olive oil needed to burn in the lamp stand took 8 days to press and purify. The Jews had only a one-day supply of oil. They decided, in faith, to light the flame anyway. And, a great miracle occurred. The jug of oil refilled itself every day with enough oil to relight the Temple's great menorah, and this continued for 7 days, the exact time it took to prepare new oil! It is a common misconception that the oil burned continuously for 8 days. This story is even mentioned by Josephus, the first century Jewish historian.Since that time, Hanukkah has been celebrated for 8 days to recall the miracle when the menorah burned for 8 days at the Temple. The main miracle of Hanukkah is the victory of the Maccabees against the most powerful army in the world.;
, The most basic thing you need to celebrate Hanukkah is a 9-branched candelabra, called a Hanukkiah (or often a Menorah, although technically a Menorah is a 7-branched candelabra), and candles. Eight of the branches represent the eight nights, while the last one (at a different height, usually higher than the rest) is called the shamash or helper candle, and is used to light the rest of the candles. The Hanukkiah is usually lighted at or right after sunset.


On the first night, the shamash is lit, a blessing is recited, and the first candle is lit. The first candle occupies the rightmost place on the Hanukkiah.
Candles are placed from right to left, but lit from left to right. The candle that you light first is always the last candle that you placed on the Hanukkiah; likewise, the candle that you light last is always the first candle that you placed on the Hanukkiah.
On the second night, the shamash plus two candles are lit and so on until the eighth night, when all nine branches contain lit candles.
Traditionally, the lighted Hanukkiah is placed near a window, so that everyone passing by can remember the miracle of Hanukkah. Some families who set the Hanukkiah near the window place the candles left to right, so that they appear right to left to a passer-by.

, Blessings are a way of paying respect to God and to Jewish ancestors.


On the first day of Hanukkah, recite the following blessing:Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech Ha'olam, asher kidshanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu l’hadlik ner shel Hanukkah.
Blessed are You, O Lord Our God, Ruler of the Universe, Who has sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded us to kindle the lights of Hanukkah.Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech Ha'olam, she’asah nisim l’avoteinu, b’yamim haheim bazman hazeh.
Blessed are You, O Lord our God, Ruler of the Universe, Who made miracles for our forefathers in those days at this time.Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech Ha'olam, shehekheyanu, v’kiyamanu vehegianu lazman hazeh.
Blessed are You, O Lord Our God, Ruler of the Universe, Who has kept us alive, sustained us and brought us to this season.
On all subsequent nights of Hanukkah, when you light the Hanukkiah, recite the following blessing:Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech Ha'olam, asher kidshanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu l’hadlik ner shel Hanukkah.
Blessed are You, O Lord Our God, Ruler of the Universe, Who has sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded us to kindle the lights of Hanukkah.Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech Ha'olam, she’asah nisim l’avoteinu, b’yamim haheim bazman hazeh.
Blessed are You, O Lord our God, Ruler of the Universe, Who made miracles for our forefathers in those days at this time.

, A four sided top, called a dreidel or sevivon is used to play a gambling game with small candies or nuts. Players get an equal amount of candies, and some are placed into a ""pot"" in the center. Players take turns spinning the dreidel. Each side of the dreidel bears a letter which tells the players whether to put in or take out candies. The game ends when someone has all the candies, or when the candies have all been eaten (usually the case in homes with small children!)

, Small gifts of money (gelt) are given to children on each night of Hanukkah. Chocolate coins are also popular as treats and gifts during Hanukkah. Consider giving each child a 5 dollar blank check each night to make out to the charity of their choice.


Hanukkah gifts may also be given to adults. Although Hanukkah takes place during the Christian holiday season, it is not the ""Jewish Christmas,"" as some have mistaken it for.
Great Hanukkah gifts for adults include beautiful Hanukkiah candles, nice cooking oil, or a Jewish cook book.

, Hanukkah just wouldn't be the same without the traditional latkes and applesauce. Latkes (pancakes made from shredded potatoes, onions, matzoh meal and salt) are fried in oil to crispy gold brown, then served with applesauce (and often sour cream). The frying oil reminds celebrants of the miracle of the oil. Small powdered sugar donuts, called Sufganiyot are also a popular Hanukkah treat, especially in Israel. Fried, oil-rich foods are the theme!


Additionally, dairy is consumed by many people during Hanukkah, as a way to remember the story of Judith. Judith saved her village from a conquering Syrian general by plying him with salty cheese and wine. When he passed out, she took his own sword and beheaded him, the story goes.For this reason, cheesy latkes and cheesy blintzes are popular during Hanukkah.

, Use the holiday as a chance to talk with children about what they believe in, and what it means to stand up for your beliefs. Find causes that support free speech and religious freedom, and help them to spread those messages centuries after the miracle of Hanukkah. After all, Hanukkah is the story of the Israelites fighting for religious freedom!

Buy a modest gift for Day 1.,
Get involved in charity for Day 2.,
Think of an educational gift for Day 3.,
Give the gift of money or chocolate coins for Day 4.,
Gift them a Jewish-related present on Day 5.,
Give them an earth-conscious gift on Day 6.,
Do something family-related on Day 7.,
Splurge a little on Day 8.,
Plan a budget in advance.,
Allow for flexibility.,
Talk about Hanukkah with your family.",How to Buy Hanukkah Gifts for Kids," Choose a gift that is modest and fairly priced. For example, a DVD, a CD of a favorite rock band, etc. Choose something small that you know the child would like to have.


If the child is young, think building blocks (Legos or Lincoln Logs), small dolls, board or card games, or sports play toys (Frisbees, Nerf balls, etc.)






If the child is older, think articles of clothing, CDs or DVDs, a subscription to a magazine, or sports or entertainment memorabilia.





;
, This is the day for kids to think about giving to others, highlighting the spiritual values of Hanukkah. Ask the kids what their favorite charity is, then give a donation to that charity under their name. Make sure the child knows why giving is important. Instill in them how lucky they are to have what they have. Make sure that they see the receipt in their name and be sure to have a shared discussion about the importance of charity.
Do they sigh at the sight of a stray dog or cat? If yes, give money to a local pet shelter.






Do they wince when they see a homeless person or family go to a homeless shelter? If yes, give money to Goodwill Rescue Mission.






If they wish they could help every sick person, give money to a hospital nearby.







, Education is the focus on this day. Give the kids a gift that is both educational and fun, something that will teach them about the world, or maybe something about themselves. If you want to make the greatest impact, get them a gift in an area you know they'll enjoy.
There are plenty of excellent ideas here, including science kits, rock tumblers, crystal growing kits, chemistry sets, electronics projects, etc.






Books can also be a great gift idea, although not all books are equal in the eyes of children. Get a book that is engaging and a bit edgy instead of dry and academic. Try books about dinosaurs and ships for young boys, or perhaps books about horses or fairy tales for girls.






Some other gifts might be a butterfly garden, a no-stress chess set, a microscope, telescope, or an educational tablet for kids.







, For the next night, give them ""gelt,"" a Yiddish word for money. If they are young, give them chocolate coins. If they are older, give cash (ranging from $5 to $20), or coins of any amount. You could also simply deposit an amount direct into their savings account.
Kids might get a kick out of older coins, especially if they are older. Old Silver dollars or two-dollar bills might be a good idea.






Give kids money in a different currency and encourage them to travel. For example, give them shekels and tell them that they can use them if/when they go to Israel on Birthright.







, Give them a gift related to Judaism on this day. For teens and tweens, such items as religious books, a symbolic necklace, a snow globe, or a bookmark would work well. For younger kids, good choices include picture books, jewelery, games, etc., with a religious theme. Dreidels work well for kids of all ages.

, Be kind to the Earth this Hanukkah and give them an eco-friendly gift, such as a durable water bottle, a small compost bin, a recycled purse, or a plant to grow. Wrap it in last week's newspaper and present it to the kids.


Other gift ideas include an indoor gardening kit or indoor greenhouse, organic sculpting dough, an ecosphere, as well as solar toys.







, Give the kids an outing with the family. Either plan to go and do something together on this day, or purchase tickets for an upcoming event that you'll all attend together. Another alternative is making an IOU for something you know the whole family really wants to do, or a small family vacation to be taken later.

, This is the day for the most expensive and fun gift for your child. A new bike, a play set, a pool, a play piano are good for non-living gifts. Or, if you're up to getting a pet for your child, get a family pet, but be sure to tell your kid about the responsibility he or she now has.


Some nice gift ideas for girls include: fancy clothes (a nice dress or a cashmere sweater, for example), jewelry, a musical instrument, perfume, a handbag or a makeup set.






Some nice gift ideas for boys include: a musical instrument, a sports-set (basketball hoop, or hockey pads, for example), a computer or video game (it doesn't have to be educational), or tickets to a sports game.







, While one child is affordable, many children can soon blow the budget with 8 days of gifts! Sort out how many of the days you think you'll give gifts for, as well as the types of gifts you can afford, and what your budget can handle.


Keep in mind that observing the spirit of the occasion is the most important aspect.
If giving gifts to siblings, keep in mind that each gift will need to be similar in price and value for each child.
If children consistently complain about the gifts they get, prepare to leave gifts out of Hanukkah for one year: Teach your kids how lucky they are to be in a position to receive gifts at all.

, On each of the eight days, the tradition is for a gift of a particular sort is given to each child. However, it is important to recognize that the gift-giving part of Hanukkah does not need to be followed strictly or even observed on each day – it depends on your budget, your enthusiasm, and, of course, your interpretation of this part of celebrating Hanukkah. Approach Hanukkah gift giving in the the way that your family believes is the most appropriate.


For some parents, giving very modest gifts of the same kind several times over is not unusual (for example, giving small amounts of coins or chocolate coins several times during the week), while other parents favor one single large gift at the end, with extremely modest gifts in between (such as Hanukkah decorations), or daily donations to charity in the child's name.

, As with any religious holiday where gifts are involved, it is important to spend a little time relating the gift giving to the occasion being celebrated. Make it an enjoyable time of learning, with the whole family involved in talking about Hanukkah and celebrating it together.

Make yourself look creepy.,
Wait until your friend is alone.,
Find a good hiding place.,
Add some creepy props.,
Scream and howl like a maniac.",How to Scare People1," Popping out and scaring someone can come off as goofy if you just look like yourself, but if you're dressed all in black with your face covered in fake blood and creepy clown makeup, you'll be scary.


If you know your target well, you can exploit their biggest fear by dressing up as whatever will scare that person the most, whether it's the dentist, a giant spider, or a ghost.
Though the quick scare will still be effective if you just look like your regular self, you will frighten your victim at a whole new level if you dress up as someone scary.
For more specific costume suggestions, skip to the next section for tips.;
, Being in a group helps to bolster your bravery, so it'll be easier if you wait to freak someone out until they're alone. The fright will be much stronger and more real. There are a variety of ways to make this happen, but here are some easy ones:


Text your friend to meet you somewhere at a specific time, but have your creepy surprise waiting for them instead. This will give you the chance to set up beforehand.
Wait until you know your friend or sibling will be alone and distracted. Alone in their room playing video games, or focusing hard on homework? Perfect.
If you want to scare your sibling, set up your frightening scene while they're asleep and let them wake up to it. Super terrifying.

, The best scares combine a moment of your victim thinking, ""Wait a minute, that looks creepy"" right before you pop out screaming to terrify them. Wherever you're planning your scare, and whatever it will include, it's a good idea to hide somewhere and wait for your opportunity to jump out and add a last-minute scare. Good hiding places include:


Under beds
Behind doors
Behind trees or cars
Under staircases
In the dark basement
In the attic
In plain sight, but in the dark

, Find out what gives your friend nightmares and use it to your advantage. This will vary, depending on your friend and what scares them the most, but it's a good idea to do a little digging and find out what will freak them out the most. Think about the following little freaky props:


Fake snakes, wetted with Vaseline to look really creepy
Rusty knives
Fake blood
Raw meat
Worms or cockroaches
Static noise on television or radio
Broken baby dolls

, After you set your trap, let your victim walk into it, and let it spring into action. Scream, growl, grab the person's arms, and laugh maniacally while enjoying the person's sheer terror. Then, run off into the night, all the while cackling with your head thrown back. You can hide in the distance to watch complete fear overwhelm your victim until he realizes he has been fooled.


Alternatively, you can also leave a recording of creepy noises to startle your friend instead. Set up an old boombox to play a recording of you coughing and wheezing creepily, timed to set off when they walk in.
When your victim is thoroughly frightened, it's a good idea to start backing off. You don't want to freak them out too much, or risk getting the cops called. Once they scream once, you got your fun, and now know when to call it quits.

Make yourself look dead.,
Dress up like a creepy surgeon.,
Go with a classic monster costume.,
Don't dress up at all, but act creepy.",How to Scare People2," Everyone's scared of dead people. They're dead. That's scary. If you want to exploit this fear, you can learn to make yourself look like a zombie using basic make-up and safe products. Try out the following tactic:


Wash your face thoroughly, then apply some really pale foundation make up all over your face. You could also use some baby powder to dust your face gently and make it appear paler. The pallor of death.
Use dark blue or black eye shadow under your eyes to give them that sunken, fresh out of the grave look. Blend it gently to make it look more natural. Nice.

Make up some fake blood using food coloring and corn syrup, then draw a fake ""wound"" on your body somewhere visible with marker and bloody it up with the fake blood.

, For lots of us, the blood will curdle at the thought of visiting a deranged surgeon or dentist. It's time to have some fun with this fear. Dress up in rubber gloves, some blue scrubs, and cover your mouth like a real surgeon, so only your eyes are exposed. You can get most of these things at most drug stores.


You can even go all out and get some surgical equipment to make it as realistic as possible, or at least your dad's power drill from the garage. Unplug it, of course.
Splatter some ketchup or fake blood all over your scrubs and carry a knife and fork. You'll look super creepy.

, The classics are classics for a reason. They're scary. Dress up as a zombie, vampire, ghost, or mummy. You could also invent your own monster costume and be even more unique.


Look to famous horror-movie characters like Michael Myers, Jason, Freddy Krueger, or Ghost Face from Scream,"" and see if you can get your hands on a realistic looking mask.

Wearing a mask over your regular clothes can look somewhat creepy, but if you're wearing what you wore to school that day, it'll probably be a quick tip that it's you.

, If you don't have the time or energy to put together a creepy costume, you can use your acting skills to make up for it. It can be even creepier if you look the same, but seem off in some scary way. Try out the following:


Just sit in a dark room with the TV blasting static, rocking back and forth, mumbling the sentence, ""They told me this would happen..."" over and over. When your friend starts looking concerned, scream at the top of your lungs.
Walk into your sibling's room in the middle of the night and just stand over their bed with your mouth open, drooling fake blood and breathing raggedly.
Stand facing the corner in a dark room. Do nothing. When you turn around, have fake blood all over your face.

Pick a venue.,
Pick a theme.,
Get some friends to help.,
Decorate accordingly.,
Create scary sound effects.,
Create spooky lighting.,
Commit to the mood.",How to Scare People3," While it takes more time and work, creating a scary environment, such as a haunted house, will build a lingering dread in people's hearts and minds while they expect the worst to happen at any moment. When creating a haunted house or other spooky scene, location is key.


A house or structure with scary elements—like narrow hallways, squeaky steps or dark basements—is a good place to start.
Make a map for yourself. Make sure people can easily move from room to room without difficulty.

, A theme will help you decide how to decorate and what elements to include. For true authenticity, come up with a story for why the house is haunted. Is it haunted by an old lady whose husband disappeared into thin air? Is it haunted by a family that was brutally murdered in the basement? Make it at least a little bit believable.


Abandoned insane asylum
Torture chamber
Vampire's lair
Zombie invasion

, Creating a haunting house on your own can be a challenge. Instead, have your trusted friends dress up as eerie characters and help you decorate the house and spook the guests as they walk through the house. They can leap out at people, hide in closets, or spring out of fake coffins.


You can station some guests on the porch, having them ""play dead"" until the guests get close enough. Then, they can jump out at your guests, scaring them before they even set foot in the house.

, Create spaces that build tension, which is essential for a good scare. A long, dark hallway that must be followed will have people expecting the worst at any moment. People who are tense and anxious are easier to scare. Each room should have its own spooky theme so your guests are always on their toes and never know what to expect.


Station a volunteer in each room to help create the spooky environment and direct the guests.
Each room can have differently creepy effects, such as a bowl of cold noodles meant to be worms, or a jar of peeled grapes that are supposed to be eyeballs.
Create ""specimen jars"" by placing broken toys or bent utensils in cloudy water that is dyed green.

, Sound effects can go a long way in completely scaring a person out of his wits. There are a few things you can do to truly scare your guests with just a few key sounds. Here are some things to try:


Have your volunteers scamper from one side of an empty room to the other, wearing heavy boots.
Place a few coins in an empty soda can and tie it to a string. Have your volunteers shake the can to create a ""rattling"" sound.
Play a recording of spooky sounds in every room, from the sound of a woman screaming, wind wildly blowing, or the sounds of chainsaw.
Make the most of silence. Make the house absolutely silent from time to time so the fear factor goes up during the next spooky sound.

, The lighting can also go a long way in scaring the living day ""lights"" out of people. You can build areas of complete darkness, incorporate disorienting strobe lights into one room, or pump in fog in front of a light for an eerie effect, all of which will confuse a person's senses and make him more susceptible to scares. Here are some other ways to create spooky lighting:


Designate a hallway where the guests have to wear blindfolds -- just make sure they're comfortable with this.
Light a spotlight under fake creepy insects or a spiderweb to create a spooky shadow on the wall.
Drape black plastic bags around the furniture to catch a little bit of eerie light.

, Always stay in character in the haunted house to maintain the illusion. Don't stop and say hi to your friends. Keep the haunted house completely scary and believable. Don't break character, not even when you escort your guests out of the house.


Later, when the guests tell you they had a great time at your haunted house, act like you have no idea what they're talking about.

Concoct a premise.,
Say it's a true story.,
Build suspense.,
Use visual aids.,
Create spooky sound effects.,
Embellish the details.,
Keep it surprising.,
Tease the ending.",How to Scare People4," Whether you're making a movie, writing a horror novel or just telling a story, a solid premise is key. Whether it's caused by a spider or a dark room with a sense of dread, fear lives in the brain. Horror movies, suspense novels, or scary campfire stories are all good ways to give people a fright. Watch a scare movie or read a spooky tale for inspiration.


Don't just create your story on the spot. Though you can surely improvise, it's important to have your story set before you begin. If you hesitate while you're telling the story, then you will lose your audience.

, Even if your story is wildly untrue, just say it's a true story -- that it happened in your town many years ago, that it happened to your cousin, or that you actually saw it happen. Saying something is actually true will get people to pay attention and will make your story sound more probable.You can even tell people that it's so secret that you can't even read about it online. Say you read about it on microfilm at the local library. Tell people they can do the same to confirm that the story is true -- obviously, no one would do that, but it'll lend more credibility to your tale.
Before you jump into the story, you can ask, ""Are you sure you want to hear this?"" Act like the story is so scary that you don't know if you should proceed.

, From the long walk up the attic stairs to the slow opening of a door, a good scare needs to be built up and anticipated. Don't just give it all away, or your audience won't be interested. Build anticipation by acting like you're telling a normal story, and let the creepy details slowly make their way into the story.


Keep your readers on their toes by saying things like, ""But that's nothing compared to what happened later."" Or, ""She thought that was the worst pain in the world, but that was only the beginning.""
Talk slowly and carefully. Don't just rush to the scariest parts of the story. Make every word count.

, Show people your appendectomy scar and say it was where you were stabbed by the killer in question. Bring some old grainy photos of your grandparents and say they're pictures of the victims. If you've brought any other visual aids, just pass them around casually, like you always keep them with you.


The fake blood-stained clothes of the victim are also a nice touch.
You can even use something ordinary, like the baseball card collection of a little boy who disappeared.

, The effects can be simple. If you're talking about something knocking on a door in the middle of the night, knock on the floor. Have a friend help out by creating other spooky sounds, like a creaking opened door, raindrops falling on the ceiling, or the wind blowing through the trees.


You can also crumple a plastic bag, which creates a great rustling effect.

, Just like the spooky atmosphere of a haunted house, the details of a scary story help set the scene. Describe the sounds of the abandoned warehouse or show the decaying teeth of the murderous clown. The more specific your scary story is, the better.


For example, a man whose hand was severed is scary enough, but a man with a severed hand whose veins leave a trail of blood wherever he walks is even more frightening.
Ground the story in history. If it was before World War II, casually mention who the president was, or bring up a detail from that period to make the story sound more realistic.

, Don't reveal the ordinary details that people would expect to hear in any scary story. Sure, everyone has heard the story of a ghost who haunts the woods late at night, but how about the story of a ghost who makes people eat their own eyeballs, or a ghost who inhabits the body of a little girl's pet rabbit?

, When the story gets really scary, slow down or even clam up, like you can't bear to finish the story. Take a deep breath and wait for people to ask what happened next. Finally, make your voice absolutely calm as you reveal the gruesome ending.


The spookiest endings are unresolved. Don't solve the mystery. Leave your audience to wonder if the ghost or scary person in question is still alive -- maybe even wandering in the woods nearby.
When the story's over, go absolutely silent, like you were so overwhelmed by the ending that you can't possibly go on.

Freak the pranksters out!",How to Protect Your Home from Halloween Pranks and Vandalism," The biggest reason that people tend to attack your home on Halloween is that you might be avoiding giving them candy. If you show yourself to be a welcoming neighbor, you might not get vandalized.;
, If they don't think you are home, people probably won't attack your house for not ""treating"" them.

, This prevents things like stink bombs, etc.

, This lessens the chance of drive-by egging.

, If you see someone who is going to vandalize your house aim and spray water while still hiding. Also, you could use ""sprinklers"", but do not use a water-gun or Airsoft because that exposes you and makes it personal (which could bring revenge against you).

,, Be sure the leash isn't too short/or too long.

,, ""You vandalize, you don't get candy.""

,, Hide behind bushes or leave a hidden tape of you saying ""I see you..."" Beware as this may drive nicer people away, too.

, The last thing you want is a parent or a guardian reporting your description to the police or neighborhood watch.

, Even if you are defacing a person's lawn or other property, don't be a jerk. No burning bags of dog feces, no smashing windows, and most f all do NOT harm your victim physically in any way, shape, or form. The idea is to have fun, not be a sadistic demon.

, Toilet paper, rotten pumpkin innards, smoke bombs, stink bombs, and eggs are allowed, as long as you don't go overboard or severely damage something. The worst thing is to get a reputation as a horrible prankster, you want to get a relationship of mutual respect between you and your victims, with a pinch of fear in their hearts.

, Use your imagination to think of other harmless but degrading pranks that can be done with relative ease.

, That's what Halloween is for!

If you're unsure what your mom's favorite dishes are, ask others who are close to her or ask her months in advance. Search for recipes online if you're anxious about preparing a dish.
Homemade isn't always better. Don't feel bad about purchasing pre-made food, especially if your mother enjoys it. You can always purchase from a grocery store or order take-out from her favorite restaurant.
Catering is also an option. The cost of catering varies greatly depending on the type of food and the company.

, Not only do Mother's Day games help you to entertain guests, but it also helps to build great memories for mom on her special day.


Put on a play or skit for your mom. Have family members reenact memories that are special to your mom, or even tell her life's story. Not only is it fun and entertaining, but she'll be thrilled to have a play hosted in her honor.
Play a version of ""The Dating Game"" where pairs of mothers and daughters (or sons) have to answer questions about each other, and determine which team can get the most answers correct., Does your mother prefer flowers and butterflies or football and motorcycles? Determine her interests in order to put together a party that reflects who she is, and what she enjoys. The theme will have an impact on everything from the decorations to the activities.


For example, a tea party themed brunch might be appropriate to celebrate your mother. Decorate with centerpieces and flowers, and serve various teas and finger foods to keep mom and guests satisfied.Try a garden inspired luncheon complete with flower centerpieces, fresh fruit, and mimosas., As the party gets underway, toast your mother to show her that this is her special day. Remind her why she deserves to be honored. Don't be cliche in reminding her of all of her wonderful attributes; instead, dig deep and think of all the wonderful things she has done for you.


For example, think of all of the macaroni necklaces she had to wear over the years. Think of how many times she had to drag herself out of bed on a Saturday morning for ballet practice. Remind her that she is deserving of all the praise on this day.
If you have a gift for words or music, sometimes writing a poem or song can help to better get across these sentiments.Say ""I love you."" Very simple, but very effective.

It could be something like “Love You,” or “Love,” or even “Thanks!”

, Using a pin, poke the holes about a ¼ inch apart. Make sure that your card is open and you’re only poking holes through one piece of the paper. Take your time and go slow. If you rush you could miss a few areas. Just follow your tracing.


When poking the holes, do it on top of a piece of cardboard as a cushion.
You don’t have to be super precise with the holes, just aim to evenly space each one out.

Sew through the rest of the holes. Once you’re finished, tie off a knot and cut extra floss.

, Finish your card by writing a nice note on the inside. Try to write her a note that reflects the word or phrase you sewed on the outside.


Once you’ve written your note, you’re ready to place the card in the envelope and give it to your mom.

Decide if you're going to pick up flowers in person or order them to her.,
Consider what flowers she'd like.",How to Get Flowers for Your Mom for Mother's Day1," If you live a distance from your mother, the choice is obvious: get them delivered. If you're close by, you might prefer to choose some flowers in person and hand deliver them. She'll love to see you in person!

, If you know she has a favorite type, the selection is easy, but if not, consider her favorite colors and whether you can pick a bouquet in those hues. If in doubt, a mixed collection of spring flowers is often a good choice.

Buy her a gift.,
Make her a gift.,
Make a special Mother's Day meal.,
Pamper her with a luxury spa treatment.,
Buy her flowers.",How to Surprise Your Mom on Mother's Day1," Buy her something that you know she's always wanted, or find something that you know she will like. Try to buy something special that she wouldn't necessarily buy for herself. You don't need to break the bank with an expensive gold necklace. The important thing is that your gift is thoughtful and makes her feel appreciated.


If you can't think of a specific item that she wants or needs, try to think of something that plays on her interests. If she likes to garden, give her a packet of seeds, or buy her a potted plant that she can replant in her garden. If she likes dark chocolate, buy her a bar of quality chocolate.
If you don't want to buy her one expensive gift, try putting together a small gift basket of her favorite things. A bottle of wine, a bar of chocolate, a bouquet of flowers. Even if the individual items aren't very expensive, she will appreciate the thought that you put into choosing her favorite things.;
, Paint her a painting, write her a poem, carve her something out of wood, or arrange photos of the two of you together into a collage. You won't have to spend much money, and she will appreciate your gift all the more if you make it specifically for her. Don't be afraid to get creative.Make her a mix-CD. Make her a card. Make her a thoughtful video and post it to YouTube or Facebook. Make her a picture-frame, a flip-book, a t-shirt, or a portrait.
Make her a found-object sculpture that she can put in her garden. Make her a coffee mug, a bowl, or a vase out of fired clay. Carve and polish a cutting board out of a unique piece of wood. If she loves the beach, give her a mason jar full of shells that you collected.

, Cook her favorite foods for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Consider serving her breakfast in bed for a classic Mother's Day treat. Make the meal, set the table, and clean up afterward.


If you aren't confident in the kitchen, look up recipes online. Ask a sibling, a friend, or another family member for help.
Consider making her sweet treats. Cookies, brownies, muffins—whatever she likes. Make a nice basket with a Mother's Day card. Consider decorating the treats with her favorite things. If she loves the beach, for example, you might decorate cupcakes with ocean-themed frosting: crabs, palm trees, dolphins, starfish.
If you don't live with her, you can invite her over to your house for dinner. It might not be a surprise, but she will appreciate it. Consider taking her out to her favorite restaurant.

, Pay for a massage, a facial, a manicure, a pedicure, or all of the above. Show that you appreciate her by spoiling her for the day. She may appreciate the chance to lay back, relax, and let someone else take care of her for a change.

, If you know what kind of flowers she likes, buy her a bouquet from a flower shop. She will appreciate flowers no matter which type you give her, but there's a good chance that she has a favorite. Many grocery stores and drugstores also sell flowers. Pick the flowers yourself, if you can find them, and your mom will appreciate the effort.You can buy a wrapped-up bouquet and simply give it to her, or you can put the flowers into a vase that's filled with a few inches of water. Your mom will probably want to put the flowers into a vase or jar to preserve them, so she may appreciate the thought involved in giving her a vase.
If you don't know what type of flowers she likes, consider just asking her. Commit this to memory and use it in the future. She will appreciate that you remembered. This does not only apply to your mom: casually ask significant others what their favorite flower is, and remember the answer for special occasions.
If you can't give her the flowers in person, consider using a flower delivery service. Most florists will deliver flowers for you, and some may even have a special deal for Mother's Day. This is a simple process: you just need to call the florist or order from their website.

Be creative, Make her pancakes, and dress them up so they look really pretty, as well as delicious.,
Make sure to get up earlier than your mother.,
Clean the kitchen the night before so that you know it will be clean for you in the morning.,
Find all the recipes the night before and make sure you that you have all the ingredients on hand, and have them ready to go.,
Think about making some coffee.,
Sit with her so she doesn't have to eat alone, or put on the TV or hand her the paper.

,
Clean up after her.",How to Make a Mother's Day Breakfast," The best thing is to plan the menu ahead of time but if you wake up on Mother's Day and decide it's important to make breakfast at the last minute, you still have time.


Purchase fresh ingredients either early in the morning if local bakers, stores, markets, etc., are open. If not, purchase these the day before.
Make baked goods fresh on the day. Get up earlier than you normally would.;
, Unless you're a chef or a very patient cook, it's best to avoid concocting an elaborate breakfast, as that might take a long time to prepare and then cook, and then clean up afterwards. Choose something you know you can cook and that won't leave a big mess after for you to clean up, as that'll simply take you away from spending time with her.

, Prepare something that she might even have eaten for lunch many times. Do not make something new because she might not like it, and it would spoil your surprise and her enjoyment. Prepare Bagels & Lox, with some herring on the side, as this is usually served for a Sunday breakfast, or brunch. Add a glass of Orange Juice and a cup of coffee for an easy to make and clean up and delicious breakfast.

, Top them with strawberries, place them nicely on the plate. Mother will love your strawberry pancakes, and might even give you a bite to taste. Serve it with a half of grapefruit, and a cup of coffee and she will certainly appreciate it.

, If she gets up before you do, your plan is going down the drain. Also make sure you get up early enough so that you can make the meal without having to worry about the time.

, Make a list of all the ingredients you need, and make sure you can grab them easily, without having to search for them. Set the table nicely, and make sure you have the silverware needed, and the condiments for the meal. Bacon, scrambled eggs sounds like a great breakfast, served with buttered toast, juice and coffee.

, If you are not used to cooking often, cook just one or two items instead of an entire menu.

, If your mom takes milk with her coffee, you might like to have a special flavored creamer on hand.

,, Scrub the pots and pans that you used, put the silverware and plates in the dishwasher, and clean her coffee pot.

, Look for flowers and bouquets that seem fresh and in good condition, as well as meeting your color and type requirements.

, A florist can generally put together a beautiful bunch of flowers for you; if you're lost, just ask for their input and they can help you come up with something your mom will love!

, Most florists will accept a wide range of payment forms. They may also offer fancy vases and other small gift items to go along with your purchase, if you'd like to pay extra for those and up the ante on your gift.

, If you're taking the bouquet to your mom in person, just be sure to be gentle on the bunch in the meantime, and ideally deliver them quickly. You don't want the flowers to be wilted or battered by the time you get to her!

This is especially important if you are having your roses delivered to someone’s workplace where your roses will be judged by any and all coworkers.

, If you can’t think of anything original to say you can “borrow” something from a greeting card or even a line from a love poem. Your card is your chance to really convey your emotions and why you’re sending these lovely roses in the first place.

Take some time to think about your favorite memories with your mom.,
Hang balloons around the house with personal, thoughtful messages written on them.,
Write her a thoughtful note.,
Try making her a custom fortune cookie.,
Make her a video to show her how much she is loved.,
Write a Mother's Day essay.,
If you have good news to tell her, consider saving it for Mother's Day.,
Act out a Mother's Day skit.",How to Surprise Your Mom on Mother's Day2," Find photos, souvenirs, and other mementos, if possible. On Mother’s Day, reminisce with your mom about those special moments. Tell her how much those memories have impacted your life, and make sure she knows that you value your time together.

, Be specific. Think of your mom’s best qualities and think of all the things that she does for you. Instead of writing something generic like “Happy Mother’s Day,” try something like “Thank you for being there at our baseball games” or “We love the delicious dinners you cook for us.”

, You can hand-write a note, you can make or buy a Mother's Day card, or you can print out a typed letter. It doesn't need to be wordy or complicated. Simply wish her a happy Mother's Day, tell her you love her, and list a few reasons that you appreciate her so much. Give her the note with flowers or another gift. If you can't give her a note in person, send her a thoughtful email or e-card, or post something sweet on her Facebook wall.


Try writing several short, thoughtful notes and putting them around the house where she will see them. Put a note on the coffee pot, on her computer screen, on the front door, on the bathroom mirror. Write notes as simple as ""Happy Mother's Day! <3"", or write specific notes that describe her best qualities: for instance, adorn the refrigerator that says ""You are the world's greatest chef! Thank you for cooking delicious dinners and making sure that we never go hungry.""
Consider mailing her a letter. If you don't live with your mom, and you won't be around to spend time with her on Mother's Day—even if you will—try sending her a heartfelt letter in the mail. Look up average mail-delivery times from your area to hers (or use priority mail) and try to time it so that the letter arrives on or just before Mother's Day.

, Simply remove the fortune from an existing fortune cookie without cracking the shell, then slip in your own Mother's Day message. She will be surprised, and she will be impressed at your creativity., Record her children, siblings, husband, and other special loved ones saying things that they love about her. Post the video to YouTube or another video-sharing website; post it to her Facebook wall; or, if she is not so into public displays of affection, simply save the video file to your computer and send it to her in an email. Your mom likely won't expect a heartfelt video that has been made especially for her.

, Write about what your mom means to you, what she does for you, and what makes her a great mother. It does not need to be long, and it does not need to be in a formal style—but if you are writing an essay and not a letter, it will probably not be addressing her directly.

, She will be a proud mom when you tell her about the A that you got on your test, the exciting new job that you were just offered, or your successful proposal to your now-fiancee. Don't make the day about yourself, but tell her things that will make her proud to be a mother.

, Bring your siblings together to plan and act out a short, funny skit that honors your mom. Playfully re-enact a memorable family event, a funny camping trip, or a time when Mom did something especially caring or courageous. A comedic sketch can be a great way to lightheartedly poke fun at your mom's quirky traits while still showing her how deeply you care.

Come to visit her.,
Set the day aside to spend with her.,
Give her a call.,
Plan a party for her.,
Help out around the house.,
Take her out.",How to Surprise Your Mom on Mother's Day3," If you don't live in the same area as your mom, consider surprising her with a Mother's Day visit if you can afford the trip. Drive, rideshare, fly, or take a train. Do not tell her that you're going to come, then show up at her door with flowers and her favorite treat. Plan it out beforehand: speak with siblings, relatives, or your other parent to make sure that your mom is going to be around when you arrive.


Try further setting up the surprise by making up a story about how you can't come. Tell her you have an exam, or a meeting, and that you are very sorry that you aren't able to make it. She will be even more surprised if she specifically expects you not to come!
You don't need to show up on Mother's Day, specifically. You can come on Friday or Saturday and spend the whole weekend. If you do plan to stay the whole weekend, make sure that your mom has space for you to stay.

, Take care of all your homework, projects, and other obligations before Sunday rolls around. Don't make plans with friends or arrange to be out of town. Tell her that you want to spend the day hanging out with her, then take her out for a hike, to a show, or to dinner. She will appreciate the gesture, and she will love the chance to spend quality time with you.Be present. Set aside your phone, and don't spend your day on the Internet. Make the time to be there for your mom and give her your undivided attention.
If you think that your mom would rather spend Mother's Day reading in bed or being pampered at a spa, then arrange it so. If you think that she'd like to spend the day with you, then take the time to make that happen.

, If you aren't living with her, and you can't pay her a visit for Mother's Day, surprise her with a phone call. Wish her a happy Mother's Day, tell her you love her, ask her how she's doing, and tell her what you're up to. Life can get busy, and she will appreciate hearing from you. The simplest gestures can be the most powerful.

, Invite her friends and family, book her favorite band, and make sure that there are plenty of refreshments. Ask a sibling, your father, or other family members for help. Bear in mind that if you hold the party on Mother's Day, many of the guests may be busy with their own Mother's Day plans—so plan accordingly.


You know your own mother best. If she is a social butterfly, then a party might be the perfect Mother's Day surprise. However, if she is less prone to partying, she might prefer to spend a more intimate day with you and your family.

, Stay up late the night before Mother's Day, wake up early in the morning, or simply tell her that you're going to do her chores for her that day. Do the things that she's been planning to do: fix the leaky pipe, mow the lawn, do the laundry, clean the kitchen. Show your love with your actions.She will surely appreciate your help with the regular chores, such as laundry, yardwork, and dishes, but she may be even more surprised if you take the initiative to begin a big project that she's been planning. Help her install a new flowerbed, wash her car, or trim the hedge. Do something rare and special.
Bear in mind that while she will surely appreciate the thought and effort on your part, she may prefer to spend the day with you rather than laying around while you work.

, Bring her to her favorite restaurant, take her to the movies, or take her for a hike. Think about what your mom likes to do, and plan a day that allows the two of you to do that thing together. If you have siblings, be sure to plan something that you can all enjoy, or schedule with them ahead of time: for instance, you can agree that you will take your mom for a hike, but your brother will take her out to dinner.Although it can be great to surprise your mom, you may want to tell her about these plans in advance. If she doesn't know that you plan to take her out to dinner, she might make other plans for the evening. You can still surprise her in advance by telling her about the plans you've made.
She will be especially surprised if you plan out an unexpected excursion. If her favorite band or play is coming to town, buy tickets for the two of you (and, perhaps the rest of your family) to go. She may not even have been aware of the show, but there's a good chance that she will appreciate the gesture.

Check the arrangement.,
Place the flowers in vase.,

Wrap them in tissue paper.",How to Make a Mother's Day Bouquet," You can use your moms’ favorite color as your color palette for the flowers. You could also use the color of your mom’s dining room, bedroom, or kitchen as the color palette. Once you decide on a color, choose flowers of varying hues to create a balanced look.For example, if your mom’s favorite color is pink, then pick pink, magenta, blush, and white flowers for the bouquet.;
, You want to do this since these will be the focal point of the bouquet. Additionally, pick an odd number of large blooms. Depending on how big you want the bouquet to be, pick one, three, or five large blooms.Choose your mom’s favorite flowers for the centerpiece. If your mom doesn’t have a preference, then choose flowers that appeal to your taste.
Examples of large bloom flowers that are perfect for centerpieces are roses, dahlias, tulips, peonies, cosmos, sweet peas, and lisianthus flowers.

, When creating your bouquet, you will need to choose smaller flowers to fill in the space between the bigger ones. These are referred to as filler flowers. Make sure the colors of the fillers complement the colors of the bigger flowers.

Some examples of flowers that work great as fillers are spiraea, lavender, hellebore, statice, and seeded eucalyptus.
For example, seeded eucalyptus and lavender pair well with white or pastel colored roses and dahlias.

, Greenery is great for adding texture and depth to the bouquet. Additionally, by picking greenery that is leafy and tall, you can add height and weight to the bouquet.Some great choices for greenery are seeded eucalyptus, bells of Ireland, ruscus, penny gum, rosemary, forsythia, and astilbe.

, Lay the large blooms down on a table first. Order them according to how you think they look best.Alternatively, you can hold the flowers in your hand while you arrange them.

, Place the smaller flowers in the gaps between the larger blooms. To create contrast, place pale-hued flowers next to rich-hued flowers.For example, place a white flower next to a magenta-colored dahlia to create contrast.
If you are holding the flowers as you arrange them, then rotate the bouquet to make sure you are placing the flowers evenly.

, For the final touches, fill in any extra spaces or gaps with the greenery. You can also place the greenery at the front and end of the flower line to round out the bouquet., Pick the flowers up into a bouquet with your hands. Looking at the top of the bouquet, check to see that the colors are balanced. Also check to see if any flowers need to be repositioned to balance the overall flow of the bouquet. Make sure to check for any gaps as well.For example, if one side of the bouquet has too much greenery, then remove some and place it on the other side of the bouquet, or add more greenery to the other side.

, Fill a vase with water. Before placing the flowers in the vase, trim the ends at a diagonal with scissors (the stems do not need to be the same length). Then place the flowers in a vase of your choice.Get creative by using a pitcher, garden bucket, mason jar, glass cylinder, or another found object as your vase.
Spice up a plain, glass cylinder by tying a ribbon around it.

, Use raffia string, ribbon, wired ribbon, or another type of string to tie your flowers. Cut a piece of string that is long enough to wrap around the stems at least twice. Lay the string on the table and place your bouquet on top. Then wrap the string around the stems and secure it with a bow or a fancy knot.If you bought your flowers ahead of time, place them in the freezer, or a vase with fresh, cool water to prevent them from wilting.

, Lay two pieces of tissue paper on a table at different angles to make your first layer. Using the same technique, lay two more layers of tissue paper on top of the first layer. Then, lay the bouquet on top of the tissue paper. Fold the bottom of the tissue paper up and the sides over and in. Fasten with ribbon or string. Fold down the edges of the tissue paper to make the flowers more visible.Use three to four different colors of tissue paper.
For a rustic look, use brown parchment paper instead of tissue paper.

, Color them in. It's OK to be a little messy as long as they look like they are made with love (probably like the cookies your mom bakes, too.)

, Leave the back blank for messages. They should look like real cookies now.

, If you want, you can color in the back with a very light pencil like yellow or peach, but if you want to keep it white that is fine. White, anyway, is better for magic markers if you will be using them.

, Say why you love her or what this cookie is for. For example, you could write ""I love my mom because she is great at cooking my favorite foods"" or ""This cookie is for all the love you give me."" Repeat with the other cookies, just use different phrases or messages this time. If you have just one big cookie, list multiple reasons.


You could say you love her because...
She is beautiful
She is a great cook
She is always there for you when you need someone to talk to
She always loves you the most in the world

, If you buy a card, take the time to find one that really expresses your feelings about your mom. If you make a card, use good-quality materials to ensure that the card looks nice.

If you have a printer, you can design a card using free online design sites or whatever applications you have installed on your computer.

Whatever it is that makes your mom special to you, articulate it in your card. If you’re struggling to figure out what to say, try making a list of things you love and/or respect about your mom.

, Is your mom more into humor than overly lovey cards? Or maybe she loves super mushy cards. Once you know what you want to say, tailor it to your mom’s tastes.


For example, you want to thank your mom for being so supportive to you this past year while you finished school. Since she loves mushy cards, you could write, “Thank you for being so loving and supportive. I am so grateful to have you in my life. I don’t know what I would do without you. You are my sunshine!” Your card could even have a sun on the front of it.

, Before writing in the card, write a draft of what you want to say on a piece of paper. Doing this will show you how many words will fit on the card, and will help you figure out exactly what you want to say.

, Once you've figured out what you want to write, and you’ve practised it on a piece of paper, you’re ready to write it in the card. Be sure to use a good-quality pen that won’t run out halfway through your message.

, Write your mom’s name on the front of the envelope. The card is ready to be given to your mom! If you want you can also decorate the envelope with some stickers or drawings.

, What are some of her favorite things? What does she like to do? Show your mother you know her by choosing a thoughtful gift that she’s sure to like.


If you really have no clue what to get her, flowers and chocolates are a popular choice.
Another popular choice is to get your mom a gift certificate to her favorite store.

, If you’re unsure of what to get for your mom, don’t be afraid to ask for advice. Ask your siblings and father, or even your mom’s friends and close relatives for ideas on what she might like for Mother’s Day.


It’s also a good idea to ask friends and family just in case they’re also getting your mom a present. That way you can make sure your gifts don’t overlap. You can even go in on a gift together!

, If your mom is into arts and crafts you can make her a collage of family photos. Choose photos that highlight her role as a mother. These will likely include you and any siblings you have.


You could start with a photo of just your mom in the middle of the collage, and then surround her with photos of you and any other members of your family.

, If she loves music, make your mom a CD or a playlist of songs you know she’ll love. Make the playlist a combination of songs she loves and new songs she doesn’t know. That way, part of the gift will be the discovery of new songs and artists.


If she has a good sense of humor and/or loves dancing, you might even make a funny dance routine to go along with one of the songs.

, This is a great gift if you’re still living at home and don’t have any money. Examples include free babysitting (if you’re older with younger siblings) and doing the dishes.


You can make the coupons as simple or fancy as you like, for example, using craft materials or printing them off from a text document the computer.

, Surprise your mom with breakfast — maybe even in bed. If she loves baking, find a cookie or cake recipe she hasn’t tried before and spend the afternoon baking together.Plan the day’s meals out in advance so that your mother doesn't have to cook at all that day if she doesn’t want to. Even if she loves cooking, she might appreciate a day off.

, If you have a bit of money to spend, treat your mom to a day at the spa. A less expensive option is to book her in for a free makeover at a beauty shop and then give her a gift certificate to that shop.Another fun pampering option is to have a girls’ day together. Go to the spa, get manicures and pedicures, or go get makeovers together.
If you’re very short on money, pamper your mom at home by buying her a nice face mask from the drug store and drawing her a bath with nice oils, suds, or Epsom salts in it. You can make the bathroom feel more like a spa by lighting candles and playing soft music in there.

, A lot of moms work hard to keep the house clean and the family fed. On Mother’s Day, give your mom a break by doing all the cleaning that day. Clean up after each meal, and clean up whenever else it may be needed.


If you treat your mom to a day at the spa or a makeover, surprise her when she gets home by cleaning up the house., Pretend you’re tourists in your own city: go to a museum, take a walk in a forest or park, or see whatever other sights your city has to offer.Present your mom with a few different options or a sample itinerary in the morning, and let her choose.


If you’re doing this one, make sure you have all the details of each option worked out, including prices and hours of operations for any buildings such as museums or aquariums, for example.
As Mother’s Day falls on a Sunday, you want to make sure that your plans for an adventure aren’t foiled by unanticipated closing hours.

, One of the best ways to show your mom how much you appreciate her is to spend quality time with her. This could be having an adventure or taking a class together, or simply grabbing a hot drink to go from a local cafe and then going for a long walk together.


Other examples of quality time include popping popcorn and having a movie or TV series marathon together, or if your mom is into shopping, hitting all the city’s best vintage and antique stores.

, The single most important thing to do on Mother’s Day is to let your mother know that you love and appreciate her. If you can’t be there in person to celebrate your mom, give her a call.


If you’re living overseas, you can also send a card, but a phone call is even more important. If you have an Internet connection and a computer, phone, or tablet with a camera, you can even video chat your mom for free using an app like Skype or Google+ Hangouts.
Chocolate and flower delivery services are also popular. You can order specific arrangements of both flowers and chocolates online and have them delivered to your mom on Mother’s Day. For that matter, you can also just order her a gift at an online retailer.

, There are a lot of things you can do to show your mom you love her without going broke. Set a reasonable budget and stick to it. Your mom wouldn’t want you to spend all your money on her anyway. What’s most important is your love and presence.


If you can’t afford to buy her anything, ask her out for a walk or clean up her house for her. Another neat option is to volunteer for a cause that she believes in.It’s common for people who live far from their families to overcompensate with gifts. If you can’t be with your mom on Mother’s Day, don’t fall into the temptation to spend more than you have., Mother's Day occurs each year on the second Sunday of May in most countries, including the United States, Canada, much of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Africa, and India.


In the UK and Ireland, however, it occurs on the fourth Sunday in Lent, and most Arab countries celebrate it at the Spring Equinox in March., In making plans for Mother’s Day, it’s most important to consider what your mom would like to do. Ensure that whatever plans you make don’t require your mom to do anything. It’s her day to just have fun and relax.


Pay attention to the things your mom says throughout the year so that you can surprise her on Mother’s Day. It’s okay to ask her what she’d like to do, but it would be even better to surprise her by showing you’ve been paying attention. You might even note down things she says she’d like in a secret list on your phone or in a notepad.

, Ensure that your plans and gift ideas work with everyone else’s. The more information you have, the better a decisions you’ll make.


Perhaps your older sister was thinking of taking Mom to the waterpark for the day. You could all pitch in and have a fun afternoon together.
Maybe Dad heard Mom mention how nice a relaxing day at the spa would be. Again, you can all pitch in together to give her a spa day. You might even split up the chores amongst yourselves so that she comes home from the spa to a clean house.

, Once you’ve considered your mom and consulted with your family members, put together a detailed plan for Mother’s Day. You might do this in cooperation with your other family members.


It’s important to make the plan detailed because you don’t want there to be any stress for your mom that day.
For example, if you’re planning to cook a meal, make a grocery list of what you need and write down how long you think it will take to make the meal so that you can have it ready at a suitable time.

, Plan beforehand so that you have all the right ingredients, and make her breakfast depending on what her favorite breakfast foods are.


A fun breakfast idea would be to do a French-themed breakfast with French music, coffee, crepes, and lots of toppings. Nutella and strawberries are a popular sweet filing, and sautéed veggies and cheese are a popular savoury filling.Remember that you’ll need to get up before your mom so that you can surprise her with breakfast.

, Don’t just make her breakfast and then walk away. Make it a family event. Sit down and enjoy the meal together, unless she wants a quiet moment to read the paper or watch her favorite show, in which case, let her do that.

, If you’ve purchased any gifts for your mom, breakfast is a good time to give them to her. Note that you needn’t buy her any physical gifts if you’re short on money. The acts of making her breakfast and planning out a day to celebrate her are gifts too!

, Your mom shouldn’t have to lift a finger today. Tell her to sit and relax or do whatever she wants while you clean up. This step applies to the whole day.

, Whatever you have planned for the rest of the day — whether it be a walk, a trip to the spa, or a coffee date — make sure that you schedule at least 60 to 90 minutes for your mom to get ready.


The last thing you want to do on Mother’s Day is make your mom feel rushed or stressed, so be sure to give her ample time to get ready for anything you have planned.
If your mom usually takes longer to get ready, give her that time, even if it’s 2 hours or more!

, Get a drink to go from a local cafe and then go for a walk. Walk around the seawall or a forest trail if you have those, or even just a nice neighbourhood.


If you don’t drive, try to choose somewhere that doesn’t require your mom to drive you there. If she’s okay with driving, that’s fine, but ideally you don’t want your mom to have to do anything today except enjoy it.

, Schedule a late lunch/early dinner with your family. Invite friends and family over to help celebrate Mother’s Day. If you can, arrange with a family member to set the up the get-together while you're out with your mom so that it’s a surprise.


If you are inviting a lot of people over, make it a potluck, so that everyone brings something to eat along with them. Organize it so that some people bring appetizers, others bring salads and main courses, and others bring desserts.

, Once you get home with your mom from your walk, just relax and enjoy the food and the company of your family and friends. If you want you can bring out a party game ( Charades is a popular choice) and/or put on a nice playlist.


Creating a nice atmosphere for the party will make it even better. Clean the house, light some candles, put some flowers in a vase on the table — do things that make the house look festive.

, Once the party is done, tell your mom that you’ll clean up and encourage her to do whatever she wants. The key is to make sure that the end of her day is relaxing.


Maybe she’ll have a cup of tea and talk to you as you clean, or maybe she’ll go have a bath or sit on the couch and watch her favorite show.

, End the day with telling your mom how much you love her and reiterating how grateful you are to have her in your life.

Ask one of the employees if you're not sure.They may sell chocolate, and if that's the kind of thing your mother likes, buy some! If they have anything fancier than plain bars then all the better. Make sure to take off any price labels from anything you buy though.

, This puts a fresh touch on the traditional gift of a bunch of flowers, and is also quick, easy and doesn't cost anything at all! Go out and look for flowers close to where you live - try not to pick flowers that your mother planted in your garden if you can help it! Go for some pretty and colourful flowers that are not home to a whole host of bugs. Once you've found some, pick them close to the roots and put them in water as soon as possible. You can then bring them back to your house and put them in a pretty pot or vase.

, This time-honoured tradition is a lovely gesture and will really start off your mother's day well. Sneak into her room about the time she normally gets up and insist she stays in bed for a while, for you have made her breakfast! Include any favourite breakfast foods she may have and set the meal out creatively. Don't forget to bring her up something to drink like coffee or juice. Some more traditional breakfast foods include things like oatmeal, muesli, eggs, toast, etc. but don't be afraid to try something a little more exciting and adventurous - breakfast doesn't have to be a chore! Here are some ideas that are brilliant:


Cinnamon rolls
Breakfast burritos
Bagels
Traditional full English breakfast
Doughnuts
Breakfast parfaits
French toast
Mini breakfast pizzas
Pancakes
Breakfast cookies

Waffles.

, This will really relieve her burden and allow her to relax for the day. Are there some things she normally does around the house, like washing the dishes, cleaning, tidying, etc.? Why not try doing them yourself for the day. It won't take too long and it will really please your mother that you've thought about how much work she has to do. Cleaning your house is an especially good one to do, as when your mother gets out of bed, she won't believe her eyes!

, You can announce to your mother in the morning that you will cook her an evening meal... and then you will have the whole day to buy ingredients if you need to and to figure out what on earth you will actually cook for her! If you are young, try to enlist the help of an older sibling or another adult. Choose a main meal, a sweet dessert (and a starter, if you feel up to it) to cook her. If she has a favourite food, that's a good place to start!

Find a gift that matches her interests.,
Personalize a homemade gift for her.,
Let her choose her own gifts.,
Write her a poem or song.",How to Choose a Mother's Day Gift for Your Wife1," Store-bought gifts are easy to tailor to your wife as a person. You can get her a pretty piece of jewelry, but also consider deeper interests. For example, if she likes reading, you can get her an electronic reader such as a Kindle. You can also assemble a basket with a bunch of new, bestselling books or her favorite movies., Crafts require effort and show that you care. Make something that she’ll wear or display, such as a bracelet or a photo calendar. A photo calendar, for example, can be made at a craft store or print shop. You can include pictures of pets, children, or other meaningful images.


Remember, it’s the thought that counts, so don’t be afraid to try. Get creative., Instead of selecting what you think she’ll like, get her a gift card to her favorite store. This way, she can enjoy shopping and choosing something she truly wants. You can also go along and spend time with her while she shops.


A gift card to an online service such as Amazon or iTunes can also work, but this may feel more impersonal.

, A card is one way to express your appreciation, but you can make it more impactful. Writing something is a challenge, but it doesn’t have to be a literary masterpiece. Instead, express your sentiments through your writing, perhaps recalling experiences you’ve had together. Perform your work for her on Mother’s Day.

Go out for a fun experience.,
Pamper her with a massage.,
Make reservations at a restaurant.,
Take a trip.",How to Choose a Mother's Day Gift for Your Wife2," Surprise her with an an activity she’d like to try. You can dress up and take her to the theater or go out dancing with her. Alternatively, you can sign up for an art or cooking class. While you can let her go alone, you can also accompany her and have a memorable evening together.For classes and other scheduled events, check her schedule to make sure there isn’t a time conflict such as work that would prevent her from going.
Look at the refund policy on any tickets or class sessions you purchase. This may help you get your money back in case she cannot attend or wishes to quit a recurrent class.

, Relaxation is a positive gift during Mother’s Day. Get her an appointment for a manicure or a massage, if you think she’d like it. These ideas will get her out of the house and into the hands of a professional, where she can let go of stress and feel good.This can also be done at home. If you don’t typically give massages, surprising her with one can be part of a gift of spending time together.

, A night at a fancy restaurant or bar is another common gift idea. You don’t have to go someplace expensive, however. Try her favorite place or go somewhere meaningful to the two of you, such as where you went on a first date. Relax, reconnect, and have a romantic night together.


For Mother’s Day, you can always hire a babysitter to watch the kids, but you may also bring the kids with you and celebrate as a family.

, Perhaps Mother’s Day is an opportunity to leave town for a weekend and reconnect with your wife. Go online and find a flight that fits your budget. You can take a vacation abroad or simply drive out of town and spend time together in a different environment. The gesture will appear spontaneous and romantic."

Cook for her.,
Take care of her responsibilities.,
Let her rest.,
Get her maid service.",How to Choose a Mother's Day Gift for Your Wife3," Before she wakes up in the morning, you can make her breakfast and serve it in bed. Children can also help out by mixing ingredients and serving. Later on, you can make her dinner or dessert. Try surprising her with her favorite food or make a new recipe you think she’ll enjoy., Consider what your wife does around the house. For Mother’s Day, at least, tell her you’ll take care of her chores. If she is the person who handles the dishes in your home, take over for her. Assure her she won’t have to work at all this Mother’s Day.


You can also give her an IOU on this. Make a slip that she can turn in on some days where she’d rather relax. Pick up her chores on those days throughout the year.

, This sounds like a strange idea, but many wives do enjoy a peaceful day without stress. Draw her a warm bath, light some candles, and leave a fluffy robe. Take the kids out for the day. Let her spend the day in bed without having to worry about work or children. You can couple this with another gift, such as personal care items or a box set of her favorite show.Instead of leaving her alone, you can spend time together but still allow her to choose what to do during the day.

, Rather than take care of her household responsibilities for one day, consider doing it throughout the year. Professional maids can be hired for a day or for regular cleaning. Your wife will have less responsibilities to stress her.

That way, you can incorporate what's on sale into your menus, so you save money and you and your family can eat better.If you don't get your grocery stores' ads in the mail, try looking online to find the ads for the places you shop at most.;
, Once you figure out what's on sale, compare that to recipes you normally fix. Of course, you can try out something new once in awhile, but when you're fixing something new, you're not likely to have dinner on the table in 30 minutes.Add meal planning to your schedule so you don't try to skip it.

, That is, to keep things simple, you don't have to try a new recipe every night or even every week. If you want, you can assign one thing to each day of the week, such as ""salad Mondays, taco Tuesdays, etc."" You can even take it a step farther and assign a specific recipe to each day of the week, such as ""tuna salad Mondays, beef taco Tuesdays."" As long as they're recipes you and your family like, it shouldn't be a problem. You can get a little crazier on the weekends when you have more time.Plus, sticking to recipes you know means you'll become an expert at them, and you can have dinner on the table in record time.
You don't have to keep the same five recipes all year. Try changing them out by season, for instance.
Make sure to pick recipes that are different from one another so that you don't get sick of them.

, Of course, no one is going to agree on every meal every time. However, asking for some family input gives them some control, meaning they are more likely to eat what you fix. See what suggestions your family has for meals, and take them into account when planning., Create a list based on the meals you've planned. Make sure you have everything you need to make the meals, including condiments and pantry staples, such as ketchup, rice, and pasta. It's best to check your cupboards before going shopping., Once you're organized, you only need to go shopping once a week, usually. Therefore, you have everything you need on hand each night, and you don't need to run out for extra ingredients. Pick up the things on your list, but don't be afraid to substitute if you see a better deal., If possible, spend some time on the weekend to wash and chop veggies ahead of time. Alternatively, if you're chopping half an onion for one dinner, chop the rest of it for a dinner later that week. Doing some prep work ahead of time helps you get dinner on the table faster during the week.Alternatively, you can buy fresh or frozen vegetables that are already chopped for you, saving you time.

, To save time during the week, premix your spices on the weekend. If it's a dish you make all the time, you can even just make a special jar of seasoning for that dish, ready to go for the weeks ahead.Use small baggies or empty spice jars to hold the mixtures.

, Cooking a few ingredients on the weekend can help you save time during the week. For instance, if you know you're going to make several dishes that need rice (chicken and rice, then fried rice), cook a big batch on Sunday for the rest of the week. Alternatively, if several dishes take sauteed onions, go ahead and saute an onion or two up for the week.You can also cook other whole grains and beans ahead, such as barley, lentils, black beans, or quinoa. Most of them even freeze well, so you can make a really large batch and save smaller portions for later., Another good option to keep you full and healthy throughout the week is to make a big batch of roasted vegetables over the weekend. You could do all root and starchy vegetables, like carrots, parsnips, beets, sweet potatoes, and butternut squash, or you could a mixture of greener varieties, such as broccoli, cauliflower, onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers.All you need to do is spray a roasting pan with cooking spray. Chop the veggies into about 1-inch pieces. The specific size doesn't matter as much as the pieces being roughly the same size. Drizzle with oil, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and your favorite seasonings. Cook at 425 Fahrenheit (218 Celsius).
Turn them at 15 minutes, though some vegetables may take as long as an hour to cook, depending on how many you have in the oven.

, If you have time, you can also cook and freeze whole meals ahead of time. Soups, for instance, do well in this capacity, such as beef stew. You can make a big batch and then freeze it into smaller batches. You can also make a double batch of a casserole, one to eat and one to freeze for later. When you need to use your freeze-ahead meal, you can thaw it in the refrigerator overnight, thaw it in the microwave, or in some cases (such as casseroles), cook it from frozen.

, If you know you're going to be using the oven, go ahead and turn it on when you come in the house. That way, it will be ready as soon as you're ready to heat something up, and it gives you a few minutes to prepare., Items like cooked rotisserie chickens often aren't that much more expensive than raw chicken. You can serve the chicken as is or pull off the meat from it to use in casseroles, soups, stir fries, salads, and more.Other options include pre-cooked shrimp or pre-cooked grilled chicken strips, both found in the frozen and/or fresh sections.

, The meat in your meal often takes longer to cook than anything else. Therefore, skipping the meat on some nights can help you save some time. For example, try using canned beans for protein or cook up a dish like an omelet with eggs., Your microwave can help increase your cooking speed immensely. You can defrost foods to help them cook faster, for instance. You can also nuke foods for a few minutes to give them a head start before you finish cooking them another way., If you pick foods that take less time to prep, you can get dinner out faster. For example, try using the bagged and washed spinach to add to meals. Whole potatoes and sweet potatoes are also fairly fast because all you need to do is wash them and prick them, and then you can cook them in the microwave., You probably already used jarred sauces like spaghetti sauce. However, other sauces can also do a lot to bring a meal together. For instance, add teriyaki sauce to chicken and vegetables to make a stir fry or use pesto to spice up baked chicken breasts or pastas. There's a wide variety of sauces out there now; you just have to find the ones you like.Another option is to make batches of sauce yourself over the weekend. You can use them up over the week or freeze or can portions for later., A dirty kitchen is a deterrent for making dinner. Plus, it slows you down exponentially. Make sure to clean up after yourself each night so you can start fresh the next day. Your future self will definitely thank you., Fish is one of the faster cooking proteins. Because fish fillets are so thin, they can cook in minutes, particularly in a pan. Plus, fish is a healthy, lean protein. Add a simple side, and you have a meal.You can even bake fish fillets with vegetables, though you'll likely need to give the vegetables a head start.

, There's always going to be a night when your dinner needs to be faster than 30 minutes, and you can make that happen. Simple sandwiches, grilled paninis, and turkey burgers all make for fast, delicious meals., Breakfast foods are often meant to cook a lot faster than dinner foods. For instance, scrambled eggs and toast make a delicious dinner, particularly if you add a bit of sauteed spinach to the eggs. You could also go for a bit more sugar with pancake night., Some nights, you just might not make it around to cooking. Try having some foods on hand that literally take no effort, such as canned soups, frozen entrees, or frozen pizza. You can also prepare for the week ahead by making something like chicken salad to keep in the fridge.Other good options to have on hand are canned proteins, such as tuna, mussels, sardines, or beans.

, Pasta can make a very quick dinner, and it can even be healthy if you stick to the whole wheat variety. Incorporate some frozen vegetables and some pesto, and you have a quick, nutritious meal., Once you have a main dish, you don't need to go super fancy on your sides. Create a simple salad with pre-washed spinach leaves, dressing, whole grapes, and a sprinkle of sliced almonds. Wash whole fruits like raspberries and blueberries and serve them with a dollop of yogurt. Buy the frozen vegetables that allow you to steam them in the bag, and serve one as a side."

Maintain moisture.",How to Care for a Living Christmas Tree," Living Christmas trees should not be kept indoors for more than 7-10 days at most., Slowly bring your tree indoors so as not to shock an outdoor tree by exposing it to warm indoor temperatures. The warm temperature will encourage tree growth which is to be avoided.Transition your living tree by first moving it to a garage or enclosed porch before bringing it indoors.

, Before moving the living tree into your house, you want to ensure you’re not bringing any other living creatures with you.

, During the transition time, it’s important to ensure that your tree is still receiving moisture. Soak the rootball so that the soil around the tree is always moist but not overly wet or drowning., This spray will prevent the needles of the tree from dropping and help your tree to maintain moisture.Anti-desiccant and anti-wilt products can be found under the names Wilt-Pruf or Cloud-Cover.” To use, shake the bottle well. Spray the tops and bottoms of the leaves and needles of your tree. Allow the spray to dry outdoors for several hours. One application of spray will last for three to four months. Please see the label of your specific anti-desiccant or anti-wilt spray for detailed directions.

, Keep your tree in as cool a spot as possible away from any heaters, radiators or direct sunlight.

, In order to protect your living tree, use LED lights that don’t give off heat and hang lighter ornaments that won’t weigh down or damage your tree., Continually water your living tree while it is indoors so it doesn’t dry out. If the tree dries out, it may be unable to recover.Check the water level in your tree’s basin regularly.If the root ball of your tree is wrapped in burlap, place the root ball in a tub. Add mulch on top of the root ball to help increase moisture.Ensure there is 1-2” of water at the bottom of your tub or container. Any more than that may drown the roots.To add more moisture, use a spray bottle to spray water onto the leaves and branches of the tree. Be careful when spraying near lights or ornaments.
As an alternative to adding water, you can place crushed ice overtop your tree’s root ball.

, Before planting it’s important to consider if your tree will be able to successfully grow in your area.


Check if your tree is suitable and able to thrive in your area’s climate.Determine if your space can accommodate the full grown height and width of your tree.
Ensure your space is protected from high winds and that it receives adequate sunlight.

, If frozen soil is an issue in your area, be sure to dig the hole for your tree early in the winter before the ground freezes over.Dig a hole about four to five times the size of your tree’s root ball in diameter and slightly shallower than the root ball in depth., Livings trees that spend more than 7-10 days indoors may lose hardiness and be unable to thrive once replanted.

, Just as you acclimated your tree to indoor temperatures, you must do the same when preparing to bring it back outdoors. Spend about a week slowly transitioning your tree from inside your home to outside using your garage or enclosed porch.During this period, keep your tree away from high winds, direct sunlight and warm areas.

, Only natural burlap or biodegradable containers are safe to be planted. Treated burlap, nylon or plastic containers must be removed.If after removing the covering your tree’s roots are bound tightly together, gently break up the massed roots on the outer layer of the root ball.

, Plant your tree slightly higher than the surrounding soil to help with drainage.If the area where you plan to replant your tree is still frozen, you will need to wait for it to thaw before replanting. Keep your tree in a sheltered spot outdoors until the soil is thawed.

, Level the soil to the top of the tree’s roots. Spread 2-3” of mulch over top of the area.

, During the replanting process, your tree will still need water. If your area is dry in the winter, you may need to continue watering your tree once it is replanted. Monitor the soil to determine if your tree needs additional moisture or not.Do not add fertilizer to your tree’s soil until the spring. In the first year after replanting, be careful not to add too much fertilizer as the roots are not fully established yet."

Arrive at a store that is selling artificial Christmas trees.,
Choose your artificial Christmas tree.,
Bring the box containing the exact tree you've intended to purchase up to the register.,
Check-out with your tree-purchase.,
Take the tree to your car for the ride to the next store or home.",How to Buy an Artificial Christmas Tree," Most superstores and supermarkets (i.e. Walmart or Super Kmart), carry these, along with some local, regional/national hardware stores, so be on the lookout. The department store Sears in most malls sells artificial Christmas trees from Thanksgiving onwards, so be on the lookout there too.


Look for signs in each store's window listing ""artificial Christmas trees"" for sale. While some displays are more elaborate and varied than others, your best bet is to go in to a store that has several types along with a few that are physically on display from some of the trees they sell.;
, Look for quality along with the tree's overall size and whether or not you want it to be pre-lit or not. If you want lights of the tree, make sure that the wire matches the tree's color and that the bulbs are a nice color.

, If it's too heavy, then you can get help from a salesperson.

, Pay for the tree.

, You can easily slip most artificial Christmas tree in a car trunk or on the back seat of a car (assuming no other infant seats are taking up some of the room - otherwise, you can place it on the floor mats behind the passenger or driver's seat and out and away from the car seat).

, Take a close look at the tree, and make sure there aren't any bald spots or enlarged branches that you missed.

, The back is just as important as the front!

, Fill it up if needed. If it's not, you can begin decorating!

Remove all decorations from the tree.,
Check with your local yard waste management department.,
Contact your local sanitation or waste management department.,
Check local recycling centers.,
Drop your tree off at a tree collecting non-profit organization.,
Search for paid pickup services.,
Check with local fire stations for drop off options.",How to Dispose of a Christmas Tree1," Before you dispose your tree, you have to remove all decorations and trappings on the tree. This includes any tree skirts, ornaments, lights, garland, tinsel, and ornament hooks.Once your tree is back to its natural state, consider putting a large tree bag over the tree to keep everything contained until you figure out how you’re going to dispose it.


It’s better to not let your tree get too dry before you dispose it. That’s because dry trees are fire hazards, since they burn so quickly.Dry trees are also more of a hassle to clean up since dead pine needles fall off more readily.;
, Some communities provide specific yard waste pickup services along with normal garbage pickup services. If you live in a community that provides this yard waste service, call or check online to find out the details about their Christmas tree pickup service., Some waste management units will offer Christmas tree pickup services during normal collection schedules or a couple weeks following the Christmas season.Call or search online to contact your local waste management unit and ask about their practices and policies regarding Christmas tree collection.


Oftentimes, curbside pickup is available, where all you have to do is leave your tree on your curb, or where your garbage is collected. When trees are collected, they are often chopped down and chipped into mulch.This mulch sometimes goes to enhance public areas, but it’s a possibility that you may be able to pick up some mulch for your own gardening needs.

, Most recycling centers offer Christmas tree drop off services, where you can bring and leave your tree to be recycled.This is similar to the services your local waste management unit may provide, but not all communities have that waste management pickup option. To see services provided by local recycling centers, simply call or search online for further details.


Most times, Christmas trees will be chipped into mulch (which again, you can most likely take home with you) that is normally used for public outdoor areas, parks, or erosion barriers for various water shorelines., Search online and call some local non-profit organizations to inquire about any Christmas tree collecting initiatives. Some common organizations that hold collection programs are home department stores and certain boy and girl scouts chapters, but more options can be found online.Usually these services are free, but even though these are non-profit organizations, a small donation may sometimes be encouraged., There are some companies that specialize in delivering Christmas trees for the holiday season, but there are also some companies that can pick up your tree once you’re finished with it.Search the internet for local companies that can stop by and take your tree away for you. Sometimes, the companies that deliver the Christmas trees also have a pickup service.


The pickup fee is usually based on the size of the tree., In some areas, local fire stations accept dropped off Christmas trees after the holiday season.The drop off period can extend a few weeks into the New Year. Normally, the trees accepted get sent to be mulched and recycled.Any trees that are dropped off, need to be in their original state without decorations and ornaments.

Craft some felt ornaments for your tree.,
Upcycle CDs into Christmas decorations.,

Make decorations from pine cones.Store bought decorations often use pine cones and cranberries.,
String popcorn and cranberries to make a natural garland.,
Create an elegant look with ribbons and lace.,
Add paper ornaments to cord to make a paper garland.",How to Decorate Your Christmas Tree on a Budget1," Trace a holiday themed pattern on a piece of white paper. Transfer this pattern twice onto felt with a fabric pen or other writing utensil. Cut out the two patterns with scissors and sew them together. Add a loop of thread to the top for hanging your felt ornament.


You can add personal designs to your felt ornaments to make them more appealing. Add things like sequins, beads, and so on to the felt with glue.
Using markers, you can draw designs on your felt ornaments, like snowmen, reindeer, elves and so on. If you have trouble drawing freehand, try using a stencil.
If you're not much of a sewer, you can simplify the ornament so it is made of a single piece of felt, instead of two pieces sewn together.
You can give your ornament more contour and shape by sewing most of the two felt pieces together, and inserting stuffing into the space between the felt pieces. Then finish sewing the felt pieces together.;
, Old Christmas CDs that you don't use anymore only need a piece of string through the hole in their middle. Hang this on your tree as a nostalgic ornament.You can add things to your CDs to make them ever more festive. For example, you might cut out letters from magazines and glue these to your CD decorations to express Christmas messages, like, ""Merry Christmas"" or ""Let it Snow"".
On some CDs, you may be able to use a felt tipped permanent marker to draw designs, like Santa, snowflakes, or candy canes on it. Use different colored markers to make your ornament more festive.

, This inexpensive decoration is great for young kids who like drawing. Gather together three to six crayons that are the same length. Align them so their ends are even. Then:


Use a piece of decorative ribbon or string to fasten all the crayons together in a bundle. Create an end loop in your ribbon for hanging the ornament.
If the crayons don't fasten well, use glue to help hold them together. You may need to hold the crayons together firmly for a few minutes while the glue sets.
Apply a thin layer of glue to the outside of the crayons. Sprinkle glitter, sequins, and similar accents onto the glue to add some glamour to your ornament.

, Spray paint pine cones with metallic gold or silver spray paint and then tie a string around them for hanging. Hang the pine cones on your tree and enjoy the refined, yet natural, look.


By adding a light dusting of glitter to your pine cones, you can make it appear as though they are covered in ice or a thin layer of snow.

, Take a needle and a piece of durable thread, like nylon or waxed cotton, and thread the needle. Make a simple, thick knot at the end of the string opposite your needle. Then:


Use the needle to thread air-popped popcorn and cranberries on the thread. When you are finished stringing the popcorn and cranberries, tie off the needle end of the string and hang your popcorn/cranberry garland on your tree., Ribbons and lace can be relatively inexpensive, but these will add a refined atmosphere to your tree. What's more, you might have lace or ribbon leftover from prior crafts, decorations, or projects that you can use.


Take your ribbon or lace and cut it into strips about the length of your arm. Then tie the fabric in an elegant bow.
You can make the decorative bows smaller, which will allow you to fit more of them on the branches of your tree, by decreasing the length of the strips of ribbon/lace.
Use hot glue to add decorations to your bow. You might add a small pine cone, a small evergreen branch, cranberries, mistletoe, and so on., You can use any kind of paper for making this kind of garland, though colored paper might look the most festive. Draw circular shapes on your paper in assorted sizes. Cut the circles free with scissors. Then use tape to fasten a piece of string for hanging to the paper ornament.


You could also punch a small hole in your paper ornament and feed your string through the hole for hanging the paper decoration.
These paper circles will give the appearance of ornaments, though they're much less expensive.
To make your paper ornaments look the most authentic, you might want to add holiday designs to your ornaments with markers."

Acquire a Christmas tree.,
Place the tree at the child's height at first.

,
Decorate the tree with lights and some popcorn or cranberry strands.,
Have your children create a paper chain that can be hung on their tree.

,
Allow your children to collect things that can be used as ornaments that can be hung on their tree.,
Attach these ""ornaments"" to the tree, with the help of the children.,
Attach a few strands of gold or silvery garland to the tree if your children can be trusted to not eat anything they find laying on the floor.,
Attach a tree topper to the top of the tree.,
Move the tree to a better-suited area, or until the tree is away from the child's hands, but is still in pluggable reach of an electrical outlet.",How to Decorate a Kids Themed Christmas Tree," Whether the tree is real or artificial won't really matter. However, if your kids are allergic to pine or spruce, go with the artificial tree.;
,, Children love to help with these strands, though you might be needed to help with the lights to ensure the kids don't get hurt in the process. But let them make some of the choices of whether it would be best to move around clockwise or counterclockwise or further up versus further down than what you've decided. Listen to the kids choices, unless their choices would potentially hurt other innocent people.


For Christmas lights, start with the end that doesn't contain the electrical plug first. Wrap that around the tree-topper area and decorate downward until the lights run out or it reaches the bottom.

You can connect additional strands of lights to the tree until you get to the bottom, but don't overdo it if you are coming close to finishing, as you should use an extension electrical cord instead.


For popcorn strands, let them help set these up completely by themselves, though be around to ensure they don't try to taste-test them in the process.(Popcorn always looks inviting to any child whether or not it's been freshly prepared or not!)

,, Keychains or costume jewelry are a great start, though you can follow up with additional small mementos that your children won't mind destroying if you had to place something through them. (Although that miniature tool from a toolbox wouldn't be too devastating to a child who doesn't mind building, asking your kids to give up a sports card to poke a hole later could be both emotionally and financially disastrous.)

, Get them to hang on the tree without overdoing the amount of weight on each branch. Hang heavier ornaments on the bottom, and lighter ornaments on top.

, If they can't, you have to give it up in lieu of safety.

, If they can give up a small-to-medium size stuffed animal, you can use this animal. If you must use a real Christmas tree topper (or have an extra unneeded few lights from the Christmas light strand, make sure the light that was placed around the treetop can't catch the stuffed animal on fire. Bend the wire away from the bear or untie this section of lights from that area of the tree., Place it on a nightstand or other place away from their hands where only you (as the adult) can be responsible for it's operation (yet still allowing them to see it sparkle throughout the day)."

Convert your tree into a bird feeder.,
Donate your tree to the local forest preserve.,
Do arts and crafts with leftover pieces.",How to Dispose of a Christmas Tree2," Secure your tree in your backyard for birds and other creatures to use as a feeding spot.Your leftover Christmas tree could also provide small animals with shelter.


After some months, the tree will be bare and brittle enough to be chopped up in a wood chipper, where the pieces can later be used for mulch., Some forest preserves accept Christmas trees after the holidays. Donated trees are sometimes used for mulch around natural areas, planted for artificial habitat, or used in bodies of water as fish structures.Since most of the bodies of water and lakes in forest preserves are man made, fish don’t have structures to hide from predators at the bottom of the lake.The Christmas trees at the bottom of the lake help diversify the aquatic ecosystems within the forest preserve.

, Cut off some of the more hydrated branches of the tree, and bind them into a wreath that can be hung on your door, used as a winter centerpiece, or wrapped around the bottom of candles.If you have an essential oil extractor, you can try to extract the oils and scents from the pine needles to make a wintery air freshener."

Remove all decorations from the tree.,
Cut the tree into smaller sections.,
Set out the tree for collection.",How to Dispose of a Christmas Tree3," Before your tree can be thrown out, all ornaments, garland, tinsel, lights, and other decorations must be removed.When the tree is back to it’s original and natural state, you can bring the tree outside.


Try to get rid of your tree before it starts to get really dry. Dry Christmas trees shed pine needles everywhere, but they’re also dangerous because they are highly flammable., Cut your tree into smaller pieces. These tree portions normally need to be into pieces at most, four feet long.This makes for easier pickup for the people who come to collect your trash.

, If you’re community doesn’t have a recycling waste system or a yard waste system, you can dispose of your tree as you would with your normal trash. When your tree has been cut down into smaller pieces, place the pieces into your yard waste bin, recycling bin, or garbage bin.Usually, the bin lid has to be able to completely close with the tree inside.


There are some communities where you may be charged a fee for not recycling your Christmas tree, so keep that in mind along with other options of disposing your tree."

Purchase decorations for cheap after the holidays.,
Search for decorations at garage and rummage sales.,
Find inexpensive decorations at suitable stores.,
Buy an artificial tree in a bold color.",How to Decorate Your Christmas Tree on a Budget2," Stores stock up on holiday themed items throughout the holiday season. These, however, are less salable after Christmas has passed. Stores often sell decorations after the holidays on clearance.


This technique requires a little bit of foreknowledge. But if you suspect next year might require a stricter budget, wait until this year's holidays are over, and buy some ornaments on the cheap.

, Garage and rummage sales are generally a spring or summertime affair, but many families use these sales to offload old or unwanted decorations. These are often priced incredibly low, and are a great place to get traditional ornaments at a reduced cost.

, Many holiday decorations find their way to secondhand or thrift stores and are sold for a fraction of the original cost. Especially during the holiday season, it's likely that these stores will put out Christmas decorations, which you can hunt through to find suitable pieces for your tree.


Another popular location for inexpensive decorations is your local dollar store. You may want to visit a few different stores, since they'll likely carry different items in stock. This way, you'll have a wide selection to choose from.

, Natural trees can add a considerable expense to your holidays. Add to that the fact that you'll have to buy a new natural tree every year, and natural trees can really strain your budget. Artificial trees can be found at most general retailers.


When choosing an artificial tree, choose a bold color, like white, red, magenta, or turquoise. These colors will add pop to your holiday decor.
Bold colored artificial trees will make a big impact. This means you can buy a smaller artificial tree, which are generally less expensive than larger ones."

Incorporate your children's toys in your decorations.,
Create a winter wonderland theme.,
Rely on a Christmas color scheme.",How to Decorate Your Christmas Tree on a Budget3," By using your children's toys as the theme for your decorations, you can make your kids feel like they're contributing to the holiday. You could even get out some of your own childhood toys to use as ornaments.


Use a loop of string, fishing line, or a similar material and tie it around the childhood toys you're using as an ornament so you can hang them easily.
Classic, visually appealing childhood toys, like pinwheels, plastic train models, and similar items, work well for tree decorations.
By using your childhood toys as ornaments, you'll have a great conversation piece in full view. Such decorations are great for connecting with your children or with guests., This kind of theme utilizes white and silver colors, which can cut down on costs. Color printing or colored prints typically cost more than those that are blank. You can easily make winter themed decorations with white paper or similar material by:



Making a 3D paper snowflake.

Making a kirigami snowflake.
Decorating your tree with tinsel to make it appear your tree is covered in snow.

Making a snowman decoration with cotton balls and a toilet paper roll.

, Red and green are the classic colors for Christmas. This theme is easy to replicate with construction paper. For example, you could cut narrow strips of paper from the construction paper, then use tape to connect the ends of the strips to make connecting links with the construction paper. Connect the links together to make a chain and hang this on your tree.


Add some white to your red and green color scheme to give the impression of snow. Use tinsel, imitation snow, and so on to achieve this effect.

Done.",How to Decorate Your Christmas Tree (for Kids)," Spread out all the branches on the Christmas tree. The should be spaced evenly, to make it easier to hang the decorations without them touching each other.;
, Place these out on a nearby couch, chair, or strong durable pillow, in readiness for hanging.

, Make lines of short hooks on one side, and long hooks on another side. Don't put them on your floor or carpet, because they are hard to find. (If you don't have ornament hooks, you can bend paper clips to make or replace them.)

, Uncurl them from their storage packaging. Test them to see that they still work by plugging them in and turning them on; ask an adult to help here. If any don't work, get help replacing the non-working lights.

, You might need help with this step. Wind them around the tree, taking care to sit them evenly so that they cascade down the tree neatly. Place the power cord at the back of the tree and the plug near the outlet. If possible, tuck away any extra cord length, to prevent people or pets from tripping over it (use a cord tidy)., Put them on the bottom if they are heavy. It helps to put unbreakable ornaments on the bottom because if they fall off the Christmas tree they are less likely to shake the breakable ornaments off.


Use hooks if the ornaments don't have a string to hang itself by. (If the string breaks off, bend a hook around the top where the hanger/part where it's supposed to be hung. Leave a tiny space. Then get another hook and put the hook through the tiny space. Pinch the end closed.)







,,


For example: If there is an ornament you have that has a picture of you when you were five years old, put it in the back of your Christmas tree. If you have an ornament that is glass and that is sparkly without fingerprints, photos, drawings, etc., then put it toward the front.







, A stocking is a good, cute ornament, too.

, After you are done putting on all your ornaments, make sure there are no empty spaces. If there are, fill them in with ornaments. If you are out of ornaments, buy some or make some new ones.

, When you are positive there are no gaps left and your tree is pretty and perfect, put your star or angel on the top of the tree.

, Thread it around the tree where there are small spaces, taking care not to cover up the decorations. Finally, if you're using a tree skirt, add it now., Take a photo of your handiwork and share it online."

Shape the tree late in the growing season, preferably from late May to early August, depending on your particular region.,
Use good quality, sharp bypass hand pruners.,
Shape the sides of the tree to a pleasing triangular shape.",How to Shape a Living Pine Tree,";
, Cut the tree's very top tip - called the leader - back less than halfway but at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) at a 45 degree angle. Because the leader controls the growth hormone, trimming the leader a few inches every year promotes fuller growth.

, Use an imaginary line from the top to the ground at a 60 to 70 degree angle. Any branches that protrude past that line should be trimmed back.

Provide a home for the birds.,
Cut the branches off and:



Lay them over perennials in your garden.,
Use the trunk to make teepees to grow beans on, rustic fences, and as supports for shade covers and floating row covers.

",How to Use Your Christmas Tree in the Garden," Place your tree, stand and all, out in the yard. Be sure to remove the decorations! Birds will find the tree and use it as shelter during the winter months. In spring, once the birds don’t need it anymore, either chip it up or lay it on its side in a part of your yard where it can serve as a brush pile for other backyard wildlife.;
, This will provide protection from temperature fluctuations and prevent the plants from heaving out of the soil.

Use them at the base of a fresh compost pile. Having coarser materials, like tree branches, at the bottom of the pile helps increase air flow to the pile.

Use them to mulch your beds or garden paths. Cut them up into smaller pieces first.

Trim the top of the tree.,
Shape the rest of the branches.,
Stand your tree in a tree stand.,
Keep your tree stand full of water.,
Place the tree near an outlet and away from heat.,
String up lights.,
Wrap a garland around the tree.,
Hang your ornaments.",How to Trim a Christmas Tree," Pick out the best candidate for a Christmas tree from whatever options you have available.


Look out for one that looks full, has an even shape, and has the fewest dead or missing branches.
If the tree is pre-cut, have someone hold it up for you so you can walk around and observe the shape and quality from all angles.;
, Measure ahead of time to find out the height of the ceiling where you plan to put your Christmas tree. Take along a tape measure to observe and compare the height of the tree.


Note that you will also be adding the height of your tree stand to the total height. Measure the height of your stand ahead of time and factor it into your calculations.You will be able to trim off some height from the trunk of a Christmas tree, but don’t plan on dramatically shortening a tall tree to make it fit in your home. It may be too difficult or impossible to saw off a large portion of the tree.

, Measure the approximate width of the area that you plan to put your Christmas tree so you can find a tree of an equal or lesser width.


Note that the branches of a pre-cut tree that has been wrapped or stored against other trees will unfold with time and expand the width of the tree.
Take into account the extra width that tree lights and decorations will add later.

, Trim the base of the tree trunk once you take it home. Use a handsaw or chainsaw to remove at least half an inch off the end.If you get your tree from a nursery or store, staff may be able to trim the trunk of the tree for you when you purchase it. Just make sure you are able to get the tree into water shortly thereafter.
If you want to shorten the tree slightly to fit the height of your ceiling, cut off a larger portion of the trunk. Just remember that you will likely need a decent section of the trunk clear of branches to fit it into a tree stand.
Trimming the trunk is essential to the tree absorbing water and staying fresh, so make sure you cut off at least a half inch even if you don’t need to alter the height at all.

, Cut off any branches of the tree that appear dead, discolored, or overly dry.


Make sure that you are not removing so many branches that there will be large chunks of the tree missing when you’re done. If a tree looks like it has a lot of dry or dead branches to begin with, don’t buy it.
Test dry branches by gentling shaking them and observing how many needles fall off; if more than half, the branch is probably too dry. Also bend needles in half; they should snap if from a fir tree and not break at all if from a pine.Use pruning shears, hedge clippers, or a shearing knife to remove any branches., Locate the most central, vertical branch at the top of your tree and trim it to about 10 inches if it is any longer.The top center branch is important to keep and trim to a sturdy length so you can use it as a support for a tree topper, like a star or angel, if you choose to decorate with one.
Remove any other longer branches that appear to be competing for the center branch.

, Trim the ends of any branches that stick out from the overall shape of the tree, keeping it a generally uniform cone shape, or however you want your tree to look.


In general, for the classic look, you’ll want the base of the branches to be widest with the circumference getting gradually smaller as you go up to the top, which ends in a tapered point.
The ideal proportion for most Christmas trees is a “two-thirds taper,” which means that the base of the three is two-thirds as wide as the height. So, a six-foot-tall tree would ideally have a four-foot-wide base.Try to cut as little of the branches as possible, sticking to the lighter green new growth. Don’t cut into the old growth (which is characterized by a darker green color, usually) unless you have to., Place your tree upright in a tree stand that can hold about a gallon of water.


Avoid shaving the bark off of a tree trunk to get it to fit into a smaller tree stand opening. You want to leave on the outer layers of wood, which are the most efficient in taking up water.Use a tree skirt to cover up the tree stand and create a visually appealing place to put presents. Just remember to lift the skirt up periodically to check and fill the water.

, Fill the water trough of your tree stand right away and keep it full at all times with clean, fresh water.


A good indication of how much water your tree needs is to measure the diameter of the trunk at its base. The number of inches is the same number of quarts that should be available to your tree in the tree stand.If your tree doesn’t get enough water after being cut, it will form a seal of sap over the cut end, which you will need to cut off to allow it to absorb more water. Try to place your tree in water as soon as possible after it is cut.
Despite some common theories, adding sugary drinks or any other substance to the water in the tree stand does not help the tree to maintain its freshness. Always fill with clean, pure water., Choose a location to display your tree that is close to a wall outlet so that you can easily plug in a string of lights. Keep it away from fireplaces or other areas of high heat to avoid a fire hazard and premature drying.


You can also lower the temperature of the room that the tree is in to help keep it from drying out as quickly. The branches will dry more and the water will be taken up and evaporate quicker in high heat.If you can’t place a tree near a power outlet, try using an extension cord with a power strip. This will also act as a safety and convenience feature, as you can easily turn off Christmas tree lights once you’ve put them on the tree by using the on/off switch on the power strip.

, Choose the color, size, and length of the lights you want to wrap around your Christmas tree. Determine the ideal length you’ll need by taking a couple measurements of the tree’s circumference with flexible measuring tape.


Try opting for a longer string than you think you need, or multiple strings, as the tree will look best with lights weaved into the inside of the tree, not just the outside branches. A good rule is to have a string of 100 lights for every vertical foot of the tree.You can mix and match colors and styles of lights on the same tree. Try smaller traditional incandescent lights in multi-color along with a string of larger white globe lights, for example, to add variety to your tree.

, Hang a garland of beads, ribbon, or foil on your tree by loosely draping it over the branches from top to bottom.


Try making your own traditional garlands by stringing popcorn kernels or cranberries together.
A good rule is to hang a thin garland of berries, beads, or popcorn by draping it across the branches, while a thicker ribbon or foil garland should be wrapped loosely around the tree.
You can also add loose tinsel to hang on the garlands, strings of lights, or the branches themselves. Or, find a string of tinsel to hang like a garland for less fallen mess.

, Place ornaments on the tree by spacing them evenly throughout all sides of the tree on top and bottom.


Try placing your favorite ornaments, whether they’re sentimental or just visually pleasing, up front and in the middle of the tree where you will see them most often. Then space all of your largest ornaments around the tree before filling in with smaller ones.
Make sure to hang ornaments, especially fragile ones, securely on the tree by pinching the wire hanger (either provided or one you’ve made with a paper clip) securely around the branch you’re hanging on.
You can also add other touches to the tree at this point, like a star or angel tree topper, poinsettia flowers, or other adornments like icicles and snowflakes.

Determine how many lights you’ll need.,
Check if all the bulbs are working.,
Remove all tags.,
Install a power strip to the closest receptacle.,
Plug an extension cord into the power strip.,
Plug in your first set of lights.,
Move from the trunk out to the branch tips.,
Start at the bottom of your tree.,
Use floral wire to keep your lights in place.",How to String Christmas Tree Lights1," A good rule of thumb is that for every foot of tree, you should use 100 lights. So if you have a 5 foot tree, you will probably be using 500 lights. Of course you could use more or less depending on your budget and preference. The size of the bulb can also determine how many lights you use.The number of lights is really a personal preference. If you want a more subtle look, you may use a less lights or smaller bulbs. You may also use a combination of sizes for some variety.;
, Before you start hanging your lights, plug them in to make sure that all of them are working. Keep your lights plugged in as you hang them to get a sense of how your finished tree will look.Do not use lights that you cannot get to active within five minutes. Avoid any frustration of tinkering with lights for extended periods of time.

, Tags can be found on each string of lights and can be unsightly. Simply use scissors to remove all tags before hanging up your lights on your tree., This will be a built-in circuit breaker as well as make it more convenient to turn your lights on and off. Simply turn the power strip on and off to activate your lights., Find brown or green cords at your local hardware store to blend with your tree. Make sure that you can plug more than one plug into your extension cord. Add a splitter to an extension cord that only allows one plug.Place two power cords in your tree. First place the extension cord halfway up your tree trunk. A second cord should be placed at the top of taller trees. Use small cable ties or wind excess cord around the trunk to keep it in place and hide it from view.
Plug in a second extension cord into your main power strip if you are lighting a larger tree.

, Hide the wires by plugging in your lights to the extension cord that you have placed halfway up your tree. You want to maximize your light strand by not having to plug it into the wall outlet. Extend your lights and pull them to the top of your tree along the trunk., Hide wires and keep the emphasis on the lights by wrapping the lights around the branch, working outward to the tips. Avoid draping your lights on the front of your tree because this keeps the wires in plain view.Keep the lights loosely wrapped on each branch with about 12 lights to each branch, spreading them out in areas that they will be seen. You may reduce the amount of lights at the back of your tree if it is obstructed by a wall.
Avoid connecting together more than three strings of light because this may cause them to burn out. Use the extension cord that you placed at the middle of your tree to plug your fourth string lights into. Tie the plugs together to keep them secure. , If you are going for a natural look, string your lights through and around your tree randomly. Avoid patterns or spirals. You may also place some lights into the deeper branches of your tree with others at the front to create some depth.Move from the top to the bottom of your tree if you have a limited number of lights or a taller tree. This makes it easier to spread the lights out at the bottom of your tree. Install your lights from the top down so that you are always working towards the plug. Avoid hanging half a strand of lights at the top of your tree.
Green plugs that attach a string of lights to another create a dead zone. Push the green plugs deep into the tree branches to hide the green plugs.

, If your lights fall off branches or if you’re going for a specific design, use floral wire to keep them in place. Wrap the floral wire around the cord of your lights and bend the loose ends of the wire into the tree to prevent injury.Floral wire can be purchased at your local flower shop or arts and crafts store.

",How to Store an Artificial Christmas Tree," Get the biggest pieces from the top off first, so you don't feel overwhelmed by it later.;
, This could include any tinsel and garland(includes popcorn and fruit-bed strands), along with lights (if the tree isn't a pre-lit tree) and decorations. Make sure to completely remove all the tinsel that exists on the tree - down to the last single errant strand that you could miss from year to year. Tinsel likes to collect dust that will accumulate in the box from year to year.


Unplug and remove all the Christmas lights from the tree. Unless the tree comes pre-lit with Christmas lights, you must remove all lights from the tree until the tree is barren.

, Fold them all up so that all the Christmas tree branches fit within the confines of the container/storage box where you are storing the tree during it's time away from the location.

Use the tree for kindling.,
Make your own mulch.,
Send it back to its seller.",How to Use a Dead Christmas Tree," Councils or local municipalities in many regions collect dead Christmas trees and turn them into garden mulch. If you don't already live somewhere that does this as a matter of course, ring your local council and ask for details on pick-up. Ask them to start a service to collect Christmas trees if they don't have one yet.;
, If you have an open fireplace and room to cut a tree, Christmas tree wood makes ideal kindling. The tree has already dried in your home, so it is in excellent condition and just needs cutting into manageable pieces. A good weekend afternoon task and there will be no need to buy kindling for all winter.

, If you don't have a council to do the mulching, do it yourself. Get a group of neighbours together and share the costs of hiring a mulcher. The whole street can get rid of its Christmas trees and get the added benefit of terrific mulch for the garden. Bag the mulch if you cannot use the mulch straight away and store in a garage or basement.

, Some of the large commercial tree farms will take the tree back for you. Give them a call to ask about pick-up and delivery.

Decide what information you want to include.,
Determine the vertical size of your tree.,
Determine the horizontal size of your tree.,
Decide what medium you'd like to use for your tree.,
Attach each family member's information to your family tree.",How to Design a Family Tree," Some family trees include only the names of individuals. Others include dates and/or places of birth and death, marriage information, health information and even photographs. The design and shape of your tree will depend on how much information you want to include.;
,


Write out a sample box with the information you want to include, using one individual ancestor for your sample. Make several photocopies of the box, then cut them out to use as templates.
Space out the sample box templates you've created as though they represented three separate generations. The oldest generation typically goes on the top of a family tree, and subsequent generations line up underneath. This will give you some sense of how much space you want between each generation.
Measure the distance from the top of the sample box template for the first generation to the top of the sample box template for the second generation.
Multiply the distance between the top of the sample box templates by the number of generations you want to show on your family tree. This will give you the height of your completed tree.

,


Lay your sample box templates out side by side, as though they represented siblings in the same generation.
Measure the distance from the left side of the first sample box template to the left side of the second one.
Multiply the distance between the left sides of the sample box templates by the number of individuals in your largest generation. This is the minimum width of your family tree.
Consider adding additional horizontal spaces for future growth. It's common to uncover new siblings or spouses of ancestors, even with mature family history projects.

,


Use large copy paper or poster boards for smaller trees.
Use butcher paper or the backside of wrapping paper for larger trees.
Use a flat bed sheet or an artist's canvas for extra large trees.

, You can write the information directly on your chosen medium, or print the information, cut it out and attach each individuals information separately.

Start by writing down the names of people in your immediate family, then move to your parents' generation. Make sure you don't leave anyone out! Your family tree will be an important piece of family history, so take time to create an accurate diagram.


Write down your name, your siblings' names, and your parents' names.
Write down your grandparents' names, your aunts' and uncles' names and your cousins' names.
Write down your great grandparents' names and your great aunts' and uncles' names.
Many people stop there, but you can include as many generations as you want.;
, It might start getting difficult to fill in names once you go back a few generations. In an effort to make sure everyone gets included and all the names are accurate, conduct some research to double check yourself. This is a great opportunity to learn more about your family history.


Talk to older members of your family to find out more information. Find out the names of your grandparents' siblings, their spouses, their children. Ask around to find out as much as you can. If you're lucky, you'll get the opportunity to hear some surprising family stories and secrets, too.
Do online research using a genealogy tool. There are many online tools that let you simply enter your name and your parents' name, then do all the research for you.These sites usually give you a limited amount of information free, then require payment for more in-depth research. If you're serious about mapping your ancestry, this is a great way to collect information.

, In addition to including the first and last names of your family, you might want to list their birth dates, death dates (if applicable), marriage dates, and so on. Having these dates on the family tree will make it even more informative as a historical document for your family. In addition to dates, you could consider including your relatives' birthplaces or hometowns.

, If you have access to photographs of your ancestors, you could include a small portrait of each person. This option is best for family trees that are relatively contained, since the pictures could take up a lot of room on your finished diagram.


If you only have a few photos, you could just include pictures of your immediate family members.
Track down photos of as many family members as possible. If you want to make them all the same size, scan them into your computer and use Photoshop or another photo editing program to change the scale.

, This is the base of the tree, and includes you, your parents, and your siblings. The shape your diagram will take is your choice. If you want it to branch out vertically and get bushier at the top, like a tree, start at the bottom of a large sheet of paper. You may also start on the left side of a sheet of paper so that your diagram will be easy to read from left to right. No matter what shape you want your diagram to take, fill in the following information to get started:


Write down your name.
Draw a line from your name to the name of your mother. Draw another line from your name to the name of your father. Draw a horizontal line connecting your mother and father.
If you have siblings, draw lines from your mother and father to their names.
If your siblings have spouses, write them in and connect them with lines.
If your siblings have children, write them in and connect them with lines.

, Now it's time to fill in the second generation - your parents' generation. Connect each married couple with a horizontal line, and draw lines from parents to children.


Write your maternal grandparents' names above your mother's name. Write your paternal grandparents' names above your father's name.
Connect your maternal grandparents' names to your mother's siblings. Connect your paternal grandparents' names to your father's siblings.
Add the names of your aunts' and uncles' spouses.
Add the names of your aunts' and uncles' children, your cousins.

, If you have a big family, your diagram may already be threatening to go over the edge of the page. Some people stop here, with both sets of grandparents serving as the crown of their family tree diagram. If you want to keep going, it's time to include your grandparents' generation. Remember to connect married couples with horizontal lines, and to draw lines from parents to their children.


Add the names of your maternal grandmother's mother and father and your maternal grandfather's mother and father. These are your great grandparents.
Add the names of your paternal grandmother's mother and father and your paternal grandfather's mother and father. These are your great grandparents.
Add the names of your maternal grandparents' siblings - your great aunts and uncles.
Add the names of your paternal grandparents' siblings - your great aunts and uncles.
Fill in the names of your great aunts' and uncles' spouses and children.

, If you're enjoying the experience of researching your family history, keep tracing it back as far as you can. There's no limit to the potential size of your diagram, especially if it's digital!

, Now that your diagram is complete, consider putting an artistic spin on it so you can share it proudly with the rest of your family. Copy the diagram in pencil on a large sheet of drawing paper, then use nice ink or paint to render the names and add colorful embellishments. You could choose to use the classic tree shape or try something new and creative to illustrate your ancestry. Here are a few ideas:


Turn the connecting lines into branches, and write each person's name on a different leaf. Children's names can be written on apples or berries.
Make a family galaxy, with people's names written on planets and stars. If you want, make your name the ""sun.""

Feel the negativity, but don’t unpack and stay there.,
Tell yourself it’s okay not to be perfect.,
Stop comparing yourself to other moms.,
Focus on your strengths.",How to Cope when You Feel Like a Bad Mom1," Sometimes, feeling bad about your parenting is just a side effect of the job. However, you don’t want to play into these feelings. That’s why it’s important to be able to recognize when they arise and move through them.Try taking some time to journal about the problem. Write out what happened and why it is making you feel bad about yourself. Then, try to look for something that you can learn from the experience. For example, if you are feeling guilty about yelling at your daughter, then you might consider what caused you to do so. Have you had a stressful day? Were you reacting to something she said or did? How would you like to handle similar situations in the future?
It might also be helpful to give yourself a 15 minute time limit for worrying about what happened as well. After your 15 minutes has elapsed, don’t think about it again. More than likely, you will have released all the guilt or anger and you will start to feel better afterwards. If the thoughts keep coming back up, say to yourself, ""I'll worry about you later"" and don't think about them again until your next worry period.;
, If you’re a perfectionist in life, receiving even the slightest hint that you haven’t earned an “A+” in parenting can be devastating. Stop holding yourself to such high expectations and you won’t feel horrible when you don’t meet them.


Instead, take a moment at the end of each day to celebrate what you did right as a mother. Maybe you got all of your children dressed in clothes that actually matched. Maybe you mustered up the energy to wash your hair. Maybe you fed them –even if McDonald’s—but, they did eat.
Lower the bar on what you consider to be “good parenting” and you’ll engage in less self-criticism. Research shows that kids really need your love, your time, and structure so that they learn appropriate boundaries. If you are providing these, you have already earned an “A.”You can also focus on being present when you are with your children so that you can better enjoy their company. Stay in the present moment and enjoy every little hug, smile, and conversation with your children.
Also, try to be optimistic about each day. Imagine that things will go well, and a positive outcome will be more likely. For example, if you are planning a trip to a local museum with your kids, then envision yourself and your kids having a great time and making lots of happy memories.

, Parenting is hard. For everyone—that’s right, even those moms who seem to have it all together have bad days. Give yourself a break and stop peaking over their fences. If you’re always caught up in what your neighbor or Facebook friend does for her kids, you will continue to feel worthless.Why? Because you are holding yourself up to unrealistic comparisons. When you meet other moms at events or see snapshots of their lives on social media, you aren’t seeing the ugly parts. They aren’t putting their bad days on display.
When you find yourself wanting to compare, remember this. Say it to yourself, “Just because I don’t see her bad days, it doesn’t mean they don’t happen.”
Get off Facebook or parenting forums if these sites make you beat yourself up. Stop attending parenting groups that have high expectations of motherhood. Don’t put yourself in environments that make you feel bad about yourself.

, Rather than dwelling on your shortcomings, start emphasizing all those little things that you’re good at. Collect them to fall back on during those times when that voice pops up in your head that you’re not good enough.Make a list of everything you believe you excel at as a mother. Make the list on a good day, so you don’t sell yourself short due to negative thinking. The list can include both big and little successes like sparing a few minutes to read your kids a bedtime story or helping your learning disabled child improve a math grade.

Budget your lights.,
Check if all the bulbs are working.,
Remove all tags.,
Install a power strip to the closest receptacle.,
Start at the bottom of the trunk.,
Work from the tips to toward the trunk.,
Secure the cord at the trunk.,
Repeat the process.",How to String Christmas Tree Lights2," Artificial trees usually come in sections. You may use miniature tree lights to wrap around the branches if your light each section separately Use 50-light strands because they are less likely to burn out and are easy to handle.Use about 12 boxes of 50-light strings if your tree is around six feet and about 20 boxes for trees that are around eight feet high. For showcase lighting, use about 40 boxes of 50-light strings for a tree that is around six feet high and 80 boxes for a tree that’s eight feet high.

, Before you start hanging your lights, plug them in to make sure that all of them are working. Keep your lights plugged in as you hang them to get a sense of how your finished tree will look.Do not use lights that you cannot get to active within five minutes. Avoid any frustration of tinkering with lights for extended periods of time.

, Tags can be found on each string of lights and can be unsightly. Simply use scissors to remove all tags before hanging up your lights on your tree., This will be a built-in circuit breaker as well as make it more convenient to turn your lights on and off. Simply turn the power strip on and off to activate your lights., Keep some slack in the first string of lights and create a loop by separating the cord from the first bulb. Place the loop over one of the greens or small branchlets close to the trunk and secure the cord by wrapping it a few times around the green., Keep the string of lights taught as you place the lights from the tips of your branches moving towards the trunk. Make sure to wrap the cord over the branch and itself as you make your way towards the trunk., When you reach the trunk, separate the cord from the last light and secure it by slipping it over a branch. Place the cord over to the closest branch, find a green part close to the trunk and wrap the cord around it. Make sure to pull the cord over the tip of the branch and wrap it over itself and the branch., Wrap branches in the same way until you reach the end of the light string. Plug in another set of lights and continue wrapping branches until you get to the end of the tree section, the section at which the tree comes apart. Position any excess lights along the branches instead of having them cross into another section of the tree.Evenly spread out your lights so that your tree will be evenly lit from the top of your tree to the bottom.

Be sure there is a working outlet outdoors.",How to String Christmas Tree Lights3," Plan on using at least three 100 light strings for every foot of height on your tree. So if your tree is six feet tall, you will be using about 18 light strings of 100 lights each., Avoid wrapping the lights around your tree as if it were a maypole. Start from the top and mentally divide your tree into three triangular sections until you get to the bottom of your tree’s cone., Use florist shears to clip any drooping branches or any branches that seem out of place., Place the last bulb of the first string of lights at the top of your tree. Carefully weave your lights back and forth through the top triangle section. Do not cross your cord over itself. Plug in another set of lights once you’ve reached the end of the first and continue weaving until you reach the bottom of the top triangle section.

Use a GFCI circuit for lights outside. These circuits are designed to prevent electrocution and shock.

, Weave lights through each triangular section until you reach the bottom of the cone of your tree. Avoid connecting more than 300 lights to one another as they may burn out., Any dark holes need to be filled. Rearrange your lights to fill in any gaps or until you’re satisfied., Remove the roller from a painters pole and use the metal bracket to string lights on trees that are 10 feet or taller without having to use a ladder.Work your way to the bottom and use another extension cord if needed. Plug any additional extension cords to your main power strip.Wrap your plugs with electrical tape to help keep them together as well as protect them from water.

, Use blue, white, or green lamps. Using yellow, red, amber, or pink can make your tree look a muddy brown., A strong wind can easily dislodge your lights if you use hooks to hang them up. Use plastic gutter clips that you can purchase from your hardware store. You may also find them in your arts and craft store., Test any outdoors sockets to be sure that they are functioning properly before plugging in any lights. Keep cords organized and neat away from any walkways where they can be tripping hazards."

Make sure all your lights are compatible.,
Check the wattage of the bulbs.,
Plug in your lights before removing them from the box.,
Use miniature clear lights as base lighting.",How to String Christmas Tree Lights4," Christmas tree lights can be end to end or stacked. End to end is also known as string to string. Stacked plugs can join more light strands together relative to string to string plugs. Read the boxes to ensure that your lights are compatible before purchasing., Don’t plug more than two extension cords to one another and make sure that they can handle the wattage of the bulbs. Only buy the lengths of light string and extension cord that you will be using. Make sure that all the lights you are using have the same wattage to prevent power surges. This will also prolong the life of your lights., Make sure all the lights work before placing them on your tree. You don’t want any live wires or broken bulbs in your tree as they can be fire hazards., Miniature white lights make great base lighting when coupled with strands of larger cool-burning bulbs that come in a variety of colour. You may also add novelty lights like flashing lights, flickering flames, bubble lights, or lights of various shapes along with miniature lights."

Identify what you’re telling yourself.,
Find the culprit.,
Perform reality testing.,
Reframe negative self-talk.",How to Cope when You Feel Like a Bad Mom2," Self-talk is a powerful tool that can be used to create a positive or negative reality.If the script running through your head all day long is that you can’t do this or that, you are bound to feel bad about your mothering skills. You can shift this internal dialogue to feel like a better mom.


Start by listening to your self-talk. What are you telling yourself throughout the day? Notice your thoughts and how they make you feel. For instance, you might find that you tell yourself, “I lost my cool and shouted at Samantha, I'm a terrible mom.” Saying this makes you feel even worse about raising your voice.

, Once you start becoming aware of your self-talk try to reflect back on what led to your negative thinking patterns. These are your triggers. Sometimes, triggers are more obvious, like when your teenager tells you “You’re the worst mom ever.” Other times, the culprit behind negative self-talk is harder to spot.


When you catch yourself thinking negatively, try to pinpoint the stimulus. For example, when you show up late to the parent-teacher conference, you start telling yourself “You’re always late. You’re never on time,” which makes you feel bad. Maybe this self-talk is so negative because another mom exited her meeting right before you, and she always seems to be on time. In this scenario, your comparisons were the culprit of your negative self-talk.

, Challenging negative self-talk is the key to getting rid of these unhealthy thinking patterns. Usually, these thoughts are unrealistic. So, when you look more closely at them, they lose their impact. Reality testing is one way to challenge unhelpful self-talk. It involves looking for evidence that supports your thoughts.For example, you tell yourself “I never get anything right.” Ask yourself what evidence is there for or against this thought? Maybe you forgot to sign a permission slip, but you did succeed in getting your toddler to eat his vegetables and you got your teenager to open up about a bullying situation. Those are clear instances when you got something right. That way, you can recognize how illogical the earlier thought was.

, Challenging negative self-talk isn’t beneficial unless you make the effort to modify the negative language and change it into more positive, realistic statements. When you do this, you set a foundation for putting a positive spin on any negative thinking you notice.You can reframe the earlier example of “I never get anything right” into “I make mistakes as a mother, but there are also many things I can do well.” Just shifting this thought can lead to a healthier, more positive outcome.

Share your feelings with other moms.,
Call a trusted friend or family member.,
Join a support group.,
See a therapist.",How to Cope when You Feel Like a Bad Mom3," Feeling like a bad mom isn’t unique to you. Unfortunately, you may never know because many moms choose to bury these feelings so others can’t judge them. Have the courage to say aloud to other moms some of the terrible thoughts you have about your parenting. In doing so, you will realize that they have similar thoughts.For instance, at your next play-date, share your concern “I have been so busy with work lately that I haven’t really had time to cook healthy meals. This makes me feel terrible.” More than likely another mom will share the feeling with “Me, too! Oh, I feel so bad!”

, When you find yourself caught up in negative thoughts about your mothering abilities, reach out to a loved one like a sister or best friend. Or, get the opinion of your own mother or mother-in-law.


Say, “Oh, Mom/Sis/Mother-in-law, I feel horrible. I’ve been so tired. I haven’t had any energy to play with the kids. They’re been bingeing on cartoons.”
You may be surprised to find that some of the women you view as mothering idols faced many of the same challenges as you do., It can bring you consolation to be in a group of mothers who have similar concerns. Hearing the stories of other women who struggle to parent on some days, or don’t follow society’s parenting rules, can help you realize that you’re not alone.


Talk to your child’s pediatrician or a local counselor to find a supportive group for mothers. Or, you can even start a Meetup in your area to join up with other women who feel like bad moms.

, If you are a new mom—or recently gave birth to another child—who is struggling to care for your child or yourself due to feelings of depression, you need to see a professional right away. Post-partum depression is a serious condition that can have a negative impact on your life, if left untreated. Treatments may include psychotherapy, medication or a combination of the two. Consult with a doctor if you are concerned that you have this disorder.


Symptoms include anxiety, mood swings, sleep disruption, problems concentrating, crying spells, isolating from loved ones, and having trouble developing a bond with your baby."

Understand the crest.,
Know what a crest means.,
Think about what would be appropriate on your crest.,
Choose symbols to represent your ideas.,
Stick with traditional colors.,
Pick or draw a stylized form of the symbol.,
Remember that your crest will sit on a helmet.,
Place it on your coat of arms.",How to Make a Family Crest1," The crest appears on the top of the helmet on a coat of arms.Crests are sometimes used as a stand-in for the coat of arms as a whole, especially if the coat of arms is too intricate.;
, Crests are usually born by one person, and then they are passed down through the male line. Therefore, they are not necessarily associated with a a whole family name. In addition, crests and coats of arm are heavily regulated in some countries, such as the United Kingdom., That is, what symbol would best represent you or your family. Think about your history, your profession, the number of children you have, your hobbies, and your interests. Any of those can be used as a symbol for your crest. Narrow it down to a few specifics., For instance, if you're a writer, maybe you want a feather as your crest to represent a quill. If you value bravery, maybe you want an eagle as a crest., The traditional colors for coats of arms are purple, red, blue, green, and black. You also have two options for metals, silver and gold.


You can also use colors found in nature if you are using a natural symbol. For instance, if you are drawing an eagle for your crest, you can use brown for the wings., Remember, the crest usually goes on top of the helmet. Therefore, it will need to be somewhat simplified and not too detailed.


Pay attention to symmetry. Though not all crests are symmetrical, many have symmetrical elements. For instance, you may have an eagle with it's wings outstretched, and it's head turned. In that case, the turned head makes it not symmetrical, but the wings and other parts of the body should be symmetrical., That is, it shouldn't overtake the helmet, but be small enough to sit on top of it.

, Usually, the helmet sits above the shield, so the crest's colors should blend in with the other colors on your coat of arms."

Embrace the benefits for your family.,
Reclaim history for yourself.,
Reap the health benefits of writing.",How to Write a Family History," Not all family histories have to be massive recordings of multiple generations. You could just create a story of your immediate family -- your parents and siblings or your spouse and children.Get a rough idea of how far back in history you intend to search. This will help you decide what kinds of resources you need to explore.
In addition to deciding how many ancestors you want to include, you should also consider if there is a particular geographical location you want to stick to. If your ancestors immigrated, do you want to conduct research about their lives in another country or do you want to keep it centered in one specific location?;
, Similar to deciding on your scope, a clear research question will help guide your research. Is there a particular ancestral figure you want to focus on?For instance, do you want to know why one branch of your family moved to another region of the country? Do you want to know the source of an old feud with another family? Asking something specific will help you narrow your scope and then branch out into other information.Decide what you already know. How much information do your already have on your family? What gaps in knowledge exist? How do you intend to fill them?

, In the digital age, resources for finding information on your family can be easily accessed on the internet. Here are some types of records that can help you build a family history:Land deeds and records (often available about the National Archives' web site for the U.S. as well as the records division of your local county courthouse)
Census information (available at the U.S. Census Bureau's web site)
Military records (National Archives)
Ship passenger arrival records and land border entries (National Archives and The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation Inc. web sites)
Engagement/wedding announcements, birth announcements and obituaries (often in local newspapers or church bulletins)
School yearbooks or old transcripts (usually available from the person's alma mater)
Legal documents such as wills and testaments (also available at their corresponding courthouse)
Church registries (check with local churches if you know your family has a history there)
Old letters, journals or diaries from ancestors (ask older relatives if they have these)
Family recipes and/or cookbooks

, While records and written documents will give you important facts, visual sources will make your history more engaging to read. Look for old family photographs, maps of land, posters, postcards, and newspaper clippings to include. Nothing will make your history feel more alive than actual depictions of your ancestors.Look for other physical items such as childhood toys, clothing, jewelry, kitchenware, and mementos/keepsakes kept by your older family members to include in your family history. These items will give you a sense of your relatives' tastes and interests beyond a basic genealogical record.

, Genealogy libraries specialize in resources for finding your family history. They often include extensive microfilm collections where you can read a variety of helpful sources all in one space.Some of the most well-known genealogy libraries in the U.S. include the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, the Midwest Genealogy Center, the Family History Center in Salt Lake City, the New England Historic Genealogical Research Center Library, and the Clayton Library Center for Genealogical Research in Houston.You may find that taking the time to visit one of these libraries will actually save you time in the long run because of the wealth of resources they provide all in one place.
You should also check your local library system to see what kind of genealogical resources they provide.

, If you are limited in your ability to travel to libraries, then try to use on-line resources. Web sites such as Ancestry, AfriGeneas, Find A Grave, Archives.com, and Genealogy provides lots of great tips for starting your family history.They will often provide timelines and checklists so you can properly organize the information that you are gathering and save it in a digital space.
On-line resources will also be convenient for sharing materials and records with other family members if you don't plan to send a physical copy of your family history to many readers., Sometimes the best historical sources are your current relatives. As you are gathering information, structure your interview around want you want to know. Do you want to hear about a particular time or period in this subject's life or do you want a general overview of their family history?Schedule the interview for a time and place that is convenient for your subject. This may be in their own home or in a more public place.
Document the interview. You should plan to take notes during the discussion -- don't just assume that you will remember everything afterwards. If you don't want to take notes, try to record the interview with a recorder or video camera.Ask important questions. These should include fact-finding questions (like the names of relatives/dates of important events), but you can also ask substantial questions about family traditions or customs, family trips, and how your subject related to their local communities.
Respect sensitive subjects. Over the course of a person's life, they may experience something very painful or have a moment they do not want to revisit. Respect your interviewee when they say they don't want to discuss something -- don't push them or make them feel uncomfortable.If you do not know your interview subject well, consider asking if a close friend or relative of theirs will accompany you during the interview. This might make your subject more comfortable while they are talking to you if you are a stranger., Some genealogical histories are simply lists of names, birth and death dates, marriages and offspring. While this is a good place to start, it probably won't give a very in-depth view of the personalities belonging to the people in your family.Focus on narrating the story of your family rather than simply making lists on a family tree. Give details about your ancestors based on the research you have compiled. Did the family suffer financial ruin at one point? Did they have any disputes in court? Did anyone commit a major crime? These are the kind of substantial details that can make your history a compelling text to read.
Consider if you want to divide sections of your history by time or by geography. For example, if one branch of your family is from one state, but another branch of the family still lives in a different country, consider dividing the family history into regional or geographical sections rather than by a historical timeline.

, If you are putting your history into a book format, you should have some tools that will make it easily accessible for your reader. The most helpful tools will be a Table of Contents (so your reader knows how the history is structured) and then an Index of Names at the back.


The Index will be especially helpful to a reader who wants to learn about one member of the family in particular., You don't have to follow each family member's life from the moment of their birth to their death. Opening a chapter with the sentence, ""Beauregard Fortiscue was born on October 9, 1875"" will often put the reader to sleep because they already sense the arc of this story.Instead, open with a compelling anecdote about your subject. Have you found a long lost love letter from Beauregard to his wife? Do you have evidence that he was entangled in a bitter land dispute with a neighbor? These are more compelling stories to use as an introduction to his history and they will hook your reader early on.

, There are number of style guides you can use for correctly citing your sources, such as the Chicago Manual of Style or Modern Language Association style book. Pick one style guide and apply it to the sources in your project.You will generally need to cite a source whenever you directly quote from it or whenever you refer to it generally (as when you paraphrase or summarize a section from it).
Most citations require the name of the author of the source, the date it was published, and the title of the work (such as The Journal of Beauregard Fortiscue, 1888-89).
Sources from records such as the census or other similar documents should also be cited. Consult the style guide for specific instructions on how to cite it properly.

, The best way to improve your writing is to get feedback from other readers. Consider joining a local writing group (often hosted at local libraries or community centers).If you have some extra money, you can also consider taking a class in non-fiction writing at your local college to help improve your writing skills.
Writing groups will also give you a set of deadlines to meet while you are drafting your project.

, You can also hire a proofreader to help you with this if you want to spend more time focusing on the content of the story. Try looking for local freelance writers or even asking students in a graduate writing program if they want to take on a side project., Self-publishing might be the best route for your family history; it is likely that your broadest audience is your own family (and future family members), so most major publishers will not take on your project. But there are lots of options for self-publishing today:Look for local printers who use Xerox DocuTech if you only want to print a limited number of copies. These are often lower-cost options that also provide a quick turnaround.Consider print-on-demand publishing. On web sites like Lulu, you can print one book at a time directly from a computer file (rates begin at $13 for 24 pages). This is a good option if you think you might only want a couple copies of your history.You can also turn your history into an e-book for free on web sites like Scribd., While you might assume that your family history should take the form of a book, there are many other formats to consider as well.


The website PlaceStories allows you to pick notable addresses on a digital map and then attach stories to them. You can consider using this site if you want to base your history geographically.Vlog your research. You can also make a series of videos in which you discuss your research and then upload them to sites such as YouTube or Vimeo if you want to orally tell the story of your family.Consider using a digital newsletter that you can email to your friends and family. Each newsletter can feature a story about a different relative in your family history and it will present the information in easily digestible chunks as opposed to one long book. You can use services like MailChimp or ConstantContact to create these kinds of newsletters and mailing lists.

, In a survey conducted by Ancestry.com, more than 67% of users reported that learning about their family histories made them feel wiser; a majority of users also reported that it helped them feel closer to older relatives.If you have been looking for a way to get closer to relatives you don't know very well or whom you have lost touch with, then researching a family history can be a great way to do this.

, If your family belongs to a marginalized or oppressed group, writing a family history can also help you dismantle racist or stereotypical narratives about your family's ethnic or religious background. Writing can become an act of empowerment for your family and broader community., Writing can have significant benefits for your mental and physical health. Studies have shown that writing can ease symptoms of depression and anxiety.It has also been show to reduce symptoms in cancer patients.Not surprisingly, the mental work of writing has also been shown to boost your memory."

, That is, maybe if you like to laugh, you can include part of a favorite joke in your coat of arms, such as a banana peel. If you love nature, you could include a favorite flower or tree, and dogs could easily be part of a coat of arms.

, Most coat of arms use a shield, but you can use other shapes, such as triangles or squares., Each person can design a symbol to go on the coat of arms. You can also let someone design the mantling and the helm. The mantling is a decorative piece that drapes above the shape, such as leaves or ribbon, while the helm is the centerpiece of the mantling. The helm is often a knight's helmet, but you can use whatever you want.


Don't forget the crest for the helm. The crest can be another symbol that represents your family.

, If you want the shield or shape to have more than one color, divide it up and color it in. Because this activity is just meant to be for fun, you can use whatever colors your family likes best.


Traditional colors for a shield are exclusively red, blue, purple, green, and black, with silver and gold as metals.However, traditional shields also allow for ""natural"" colors to create certain symbols., Glue each piece on to create a complete crest. Often, the shield has a centerpiece, called a charge, but you can also put several symbols inside the shape, especially if you divided it into sections.


You can also create supporters, which go on either side of the shield. Generally, these are two animals that help create balance within the design.

, Talk to as many family members as you can, especially older members of the family, such as grandparents, who would be happy to give you any information or family history that they know of.


Consider recording your talks with family members, especially older family members. These oral records can be kept on your computer for ease of reference and verification of exactly what was said.;
, Ask them about their great-grandparents and about what they know and remember of your family's history on that side of the family.


Ask about how they got to America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, etc., if you live in such places. Or, ask them how they got to wherever they are now anyway––all the facts are relevant in piecing together your history.
Ask questions about who your ancestors were, what they were like, where they were native to, etc.

, Ask for anything your eldest family member didn't know or hasn't made clear. It's also good to ask as many people as possible, to allow you to cross check the information gained.

, If your family keeps such a record, it would be useful to construct a family tree from this information. You can also contact family members through these records to get more information.

, This is very useful if the pictures have descriptions behind it, if not, you would want to find an older family member to go through the pictures with you. If you have constructed a general family tree already, this would be a good way to put a face on those people. Pictures can also be very good clues about the personalities and occupations of your relatives.

, This would include christmas cards, holiday greetings and letters. If you are researching beyond your grandparents, any kept letters from their time should provide a little insight into the generation older than them.

, There are websites online dedicated to tracking down family history and ancestry. These include such sites as Cyndi's List - www.cyndislist.com and LDS - www.FamilySearch.org.

, Libraries have very many old newspapers and might have diary-like books from a long time ago. Look for stories, awards, work histories, etc., with your ancestors in it.


If any of your ancestors were writers, you may be able to find written work of theirs, anything from advertising blurb and stories to letters to the editor and articles.

, Once you have all your data and a good enough collection to finalize it, put it together in a professional data base. Examples of free and commercial databases are: Brother's Keeper (Windows, Free Trial once downloaded), RootsMagic Essentials (Windows, free), Gramps (Linux, Free open source), Family Tree Maker (Windows, fee-based) and MyHeritage Family Tree Builder (Windows, Free).

, You are who you are, no matter what your parents are, your grandparents are, your great-grandparents are, or what your ancestors were.

Additionally, talk to any living family members. Ask your relatives about your family history. Don’t just try to get facts. Instead, ask for memories and stories. Having a conversation with a family member can actually yield better information than just trying to figure out who was where at a certain time.
Go through your family’s storage and look through photo albums, family records like birth certificates, letters, diaries, and even newspaper clippings.
You can also email your distant relatives and ask for access to any information your relatives may have.
Gather everything that you think might help you. If a photo has a date or other information written on the back, this could be a useful clue.;
, Online ancestry and family history services can often provide much of what you need to start filling in a family tree.


You can also get historical records from companies serving some of the world’s historic immigration sites. For instance, in the United States, an Ellis Island program offers free searches of historical records. More in-depth information is available for a small fee. Other sites like Ancestry.com offer comprehensive family tree building services as well. Sort records by type. You will be looking for various historical records in order to add more information to a family tree. Look for birth or death certificates, marriage certificates, baptismal records and other items simultaneously. Think about how each type of public record will aid in your research. It’s best to keep your records sorted and organized in some method that works for you. You may like having separate folders for each type.

, In many families, those who have come before you have recorded specific important heritage and ancestry information.


In some cases, an heirloom is in the form of a printed book or a memoir that includes genealogy data. Other times, families record genealogy in a family Bible or other book or document. These resources will help you get a better start for your own historic record.

, Many countries offer national archives and other resources for helping families develop personal genealogies.


Look at public records which can help you in your search for critical information on your heritage.
If you're in the U.S., searching the U.S. census data can be a helpful resource. You can find public records at your local library or courthouse. You can also look through military records if you had family members who have been in the service.

, For the most coherent family tree, you’ll want all of your research to boil down to a specific person as a reference point.


Your reference point is an individual in your family that marks the beginning of the family tree structure. This can be yourself, one of your children, or anyone else in your family.
In most cases, starting with yourself is the most efficient and easiest method.

, Gather all of the information you have found and begin to organize it so that you can easily find what you need.


How you organize your information is up to you. You may want to organize all documents by generation, person, or side of your family after branching off from your reference point.
You may want to even create a spreadsheet that lists all your family members so far. In columns next to the name you can add relevant information. Include information like geography, years alive, birthdate and death date, etc. If you have a lot of physical items like photos and other documents, you should notate where you can reference these documents in the spreadsheet.

, When you have all of your sources together, you'll want to look at how to best present your family tree.


Some “vertical"" or ""standard"" options feature the familiar chart-type designs you see in printed family tree documents. Other styles like an hourglass, bow-tie or fan format make a family tree document look different. The format you use will depend on how far back you wish to go and what kind of information you want to include. When starting your family tree, you may find that it’s easiest to start with a simple five generation format. Many five generation family tree structures are great for starting out as you’ll have room to add some vital information. You’ll also be able to go fairly deep into your history. At the same time, after five generations, you may have a much harder time finding information.
You can also find helpful templates for families that aren’t “traditional”. There are options for blended families, single parent trees, adoptive family trees, etc. , In some cases, a nicely printed family tree is a better reference point than an online document. However, if you need to send this information to many people, you may want to choose an electronic option.


Making a detailed tree by using a website or software like Excel allows you the freedom to easily make notations and changes.
Using a printed version will allow you to make a very nice looking family tree on nice paper. You can even add some art to your family tree.
If you’re just starting out, making an electronic tree might prove to be easier and more efficient. Then, once you have completed it, you can recreate it on paper.

, In most cases, starting with yourself as the reference point is the best method. But even if you didn’t, you should still begin actually populating your family tree with yourself. If you have children, you can place your children behind you on the chart. Then moving out and away from you.
Family trees can branch out in many different ways. Which is why starting with yourself as the anchor will help you stay organized. Whether you go from the bottom up, top to bottom, or horizontally, the first box should contain your information.

, Many of those who have experience in making a family tree recommend starting with a rough draft of what you know.


In whatever format you’ve chosen, a rough draft will help you determine how much information you can fit. Having a basic structure in place can also help you find more of the missing pieces in your genealogy and organize your family tree.
Your draft will inform you of how complex your current format can be. If you want to include more details than you have space for, you may need to restructure your family tree’s format.
In your draft, start to create a legend to reference. For example, brackets going from one box to two boxes typically indicate the parents of the previous box. Note this method for connecting family members somewhere in your tree.
Also make sure that you are using birth names in your draft. For example, if your mom took your dad’s last name when the two married, don’t use your last name. Use your mom’s maiden name.

, Populate your tree with all of the current information you have compiled.


As you fill out and populate your family tree make note of what resources you are using.
When you have populated your tree, go over all your resources and see if you missed something. Then, you may want to locate all the information, pictures, files, etc. you didn’t use. Separate the unnecessary information from the necessary information.

, You can do this in a chart you’ve already created or make a new one if it’s easier. But you should now make note of what information you are still missing.


Check to see if you have all the information you want for each family member. Are you missing birthdates, marriages, or any other relevant information?
Make detailed notes of what you still need. Perhaps you couldn’t find any information on who your great-grandmother married. Or, you still don’t know when your grandfather came to your country.

, Start searching again, this time being more specific as you know what information you need. Try searching through records using different names or dates.


Depending on when a certain family member moved to a new country, these members may have had a different name. Alternatively, you may eventually discover that the dates you thought were correct were actually wrong.
Ask your family if anyone had a different name or a variation of a name. Search Google and other records with different parameters. You can set date ranges when searching on Google to filter out any dates you don’t want results from. , Now that you’ve started your family tree you can continue to expand it and fill in all the blanks as you discover more.


When you find new information, add it to your tree and notate where you found the information.
You can continue building out a record of your genealogy going as far back as you wish.

Other kits can be ordered online at the manufacturer’s website. Some options are AncestryDNA for genealogy analysis and 23andMe for health risk analysis., After you receive the kit, use the included tools to gather your DNA sample. The kits either have cheek swabs or saliva containers. Swab the inside of your cheek or spit into the container.DNA tests to establish paternity require a sample from parents as well as the child.

, The kit will come with packaging to mail back to the testing facility. For example, your paternity DNA test may have several envelopes. Record the name of the sample provider and their personal information, including age and ethnicity.Many DNA test companies operate online. The sample kit will have a barcode that you must register on the company’s website.
DNA samples to establish paternity require signatures from the sample providers.

, Fill out the order form with your information. This will indicate you as the results recipient. The envelopes are typically prepaid, so all you have to do is slip them into a mailbox., Go to the company’s website. If you haven’t already, set up an account by registering your email and setting a password. Simple paternity tests can be completed relatively quickly, but lengthier ancestry and health risk analysis DNA test will take longer., The test results often require more analysis to be illuminating. For example, a health-based DNA test will reveal how much more likely you are to get a certain disease than someone else. Don’t worry yet and don’t disregard any treatment plans your doctor has already given you. Call the company or enlist the help of your doctor to interpret the results before you change your lifestyle.Paternity tests need to be submitted to the court system to be considered official.
For ancestry tests, research your family tree to gather more information about your lineage.

Search the census records.,
Narrow down your search results.,
Use naturalization papers.,
Track down physical records.,
Find your ancestors' gravestones.,
Use baptism records to suggest birthdays.",How to Trace Your Ancestry2," Use the US Census online at Ancestry.com. Start with the most recent ancestors: find their names on each census, and work backward into the past. The online censuses are indexed – so if you put in the name and birthday, it may bring up the correct person along with other possibilities. As you start building the family tree, note the details that suggest other areas to search – e.g. someone's occupation.If your family member doesn't show up on the census, try editing the search. Add or remove words to clarify the results.
Search for their maiden name as well as the married name of female ancestors. The census records may confirm or suggest a marriage date.
Be aware that the spelling of names may have changed. Some ancestors may not have been able to read or write well, and they may have used uncommon spellings. Old censuses may indicate whether or not a person was literate.

, After checking the census history, try a search of all records. It may help to narrow the records down to marriage and divorce, or immigration, or military. Search any census category that might include your ancestors. Try using tax and voter lists., If your ancestors came from another country, you may need to look for their immigration and naturalization papers. Naturalization papers have two parts: the papers and the final application. Unless you have that second paper, you can't be sure they were naturalized. They could have waited several years between the two, and the final paper could be in a different courthouse – even a different part of the country. Use the census to trace where your ancestors lived, and look for naturalization records in those places.


Consult the passenger lists of ships. If your ancestors immigrated across the sea, you might be able to figure out exactly when if you find their name.

, If you know where your ancestors were married, go to that location (church, courthouse, etc.) and ask for access to their records. Marriage certificates often feature the names of the parents of the bride and groom's parents. This may be a useful clue to get you on track. See if the location was used for other ancestors, and look for their records as well.

, If you know where your deceased relatives are buried or commemorated, visit the cemetery in person. Look for clues: birth and death dates, names that don't match your records, or other relatives buried nearby. Don't be afraid to travel to distant cemeteries if your ancestors lived and died in various places. You might find it valuable to physically trace your ancestry by making it a journey.

, If your ancestors' church baptized children, look through the baptism records. If you don't know an ancestors exact date of birth, the baptism can help you approximate when a given family member was born. Most baptisms are done soon after birth. You should also be able to find marriage and death records in the church archives.


Church records are not always complete. If the church is far from you, call before you travel.

Explore online ancestry-research services.,
Contact local ancestry research groups.,
Use free trials.,
Consider DNA testing.There are a number of services that run saliva samples through lab tests to isolate hereditary genetic factors.",How to Trace Your Ancestry3," In most cases, you will pay someone to go out and research your family tree. You will need to provide as much relevant information as possible, including names, locations, dates, professions, and connections. This can be a great option if you don't have the time, energy, or inclination to do the legwork yourself.Be careful. Some of these services are scams. Read reviews and inform yourself before you pay any money.

, Find out if there is a genealogy research group in your area, or the area where your ancestors lived. These groups may have some records of your family. Many of these societies are based online, although they may also keep physical records.

, Websites such as ancestry.com are build to find this sort of information, and their free trials can help you dive quickly into the past. Each trial gives you access to a large database for a short period of time. You will need to be motivated, and you will need to dedicate a brief and intense effort to your research. However, you might be able to learn a lot.

, You may be able to tell, for instance, that you have genes only found in a specific part of the world. These services are usually more expensive than paying someone to look through the records. For the price, however, you might be able to learn much deeper information."

Visit an accredited testing facility.,
Provide the requested sample of DNA.,
Gather necessary samples from other people.,
Seek counseling for test results.",How to Get a DNA Test2," Search your area for government-sanctioned testing facilities. This is particularly important during paternity tests. The facility must follow established procedures in order for the test to be legitimate. Find lists of facilities online and ask for the facility’s credentials before taking the test., DNA testing can be done with any number of body fluids or tissues. Many on-site tests are done by swabbing the inside of a cheek. When testing an unborn child, the facility can now withdraw blood through the mother. This can be done after the first trimester for a safe and highly accurate paternity test.Blood and swab tests are non-invasive. Invasive tests, such as using a needle to extract amniotic fluid, pose slight risks to an unborn child, so wait until after the child is born to get the test done.

, Genealogy and medical DNA tests will be complete after you provide your sample. To test paternity or maternity, you’ll also need samples from parents. The parent needs to come into the lab and provide their sample. If they can’t or don’t want to, you’ll have to get a sample from a grandparent or other immediate relative., Medical DNA tests will be explained by the facility or your doctor. Heritage DNA tests can be researched via your family tree. For relational DNA tests, you’ll have to go through the legal system. To establish paternity in Ohio, for example, you will need to speak to an attorney and set up a court proceeding to make the DNA test official."

Develop an idea of what genealogical information you're looking for.,
Know the types of records you can consult at a library.,
Be aware of the types of libraries you can consult for doing genealogical research.,
Know the libraries' hours of operation.,
Take advantage of a library's online services before you visit.,
Bring along copies of information you already have on the ancestor(s) you plan to research when you do visit.",How to Trace Family Genealogy at the Library," Libraries can offer you a wealth of information about your ancestors, but without a plan or goal as to what you hope to learn, the information can overwhelm you. Choose 1 or more specific ancestors to research and a specific time period or historical event your ancestor(s) are known to be associated with to make your research more productive.


Many libraries offer classes in conducting genealogical research, which includes an overview of the resources their library offers. If you're new to researching your family history, you may want to attend one of these classes before you begin your research.;
, Libraries contain a number of records that can help you in your family history research, among which are the following:


Federal census records. In the United States, federal censuses are conducted every 10 years. Census records list all residents by household for a given jurisdictions, their names, genders, ages, occupations, places of birth, and other information, depending on the year the census was taken. U.S. census records are available to the public 72 years after the census was taken. Library copies of census records are most likely on microfilm, with a printed index to direct you to a particular microfilm roll.
State and local census records. State and local censuses may be conducted more or less frequently than federal censuses. Although they contain mostly the same information as federal censuses, they may include information not found in federal censuses, such as farm acreage, and if compiled between federal census years, can identify births, marriages, or deaths that may have occurred within the 10-year period between federal censuses. State censuses are typically on microform, while local census such as school censuses may be in book form.
Passenger lists. These records identify the name of the ship your ancestor sailed on, the date it arrived, and the port it arrived at. Depending on the library, this may be a microform record, or in an index book.
Naturalization records. These records give the date your ancestor became a citizen of the country he or she moved to.
Military service records. These include draft registration cards as well as actual records of which branch of the military your ancestor may have served in and dates of service.
Cemetery records. These are a row-by-row listing of the grave sites within a cemetery. They are usually compiled in book form by local historical or genealogical societies.
Obituaries. These may be organized in a card file or in book form. Depending on its length, an obituary can provide not only your ancestor's date and place of death, but details about his or her life that you can research further.
Biographies and memoirs. Biographies cover all the significant events in a person's life, while memoirs typically cover only a single significant event. These can be useful resources if your ancestor was famous enough to have his or her life story written or if he or she played a significant role in the life of a famous person covered in the biography.
Microfilm copies of old newspapers. Combing through old newspapers can provide you not only with birth, marriage, and death/funeral information on your ancestors but also significant events that occurred during their lives. Older small-town newspapers were often written in a style more similar to modern newsletters, with descriptions as colorful as your ancestors may have been.
Plat maps. Available on either microfilm or microfiche, these show where buildings were located inside cities and towns and where farms were located outside them.
Printed histories. City, county, state, or provincial histories can be in soft- or hard-cover form and are usually written in conjunction with an anniversary of the jurisdiction's founding or of the larger jurisdiction it is part of. If your ancestor played a role in the history of that jurisdiction, the printed record should tell you what it was.
Printed genealogies. Many libraries that offer records for genealogical research also have copies of family histories previously published by others. These records can be useful to you if you discover that you're related to one of the families covered in these genealogies, and they can also give you ideas on how to format your own family history when you publish it.

, Tracing your family history requires consulting many sources and piecing the bits of information into a concrete whole. You may have to consult more than 1 library, and different types of libraries, to get all the information you need.


Public libraries are found in most city or county jurisdictions. Although best known for lending books on various subjects to cardholders, including books on how to do genealogical research and books on various aspects of history, many libraries also keep a number of records on microfilm or microfiche. Some libraries have dedicated genealogy sections with many of the same records kept at government libraries and free Internet access to subscription-based genealogical websites such as Ancestry.com. Access to the library is generally free, including a library card for residents of the geographic area the library serves to check out materials, while non-residents may be charged a fee to check materials out. There may also be fees for services such as printing, copying, and mailing.
University libraries are found on college campuses. They have many of the same resources as public libraries, although their collections may include the private effects of outstanding alumni or materials related to the areas of research the college is engaged in. Current students can usually check out books for free, while others may have to pay a fee to check out materials from a college library.
Government libraries and archives are usually located in federal, state, and provincial capitals. They may contain birth, marriage, and death records for the jurisdictions they cover, state or federal census records, military service records, prison records, and other vital records. They may also contain biographies of government officials or other outstanding citizens, indices of church and cemetery records, and microfilm copies of newspapers from cities within their jurisdictions, as well as published genealogies compiled by others. Government libraries usually permit access to their materials on-site, but do not offer materials that can be checked out.
The Family History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormon) in Salt Lake City, Utah has 4,500 satellite Family History Center branches located around the world. It offers a broad spectrum of genealogical records, many in microfilm and some on compact disc, and also provides Internet access to use its online resources. LDS Family History Center services are open to all for free, with fees for photocopies, computer printouts, and the shipping cost of sending microfilms from the main library to a requesting branch.
Genealogical or historical societies may maintain their own private archives. Direct access may be restricted to only members of that society, although they will assist you in researching the information contained in their archive.

, This information is usually available on the website of the library in question, although it may be necessary to verify the information by telephone before visiting.


Main branches of public libraries in large cities are usually open all 7 days of the week, with morning and afternoon hours Monday through Saturday, evening hours Monday through Friday, and afternoon only hours on Sunday.
Public libraries in smaller cities and satellite branches in larger cities may be open fewer hours, according to how the city allocates its budget to the library system.
College libraries may or may not be open during periods when classes are not in session.
LDS Family History Centers determine their own hours. Hours of operation may be listed for a particular center on the Family Search website, or you may be provided with a telephone number to call to obtain the hours.

, Many libraries now post their card catalogs online, allowing you to reserve books or to learn if someone else has already checked out that book. Libraries with frequently used genealogical resources may also post a list of those resources, and in some cases the actual resources themselves online, such as the Denver Library's directory of settlers during the Pike's Peak gold rush. Knowing whether a library has the resource you're looking for before you contact or visit that library will save you time and spare you frustration in your search.


Many libraries that contain genealogical resources also feature links to other genealogical resources on their websites. Some of these resources may help you identify what resources the library offers will help you in your research, while others will help you in researching the answers to the questions your library research raises.
If you have identified a particular book or other resource from another library that can help you in your research, check to see if your local library has it in its catalog or can obtain it for you through interlibrary loan.

, You'll want the information on hand to refer to as you do your research. Items such as family group charts, pedigree charts, and research logs will present your current information in an organized form. You'll also want to have a number of blank forms to fill in with the information you gather during your research.


If you work with a laptop computer, have your information available in both digital and hard-copy format, for both your own convenience and that of the staff assisting you.

Communicate your support.,
Bring your friend food.,
Send a gift to your friend and friend’s family.,
Attend the funeral.",How to Help a Friend Who Has Lost a Family Member1," Social support from family and friends is crucial to helping someone deal with the death of a loved one.Once you find out that your friend lost a loved one, you can let your friend know that you are there for her.


Make sure you verbalize your condolences. You can say something like, “I am so sorry for your loss.”
You can start by saying that you are available if she needs to talk with you or spend time with you. You can say something like, “I know this is a difficult time for you and I just want you to know that I am here for you. Is there any way I can help?”
Offer to help your friend with any practical tasks. During this time, your friend may have to help cover costs of the funeral, unpaid bills, clean out her loved one’s home, go through items, and deal with other financial and legal concerns.You can offer your help and support if you feel comfortable.;
, Practical help is often lost on friends of the bereaved.However, many people who have lost loved ones are consumed with grief. A great way to help your friend in this time is to make a home cooked meal, or pick up her favorite meal, and deliver it to her. This is a common gesture (depending on your culture) that can produce feelings of being supported, which is important in helping individuals cope with grief.Good food ideas are: home-made lasagna, a casserole, banana bread, and soup.
Try to prepare dishes that can be put in the microwave or oven easily. Provide simple instructions on a post-it note if needed.

, Gifts can be seen as an act of compassion; these gestures can provide a great sense of comfort to those who are grieving.Try to avoid giving your friend any gift that will remind her of her loved one that passed away.

While that may be true on a superficial level, at first, if you bottle up your feelings inside, you won’t be able to truly move forward. Instead, slow down, get some time to yourself, and let yourself cry, be angry, feel emotional, or just to get in touch with your feelings in the best way that you can.


Just taking some time alone to cry can help you feel like you’re on the path to getting better. Though no one likes crying, this is perfectly healthy and can help you express your emotions.
For most people, crying is essential/natural. Many people find however that after a few days or so to continue work/school because it helps take your mind off the loss and can help you rationalize the problem.
That said, not everyone cries after the death of a loved one. If you’re not crying, this doesn’t mean that you don’t care about the person who passed away; it just means that you’re dealing with the situation differently. Don’t feel guilty for not crying or force yourself to do something you don’t want to do, or don’t feel ready for.
You can let your feelings out when you’re alone in your room, or even by talking to a loved one about what you’re going through. You can decide what makes you feel more comfortable.
Writing in a journal during a time of sadness can also help you feel more centered and more in control.;
, After you let all of your feelings out, it’s important to recognize that yes, you are experiencing grief. Grief takes time to process, and when you’re grieving, it’s likely that you won’t be able to enjoy many of the things that normally make you happy. You may want to stay in instead of going out with friends. You may be able to barely muster a chuckle over your favorite hilarious TV show. You may look at your textbook and think all of the words are blurring together. Accept that you’re going through a difficult time instead of trying to move on too fast, and know that it will get better.If you need to take some time off from work or school to deal with this difficult situation, then that’s perfectly natural. It can be hard to go through the motions when you feel so devastated; others, however, find comfort in their old routines. It’s important to do what’s best for you.
Don’t force yourself to be social. You may not want to hang out with your usual group of friends or to go to a big party. Though you shouldn’t completely isolate yourself, you shouldn’t go out there with a big fake smile on your face when you’d rather be curled up into a ball at home. , Though spending some time alone can help you process what happened, you don’t want to be in that state forever. If you want to go on living when someone you love dies, then you should make sure you have a shoulder or two to cry on; talk to your friends, family members, or even people in your extended social network if you can’t find anyone closer, and let them know that you’re going to need some help during this difficult time.


Don’t feel like you’re burdening your friends by being sad all of the time; they care for you and expect that this is exactly how you will feel. If you don’t want your friends to be near you during this difficult time, then what are they for?
Of course, you don’t need your friends and family to be near you 24/7 during this time and may even prefer to be alone a lot of the time. However, you should still let them know that you’d appreciate it if they were there when you needed them.

, Some people have this idea of people who are going through grief as being these strong, admirable creatures who impress everyone with their composure and dignity. Well, sure, some people who deal with loss may be like that, but you may have seen many of them on TV. Don’t force yourself to act like everything is “fine” and that you’re having no trouble moving on. Though you don’t have to cry in public if you don’t want to, you shouldn’t try to make everyone around you think that you’re tough, either.


Remember that your friends and family members care about you. They want you to be honest and open with them, not to to try fool them with some tough exterior.
Dealing with pain and loss is enough of a struggle; you don’t need to make your life more complicated by also pretending that you’re doing just fine.

, Though you may think that you should be “fine” and ready to move on after a certain period of time just because that’s what you read someone or because that’s how long you think it took for your best friend to get over the same loss in her life, you should throw any ideas of a timeline out the window. Don’t force yourself to feel “fine” by a certain date or you’re just liable to get frustrated and to feel disappointed in yourself for not following through.This is the time to be generous, not strict with yourself. Don’t tell yourself that you have to act a certain way by a certain time and focus on healing from within instead.
Don’t compare yourself to how other people have dealt with loss. Your best friend or cousin might have put on a sunny exterior after a loss after a short amount of time, but you don’t know what they were going through on the inside.

, In your time of need, your friends and family members can give you the support you’re looking for. Whether you’re just watching a movie with your family or telling your best friend about all of the sadness you’re feeling, making sure to connect with your loved ones can help you be on the way to moving forward with your life. You can’t stay trapped inside your own head forever or you won’t be able to start enjoying your relationships again.If you lost a family member, then spending time with other members of your family and sharing your memories of the person you love can help you feel less alone. Remember that you don’t have to avoid talking about the person you lost to move forward.
When you spend time with your friends, you don’t need to go out to bars or big, loud, parties; just grabbing coffee with a close friend, going for a walk, or watching a lighthearted movie with a close friend can help you move toward the path to healing.

, Being in a session with multiple people who are dealing with similar experiences can make you feel less alone and can help you find new ways to cope. It can also open you up to new relationships and can help you feel less alone in your struggle to move forward after losing a loved one. Having a support group to go to at least once or twice a week can give you something to look forward to and will make you feel like you have a new support system.Tell yourself you’ll at least give it a chance. Don’t judge what a support group is until you’ve met the people there and have heard their stories. You may find that you feel even more comfortable sharing your story with new people who are going through the same thing.

, If you do believe in a religion, then you can help yourself go on living by spending more time in your faith-based community. Whether you spend more time at your church, synagogue, mosque, or another religious establishment, you’ll be able to not only find comfort in your faith but to spend more time in a community of like-minded people who truly care for one another.


Even going to your religious establishment just once a week can give you something positive to look forward to in your routine.
Your faith-based community may also alert you to more events, such as volunteering opportunities, which can help you spend your time in a productive way.

, Though therapy isn’t for everyone, you shouldn’t rule it out before you give it a chance. If you feel that you’re having trouble coping on your own or with friends and family, then your best bet may be to get the help of a knowledgeable professional who can talk to you about your feelings and mental state and can recommend the best course of action. Therapy or grief counselling can help you get a new perspective on your situation and to find new ways to get help.


Don’t think that you’re admitting weakness by seeking therapy. In fact, quite the opposite is true; you’re showing strength by being comfortable saying that you need more help.

, Though you may think it’s silly to get a little cat or a dog during a time of great loss, it can actually improve your mental state quite a bit. Having a beloved pet can give you someone to cuddle and spend time with as well as someone who needs you to take care of him; this can give you a sense of meaning and purpose. Of course, getting a kitten won’t bring your beloved mother or father back, but it can help you to go on living.


Go to an animal shelter to bring home a rescue animal. You’ll feel even better for bringing home an animal who really needs your love and care.

, Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to make you feel better, and some people may even unintentionally make you feel worse. People may say things they don’t really mean because they think it’ll make you feel better or because they think it’s what you’re supposed to say, and it may come off the wrong way. Try to let these people know how they could be more helpful or even steer them in the right direction, or just try to spend as little time with them as possible if they’re really bothering you.


People may do things like compare your loss of your closest relative to the loss of a casual acquaintance or distant cousin; they may say, “He’s in a better place”, or they may even say that it took them “a few weeks” to get back into the swing of things after so-and-so died. People may not mean to be hurtful and just want you to feel better, even if they have a poor way of expressing it.
Remember that, if you’re spending too much energy being frustrated with people who don’t know how to help, it may just be that you’re taking all of your negative energy or sadness out on the wrong situation. It’s natural that you’re feeling frustrated, but make sure you don’t take those feelings out on the wrong people; it’s just not worth it.

, As you continue to move forward and to spend more time with people out in the world, don’t force yourself to be cheerful, extra friendly, and super peppy if you feel like crying on the inside. While you may want to hold off on showing the extent of your sad feelings in public, you certainly shouldn’t try to fake the fact that you’re going through a difficult time. If you try to convince your friends and family members that you’re “just fine,” then it’s likely that they will be able to tell that you’re bluffing pretty fast.


It can be exhausting to put up a cheerful front if you’re not feeling your best. Exerting this kind of energy in a false way can actually make you feel much worse.

, You may feel like the death of your loved one has made you realize that you need to quit your job, sell your house, or move immediately, but you should take some time to think before you make any big decisions. You don’t want to make a decision and then have to deal with regretting it while also coping with your grief. Instead, make sure you give it at least a few months, think about it with a clear head, and talk it through with some friends to make sure it’s really the best choice for you.Though you may think that making a big decision or getting rid of what you see as unnecessary baggage in your life can make your burden lighter, chances are that the decision will give you more to deal with during a difficult time.

, Though getting 8 hours of sleep or eating cruciferous vegetables may be the furthest thing from your mind when you’re coping with grief, if you want to be able to go on living, then you have to remember to take care of yourself. Staying as healthy as you can will make you feel more physically and mentally tough and can make you feel more capable of dealing with the challenges life has thrown at you. Here are some things you should make sure to do:Get at least 7-8 hours of sleep and go to bed and wake up around the same time every night
Eat three healthy, balanced meals a day that include lean proteins, fruits and vegetables, and healthy carbs.
Pay attention to your hygiene. It’s important to shower, bathe, and groom yourself regularly so you feel more ready to face the world.
Get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day if you can. Even going for a walk instead of driving can help you get your adrenalin pumping and can make you feel more mentally and physically sound.

, As you begin to feel like you’re moving forward, you can let yourself get out of your comfort zone a bit more. Instead of just spending time watching TV with your friend, venture out to a restaurant with a friend or two, or even go to a small party if you’re feeling up to it. Though you don’t need to force yourself to go out there before you’re ready, once you’re feeling antsy by yourself, it can help you to spend more time connecting with people.


You don’t have to fill your social calendar with a million different events. In fact, it’s important to continue to make time for decompressing and reflecting on your own.
If you’re normally a social drinker, you should avoid alcohol until you feel more emotionally stable. Alcohol is a depressant, and while it may numb the pain at first, it can actually lead you to feel more sad and unstable after you’ve had a drink or two. Don’t let your friends pressure you into drinking if you’re not ready for it, either.

, Once you begin to gather your strength, you can go back to doing the things you love and the things that make you happy. Though you may not feel like watercolor painting, doing yoga, or playing guitar, at first, you’ll find yourself missing out on your favorite activities little by little. Set aside at least a few hours each week to do the things you love and let yourself get immersed in them.


Though you can’t distract yourself away from your pain forever, devoting yourself to something you care about can help you heal faster than doing something that numbs your mind, such as watching reality TV. Of course, though, there’s room for both, and if you’re not up to doing something you care about yet, be patient with yourself.
If you feel like you don’t have anything that you really care about, you can think about finding a new passion and throwing yourself into that.

, Just because you’re getting back into the swing of things, it doesn’t mean that you have to completely forget about the person you lost. You can still honor the person’s memory by talking about that person with loved ones who cared about him, visiting his grave, looking over photos or prized possessions that remind you of him, or just taking contemplative walks and thinking about that person. This can help you come to terms with the fact that the person is gone, while also keeping the person’s love alive in your memory.If it’s too painful for you to think about the person right now, then you can wait until you feel more comfortable.

, This step may seem like it’s the hardest to achieve, but you will be able to do it. This doesn’t mean you have to “find closure” or stop thinking about the person you love in order to be able to find the joy and happiness in your life again. Once you feel like you’re on the path to healing, you can begin to appreciate anything from a beautiful sunset to a long night spent with a good friend. You may feel like it’s impossible to do this from where you’re standing but one day, you’ll be able to go on living when someone you love dies.


If you take the time to appreciate the little things, from the loving touch of your kitty to an amazing home cooked meal, you’ll be moving toward not only living your life again, but to living it to the fullest.
Be patient with yourself. Things will seem drab, dark, and hopeless for a long time. But as long as you make the effort to move forward and take care of yourself, you will be able to feel joy again.

Think of the future.",How to Get over the Death of Someone You Love," Grief is very, very painful. However, working through this pain is necessary in order to heal and move on from a great loss.Try to resist the urge to shut down, go numb, or pretend like your loved one has not died. Do not deny that something bad has happened to you and that you are hurting. Grieving is healthy: it is not a sign of weakness., While everyone grieves differently, grieving people often have stages of grief in common. The stage theory of grief is not supported by all psychologists, though recent studies show that it effectively captures the experience of most grieving people.If you learn about these stages of grief, you will be prepared for the strong emotions they evoke. Knowing the stages of grief in advance will not eliminate your pain, but it might make you more equipped to face the pain.


Note that you might not go through these stages in the typical order. Sometimes grieving people repeat steps, remain in one step for a long time, experience multiple steps all at once, or go through the stages in a completely different order. Sometimes the bereaved are able to move on very quickly with their lives without going through the steps at all.Remember that each individual grieves differently. But identifying the stages of grief can still help you understand your experience., Immediately after your loved one dies, you might feel numb. You might also not be able to believe that your loved one is really gone.These feelings are more common in those who are grieving the loss of someone who died suddenly.Because of this disbelief, you might not be able to cry or show much emotion. This is not a sign that you don't care: indeed, this is a sign that you care very much. Denial can help you get through the early days of your grief by allowing you to plan a funeral, contact other bereaved people, or handle financial matters.Often the memorial service or funeral can help make the death seem real.If you have been preparing for your loved one's death for a long time, you might not experience denial or disbelief. For example, if your loved one experienced a lengthy terminal illness, you might have processed your disbelief before their death., After the reality of the death sets in, you might feel angry. You might direct your anger at anything: at yourself, at your family, at your friends, at people who have not experienced a loss, at the doctors, at the funeral director, or even at your loved one who is gone.Do not feel guilty about this anger. It is normal and healthy.

, If you have just lost a loved one, you might fantasize about everything you could have done to prevent the death.You might feel remorse and try to make deals to bring your loved one back. If you find yourself thinking, ""If I had only done something differently,"" or ""I swear I will be a better person if my loved one comes back,"" you are probably in this stage of grief. Just remember that your loved one's death is not a karmic punishment for you: you didn't do anything to deserve this pain. Death can be random, sudden, and illogical.

, This stage might be the longest one in the grieving process. It can be accompanied by physical symptoms such as loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and crying jags. You might feel the need to isolate yourself as you mourn and confront your sadness.Sadness and depression are completely normal, but if you find yourself engaging in self-harming behaviors or losing your ability to function, you will need to talk to a doctor or therapist., This is usually the last step in the grieving process, and it means that you have learned how to live without your loved one. While you will always feel the loss, you will be able to establish a ""new normal"" without your loved one in the picture. Sometimes people feel guilty about being able to reestablish a normal life after the death of a loved one and believe that moving on is somehow a betrayal.However, remember that your loved one wouldn't want you to be depressed forever. It is important that you live your life in a way that will honor the memories and gifts that your loved one gave to you before she died.

, Much of the grieving process can take place over the course of a calendar year. However, grief can also reappear at sudden moments for many years after the loss: at holidays, anniversaries, or even during a particularly sad day.Keep in mind that you cannot get through grief on a schedule. Different people will progress differently through grief, and you might continue to grieve throughout your life.


While some grief and sadness is normal for many years after a loss, these feelings of sadness should not keep you from leading a normal life. If you are unable to function because of your grief--even years after a loss--you might want to consider grief counseling or therapy. These sad feelings might always be a part of your life, but they should not be the dominant force in your life., Many of the stages of grief encourage you to feel isolated and alone. While much of your grieving process will be solitary, you will likely find solace in the company of other mourners who miss your loved one just like you. Share your own painful emotions with your support network as well as happy memories of your loved one who is gone. They will be able to understand your pain in a way that nobody else will. Share this pain together so that you can all begin to move on.

, Other mourners will be able to help share your pain. But other people in your support network who are not in mourning will be able to help you get your life back on track. Don't hesitate to reach out to your network if you need help taking care of your children, taking care of your house, or distracting yourself.Feel free to be specific about what you ask for. If you have no food in the fridge, ask your friend to bring over some take-out. If you cannot muster the energy to drive your children to school, ask a neighbor to pitch in. You will be surprised by how many people will step up to support you.
Don't be embarrassed by your mourning. You might find yourself crying unexpectedly, telling the same stories over and over, or processing your anger in front of others. Don't feel ashamed of these behaviors: they are normal, and your loved ones will understand., While most people can grieve on their own and with the support of friends and family, about 15-20% of mourners will need to seek extra support. If you are feeling isolated, if you live far away from friends and family, or if you are finding it difficult to function, you will likely need professional support.Ask your doctor to give you a recommendation for a bereavement counselor, support groups, or a therapist who can help you process your grief.


If you are a religious or spiritual person, consider contacting a religious organization for guidance. Many spiritual leaders have experience counseling the bereaved, and you can gain solace from their wisdom.

, In the days and weeks immediately following your loved one's death, your physical routine might get disrupted. You will likely have trouble eating, sleeping, and exercising. After some time has passed, you will need to reestablish your healthy habits in order to get your life back on track.

, Even if you are not feeling hungry, try to eat healthy meals at regularly scheduled intervals.Eating nutritious foods at regular times will help elevate your mood and will establish a sense of normalcy after a traumatic event.


Resist the urge to self-medicate with alcohol or drugs. While they might seem to provide some relief, they might make it more difficult to recover in the long run. Healthy habits will be more effective at letting you move on with your life., Exercise can serve as a welcome distraction from your grief. By focusing on your body, your mind will be able to take a much-needed break--even if only for a few minutes.Exercise can also help keep your mood elevated, especially if you exercise outdoors on a sunny day., While you might not be able to sleep well while you are grieving, there are steps you can take to try to get a good night's rest and reestablish healthy sleep patterns.Try to sleep in a cool, dark place.
Avoid bright screens before bedtime.
Establish bedtime rituals, such as reading a book or listening to a soothing song before bed.
Avoid caffeine and alcohol in the evenings.
If your loved one slept in your bed with you, consider sleeping on their side of the bed for a while. You will feel connected with them and will be less likely to be startled that their side of the bed is empty., If your old habits are making it difficult for you to move on with your life, find some new patterns for a while. This doesn't mean that you are abandoning your loved one. Instead, it means that you are planning for your future.If you feel like you cannot move on because everything in your home reminds you of your loved one, consider rearranging the furniture.
If you watched a television program with your loved one, try to find a new friend to watch the program with you.
If a particular street corner is a painful reminder of your loved one, find a different walking route.
Remember that you can return to your old activities once your grief has subsided. You are not forgetting your loved one. Instead, you are allowing yourself to move on. This will allow your memories of your loved one to bring you joy instead of crippling sadness.

, After the initial loss and pain, try to reintroduce your favorite habits and routines back into your life. These will serve as a distraction from your pain and will allow you to get to a ""new normal."" These activities are especially important if they are a source of friendship and companionship.

, After some time has passed, you might want to get back to your job. Maybe you wish to return to work because you love your job, or perhaps you have to return to work for financial reasons. While the initial return might be difficult, getting back to your job will also allow you to think about the future instead of your past.


Ask if you can have a lighter schedule at first. It is possible that you will not return to full work duties right away. Perhaps you will be able to work part-time or have reduced duties for a while. Talk to your office about accommodations they can make.Communicate with your work about your needs. If you do not wish to talk about your loved one at work, you can request that your coworkers avoid the topic. If you wish to talk about your loved one at work, a grief counselor might be able to teach your colleagues about appropriate ways to discuss such a sensitive issue., It is possible that you will want to sell your house or move cities after a loss. However, these are not decisions to be taken lightly, especially if you are in emotional turmoil. Before making any major permanent decisions, take some time to consider the consequences of those decisions. You might also want to consider discussing them with your therapist.

, If there is a place you've always wanted to visit or a hobby you always wanted to try, now might be a great time to do something new. These new experiences won't eliminate your pain, but they might allow you to meet new people and find new pathways to happiness.You can also consider undertaking new activities with others who are mourning a loss, so that you can process the experience of moving on together.

, After a loss, you might find yourself getting distracted, making mistakes at work, or letting things around the house slide. Forgive yourself for any errors you might make. These are normal and to be expected. You will not be able to pretend like nothing has happened, and it might take a long time to feel normal again after a loss. Give yourself that time to recover., Even after you reestablish your life after a loss, your grief might come back at unexpected times. Think of grief like a wave that sometimes subsides and sometimes returns.Let yourself feel these feelings whenever they occur, and reach out to friends when you need to.

, The process of mourning does not only honor the dead but also allows the living to accept a loss. Many rituals of mourning occur during a funeral or memorial service. For example, wearing a particular color of clothing or reciting a particular set of prayers can allow a group of mourners to perform their grief together. No matter your culture or the culture of your loved one, a mourning ritual can help start the healing process.

, Studies show that continuing ritual behaviors can help a mourner move on with life, especially when these rituals occur well after a funeral.These rituals are often unique to the mourner and the person mourned, but they can be an important way to honor the memory of the dead while allowing the living to heal.You might consider private rituals like:


Touching an object owned by your loved one every time you feel sad.
Sitting on your loved one's favorite park bench once a week.
Listening to your loved one's favorite album when you cook a meal.
Saying good-night to your loved one before bed each night.

, As you move on with your life, you might find that you can think of your loved one and feel happy instead of sad or pained. Embrace your feelings of joy and happiness, and think of all the gifts your loved one has provided for you. In order to help your memories feel happy instead of sad, consider finding ways to preserve the memory of your loved one's life. You can then return to these memories and share them with others.

, Talk to friends and family members about their favorite experiences with your loved one. Did your loved one have any favorite jokes or stories to tell? Are there any photographs that capture your loved one's laughter? Gather images, memories, and quotations together into a memory book. On days that are particularly sad, you can read the memory book and remember the joy your loved one brought into the world.

, Consider hanging a picture of yourself with your loved one on the wall or putting together a photo album. Remind yourself that your loved one's death was not the defining moment of their life. The time they spent with you was much more important.

, You do not necessarily need a physical object to preserve a loved one's memory. Instead, you can gather together everyone who cared about your loved one and share your experiences. Remember the good times, the laughter, and the wisdom imparted by your loved one.

, When you find yourself thinking of your loved one, write your thoughts and memories down in a journal. Perhaps you will remember a wonderful experience that you hadn't thought of in a very long time. Or perhaps you will remember a time when you felt angry at your loved one, and you need to process that anger. Do not push thoughts of your loved one away: embrace these memories as a part of your life and your future.


If you feel overwhelmed by the thought of keeping a journal, set a structure for yourself. For example, write for 10 minutes each day, use guided prompts to organize your thoughts, or start off by writing lists instead of full sentences.

, Above all, continue to move forward with your life and seek your own happiness. Your loved one would not want you to get stuck in a cycle of despair. Grieve, move on, and live your life. You can move into a bright and happy future and take the memories of your loved one with you.

Spend time with your friend.,
Express empathy and listen actively.,
Give your friend time.,
Provide for space.",How to Help a Friend Who Has Lost a Family Member2," The most important part of helping your friend feel better, is to spend time with her if she is open to it.One way you can initiate contact with your friend is by texting or calling her and saying, ""I know this is hard and I want to be there for you. Can we spend some time together?"" Depending on how your friend responds you can act accordingly. She may not feel up to it, so don't press the issue; say something like, ""I completely understand. Please do let me know if you want me to come over in the future. Also, if you need anything else don't hesitate to ask.""
Your friend may just want a shoulder to cry on, or someone to sit around in pajamas with. Be open to just sitting around and tolerating her being sad. Try not to cheer her up if she doesn't request it.

, Many grieving individuals report a need to talk about their grief and loss with others.If your friend wants to talk about her grief or the loss of her loved one, listen. Do not immediately change the subject in order to try to make yourself or her feel better. Let her express her emotions and thoughts about what happened and listen attentively.


Focus on your friend’s personal values and beliefs. For example, avoid saying generalized things like, “they are in a better place now” to people who are not religious or do not believe in an afterlife.
You can express your empathy by saying, “I know how hard this is for you.” You can even tell her about a time that you experienced a loss in order to empathize further and communicate your understanding of her feelings.

, Don’t expect your friend to bounce back immediately. Everyone grieves differently. Some people cry and can’t get out of bed for days, while others go back to work immediately. Fortunately, people can be very resilient in the face of loss and most individuals do recover.Be patient with your friend during the grief process.

, Give your friend space if she needs it or requests it. Some people may need more connection during this time, while others will need space.This is due to different attachment styles that people have based on their upbringing and family relationships; some people may be more avoidant of connection in times of stress, some may want more attention when they are sad, while others are more balanced in their needs (wanting both connection and space).


If your friend refuses to see you or doesn’t want to talk, don’t take it personally. She could just be too tired or depressed to want to interact with anyone, and this is completely normal.

"
"
Distract your friend.,
Invite your friend to join you in an event or activity.,
Encourage positive coping.,
Help your friend find ways to keep the relationship alive.,
Encourage treatment if your friend is struggling.",How to Help a Friend Who Has Lost a Family Member3," Once your friend has made it through the initial stages of grief, she may be ready to focus on something else in order to distract herself from feelings of loss. If your friend is open to it, you can invite your friend over to your house.Make sure you don’t force the issue on her, and ensure that she really wants company.


You can watch TV, play video games, have a home spa, or anything to take their mind off of her family member. Make sure your friend enjoys what you are doing.

, Remember you are trying to make your friend happy, so let her choose.


Offer to take your friend to the movies, a sporting event, a roller/ice skating rink, or anything else they enjoy doing.
If she is not ready to do anything, don’t push the issue. Some people may need more space than others, so adjust your approach accordingly.Perhaps just talk to your friend on the phone if she isn’t ready to go out in public yet.
Try to go to places that aren't very crowded.

, Coping resources are integral to helping a friend through the grief process. You can suggests certain ways of coping that you think might help your friend.


To personalize it, think of activities that your friend previously enjoyed doing (but maybe now feels too upset to engage in) such as certain sports or games. Offer to go along with your friend while she does these things.
Story-telling about the loved one or journaling about the loved one can help individuals cope with the death of a loved one.If you notice that your friend is having difficulty coping you can ask, “Have you ever tried writing about it? I’ve heard that writing down stories of times you spent with your loved one can be helpful.”
Rituals and symbolic activities can also help with the grieving process. This include family traditions, activities shared with the deceased loved one, and religious activities or traditions (prayer, meditation, attending religious services).You can assist your friend in finding information on how to healthfully grieve. One way to gain education is to learn about the five stages of grief.If your friend is a minor, or open to young-minded literature, you can encourage her to read information that is geared toward young people about how to cope with the death of a loved one.

, Loss is not a state of being, but a process. A person may continue to grieve the loss of a person throughout her life. Grief and loss is not solely about letting go of the loved one, but about creating meaningful ways to continue to cherish and remember the loved one.Some ways to keep the relationship alive include: dedicating a project to the person, continuing or finishing a project the person was involved in, passing on the values of the loved one to others, planting a garden in memory of the individual, lighting a candle in memory,and the list goes on.
Another way to keep the relationship alive is to make a scrapbook with pictures of the family being happy with the lost relative.

, In one study, 1/3 of grieving individuals reported a need for professional assistance or health services during the grief process.Additionally, chronic depression may occur in 10-15% of individuals who lose a loved one.Some symptoms of bereavement include: difficulty organizing thoughts, dysphoria (dissatisfaction with life), health problems, and lowered social and occupational functioning.These symptoms can last several months to years.There are therapists or grief counselors that specialize in the treatment of individuals who have experienced a loss.
If your friend is school aged (5-18) and lost her parents or a caregiver, she may need additional help.You can discuss your concern for your friend with a school counselor in order to get her the help she needs.
A Bereavement support group can also be a helpful and relieving option because it can give people the sense that others share their pain."

Take the time you need: at first, you may feel like you are numb, or in shock.,
Read or listen to the stories of others: In her memoir North of Hope, Shannon Polson writes about her parents being killed by a grizzly bear while they were on a river trip in the Arctic.,
Take a trip: Sometimes visiting your parents’ home, or the place they died, can be a healing journey when you’re ready for it.,
Let grief progress toward acceptance: As her trip concluded, Polson realized that she had needed to grieve, but that the best way to honor the loss of her parents was to accept their death, and to go on living herself.,
Take care of yourself: When you are lost in grief, it’s easy to ignore basic care of yourself—eating well, getting some exercise, getting enough sleep.,
Write: As you grieve, you may want to keep a journal or scrapbook in which you can write, or collect photos or memorabilia.",How to Grieve a Parent's Unexpected Death," Allow yourself the time to just feel sad, or angry, or whatever feelings come. And those feelings are likely to come in waves, slowly. The process of letting go may feel uneven: you’ll feel as if you are healing, but then something will trigger more sadness. Give yourself plenty of time for this slow process. There is no right way to feel; accept what comes.;
, She writes: “The shock protects you from the horror for a while, a brief respite from cutting pain to come, a padding of grace. Even when you think you are feeling the pain, it has yet to begin.” If you've lost a parent unexpectedly, reading books like Polson's can help you know you're not alone.

, A trip to another place that is peaceful might also give the change of scenery and routine you need to bring a different perspective to what otherwise feels debilitating. Although it may seem counter-intuitive, sometimes going to the place where someone died and doing something to remember your loved one may help bring a sense of peace. Polson returned to the Alaskan wilderness where her parents had been killed by a bear. She took the same rafting trip they’d taken, visited the campsite where they’d died. Although it was a demanding trip physically and emotionally, it was ultimately healing. She writes: “I was beginning the same trip they had started a year before. But while the geography and mode of travel were identical, nothing else about this trip was similar. This was not simply a trip into the wilderness, though that would be challenge and adventure enough. This was a journey over the jagged edge of loss.”

, She wrote, “This acceptance I was beginning to feel, like the movement of air from a wing, had something to do with surrender. It had something to do with endurance. It had something to do with faith. The line between the living and the dead may not be much of a line at all, but the terrain is not for the weak of heart. It is treacherous going.”

, Some people will try to distract themselves by over-working or staying very busy. You may feel as if you don’t care about anything. Even if it feels like just “going through the motions,” make sure you get enough sleep, do your best to eat healthy meals, and take walks or another favorite activity. Grief is exhausting. Reduce your obligations for a while if you can. Go easy on yourself—don’t be too self-critical.

, Writing down your feelings and memories will help you heal from the loss of your parent. You can do this in a traditional paper journal, or online with a blog or even just journaling on a computer. You may want to read other people’s memoirs or blogs about their own grieving process. This doesn’t have to be anything you share with anyone else, but the process of writing can itself be healing.

Keep copies of the obituary to send to distant relatives and friends.",How to Write a Funeral Program Obituary," Include their contact information. These people will be able to provide information and anecdotes about the different stages and aspects of your loved one’s life.


Aim to speak with no more than five people. While you want to get a complete picture, you don’t want to overwhelm yourself with information or repetitive stories.
Make sure that your list includes people from different aspects of the person’s life. For example, include a colleague who will be able to supply details about your loved one’s work history and personality as a coworker. Often younger people, such as grandchildren, will have special perspectives and stories of their own that may add a warm, human touch to the obituary.

, This is the scaffolding for the obituary you will write. You may know some of the information off the top of your head, but be sure to double-check important facts and dates. Other material can be filled in when you speak with the people who knew your loved one. Your list might include:


Date and location of birth.
Date and cause of death.
Full names of parents and other close relatives who died before your loved one.
Full names of spouses, children, and any other close survivors.
Details about education. Did your loved one earn any diplomas or degrees? Where and in what year?
Details about work. You don’t need to write a full resume of your loved one’s career, but make sure you have the general outlines about where he worked, what he did, and for how long.
Any clubs or organizations that were important in your loved one’s life. For example, was she on a local sports team? Was he a Mason?

Details about funeral arrangements, including visiting hours and any requests about flowers or donations.

, Ask them for help in filling in the missing pieces of information about your loved one’s life. You might share your template with them and ask what information they know. Or, you might ask them what should be added. A colleague, for example, might know about an award your loved one received at work.


If possible, try meeting with more than one person at a time. A group setting might generate memories as well as being a nice opportunity for quietly remembering and honoring your loved one.

, The funeral program obituary has room for two or three anecdotes that capture the spirit of your loved one. Listen to the stories people share about your loved one and jot them down.


Be sure to ask permission before including someone else’s anecdote in your obituary. For example, you might say: “Aunt Louise, is it alright if I tell that story about catching the rainbow trout in Grandpa’s obituary?” If they say no, let it go.
Look for anecdotes that reflect larger themes in your loved one’s life. For example, if your loved one was known for helping others, an anecdote about the time she stopped to change a stranger’s tire in a snowstorm might be appropriate.

, If your grandmother says your grandfather graduated college in 1949, but your mother says it was 1951, call the university registrar to find out the correct year. Birth, marriage, and death years can be confirmed through a call to vital records offices in the relevant city or town.If you can’t resolve a disagreement, consider omitting the information or putting it vaguely. For example, you might say: “She began working as a physician in the early 1970s” if one person says it was 1972 and another says it was 1971. You don’t want your obituary to become a source of tension at a difficult time.

, The first paragraph of any obituary includes these details.You may also choose to include information about your loved one’s current residence.


It is not necessary to go into detail about the cause of death, but only to share what feels appropriate. For example, you could say that your loved one died after a long illness or died suddenly., Include her date of birth and the names of her parents. If there was a significant move in your loved one’s early life, mention it here. For example, you might want to state that he was born in Greece but immigrated to the United States as a young child.

, Include details about schools attended and degrees earned.This paragraph can also be the place to introduce important themes in your loved one’s life story. Did she first discover her love of literature while an English major in college, for example?

,


You might proceed by writing a paragraph on each significant aspect of your loved one’s life: work, hobbies, and family, for example.
Alternatively, you might choose to develop a narrative about your loved one. For example, if her crowning achievement was a position in national government, you might want to write several paragraphs describing how she earned the knowledge and experience necessary to get there.

, Use anecdotes and other personal details. Weave these elements into the larger life story. They should help to convey the overall tone of your loved one’s life.For example, if your loved one adored jokes, you might include one or two of his most famous humorous quotes.
The obituary of a beloved teacher might include a story from a former student about what it was like to be in her classroom.

, You should include relatives who predeceased your loved one as well as your loved one’s survivors.Begin this paragraph by saying that your loved one was “preceded in death by” the close relatives who have already died. Then, say that your loved one “is survived by” the close relatives who are still living. It is customary to list the cities or towns where the living relatives currently reside.

, While the newspaper version of the obituary should include details about the funeral service and visiting hours, the program obituary should be more general and simply record information about your loved one’s final resting place.

, You may wish to offer thanks to those who made your loved one’s last days or weeks easier, for example at a hospital or hospice facility. You may also wish to thank the staff at the funeral home. Include the names of caregivers here., A funeral program obituary is generally longer than obituaries that appear in newspapers.However, they should not run to more than a page or, occasionally, two printed pages in the program itself.

, The people who knew your loved one might have good photographs to include with the obituary. While it’s usual to have a serious, even formal picture of the deceased on the front or first page of the program, you may also want to include other images that capture your loved one’s life.For example, you might include a photograph of your loved one enjoying her favorite vacation destination or participating in his favorite hobby.
A photograph of your loved one at work may also convey the importance of that aspect of her life.

, Have at least one other person read the draft of your obituary over. Ask them to double-check the factual information as well as looking for typos or errors.

, You might want to include this obituary in a notice on the internet as well as in the funeral program. You might also want to share the obituary with a local newspaper or your loved one’s alumni magazine. Create different versions of the obituary that fit word-count requirements of the different venues.Be sure to follow the formatting and submission guidelines for whatever venues you choose. Talk to the person designing and producing the funeral program about how to submit the text of the obituary as well as any images.

, Once the obituary is in the funeral program, it is a keepsake that will be appreciated by those who cared about your loved one.

Know the person's full name.,
Find the date of death.,
Guess the date of death based on census records.,
Find the place of death.,
Contact the city or state for a copy of the death certificate.,
Use the Social Security Administration's (SSA) Master Death File.,
Keep the Social Security number.",How to Find a Person's Grave1," It's best if you know the person's first, middle, and last name. Knowing this information will make him or her easier to find. Because some combinations of first and last names are common, it's easier to narrow down if you have a middle name, too.


You can find a person's full name by looking through family documents if you have them. Try family bibles, baptismal records, or birth certificates. You can also try contacting the church if you know the person or family was connected to one church for a long time. Many churches keep baptismal records.;
, If you don't know the date of death, you can try searching the obituaries of local newspapers where the person lived. You can usually find some information on the person in the obituary, such as the date of birth, the date of death, and the names of the person's parents and descendants. You may luck out and find the location of the grave, as well.If you only have a name, you can try searching national archives of newspapers. Often times, your local library will have access to these databases.If you can't find this information, some websites will accept a date range for the death date.The date of birth is also helpful to keep on hand if you have it, as it can narrow down results.

, If you're having no luck finding the date of death, try looking at city directories and even phone books. If the person is listed one year, but not the next, you can narrow down the year of death., The place of death is often included in the obituary. If you know the city and state, you can also look up the county, which some websites request when you are trying to find information.If you can get a copy of the death certificate, the place of death will also be listed on it.Try asking family members. Family members are a good source for this information, as they usually know where a person was living when she died. If no one knows, ask for old Bibles, as in the past, families used to record births and deaths in Bibles, including the place of death.Old letters can also be a good source of information. Also, newspaper clippings are often saved by family members, including obituaries.
You can also try searching legal documents. For instance, probate records are often a good way to find out where a person died because many estates go into probate after death., If you're having trouble finding some of this information, the CDC lists the departments in each state that handle these kinds of records. You can request a copy of the death certificate from these departments, which will give you information such as the date of death and the cause of death. You will likely have to pay a fee for the copy of the death certificate.Depending on the state, you may need to prove you are a family member of the deceased because some states have closed vital records, which includes death certificates. For instance, Arizona, Oklahoma, and New Hampshire have closed vital records, though some exceptions are made for other types of applicants, such as genealogists and people from oil and gas and mineral companies. You will need to provide proof of your relationship to the deceased, using items such as court documents, marriage certificates, and birth certificates.Some states have open vital records, such as Maine, Vermont, and Massachusetts, though a few of these states limit the record the public can see, such as only providing the cause of death.

, This file is also known as the Death Index. You do have to pay to make inquiries through the National Technical Information Service. You can pay per inquiry, which as of 2015 is $10 an inquiry.This index will provide you with basic information about the person, such as the date death and place of death.
Some websites offer limited access to this information for free, such as Genealogy Bank. You will have to create a free account to access the information., If you have the Social Security number of the person, keep it on hand. While it is difficult to find the number if you don't have it, it can make searching easier if you do."
"
Check the online Social Security Death Index.,
Search for city or state death records databases.,
Look for newspaper obituaries.",How to Find Death Notices1," The SSDI includes the record of anyone with a U.S. Social Security number whose death was reported to the Social Security Administration.Websites such as genealogybank.com and ancestry.com allow you to access portions of the SSDI free of charge.
You can search the SSDI by the person's first and last name, date of birth, date of death, last known residence, Social Security number, or any combination thereof.If you have limited information about the person for whom you need a death notice, you can use the information in the SSDI to fill in the blanks. For example, if you are looking for the death notice for your great-great grandmother, and you know her first and last name but not exactly when or where she died, you may be able to find a listing in the SSDI that would provide you with that information. Once you know when and where she died, you have a better idea of where else to look to find her death notice.;
, Many larger cities and some states have online databases available for use by the general public.


State death indexes typically go back further in time than the SSDI, so if you're looking for the death notice of someone who died in the 1700s, for example, you'd be more likely to find the information at the state level.
Although some of these indexes are available online for free, those databases typically only cover deaths through the early 1900s. If you're looking for an older death, you may have to pay a one-time fee or join a subscription site to gain access to the records., Depending on your purpose, a newspaper obituary may be all you need to get details of a person's death.


Keep in mind that for most people, the write-up in the paper is the official death notice. The death notice generally gives a brief story of the person's life and lists their surviving family members and the arrangements made. Newspaper staff writers typically create obituaries only for famous or significant people.In small towns, the newspaper may include more staff-written obituaries. You also might find obituaries or reprints of the death notice in church or community newsletters.If someone lived most of their life in one place, but died in another, their hometown often will reprint the death notice. So if you're not sure exactly where the person died, but you know where they were born and grew up, try checking the newspapers there.
Some newspapers publish their archives online, while others make their obituaries available on websites such as legacy.com.Several websites such as obitsforlife.com offer a searchable database of funeral home death notices, which for most people would be the notice published in the local newspaper.Some of these websites allow you to search for free, but require you to pay a fee or sign up for a subscription service before they grant you access to the records."
"
Contact the funeral home.,
Talk to family members.,
Try social media.,
Use genealogy and virtual cemetery websites.,
Try state websites.,
Check the cemeteries of family members.,
Find veterans on the Veteran Affair's (VA) website.,
Contact the cemetery.",How to Find a Person's Grave2," If the obituary listed the funeral home but not the place of burial, try contacting the funeral home. Many funeral homes keep their own records, and the staff may be able to tell you where the person is buried.In fact, if you know the city of death but not much more, you can try calling funeral homes in the area.
Start with the better-known ones and work your way down.

, Again, family members can be a vital source of information. They may be able to tell you outright where the person was buried, as well as show you where the grave is. If you're not a family member yourself, this step may be one of the best ways to find the grave, especially if you can explain why you're searching for it, such as for research purposes., You can use social media to visually represent what you need to find. For instance, post a picture of the person, along with the information you have about him or her. Note that you would like to find that person's grave, and that you are asking for any relevant information. Ask that people share the post with their friends.


Make sure to make it a public post so that it can be shared outside of your page. This process can help you fill in blanks, and it is sometimes known as crowdsourcing information., These websites are designed to help you find out about your personal history. They can help you locate a person's grave, and they may even have pictures uploaded of the grave site, as many people are devoted to documenting cemeteries. Find a Grave, Ancestral Findings, and Cemetery Search are all resources you can try.,, Some states have websites dedicated to finding graves in the state, though they are often private-run, not government-funded. These websites may have more extensive information than national websites. You'll still need information, such as the date of death, the date of birth, and the person's name, to search these websites.New information is being added all the time, so if you don't find what you're looking for, try back in a few months. Many volunteers go out and take pictures of graves to add information to databases., If you can't find information, one way to locate people is to look at family plots. You may stumble on the grave you're looking for just by looking in the same area where family members are buried., Many veterans choose to be buried in a national cemetery. The VA keeps track of where those veterans are buried. You can search for a person in a particular cemetery or in all the national cemeteries. You'll need the person's full name, the birth date, and the death date for best results., Once you've located the cemetery where the person is buried, you can search for it online. Many cemeteries have maps of the graves online, making it easier to locate the person you're looking for. Some cities also maintain maps of their cemeteries, so you may be able to locate the grave through the city.If the cemetery doesn't have a web presence other than a phone number, try calling them and asking about the location of the gravestone.


Also, even if you don't call to find the location, call the cemetery before visiting in person to confirm that the person's grave is located on cemetery grounds. Ask for the grounds keeper or administrator's office, which is usually open Monday through Friday during business hours only.
Ask for a map to the person's grave site when you arrive. Cemeteries keep detailed records of who is buried in which plots.

"
"
Use a website.,
Check city and country websites.,
Visit famous cemeteries.",How to Find a Person's Grave3," Many of the grave-finding websites in this article are also appropriate for famous people. Nonetheless, famous people's graves are usually more easy to find, as information is more readily available. Therefore, you can track down information on biographical websites on the person or find the person's obituary by searching through newspaper articles.

, Many cities and even countries make lists of famous people's graves as a way of promoting tourism. For instance, Seattle has a article devoted to finding famous graves on the government website; one of the famous graves it notes is Jimi Hendrix, who is in Renton's Greenwood Cemetery., One of the easiest ways to find celebrities is to visit famous cemeteries. For instance, many movie and television stars are buried in Los Angeles cemeteries, including Pierce Brothers Westwood Memorial Par and Hollywood Forever.Another famous cemetery is Père-Lachaise in Paris. Its many residents include Molière (the French playwright from the 17th century), Chopin, Jim Morrison, Marcel Proust, and Sarah Bernhardt.Many of these types of cemeteries are happy to help you find famous people's graves, especially if you call ahead. Some even provide maps with the graves of famous people marked. However, a few, such as Forest Lawn in Los Angeles, do not encourage people to visit famous graves. Therefore, it's important to call ahead before visiting."
"
Go to the public library.,
Look for cemetery or burial records.,
Visit your state archives facility.,
Research at a National Archives records center.",How to Find Death Notices2," Local libraries typically archive materials such as local newspapers that you may not be able to find anywhere else.


The main branch of your local library typically has the entire archives of the local newspaper from the date of the first issue, usually on microfilm or microfiche.
For example, the New York Public Library has microform copies of The New York Times beginning with issues from 1857.Unfortunately, many of these microform collections are not searchable the way an online database would be, but if you know the approximate date of the person's death, you can scan through the newspapers until you find the published notice.
Many local libraries also provide free access to databases such as NewsBank, which let you search newspaper obituaries and death notices nationwide. These databases typically are only available with a paid subscription, but library subscriptions enable patrons to enjoy free access., If you know where the person was buried, you may be able to find a listing in the cemetery's records that provides more information about the person's death.


Cemetery records typically catalogue everyone buried there, since gravestones can become weathered and illegible over time. Burial records can be particularly helpful if you know where the person is buried but can't find their grave.
Although typically you have to visit the cemetery itself to view these records, some districts now have their records available online. For example, you can use the Orange County Cemetery District's searchable database to find graves in Anaheim Cemetery, El Toro Memorial Park, and Santa Ana Cemetery., If the person died in the United States, you probably can find death notices and additional information by researching at the state archives.


Keep in mind these facilities typically are located in the state's capital. However, if you're unable to travel to that city to review the documents in person, you may be able to request them through the library of a local university or historical society.State archives tend to have older records than Social Security or other national records, and the records themselves may go into greater detail.

, The National Archives has a network of research facilities across the country that have federal records and other resources available.


For example, ancestry.com and other such services are available free of charge on computers at Archives facilities.You may be able to find records on those services that you wouldn't otherwise be able to access without paying for a subscription.
You can find the location you need on the National Archives website at http://www.archives.gov/locations/. The directory lists the address of each facility along with the particular services offered there.
If you're looking for the death notice of a person who was in the military, or who died overseas, you can most likely find something in the National Archives."
"
Determine whether you need a certified or informational copy.,
Contact the appropriate state or county vital records department.,
Fill out a request form.,
File your request form.,
Receive the death certificate you requested.",How to Find Death Notices3," Although most states make informational copies of death certificates available to anyone who asks, certified copies typically are restricted to close family members of the deceased.


The death certificate typically is prepared by the funeral home or other individual or organization in charge of the person's remains. In addition to the date, time, place, and cause of death, the death certificate includes information such as the person's full name and address, his or her birth date and birthplace, and the name and birthplace of the person's mother and father.The death certificate also may include information about the person's education, military experience, marital status, and the name of the surviving spouse.Because of the sensitivity of much of the information on the death certificate, many states restrict access to them. If you are unrelated to the person for whom you're seeking a death certificate, you may only be able to get a redacted informational certificate – particularly if the death was fairly recent.Certified copies are officially stamped and contain complete information. These copies typically are required for functions involved with the person's estate, such as transferring property or claiming death benefits.However, if you don't need the certificate for probate purposes, an informational copy should be sufficient.

, Death certificates generally are kept in the state or county where the person died.


If the death occurred recently, the record may not yet be at the state vital records department, so you would need to go to the county. However, if it's been a year or longer you probably can find the certificate filed with the state.Conversely, death records that are hundreds of years old typically are kept in local or county vital records offices rather than at the state level. For example, Minnesota began keeping death records at the state level in 1908. For earlier death records you would have to contact the office in the county where the death occurred.The CDC has an online directory of the vital records offices in each state at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w.htm.

, Most states have a particular form you must fill out to request either a certified or informational copy of the death certificate.


If you're requesting a certified copy, you usually must be related to the person as defined by state law. In most states, certified copies are available for parents, children, and siblings of the deceased.Some jurisdictions require death records request forms to be signed in front of a notary. Staff at the vital records office will tell you if this is required, or you may simply look on the form to see if there is a place for the form to be notarized.If your request form must be notarized, you can fill out the required information, but don't sign it until you are in the presence of a notary.
You also may be required to submit documentation of your relationship to the deceased or your stated interest in the estate., Once you've completed your request form, you must file it with the state or county vital records office where you believe the death certificate to be located.


You must pay a fee for each copy of the death certificate. The fee varies among jurisdictions, but typically is between $10 and $15.Keep in mind that the fee is non-refundable, meaning you won't get any portion of it back if the office does not find the record you requested., If you filed your request in person, you may be able to get the death certificate that day. If you mailed in your request or filed it online, expect several weeks of processing time before your copy is delivered.


Some vital records offices may have expedited processing available for an additional fee. You can ask at the vital records office if this service is available, or check the state vital records website."

Brainstorm and plan.,
Ask about other people's memories.,
Look for illuminating memories.,
Be concrete.,
Make people laugh without telling jokes.,
Tailor the speech to your grandparent.,
Edit yourself out.,
Write a brief introduction.,
Coordinate with other speakers.,
Know if there's a time limit.,
Avoid trying to make sense of things.,
Practice the eulogy at home.,
Figure out the logistics.",How to Write a Eulogy for a Grandparent," During the brainstorming session, you'll need to be capable of letting some ideas go. You won't be able to fit everything you want to say into one speech, so don't try to give a detailed biography of your grandparent's entire life. Think about specific memories of your grandparent: times you spent together, occasions that strike you as being definitive of your grandparent's personality, and so on. Write everything down, and don't feel obligated to include everything that makes the list.Ask yourself what qualities best describe your grandparent.Consider what set your grandparent apart from anyone else you know.If your grandparent had certain hobbies or passions in life, you may want to mention those. But there's no need to make these the focus of your eulogy, as it should be primarily about the departed's role as your grandparent.

, The focus of your eulogy should be on how the departed was a caring grandparent in your life. But that doesn't mean you can't open up to other people who knew your grandparent. Asking your parents or aunts/uncles about their relationship with your grandparent might be a good place to start. You could even ask any close friends of your grandparent what their favorite memories are of your grandparent. It might help give you some ideas on how other people knew your grandparent, and why your grandparent was important to people outside your family.When speaking with others about your grandparent, you may want to consider asking how and when they first met your grandparent (if there is no familial relation), what their favorite memories are with your grandparent, and what your grandparent's best qualities were. The answers may vary greatly from your own list if the person was a friend rather than a relative of your grandparent, which can help you open your eulogy to include how others saw your grandparent.

, As you comb over the memories you have of your grandparent, look for moments that characterize your grandparent best. Did he/she ever say or do something that has always made you think, ""That's the essence of my grandparent""? It doesn't need to be a huge, life-changing moment. Often the best illuminating memories of a person are the little things they said or did, the day-to-day qualities that contribute to the person's identity and personality.As you begin writing down your memories, focus on writing a series of little truths. Avoid the big, sweeping declarations and focus on the little details that defined your grandparent or your relationship with your grandparent., Don't just write that your grandparent was caring. Write out a specific memory that will illustrate your grandparent's caring nature. If your grandparent had a wonderful sense of humor, don't just say he/she was funny. Write about his/her humor, perhaps a time your grandparent played a practical joke or told a funny story. Remember that not everyone has the same memories of your grandparent that you have. Your eulogy should illustrate for everyone at the funeral what your relationship was like, and what the departed was like as a grandparent., Remember that you're not writing a standup comedy routine. But eulogies often elicit a little laughter from the congregation, which can be helpful for everyone who is mourning. Don't write a slapstick comedy, but try to give one or two little anecdotes that will make anyone who knew your grandparent chuckle and think, ""That's so true!"" Or you may want to tell an anecdote that will end with a twist no one was expecting, but which captures a quirk about your grandparent. However you choose to write the eulogy, remember that laughter helps people heal, and you don't need too much of it to be successful.Don't write jokes. Remember that it's still a funeral, but one or two humorous and well-placed anecdotes can help lighten the mood and make everyone remember the fond, happy memories they had of your grandparent., It's important to consider your grandparent's personality as you draft your eulogy. If your grandparent was very serious in life, you may want to avoid humorous anecdotes. If your grandparent was extremely religious, then feel free to mention the role that faith played in your grandparent's life. There is no absolute rule in writing a eulogy, other than trying your hardest to capture your grandparent's spirit and personality in writing. Focus on what your grandparent would have wanted to hear, and what is appropriate and important in memorializing his or her life., It's okay if the first draft of your eulogy focuses on your thoughts and feelings, but remember that it isn't ultimately about you. It's perfectly acceptable to write about your specific relationship with your grandparent, but avoid lingering on how you feel or what you're thinking. Everyone knows you care about your grandparent and will miss him or her, and what they really want to hear is a loving tribute to your grandparent's life.Consider having someone else read your eulogy beforehand and ask them if there's too much of you in it. Having an outsider's opinion may help you recognize ways to focus more on your grandparent and your relationship than on your subjective feelings., If you come from a large family, or if your grandparent had a lot of friends, there's a chance that not everyone will know you as the grandchild. Keep your introduction very brief - just a short sentence will suffice. The introduction should simply let people know your name and your relation to the deceased.

, If other relatives or friends will be giving their own eulogies at the service, you may want to reach out to those speakers in advance. Coordinate what each speaker intends to talk about so that you don't all cover the same qualities or tell the same stories.

, Sometimes when there are multiple speakers at a funeral, you may be asked to keep your eulogy under a certain time limit. Even if there isn't an explicit time limit given to you, it's important to remember that your eulogy shouldn't go on and on forever. Be respectful and know when to cut down the length of your eulogy.Try to keep the eulogy under five minutes, even if there is no explicit time limit. After five minutes most people find it difficult to keep listening, especially if they are overcome with grief.

, You won't do your grandparent any favors by trying to make sense of his or her death. And you're not going to be able to contextualize an entire life. So rather than trying to tell anyone what to think of your grandparent's life and death, it's best to focus on what made your grandparent's life so important. There's no need to mention how it will be hard to fill the void they've left, because everyone is probably thinking the same thing. Rather than state the obvious, focus on making the eulogy a loving tribute to the life your grandparent lived.

, It's generally a good idea to practice any speech ahead of time, and a eulogy is no different. You will most likely cry during the eulogy - and that's okay. It's natural to cry at a funeral, especially when you're recalling all the wonderful memories you have of your grandparent. But you don't want to be so emotional that your loving tribute is lost under uncontrollable tears and sobs. Practicing beforehand will allow you to get some of the crying off your chest when no one is around, which is important, as this may be the first time you've spoken candidly about your grandparent's death. Don't be afraid to cry, but let yourself have a good cry before you're expected to speak to the congregation., It's important to know the specifics of the funeral's location before the service. Knowing where you'll be speaking, whether there are any obstacles to walk over, and whether there is a microphone are all important factors to consider when planning to deliver a eulogy. And don't forget to bring a written copy of your final eulogy to the service. Even if you think you've got it memorized, it's a good idea to bring a hard copy, just in case."

Have patience when offered empty platitudes.,
Explain that everyone grieves differently.,
Share what you’re feeling.,
Tell them what you need from them.,
Make a list to let people know how they can help you.",How to Handle People Rushing You Through Mourning1," Everyone alive will experience a devastating loss at some point in their lifetime. Yet, despite its ubiquitous nature, most people have no idea how to comfort someone who is grieving. If you feel you are being rushed through your mourning process, loved ones or casual acquaintances have probably made the mistake of offering you predictable, clichéd statements in hopes of easing your pain.


People may say things like “You need to get on with your life” or “He/she would want you to be strong” that send the message that your grief is time-sensitive.It will probably be challenging, but resist the urge to snap back or get annoyed with people who express their condolences this way. Know that at the heart of it, they feel awkward and helpless in the face of your pain. They just want to help.;
, It can be confusing to onlookers who see one person bounce back easily from a loss while another struggles to handle everyday obligations. If your emotional suffering is protracted, it may help to shed light on the very unique and individual nature of grief to those around you.


You might say, “Grief is very different for everyone who experiences it. Sometimes, depending on how close you were to the person, the severity of your mourning is even greater. For some people, it may not be. Please respect that I am grieving in my own way—the best way I know how.”
It may even be practical to provide some resources about grieving to those closest to you. Reading up on the highly personal process of mourning can prompt those who rush you to ease up and let your grief happen naturally.Grief often happens in stages, but grieving can be a very different experience from one person to another. It may last a lifetime for some people, while other people only grieve for a short time. There is no one-size-fits-all grieving process.

, Being surrounded by people who expect you to shoulder the loss and pretend like you’re okay can feel suffocating. Suppressing grief can prolong the process even further. You may find that talking about your pain helps you.


Use a journal to write out your feelings about the person or thing you lost. Start a blog to share your story with others—whether locally or globally.Reach out to a reasonably sympathetic friend and share your thoughts and emotions. Say something like “I feel like everyone is pressuring me to get over my divorce. They say, “I’m better off,” but that doesn’t help me get rid of this giant hole in my life. I feel empty and rudderless.”

, Another helpful way to deal with people who try to rush you through the grieving process is to give them an assignment. Keep in mind that they may offer empty platitudes because they only want to help, but don’t know how. Give them some direction in regards to what you need.


Try saying, “I know you’re only trying to help, but I feel like you are rushing me to grieve. Can you help me in some other way? I need some time alone, but not too much. Can you come and sit with me a few hours each week? We can watch TV or movies, or simply read in each other’s company. I just would like to know someone else is there. Is that okay?”, In some cases, people may just not know how to help you. You may want to make a list of things you would like them to say and do to help you feel better. On this list, you might include:

""I am here to help you in any way I can.""
""You are in my thoughts and prayers.""
""I am always just a phone call or email away.""
""I am here for you.""
Or you can even write things like “give me a hug,” “help me with errands or some daily tasks,” or “just sit and be present with me in person.”

Seek out resources, like books and internet articles, to find out how the illness usually progresses.


Turn to creditable resources for terminal illnesses like the American Cancer Society or other national organizations relating to their specific condition.You’ll be better able to help your friend when you know what their remaining time may be like.;
, You may need to push your own feelings aside sometimes to help your friend, but don’t ignore them or bottle them up completely. Talk to your loved ones about how you’re feeling, or see a counselor or therapist. Creative hobbies can also be a good way to cope with intense emotions.It’s okay to tell your friend that you’re feeling sad or stressed, but be careful not to make your emotions a burden for them.

, Ask your friend if they want you to help them break the news to other friends and acquaintances. If they say no, respect their wishes.If your friend is reluctant to tell others, try convincing them gently. Say something like, “Anne, I think it is best we let everybody know. It is up to you to decide, though.”
Do not tell anyone else until you’ve asked your friend how they want to handle the situation.

, Being in the company of others who have previously lost a loved one or who are currently coping with a loved one dying can help. These people understand what you are going though and can lend advice and support.


Research a reputable organization relating to your friend's condition to find support groups in your area and online.

, The most important thing you can do for your friend right now is show them that you care about them and want to spend time with them. You don’t have to always know what to say or do. Just look for opportunities to be with them and make them feel loved.If your friend is well enough, keep interacting with them like you normally would. Look for ways to have fun together. Invite them over for small things, like dinner, studying, or board games.

, Your friend knows best what they need and want right now, so listen to them. They may want to talk about death, or they may not feel ready to broach that topic yet. Help them feel comfortable by mirroring their attitude and letting them guide your conversations.For instance, if your friend is working hard to maintain a cheerful attitude, try to act upbeat around them.
Keep in mind that your friend might not have come to terms with their own mortality yet. If this is the case, be there for them, but also realize that they may need some additional support.

, Your friend might feel awkward if you avoid acknowledging their eventual death. Let them know that you understand what’s going to happen, and reassure them that you’re prepared for it.When you talk about death, do so in terms your friend is comfortable with. For example, your friend may prefer to talk about “leaving” or “going on a journey.”
Keep in mind that many people are uncomfortable discussing death. If this is the case for you, then you might want to talk over your concerns with someone you trust first.

, Don’t fall back on platitudes, which aren’t usually comforting or helpful to someone who is dying. Similarly, don’t reassure your friend that everything is going to be fine. Be kind, but be honest.For instance, don’t say, “Everything happens for a reason,” or, “I’m sure you’ll feel fine after you start the new medicine.”
If you don’t know what to say, focus on listening instead. Ask your friend if they want to talk about how they’re feeling.
Avoid saying anything like, “I know how you feel.” This can come across as unsupportive and make your friend feel worse.

, Remember that your friend is going through a scary, stressful time. Don’t take it personally if they refuse your help or snap at you. Be as forgiving and patient as you can, and if you’re angry or upset, try not to let them know.For example, your friend might say ""I know you'll be relieved when I finally croak so you can move on with your life."" Simply reassure them with something like ""I wish I wasn't losing you at all, but I'm glad about any remaining time we have together.""

, If you want to tell your friend something, do it now. The time between diagnosis and death can be shorter than people expect, so don’t take it for granted that you’ll have enough time to say everything later.When you depart from your friend after a visit, be aware that you may not see them again. Say goodbye in a way you won’t regret in case it’s for the last time.

, If your friend has just been diagnosed with a terminal illness, they may feel scared and overwhelmed. Help them learn about what’s happening so they can make informed decisions about their treatment.You could offer to accompany your friend to doctor’s appointments, help them make a list of questions to ask their doctor, or search for books and articles about their illness.

, Don’t wait for your friend to ask for help – volunteer your services however you can. Offer to run errands, make dinner, pick your friend’s kids up from school, or anything else that your friend might have trouble doing on their own., Your friend’s other loved ones are hurting right now, too. Reach out to their spouse, parents, kids, or other friends to help them get through this difficult time. Everyone can benefit from the emotional support, and all of you will be able to care for your friend better.For instance, you might offer to help your friend's spouse or parent with household duties or errands so that they have less responsibilities.

, Ask your friend if they want to leave letters for their friends and family, write down the story of their life, or be remembered with a special tradition. If they do, help to make it happen however you can.For instance, if your friend wants to preserve some stories from their childhood but doesn’t have the energy to write, you could take dictation for them.

Feel the pain.,
Perform a closure ritual.,
Develop and stick to a routine.,
Manage stress effectively.,
Recognize when you need help.",How to Handle People Rushing You Through Mourning2," Bottling up your feelings won’t help you mourn. Don’t listen to others who say you should just “be strong.” Acknowledging all the emotions that come with your loss is essential to the grieving process.Express your feelings however it comes natural to you. Shout into a pillow. Sit in a dark corner and cry for an hour.
If you don’t have anyone who will let you do this in their presence, take some time alone. Feeling all the horrible emotions that accompany your loss is the best way to gradually move through the pain.

, One method to express and move through your grief is by performing rituals. A simple ceremony can be a powerful way to gain closure about a loss and mark the beginning of a new chapter.


Attending a funeral or memorial service is a common ritual that allows loved ones to mourn the deceased and celebrate their life. In addition, you can write a letter telling the person you loss how much you miss them and, perhaps, sharing some words that you never got to say. Then, you might toss the letter in their grave after the burial, or let it float out to sea.Another option is to place a letter to your loved one in their casket or on an altar that you have made for them.
You may also consider keeping a memento of the person’s with you at all times so that you can pull it out in moments of pain and sadness. For example, you could keep a piece of the person’s jewelry or a watch, or even a favorite trinket. This may help to ease the pain and comfort you.
Keep in mind, some types of grief may are more resistant to finding closure. For instance, if you a parent died, it’s improbable that a ritual—or anything—will bring you closure from such a major loss.However, performing a ceremony is an intentional way to heal and move forward after the loss.

, Having some semblance of structure and normalcy after a loss can help you adjust and move forward as you learn to manage your grief. It’s important, however, to avoid overdoing it. Create a feasible schedule that offers structure, but also be sure to take it easy.


For example, you might strive to get up each morning, exercise, and make yourself a healthy breakfast before school or work. When your work or school day is complete, you might only have energy to lie on your couch, but you will feel more positive after completing some structure-based activities earlier in the day., The intense emotions that accompany a loss can take a toll on mental and physical health. You may have trouble sleeping, experience little desire to eat regular meals, and withdraw from friends and family.By building a stress-coping toolkit, you can counteract these negative effects and nourish your body and spirit as your grieve. You might include coping skills such as:


Meditation
Deep breathing
Gentle exercise
Phoning a friend
Watching a funny video or movie
Taking a nap
Eating delicious, whole foods
Writing in a journal
Drawing or coloring
Listening to music
Running a warm, bubble bath
Praying or attending spiritual services

, There is no set time-frame that is appropriate for mourning. It is a highly individual process. Still, if you find that your grief doesn’t seem to lift slightly over time, or you have trouble performing your daily activities, you may need to seek professional help. Grief or bereavement counselors are specially trained to help people navigate the confusing adjustment period that follows a significant loss. These counselors offer a safe, impartial environment where you can express your feelings and learn effective ways of coping with grief.Some things to watch for include:


Thinking about suicide or making plans.
Wishing you had died with your loved one.
Feeling guilty or to blame for the loss of your loved one.
Increased isolation and not wanting anyone to be around you.
Feeling numb and disconnected, and/or having an out of body experience as if the world is moving on without you and you are just watching from outside your body.
Having decreased ability to function with your normal daily tasks.

"
"
Spend time with others who share your loss.,
Participate in a support group.,
Seek spiritual consolation.",How to Handle People Rushing You Through Mourning3," If there is someone else who shares the same loss, seek refuge in their company. This can be especially helpful when others try to tell you that your mourning is taking too long. Turning to someone else who is struggling to adjust can provide you with relief and companionship.For instance, if you lost a child, it may help to spend time with a spouse, co-parent, or another sibling who is also suffering the loss. Together, you can walk down memory lane. Recall funny stories about the deceased. Look at pictures or artwork. Lean on each other’s shoulders when you need to cry.

, Although members of a bereavement support group may not intimately know your loss, they may be feeling similarly. Participating in a support group can give you consolation when others in your life are pressuring you to speed up your grieving.


You can talk to your grief counselor for suggestions about support groups in your area, or you can search online for supportive communities.You may be able to find a support group at a local church, at a mental health clinic, or by contacting a social worker at a hospital.

, If you believe in a higher power, it can help to lean into your spirituality as you grieve. Many people find that their spirituality is a major source of comfort and support as they navigate the aftermath of a major loss.


Depending on what spirituality means to you, you might find consolation through walking in nature, attending religious services, volunteering and helping others, praying or meditating, seeking spiritual counsel, or reading a sacred book."

Think about the goal of the eulogy.,
Brainstorm memories and facts.,
Interview your close relatives.,
Organize the body in the outline.,
Have an introduction and conclusion.,
Write for reading out loud.,
Begin with the body of the eulogy.,
Choose a tone for the eulogy.,
Understand what not to include.,
Avoid striving for perfection.,
Share the legacy you believe she left.,
Detail some of her achievements.,
Bring in touching anecdotes.",How to Write a Eulogy For Mother," When you sit down to create an outline for your eulogy, consider your goals before writing anything down. First keep in mind the difference among a eulogy, obituary, and elegy. A eulogy is speech usually given during the visitation or wake that pays your mother tribute.An obituary is a short announcement of your mother’s passing that appears in the newspaper, while an elegy is a poem or song of lament.
A eulogy is a speech containing a tribute to your mother's life, which may contain a brief story of your mother's like. Make your eulogy tell your own story about your mother rather than cater to what everyone else is telling you to write.;
, After you have determined the goal of your eulogy, start collecting material for it. Make a list of everything you can think of to use in the eulogy—funny anecdotes, facts about her life, favorite memories you shared, lessons she taught you, and so on.


Questions you could ask yourself to help you brainstorm include, What one quality of my mother do I remember most?
Try asking yourself, What is something my mother always used to do to comfort me?
Once you have your list, whittle it down to stories and memories that achieve the goal you have set for the eulogy.

, Ask your relatives if they have any stories they want to contribute to the eulogy. More than likely, you will get quite a few anecdotes to add to your brainstorm list.Ask them questions like, What is your favorite memory of my mother?
Another question could be, What life lessons did my mother teach you?

, In the body, organize your anecdotes in a specific way, such as chronologically or in logical categories. Doing this will give your eulogy focus so that others can follow what you are saying.


For example, instead of in order of occurrence, you could group your anecdotes by type: personal memories, others’ memories, her favorite things, her influence on your life, her influence on others’ lives, and concluding with how much she will be missed before giving the conclusion.
You might also use poems or songs performed by other family members for the body., The introduction should open with a brief greeting to the crowd and an introduction of yourself, including your relationship to your mother. The conclusion should repeat the main theme of your eulogy.For example, you could open with, ""Hello everyone, my name is Sam and I am Mary's son. I am honored to be sharing her eulogy with you today.""
You could end with, ""Thank you for coming to honor my mother today. I know she would be so grateful.""

, Consider that you will likely read your eulogy out loud at the visitation or wake for your mother. Use diction and vocabulary appropriate for this, such as thanking others for coming. Also makes notes indicating where pauses should occur. This means avoiding a formal tone.Focus on writing the way you speak. Simply reading a script to an audience can feel dry and ultra-formal, an effect you may want to avoid.
Try writing your eulogy in a list format, leaving room for improvisation so that you are not constantly looking down at the paper.

, Most pieces of writing have a beginning, middle, and end. For a eulogy, you need an intro, body, and conclusion. In order to produce an engaging introduction, start writing the body, then move to the conclusion before returning to write the intro. Writing in this order helps you figure out what you are going to say so that the introduction is more clear.


Keep in mind that you will likely write several revisions before coming up with a copy that you are happy with.Ask relatives and friends to read over or listen to you read your rough drafts to help make the eulogy stronger.

, The tone for a eulogy does not have to be sad, although it certainly can be. Ask yourself some questions to determine what the mood and tone of your eulogy should be. For instance, how would your mother want you to feel? How do you want others to feel after hearing or reading your eulogy?Consider the personality of your mother. Was she vibrant and energetic? Warm and loving? Think about making the tone of your eulogy match your mother’s personality.

, Knowing what a eulogy is can help you decide what things to leave out. For starters, think of a eulogy as a gift to your mother. Your gift will assist everyone close to her in processing the grief they feel.That being said, you can choose to filter out things that don’t fit this mold.


You will probably want to exclude negative things. If you were angry with her when she passed, forgiving her before penning the eulogy can help you focus on positive aspects.
Stay away from trivial facts that do not contribute to the main theme of your eulogy, such as her daily habits.

, Keep in mind that this eulogy does not need to be perfect in any way. View it as a way to honor your mother, and the funeral guests will appreciate it for this gesture. Take pressure off yourself to perform perfectly with this eulogy, which will help you speak from the heart.If you tend to be a perfectionist, try to lower your expectations by imagining how you would expect a sibling to do this, or another relative. Treat yourself as you would them (i.e., have compassion for mistakes).

, In the body of your eulogy, be sure to include the legacy you believe your mother is leaving behind. A legacy is what you hope she will be remembered for and what she would have been most proud for people to remember about her.Think about if your mother ever told you what she wanted to be remembered for, or ask others if she talked to them about this.If she never told anyone what she wished to be remembered for, think about the main theme of her life. What did she spend the most time doing? What did she sacrifice the most for? Is there anyone who is grateful to her for a service she performed?
For example, your mother's favorite sayings or life philosophy, or what she said was her proudest achievement.

, Talk about some of the greatest things your mother achieved. This does not have to be something grandiose like designing a famous building or doing something in the public eye. Perhaps you and your siblings are well-adjusted individuals, and that was a great achievement.


Achievements can be both tangible and intangible.

, Anecdotes can be both touching and humorous. In fact, a mix of both creates a balance to your eulogy that relieves some of the heavy burden of grief. Be sure to include both on your brainstorm list.Get idea from your friends and relatives.

"
Determine why you want them to leave.,
Speak with a reasonable and respectful tone of voice.,
Provide detailed, impersonal examples if they ask why they need to leave.,
Provide a firm date they need to leave by.,
Seek out information or alternatives as a good will gesture.,
Be firm, clear, and consistent about your decision.,
Understand that this may damage or ruin your relationship.",How to Put a Friend or Relative out of Your House1," You need to be clear with your own reasoning before diving into the conversation. Review any agreements you made when they moved in, or any promises that have been made/broken. Assess the situation and their current behavior, grounding your reasoning in fact. While ""I don't like living with them"" is an acceptable reason to ask someone to move, you want concrete details, like ""they never do the dishes,"" ""they said they would leave months ago,"" etc before talking to them.


Write down the issues as they occur, along with the date. You want a detailed, specific record of their behavior in case things get difficult.
This conversation will not be easy, and it will more than likely damage your relationship. However, living together with serious differences or issues will also hurt your friendship, so you need to take a stand if they've been there too long.;
, Although you may be feeling violated, fed up, or sick and tired, it is important not to explode and make unreasonable demands. Lay out your reasons for asking them to leave, and let them know that you understand how hard this is. Speak to them as you would a co-worker, sticking to the facts and not emotional outbursts.


""We've enjoyed having you, but we unfortunately need our space back and have to ask you to leave in the next two weeks.
Stick to the reasons you drafted earlier. If they've been a problem or broken promises, remind them that they have not held up their end of the bargain and need to move on to a new environment.

, Do not respond with ""because I hate you,"" or ""because you're lazy."" Give them tangible examples instead of insulting them. This is where a list will come in handy. If they are a constant source of issues, write down each incident and the date as they arise. When they ask ""why,"" mention 2-3 specific times where they broke a promise or caused you trouble.


Focus on your reasons for asking them to leave, not all of their flaws, whenever possible. ""We need more space,"" ""We can't afford to keep you here anymore,"" etc.

, Telling them that they need to leave that night may cause incredible stress and tension, and your friend or relative may not have anywhere to go. Instead, choose a date they need to leave by and let them know that this is a firm deadline. In general, try and give at least 1-2 weeks, or until the end of the month, so that they have some time to prepare for their next move.


""I'd like you completely moved out by April 20th.""
If there is a legitimate reason why that date is bad, you can talk with them to find a better day. However, don't shift by more than 3-5 days.

, If you have the resources, compile some ideas to help your guest's relocation process. You can even bring these with you to the discussion, letting them know that they need to leave but that there are options available. They may reject your ideas, but showing that you still care about their well-being can soften the blow.

, Once you've decided to put them out, hold your ground. This conversation could get messy, and emotions will flair up no matter how prepared you are. You need to stand firm, however, and stick to your decision. If your housemate convinces you to change your mind, they'll realize that they can continue breaking rules and promises without ever changing. If things are so bad that you're going to put them out, you need to be ready to really put them out.

, Putting out a friend or relative is stressful, and will most likely lead to lingering hard feelings. Ultimately, however, you need to remember that keeping them in your house for too long can damage your relationship just as much. If you are constantly in conflict, your friend/relative is taking advantage of you, or you are simply incompatible living partners, then your relationship will only turn toxic if you stay under the same roof. That said, there are ways to try and keep your friendship alive. You can:


Help them find their new place or job.
Avoid insults, even in tense situations. If they are angry, stay calm and reiterate why it is important to you that they find a new place to live. Don't start slinging insults.
Set up times to meet, have them over for dinner, and continue seeing each other as friends.
If you get into a big fight, or have serious disagreements, then it may be best to cut them off completely.

"
"
Make them part of your routine.,
Put your loved ones on the calendar.,
Multitask as a way to stay in contact.,
Include others in your plans.",How to Prioritize Loved Ones when You Have a Busy Life1," Doing this will make it easier to make loved ones a priority because you won’t feel like it’s something special or extra you have to do. Just like brushing your teeth and washing your face are a part of your morning routine, make keeping in touch with your friends and family a part of your everyday life.


For instance, your bedtime routine might include having a cup of tea, reading a book, calling your daughter, and then taking a bath.
Or, for example, your afterschool routine might be to have a snack, play with your younger sibling, and then start on homework.;
, Scheduling time with them the same way you schedule a meeting or an appointment is one way you can prioritize loved ones when you have a busy life.Putting it on your agenda will help prevent you from scheduling anything else during that time. It’s also a way of saying to yourself that your family and friends are as important to you as the other things you put on your calendar.


For example, if your partner is having a poetry reading, put it on your calendar so that you don’t plan anything else during that time.
If you are worried you might forget or overlook your ‘priority appointment’, set an alarm or reminder as well.

, Most busy people find themselves multitasking, doing more than one thing at a time, on a regular basis. For instance, you might be in the habit of watching TV, checking your voicemail, and cooking dinner all at one time. Try using multitasking as a way to make time to contact your loved ones or show them that you care.For example, order your spouse lunch when you’re placing your own order and have their meal delivered with a note saying how much you care.
Or, as another example, make use of the hands-free settings on your car and give your best friend a quick call while you’re riding home from school.

, When you have a lot to do and can’t cancel any of your plans, you can still make your loved ones a priority. Similar to multitasking, consider inviting your friends and family to join you in your activities when it’s appropriate. This way you’re meeting your responsibilities and obligations, spending time with loved ones, and giving them a glimpse of your life all at the same time.


For instance, invite your sister to join you in your weekly tai chi class. You could say, “I won’t have much time this week, but I want to see you. Could you come to tai chi with me? It’s fun!”
Or, for example, if you have to go out-of-town on business, ask your spouse to come with you. During your free time you can spend time together exploring the city.
You can also use video chatting apps like Messenger, Skype, Facetime, ooVoo, Tango or Hangouts as a way to include others in what you’re doing.This allows them to hear your voice and also see your expressions, emotions, and environment as you talk.

Send a certified letter asking them to leave in 30 days or less.,
File an official tenant eviction order with your local courts if they still don't leave.,
Do not change the locks unless you are worried about your safety.,
Call the police if they still refuse to leave.",How to Put a Friend or Relative out of Your House2," While a house guest is not technically a tenet, certain tenant-landlord laws still apply to the relationship if they've been with your for more than 30 days.Talk to an attorney who will help you draft and send an eviction notice. Giving this advance warning, in writing, is essential to protect your liability.


This warning will legally establish them as an ""at-will tenant."" You need this status if you have to pursue legal action, so do not skip it.

, If they paid for groceries or any bills, they may legal be an ""at-will tenant,"" making it much harder to kick them out legally.If they ignore the first written warning, you'll need to file a formal eviction proceedings with your local district court in order to get them out.If you plan on a court order, you should be prepared with a list of issues and infractions (known as ""just cause for eviction"") as well as a copy of your lease and any agreements.
Generally, your letter will outline a place for them to receive their belongings in the event that they don't move, as well as the specific date their stuff will be removed from your house., If you suddenly lock out a an at-will tenant, especially if their belongings are still in the house, you could be the target of costly civil suits and legal action. Changing the locks on a guest, if it causes problems or cuts them off from their property, can even get you jail time in the wrong circumstances. Moreover, it often inflames already high tensions and can lead to further issues.Once you have a court order, and/or have notified the police that you are worried about your safety, you can safely change your locks.

, Unless they are a legitimate resident of the house, usually determined if they receive mail or are on the lease, they can be removed from your property as a ""trespasser."" Obviously, involving the police is for the most extreme cases, and even the mentioning of 911 is often enough to finally get someone out the door. Some police offices will refuse to get involved in a matter like this. However, if you've sent the letter and/or filed for eviction with a court, they will come remove your guest as a trespasser.

Set your rules and boundaries early on.,
Make a timeline for their departure.,
Make notes of issues and problems as they arise.,
Help them get back on their feet.",How to Put a Friend or Relative out of Your House3," If you start to get the feeling someone is becoming more of a roommate and less of a visitor, set some ground rules as soon as possible. This gives you something to stand on when you eventually need to kick them out -- you can point back to the concrete rules laid down earlier instead of getting emotional.


Set your expectations within the first week. Do they need to pay rent? Do they have to be pursuing job interviews? Have clear benchmarks for them to meet if they want to stay in the house.

, Before formally asking them to leave, sit down and ask when they plan on moving out. Put the ball in their court, which makes it easier to stick to this move-out date as it approaches. If they don't a timeline in mind, you should make one together. Come up with something concrete, such as ""when they get a job,"" or ""after 6 months.""


If they need a job, work together to come up with specific goals to reach for -- applying to 1 job a day, rewriting their resume, etc. Make sure they are actually trying to get a job and not just enjoying the free bed.
If you aren't sure whether or not they should move in, make a trial period. Tell them when they move in that they have 2-3 months, at which point you're not sure if they can stay., If your friend or relative is breaking the rules, being disrespectful, or going back on their promises to you, right down the incident along with the date and time in a small notebook. Again, this gives you specifics to bring up when you talk to them about leaving, instead of vague generalities or emotional appeals.


Keep this as impersonal as possible. Asking them to leave doesn't have to ruin a friendship, especially if you base your reasons in facts instead of feelings.

, Some people will get out on their own with a bit of careful nudging. Read over their resumes and cover letters as they apply to jobs, visit open houses with them, and encourage them to spread out and become independent. If you can help someone become self-sufficient, they may leave without causing a conflict.


Review their goals and promises together regularly, working together to make them a reality.
If you can help finance their new move, this may be all they need to get going."

Listen to them.,
Support their activities.,
Use technology to keep in touch.,
Write a note.",How to Prioritize Loved Ones when You Have a Busy Life2," This is one of the easiest and best ways that you can show loved ones that you care about them and that they’re a priority to you.Make the time to check in with your family and friends and find out what’s going on in their lives. You should also make time to be there for them on those occasions that they need special support.


Ask your loved ones how they are doing and really listen to their answer. Ask questions about what they say in response to let them know you’re listening.
Remove distractions and try to limit interruptions when you are talking with loved ones. Turn off your electronic devices and give the person your undivided attention.
When you can, be willing to stop doing something else to listen to a loved one for a minute or two. For example, if your friend calls and he’s upset because his dog is lost, you could stop working on your paper for a moment and listen to him.

, Even if you can’t attend every event that they have, you can show loved ones that they’re a priority and that you care by supporting them in other ways. Take the time to find out how you can encourage, promote, and support your family and friends in the things that they’re doing.


For example, you might not be able to attend your cousin’s tap dancing concert, but you can have flowers delivered backstage.
Or, for instance, if you can’t help your friend volunteer at the animal shelter, you can pass out fliers at your job letting people know about shelter opportunities.

, Given the number of social networking apps and the ease with which you can post written text, pictures, audio, video, and more, keeping in touch with loved ones is not as difficult as it used to be.Make the most of technology and find creative ways to let your friends and family know what’s going on in your life and find out what’s happening in theirs.


You can send a ‘good morning’ or ‘good night’ text or you can text them in the middle of the day just to let the person know you are thinking of them.
While you are responding to your email messages, send one or two off to loved ones as a way to keep in touch.
Send a video or audio message expressing how grateful you are to have them in your life.
Post a picture of you and your loved ones and tag them in it on social media. This is a great way to share your life and experiences with people that may not live close enough to visit regularly.

, Although it might be considered ‘old-fashioned’, most people would agree that finding an unexpected hand-written note from someone you care about gives you a good feeling. You can give this good feeling to your loved ones by writing a note, letter, or card and giving it to them. This is a simple, but powerful way to let them know they’re a priority to you.


For instance, you could buy your grandfather a card and send it to him via snail mail just to let him know he’s important to you.
Or, for example, if you make your child’s lunch for school, you could put a small “I love you” note in their lunchbox.
Be creative and post a note for your loved one in a public place. For example, if you know your partner always checks the message board in the cafeteria, put a sweet note with their name on it on the board.

"
"
Be deliberate.,
Set boundaries in other areas.,
Think small.,
Delegate tasks to make more time.,
Log off.",How to Prioritize Loved Ones when You Have a Busy Life3," This may be one of the most important things that you can do to prioritize your loved ones when you have lots of other responsibilities and obligations.Consciously reminding yourself to make time for your family and friends and making decisions based on them will keep it on your mind and make it important to you.


When possible, schedule activities around your time with your loved ones.For example, if your daughter generally has track meets on Thursday afternoons, try not to schedule any meetings for that time.
Place a picture of your loved ones somewhere that you can see it frequently to remind you that they’re a priority to you.
Start each day by thinking about why your loved ones are important to you. For example, you might say to yourself, “My mom’s a priority because of all she’s done for me.”
Keep a journal or list and write about how grateful you are to have your family and friends. You can write a ‘gratefulness statement’ about one special person each day.

, It can be all too easy to allow work, school, and other obligations to spread over into your personal time. However, if you’re making your loved ones a priority then you’ll need to leave work at work and school at school, so to speak. Make sure that your time with your friends and family is spent enjoying their company and not focused on other aspects of your life.


Put a time limit on the hours you will work each day or each week. Once you reach that limit then stop and give your attention to your loved ones.
Other than important updates, avoid talking about work, school or other responsibilities with the people close to you. Instead, find out what’s going on in their life.

, Instead of thinking that you need to spend hours with your loved ones to let them know they’re a priority to you, think about the small things you can do. This will help make spending time with friends and family seem less like another obligation. At the same time, try to view large tasks as smaller action steps. Breaking your responsibilities down into smaller chunks can help you feel less busy and see free time where you didn’t see it before.


For example, you could plan to catch a quick coffee with your friend instead of trying to fit in lunch.
Or, for instance, instead of thinking of your final report as one big project, think of it as three smaller projects: the introduction, body, and conclusion. You could work on the introduction and then take a break to check on your partner.

, You may want to do everything and you may even be able to, but asking for help meeting your obligations and responsibilities may give you extra time to spend with loved ones.It’s okay to ask family members to help with chores on a regular basis or ask friends for a favor every now and then.


You might say to your friend, “I’d like to spend a bit of time with my daughter. Would you mind picking up my order when you pick up yours?”
Or, you might tell your partner, “If you wash the car while I pressure wash the house, we’ll have time to relax and watch the movie together later.”

, It might surprise you how much time you spend on your electronic devices. From checking email, to playing games, to texting, commenting, and posting – it all adds up. Logging off can give you back some of your time, which you can use to show your loved ones that they’re a priority.For example, spending 10 minutes playing with your dog is a much better way to spend your time than playing a game on your phone.
As an experiment one day, try to track how much time you spend on your electronic devices doing non-essential tasks like commenting on posts. The next day, try to spend that amount of time (or more) with your loved ones.

, For example, 'Snack Saturday', where you give them each £3 and let them buy whatever treat they want in the store. Or a special Family Fun Night, with board games.

List the multiple roles you may have.A single person may fill a number of different roles all at once, or at different times in life: employee, employer, student, sibling, significant other, child, parent, caregiver, etc.,
Go to and leave work at the same times each day.If you are never certain of when your work day will begin or end, it can be difficult to separate it from your personal life.,
Say no to unreasonable work requests.,
Prioritize your work tasks.Some tasks are more important than others.,
Delegate as much as possible.If you have others that work with or for you, make sure to assign a reasonable amount of tasks to them, instead of trying to do everything yourself.,
Know your distractions, and minimize them when working.,
Overcome procrastination.,
Manage personal and professional social media accounts.Social media have made details of personal lives much more public.,
Recognize when you do not have a good work/life balance.,
Focus only on your personal life outside of work hours.,
Define yourself as something other than work.Our work lives are often a very important part of our identity, and in professions in which one does not “clock in” and “clock out” or works from home, the boundary between work and personal life can be blurred.,
Develop relationships outside of the work environment.,
Ask for help at home.,
Spend time alone.",How to Separate Your Professional and Private Life," These roles sometimes overlap, but each one has its own expectations and needs. Make a list of all of the roles that apply to you, and decide which ones are most important to you.;
, This is especially true for telecommuters or others who work at home. If your job does not have set hours, try setting some for yourself and sticking to them.


If at all possible, give yourself one or two days off per week (on weekends or otherwise). This will give you an opportunity to rest and to engage in non-work-related activities.
Ask your employer if your work schedule can be flexible.For example, you may be able to follow a schedule that works better for your family or personal life, such as going to work earlier and leaving later. Similarly, you may be able to work on a compressed schedule that entails the same number of hours per week but with one day off.

, Speak to your supervisor about reassigning tasks that do not fall under your job requirements, or within reasonable expectations of the amount of work you can do.Let your supervisor know your boundaries. If he or she asks you to do a task that is outside of your duties, try saying something like: “I appreciate that you trust me with the responsibility of X task, but I don’t think that my position is the right one to take care of that.”
Offer to discuss any new work assignments, and thank your supervisor when the boundaries of your job duties are considered.
Even if a task seems like it’s relevant to your job duties, or even if you would like to help your employer or coworker, respectfully say no if you already have a lot to do and need some personal time.
Remember that not every opportunity is a great opportunity, or one that makes sense for your private or professional life.

, Focus on deadline-driven projects and preparations for scheduled projects, and avoid interruptions, checking unimportant email, and other low-priority tasks.


If you find yourself not even having enough time to finish the most important tasks, talk to your supervisor about whether or not you are being asked to do too much.
Set aside time specifically for work. When possible, try to work around “focus times.” Give yourself a set period of time (such as an hour or an hour and a half) in which you will work deliberately and without distractions.Don’t be a perfectionist—no one gets everything right every time.Focus on doing your work as best you can, accept when you make mistakes, and learn from them.

, Give your assistant(s) or team members tasks that are lower on your priority list, but that you can trust them to accomplish. You may also think about assigning tasks or activities that will build and enhance their skills.

, Everyone has certain things that can distract them from work: social media, chatting or texting friends, playing games, watching television, etc. When you are working, make sure to minimize potential distractions, and especially those that you know you are especially drawn to.Avoid checking your personal email, text messages and home voice mail while working. These activities steal time away from your productivity and, in many cases, can be taken care of after work hours.
Limit the time you spend online. Avoid surfing the Internet, checking social networking sites or posting on discussion forums related to personal matters.
Save private conversations with coworkers for lunchtime and other breaks.
Recognize the limits of your concentration. Most people can’t concentrate on a task for more than 90 minutes without a break.Interruptions can also reduce your ability to concentrate.
Be persistent if people try to pull you away from your work. For instance, if people distract you by chatting, tell them you have work that you’ve got to finish, but you’d love to catch up with them later.

, If you know or decide that something needs to be done, don’t give up until it is. Focusing on completing work tasks when necessary will give you more time for personal life.Try making a 30-day effort to resist procrastination. If you know you have a problem with procrastination, then make it a point to resist it for a month. Doing so can give you a foundation for long-term success and a strong work ethic.

, In many cases, employers are checking social media profiles of prospective and current employees. Some employers understand social media as a part of the modern work world, but you should still follow some general guidelines.


Understand what work information needs to remain confidential—your employer may not want you to mention certain work projects, practices, etc. in public or on social media.
Keep it clean. If your grandmother would not want to see or read it, don’t post it.
Don’t post offensive or extremist content.
Interact with colleagues or coworkers when they are present on social media.

, When you are so busy with work-related tasks that you have no time for yourself, family, friends, or community, you should reassess your work/life balance. If you aren’t sure how well you are balancing your personal and professional life, ask yourself questions like:Do I feel like I have any time for myself?
Is every minute of everyday scheduled for something? How much of that schedule is filled by work-related tasks?
Have I missed family or community events because I was trying to catch up on work?
How often do I bring work home with me?

, One way to separate your personal and professional life is to limit how often you think about work when at home. Just as being distracted by personal matters can reduce your work productivity, thinking too much about work while at home takes away from your personal life.Set a time limit on business communications at home. If you must check work email and messages while at home, designate a specific, limited amount of time for this. Ask coworkers not to call you with business-related matters on your day off.
Leave thoughts about work at work. When at home, focus on family matters, hobbies and personal interests.
Limit discussions of work matters at home and when speaking to friends.

, It is important, however, that you define a non-work identity.


Take up a hobby
Make time for non-work friends
Take vacations or “stay-cations”

Set aside time for non-work activities you enjoy (seeing movies, going for a walk, etc.)
Share hobbies, games, etc. with family
Exercise

, If you have been working too much or avoiding social interaction outside of work, then make yourself set aside time to hang out with non-work friends or go and do some activities you enjoy. Look for opportunities to meet people outside of work, as these can contribute to a satisfying personal life.


If you are good friends with your coworkers, consider establishing a rule to discuss work only during office hours.

, Many people have lots of tasks to take care of at home in addition to those at work. These may include chores, cleaning, home improvement, taking care of children or other family members, etc. Make sure to ask others in your household for help with some of these tasks so that the workload is balanced., Taking a break now and then from everyone else—including coworkers, family, and friends—is a good way to deal with stress, to relax your mind, and to improve your mood. Try exercising and meditating, and look for games and hobbies that you can do on your own.

Prioritize positive relationships.,
Bring healthy foods into your household.,
Ask for help when you need it.,
Adopt a volunteer commitment.,
Invite loved ones to join you.",How to Practice Self Care Without Being Selfish1," Spending time with supportive people is one of the most effective ways to care for yourself. Having quality social support increases your resilience to life stressors, boosts immunity, and provides a sense of community. Whether support comes from coworkers, family, friends, or members of a church or organization, you can benefit from these strong social ties.


In addition to offering you a host of advantages, being a part of a support system means that others will benefit, too. Just as you receive support, comfort, or encouragement, you will also give it to others. This comes not just from spending time with them, but from the things you will do as a result of prioritizing your relationships with them.
For best results, choose groups that make you feel valued, peaceful, and positive about life. Avoid people who are unhealthy influences or who bring negativity into your life.;
, A major aspect of a self-care plan is a balanced diet. Nourishing your body with whole, healthy foods helps you fight off stress, manage your weight, and live longer. Plus, you don’t have to feel selfish about adopting a better diet because everyone in your household can benefit.


If you are responsible for the grocery-shopping and cooking in your home, you can positively influence the self-care of your loved ones by selecting healthier choices to stock your fridge and pantry. Choose real foods over those that have been processed. Go for whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and low-fat sources of dairy.If you aren’t responsible for your household’s meals, you might inspire healthy choices by committing to improving your own diet. Drink more water instead of sugary drinks. Fill your plate with more vegetables than bread or pasta. Avoid excessive snacking between meals., It may not seem like it, but refusing to communicate your needs can be detrimental to your own well-being and your relationships with others. Too frequently, we are quick to extend assistance to friends and family, but slow to make our own requests. Sometimes, asking for help can be a necessary tool to improve your self-care. And, surprisingly, your friends and family will reap the benefits from helping you.


Research shows that lending a hand to someone else can benefit the giver's brain in the areas of stress, reward, and caregiving—meaning when loved ones help you, they ease stress, satisfy their inner need to care for others, and receive the equivalent of a mental treat.The next time you need help moving, could use a night off from the kids, or don’t know how to solve a complex problem, reach out to your support group. Say, “I could really use an extra pair of hands with the move this weekend. Are you available?” or “Do you mind watching Cody this weekend for a few hours?”, You, too, can experience the same gains from helping others by offering your time and skills in your local community. Improve your social skills, make new contacts, add purpose to your life and improve your mood with community service.Consider tutoring or reading to kids at the area schools. Volunteer a few hours at a local animal or homeless shelter. Offer to do crafts at the nursing home. Think carefully about what types of activities or groups interest you and find an opportunity in your area.

, If engaging in self-care activities make you feel a bit selfish, have a loved one accompany you. By turning it into a shared activity that strengthens your bond, you won’t feel so guilty.


Fancy going shopping? Ask your best friend to come along. You may even try to surprise your friend by buying them something as a kind gesture. Treating yourself to a nice lunch? Insist that your partner meet you there. Go for a mani-pedi and bring your daughter, sister, mom or niece.

Have a goal in mind.,
Focus on weak areas, not skills you already have mastered.,
Practice deliberately.,
Break down complex actions into smaller parts.,
Learn from your mistakes.,
Practice how you play.",How to Practice1," Think about what you want to get out of practicing -- do you want to be the next great trumpet player or do you simply want a better serve for your next tennis match? Knowing your goals helps you home in on what you need to practice the most. Be specific with your goals.



Sports: Do you want to make a new team? Set a personal record? Hit more free-throws?

Music: Do you want to increase your vocal range? Get a recording contract? Play all of the notes in ""Flight of the Bumblebees?""

Intellectual: Do you want to get straight A's next semester? Write your first novel? Get into medical school?;
, While it feels good to practice things you are good at, the point of training is to improve on skills you don't have. Spend your time working on things you are bad at or you will never get any better at your chosen activity.Sports: Work on your opposite foot, learn a new move or technique, or try new position.

Music: Develop scales and chords you don't know well, play at a different tempo then usual, or learn a song in a genre you don't normally play.

Intellectual: Take a class in a different subject then normal, write essays on topics that require research, and push beyond the minimum for projects and assignments.

, While you can certainly practice guitar scales while watching TV, if you are not paying close attention to yourself you will pick up bad habits and learn slowly. You want to practice deliberately, not mindlessly, to make the most of your time. After you complete a task, think about how it went: Where did you make a mistake? What worked well? How can you improve next time?



Sports: Don't focus on the final score in practice, focus on your technique. Are you getting stronger? Did you connect more passes than normal? Were you in the proper position to help your team?

Music: Focus on playing everything perfectly, without bum or missed notes. Even if you have to slow down, focus on getting everything right and note where you make mistakes

Intellectual: Always check your work, and find out where you made a mistake if you get the wrong answer.

, If you are trying to practice fixing a bicycles, for example, don't practice on the whole thing at once. Practicing changing tires one day, making sure you have the skill down, then work on fixing the brakes. This is the time for ""drills:"" specific, small actions that you can repeat over and over again like playing scales, shooting free-throws or changing flats.Sports: If you are struggling to make a lay-up in basketball, stop and practice each step separately: dribbling at speed, jumping towards the hoop without stopping, and placing the basketball.

Music: Don't try to tackle difficult songs all at once. Stop and practice 2-3 seconds at a time. Once you get those few seconds down, move on to the next few seconds.

Intellectual: Don't approach a test trying to learn everything at once. Do easy practice problems first, then add more complex ideas, like starting with binomials before moving on to polynomials.

, Do not worry about making mistakes -- this is the time for them. Exploring, experimenting, and noting the things that went wrong will expand you knowledge of your field and leads to new discoveries. When you make a mistake simply take note of it and think about how you can fix it next time. If you make the same mistake repeatedly, slow down and try to diagnose the problem. Work on fixing the mistake until you solve it to avoid learning bad habits.Sports: Watching filmed copies of the game and talking to coaches will help you quickly diagnose problems and find ways to fix them.

Music: When possible, record yourself playing. As you play it back, listen in for mistakes that you might have missed before.

Intellectual: Whenever you do not understand why got a problem wrong or got a bad grade, ask someone to explain it to you so you don't make the same mistake twice.

, To have the best performance when it matters, whether at a show, in the office, or on the field, you need to develop good habits when you practice. This means paying attention to the little things now so that you don't have to focus on them when you need to perform. Think about your posture, surroundings, and equipment when you practice.Sports: Wear the proper equipment (shoes, clothes, pads, etc.) when you practice so you are used to them when you get in a game.

Music: Avoid things like slouching or laying down when you practice -- if you wouldn't do it on stage, don't do it at home.

Intellectual: Playing music or watching TV while you study, write, or do research distracts you from learning effectively.

Whether self-care consists of a daily yoga session, a quiet cup of coffee before everyone else wakes up, or a weekly visit to a hairstylist, these activities help you pour into yourself.


When you overlook your own needs in favor of others, you run the risk of developing conditions like depression, anxiety, or substance abuse.

Taking my kids to the daycare allows me to run errands when they’re gone and be present when they come home.”You can also ask family and close friends to hold you accountable. If they catch you making self-critical statements, ask them to prompt you to change the way you are talking about yourself in that moment.

, If you’re new to self-care, it can quickly seem over-indulgent if you’re mapping out several hours each day to focus on you. Although the benefits of self-care are evident, you might be slow to warm up. Try a more gradual approach to pampering yourself.


Take a few minutes each day to ask your inner self what you need. Listen. Is it a break from work? A good night’s rest? A healthy and hearty meal? Meet these needs, and notice how you feel afterwards.
Over time, you will start to notice how vital self-care is to your health and well-being. You will also become more attuned to your thoughts, feelings, and needs.You may even want to consider making a schedule to see what times you have open for self-care. This can help you manage time for yourself without clashing with other responsibilities or time with others.

, To some, taking care of others is a top priority—even when it results in a neglect of self. If this sounds like you, you could be struggling with codependency, which is making someone else more important than you to the point that your life revolves around that person. Codependency is at the core of addiction. So, if you are codependent, it may be good to seek help right away before the problem worsens.


Ask your family doctor about a mental health therapist in your area. Working with a professional to improve your relationship with yourself may allow you to open up to the idea of self-care and stop neglecting your personal needs.Remember, codependency can be just as damaging to other person as it is to you.

Have the resources to fight emotional and mental stress.,
Prevent future resentment.,
Give your loved ones the very best version of you.",How to Practice Self Care Without Being Selfish3," When you engage in self-care activities you are elevated into a position in which you have greater awareness of your emotional needs. This allows you to more effectively attend to those needs and/or communicate them to others in an adaptive way.


When you are nurturing yourself, you are in a better place to deal with relationship problems, negotiate solutions to conflict, and care for others. As a result, you will find that you are more resilient in the face of stress.Practicing nurturing yourself also helps to increase your emotional intelligence, which can help make you a better, more insightful friend or companion.

, You have undoubtedly been on the receiving end of someone begrudgingly doing you a favor while waiting merely a heartbeat before throwing it back in your face. They couldn't wait to remind you how they went out of their way to help, completely ruining an altruistic gesture. This is common when you try to pour into someone else's cup and your own is empty.


Put simply, when you say “yes” to requests you don’t want to do or give more than you can, you set yourself up for feeling resentment later. Pouring love and nourishment into yourself through self-care reduces your need to feel like you are making undue sacrifices for others.

, When you are running on empty from a lack of sleep, poor diet, and zero stress-management, you feel terrible. What’s more, those around you experience the negative impact, too. You are grumpy, irritable, and possibly on a short fuse.


When you take the time to care for yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally you have the opportunity to put your best foot forward in all your interactions with others. Rather than greeting everyone with a “eh” or frown, you’ll be in a better frame of mind to smile and spread good cheer that benefits everyone."

Find time to practice every day.,
Make a practice schedule.,
Plan out your practice sessions in advance.,
Practice in short ""bursts"" with periods of rest.,
Practice interrelated skills when you have downtime.",How to Practice2," To make the most of your practice you need to be working on your skill every day. Study after study has shown that consistently practicing a skill is far more useful than trying to practice for 4-5 hours once or twice a week.Even 15-20 minutes of practice 7 days a week cab be more effective than 3 hours once a week.



Sports: If you can't practice one day, try to get some exercise (run, bike, swim, etc.) in if you can.

Music: At the very least, run through your scales and 2-3 practice songs to keep practicing your speed and technique.

Intellectual: Make flashcards and review them daily when you do not have time to study.

, You want to make practicing a habit as natural as brushing your teeth. Choose a time to practice and stick to it every day. After 2-3 weeks, you brain will adapt to this schedule and prepare itself for ""practice-time."" Think of practicing like working-out: it is much easier to stay in shape if you have a set time to go to the gym .



Sports: Schedule practices 3-5 days a week, using extra days for exercise. Set aside one day a week for rest and recovery.

Music: Practice your instrument daily, aiming to work at least 1 hour each day.

Intellectual: It is much easier to learn something when you study each day as opposed to all at once the night before a test. Make a habit of practicing writing or studying daily, even if it is only for a short while., If you're learning an instrument, for example, you might set aside 20 minutes to practice scales, 20 minutes to practice chords and 20 minutes to learn a new song. Having a plan for your practice makes you more likely to stick to your routine and to visualize how you will improve.Sports: Warm up for 15 minutes, work on skill drills (passing, shooting, etc.) for 20-30 minutes, play scrimmages or game-like situations for 20-30 minutes, then cool down with stretching for 10-15 minutes.

Music: Warm up for 10 minutes with scales, then practice your songs, chords, or new techniques. End with a review of old songs you need to know or have fun practicing.

Intellectual: Start with the most difficult subject first, then easier subjects later on., Working for 4-5 hours straight can lead to boredom or burn-out, and if you start losing concentration you will practice ineffectively. Sports psychologists suggest taking a break every hour for 10-15 minutes to relax and catch your breath, but the same principle holds true for any type of practicing (music, academics, etc.).Sports: Exercise for an hour, then take 5-10 minutes off to rehydrate, stretch, and relax before returning to exercise. Limit your workouts to no more than 5 hours a day.

Music: For younger kids, try practicing for 20-30 minutes at a time, allowing them to relax in between to avoid burning out.

Intellectual: Study for at least an hour, then take a break. Go for a short walk, stretch, or listen to music for a few minutes to refresh your brain and body.

, You don't always have to be practicing to ""practice."" The more you think about your activity the better you will be when you sit down to actually practice.Sports: Watch game tape or professional athletes, stretch, and think or read about strategy.

Music: Work on reading music, especially any new songs you need to learn. Listen to other musicians playing your songs if possible.

Intellectual: Always have a notepad and pen available to jot down any ideas as they come, and read from a variety of fields for inspiration.

Allow for your systems to change and adapt.,
Go with the flow.,
Resolve to be disciplined.",How to Organize Your Family," Then sort and purge some more. There are very few organized hoarders in the world, and there’s a reason for that: organized people know what they have, so they don’t buy duplicate items and they don’t lose items to waste.Remember, The “stuff” doesn’t do the organizing for you.Don’t run out and buy 70 storage bins tomorrow. An organized person knows how to use the stuff to improve their organization.First classify, then say goodbye. Then buy.;
, Media is a major source of clutter that uses a lot of space. Slim down your books, CDs, DVDs and (for heaven’s sake) VHS tapes.These days there’s almost no reason to have physical reference books. Fiction and nonfiction books might be a different story, but unless the topic is very obscure, there is hardly any reason to keep a physical book. Dictionaries, encyclopedias, non-historical atlases, almanacs, gazetteers and desk references have all been rendered obsolete by the internet. Say goodbye.
It might be hard, but your CDs (and DVDs to a lesser extent) are very quickly going to go the way of the World Book Encyclopedia. There’s virtually no music on CD that isn’t in digital format now. Vinyl records might be a different story, because a lot of vinyl is out of print, but see if you can get rid of the CD player and the CDs.

, There are so many utensils, appliances, and accessories in the kitchen that they become a major source of clutter. Since families spend so much time in the kitchen, an organized kitchen can set the tone for the entire house.


Nail some peg boards to the wall so that you can hang pots, spoons, ladles, whisks, and the like. It gets them off your counter, out of the cabinets, and out of the drawers!Buy a few chalkboard labels to put in your kitchen cabinets. That way you can keep similar items together, but you have the freedom to change what goes where when new needs arise.
Invest in glass tupperware-style containers. For whatever reason, people can keep up with the lids to these containers far better than they can the cheap plastic kind. It will eliminate the orphan tupperware cluttering your cabinets.Store baby bottles and sippy cups in a container all their own--kids use so many that you'll run yourself ragged trying to keep every lid with every bottle., If you're going to make an honest effort at staying organized and tidy, don't neglect the tools of the trade.


Put a tension rod in the cabinet under your kitchen sink to keep the spray bottles above the bottom level--leaving your cabinets uncluttered.
Store new scrubbers, steel wool, and scouring pads in jar. That way they aren't just hanging around the cabinets in random places.

, Every disorganized home has disorganized drawers, overflowing with miscellaneous objects. Invest in drawer dividers. Not only do drawer dividers help you find what you’re looking for, they save space.Drawer dividers are great because you can use them in practically every room in your house.

, The amount of bathroom products that people accumulate can really sneak up on them. That's why it's important to look at each of the spaces individually to see where you can make improvements.Store personal grooming items, and not medicines, in the medicine cabinet. Grooming items are used more often and more often clutter the bathroom countertop.
Buy or build over-the-toilet shelving. You can store items here that aren't used on every trip, like backup soap, toilet paper, razor blades, washcloths, and towels.
It's easy to accumulate shampoos and conditioners in the shower. If you don't use it at least once a week, rotate it to a cabinet, closet, or trashcan.

, The biggest source of clutter in most people's living room are the stacks of magazines, newspapers, and coffee table books on the flat surfaces.


Instead of letting everything pile up on the flat surfaces, get a few vertical files or magazine racks and place them strategically around the couches and chairs.
Make sure you utilize the space under the coffee table for storage. Wooden boxes, metal crates, or plastic bins can all be used. Get something that fits your furniture and decor.
Put all of the mail in one place, and have different containers for each person in the house. Some people will have an office where they can store the mail, and a lot of people will use the living room. Regardless, there'll be no more stacks of junk mail piling up everywhere.

, Toys and games are a major source of clutter and mess for every parent, so making sure that they have a home is key to making sure your home stays organized.


Keep toys with a lot of separate pieces out of your children's reach so they don't get strewn about the house.
Get rid of the toys that are broken, missing parts, too young for your children, or came from a cereal box or fast food chain.
Pay attention to how your child's classroom is organized and emulate it. A typical classroom will hold anywhere from 20-40 kids, so they need to be organized well. Your child is used to this system, so use the habits your child already has to make your life easier. Look for details like where toys are kept (usually down low), where coats are hung, where personal belongings are stored., Disorganization causes forgetfulness, which causes you to waste time. Set up an inbox and an outbox to minimize forgotten tasks.When a piece of mail comes for someone, or a task arises that they need to do, put it in the inbox. Immediately.
The same thing goes for the outbox. When something comes up that they will need to handle outside the home, like turning in an assignment or running an errand, put it in the outbox right away.

, Everybody has to eat, so everyone goes in the kitchen. Therefore, put the master list of things to do in the kitchen, where everyone will see it.The master list is best suited for regular tasks, like cleaning and yardwork. Putting a note to mow the grass in the outbox or every time a floor needs to be swept is going to cause you to micromanage too much.

, Leveraging technology is a great way to keep your family organized outside the home, and calendar apps provide the most bang for the buck.


Cozi is a well-known app designed specifically with parents in mind. It allows you to create a shared calendar, sync everyone’s schedules, create to-do lists, grocery lists, and plan meals. It works on Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, and on PC. There are free and paid versions, with the paid version topping out at $19.99 per year.Google calendar is another free option. Although Google calendar doesn’t have as many features as Cozi, you can sync schedules across platforms, create multiple calendars, and set alerts., Being late on bills, overspending, and being blindsided by unexpected costs can create chaos for anyone, disorganizing all aspects of your life. Although you can make an attempt to log every purchase and deposit in a written ledger, it might help to leverage technology to help keep track of finances as well.


Mint is a free app that helps you keep track of finances and spending. You can keep track of what you are spending and where you are spending it, unusual account activity, and Mint will send you an email if it notices something unusual. You can easily set budgets for different spending categories, which Mint will represent visually in the form of bar graphs and pie charts. It’s for use on Android, iPad, and iPhone. Best of all, setting up an account takes ten minutes., Returning to the grocery store over and over during the week takes extra time and costs more money. So use an ongoing grocery list to keep track of what you need.The simplest way to do this is to use a dry erase board on the refrigerator. You write down what you need on the board, erase it when you buy it.
However, there are more sophisticated ways to go about it. Grocery IQ is another great free tool to use. With Grocery IQ, you can make ongoing lists, but there are many more features. One great feature is the coupon alert. You scan or enter items that you frequently buy, and Grocery IQ sends you an alert right on your phone when there’s a sale or a coupon available., A great way to stay efficient is by making sure everyone is one the same page. Each night, go over the status of the items on your shared calendar and the in and out boxes. Not only does this create efficiency, it also offers the family time to talk with one another about their days.Think about this exercise as less a time when your family is going over accomplishments and failures, but as a time to listen to your family's experiences and think privately (or with your partner) about what is working and what isn't working.

, Analyze your family's routines after you implement a new organization system. Pay attention to what works and doesn't work.Ask yourself why your family is working with the system or against the system.Common questions include:


Do coats end up in a chair because the coat closet is on the other side of the room from the door?
Are you all eating together and in the same spot? If not, could that be why you’re leaving dishes all over the place?
Are toys all over your house because the children’s rooms are in different areas than their toys?

, Now that you’ve analyzed your family’s patterns, identify passive ways to change them.It’s easier to change a circumstance than it is to change a person. For example, if that coat closet is on the wrong side of the room, buy a coat rack and put it next to the door, then repurpose the coat closet. Alternatively, create an obstacle, like a piece of furniture or a new lock, that causes them the use a different door.
If you eat in different places at different times, eat in one place at the same time. It’s easier to overlook one dish in a room than it is to overlook a table full of dishes.

, Getting organized is like getting in shape: at the end of the day, there are a lot of ways to make it happen, but none of them will be effective unless you're willing to put in the work. It's less about figuring out the best way, and more about figuring out the best way for you. Organization is a mental commitment. Eventually it will become second nature, but you'll never get organized unless you create a plan and stick to it."

Establish your own mindfulness practices.,
Be present around your family.,
Spend time on self care.",How to Practice Mindfulness As a Family1," In order to practice mindfulness with your family, it is important that you model mindfulness behaviour in your own life. Your family will actually learn more from modelling your behaviour than they will from most attempts at teaching mindfulness.For example, you could set aside five minutes each day to practice meditation. During this time, focus on all of your senses and maintain steady deep breaths.
You can also practice self-compassion during stressful moments of the day. For example, acknowledge that you are stressed and ask yourself ""What do I need?"";
, One way to model mindfulness is by being present. If you are always distracted and on your phone when you are around your family, you are teaching them that listening isn’t important. Instead, crouch down to your child’s level and make eye contact when you are speaking with them. If you notice your mind wandering, ask questions and refocus on the present.Model active listening skills to demonstrate that you are paying attention.
For example, try to rephrase and repeat what is said to you during a conversation. This will help you stay focused.

, In order to model mindfulness, it is important as a parent to take time for yourself. When you are juggling your career and family, life can get stressful. Parents often put unnecessary pressure on themselves to be perfect. Take time for yourself so that you can stop and really focus on enjoying the moment.For example, try exercising, visiting a spa, reading, or simply taking a nap.
Alternatively, you may want to spend some quality time with your partner, away from your children. Try implementing a monthly date night to allow you to focus some of your attention on maintaining a healthy relationship.

Create a behavior modification plan.,
Observe and describe the behavior.,
Measure your baseline.,
Come up with a replacement behavior.,
Monitor your progress.As you start your behavior modification plan, you will want to continue collecting data throughout.",How to Make Serious Life Changes1," If you truly want to make serious life changes, you can't just say you will and let it alone. You need to commit. A behavior modification plan is an action-oriented way to commit and monitor your changes. Behavior modification means exactly what you think it means--it's a method of changing the way you act to certain stimuli in your environment.Behavioral modification techniques allow you to replace undesirable behaviors with those which are desirable through a range of approaches. One of the most common approaches is positive reinforcement, which is the process of increasing a specific behavior by adding a reward when it occurs.
Behavioral modification is a psychological concept that can be used for virtually all behaviors that you want to change by either completely getting rid of them or increasing how often you do them. You can use these principles to stop smoking, lose weight, get up earlier, or end your procrastination problem.;
, Behavior modification requires that you thoroughly understand the undesirable behavior in order to replace it. You might ask yourself any or all of the following questions to get a better handle on the behavior and when/why/where/how it happens:When do you do it? What times? How long does it last? Who is usually present when it happens? How does this person impact the behavior? What things are present in the environment a few minutes before it happens? What things are present in the environment a few minutes after it happens?
For example, in order to lose weight you may want to reduce the amount of fast food you consume each week. You will first need to know how much fast food you are eating, and under what conditions.

, Just jumping right into a behavior modification plan without collecting any data beforehand can jeopardize your results. Spend several days or weeks carefully examining the occurrence of the behavior that you want to change, answering some of the questions that help describe it.Methods for measuring might be to tally the amount of fast food meals you eat each week, as well as determining exactly what you typically order and how much you eat of these meals (e.g. burger, fries, and milkshake with a total of 1238 calories).

, Since you are looking to make a major life change, odds are, you want to stop some undesirable behaviors. As such, it can be helpful to devise a list of alternative behaviors you can do to help with the transition. Once you closely understand the reason you engage in the undesirable behavior (by describing and observing it), you can then find healthier behaviors that meet the same urge or stimulus.For example, if you realize that you always eat fast food on days you work late, you can pack a snack or prepare a few healthy meals ahead of time to suit this purpose. If you want to cut back on alcohol and tend to drink socially, you might skip a few hangouts or ask your friends to meet up for coffee instead., Doing so helps you identify patterns or even new stimuli that promote the undesirable behavior of which you weren't aware.


On the positive side, writing down how much the undesirable behavior is occurring and how much the new replacement behavior is occurring can show you whether you have truly decreased the likelihood of it happening.

Practice breathing techniques together.,
Take a listening walk.,
Focus on your bodies.,
Meditate as a family.",How to Practice Mindfulness As a Family2," Focused and controlled breathing is an important component of mindfulness and something that you can practice together as a family. In order to learn deep breathing have everyone inhale and count to four, hold the breath for a count of four, exhale for a count of four, and finally count to four before inhaling again. You could also try a fun breathing exercise called breathing buddy. Have each family member lie down in a circle with a weighted “breathing buddy” placed on their tummy. Then watch the buddy rise and fall while focusing on breathing.This will help make sure everyone is breathing properly using the diaphragm.
Slow down the breathing by counting to three as you inhale and back down to one during the exhale.
For toddlers and younger children they could use a small weighted stuffed animal as a breathing buddy. For older kids and teenagers they could use a rock, shell, or other trinket.

, This is a great way to help each member relax and focus on the present. Walk through the woods while being silent and taking in the natural environment. Adults often overlook their surrounding environment and this type of activity can help you appreciate your life.Alternatively you could try walking through a crowded shopping centre. Your mind will likely focus on your surroundings rather than getting distracted by thoughts of work or other activities.
At the end of the walk ask the members of your family what they noticed while walking.
Alternatively, you could go for a walk as a family and have two to five minutes of silent time and then discuss things you noticed for the rest of the walk., Another mindfulness activity you can do as a family, involves sitting or lying down together and then focusing on different parts of the body. Allow each member of the family to announce a body part and then discuss how that part feels. This forces your mind to engage and focus on the present activity. Then ask your kids to describe how they are feeling by focusing on a specific body part.For example, you could begin by saying “I’m focused on my feet, and they are sore.” Then your partner could say “I am focused on my stomach, and it is hungry.”
Continue this exercise until interest wanes or you can just do one round daily.

, Set aside five minutes each day for family meditation. Once, everyone becomes comfortable meditating, you can increase the time to ten minutes. In order to meditate, have each family member find a comfortable place to sit and then close their eyes and focus on breathing and positive visualization.

"
Create a mindfulness routine together.,
Create a mindfulness space in your home.,
Eat meals together.",How to Practice Mindfulness As a Family3," In order to practice mindfulness as a family, you will need to set aside time to engage in mindfulness activities. It is important for these types of activities to become habitual and part of your regular routine. For example, set aside time before bed to engage in family meditation or breathing exercises.Alternatively, you could have quiet periods during the day when no one is allowed to communicate. This will allow each individual to focus on their own thoughts and acts without getting distracted.
You could also share with your family experiences from throughout the day when you practiced mindfulness. Ask your family members to share a few examples as well.

, Another way to incorporate mindfulness into your family life is by creating a space in your home designated specifically for mindfulness activities. By designating a specific location for mindfulness you are helping to ensure that mindfulness becomes a regular habit in your family.For instance, you could have one corner of the living room dedicated to mindfulness or you could devote an entire room to the practice.
Ensure this space is quiet and comfortable.
You could also ask each member of the family to place an item in this area. This will provide a personal connection for every family member.

, Eating dinner together, even if it is only once a week, is an excellent way to practice mindfulness as a family. You can discuss things that are happening in your lives, list things that you appreciate and are grateful for, or you can have everyone think about and focus on the flavours they are tasting.This type of appreciation allows everyone to take the time to focus on the good things in life.

Assess yourself.,
Prepare for roadblocks.,
Seize opportunities.,
Make a plan with small steps.What is it that you need to do to take you from point A to point B?",How to Make Serious Life Changes2," Before you can make lasting change you must decide exactly what needs to be changed and understand why. You need to know your values, your personal strengths, and areas of weakness. These shortcomings can guide you in recognizing areas in your life in which you would like to direct more time, energy, and resources to improving.


A great self-assessment resource is the Life Values Self-Assessment that you can find by doing a quick Google search.This assessment allows you to rank your core values by order of importance in order to determine which are most relevant to you having a fulfilling life.

, There is a reason that making the changes that you want are hard, and why they haven't already been made. Try to figure out what is holding you back, be it a lack of time or willpower. The problem will be much easier to tackle if you understand the source of the resistance.Sit down and make a list of all the things you think are standing in the way of you making a change in your life. Be honest with yourself. Many of these obstacles will probably be inner sources of resistance that only you have power over.
For example, maybe you are afraid of change. Or, maybe you lack confidence in your ability to change. Carefully examine your situation to determine what you are up against.

, Even when we have all the makings of a truly wonderful life, it can still suck if we look back and regret all the chances we didn’t take. Perhaps you had the chance to relocate for a dream job on the other side of the world. Or, you were undecided as to whether you should propose to your college sweetheart. If you truly want to make serious life changes, you will need to learn how to spot good opportunities and pounce on them before they disappear.


Opportunity looks different depending on your unique values and goals.In general, it’s presented as a chance to do something meaningful, challenging, or scary. The challenging part is why so many people let opportunities pass them by. They don’t usually come wrapped up in a bow—they require us to grow and perform to win them.
You can seize opportunities by removing the constraints society places on you. Ask yourself what you would do if you could not fail. Be open to possibilities around every corner, even if they are unexpected or not wrapped in the best package. If a choice looks like it can benefit your future, take it.

, Break each problem down to its simplest components until you can draw a map leading from where you are to where you need to go. You might have to ask yourself if what you want to achieve is worth what you have to do to get there.


When you make your plan, be sure that it's feasible. You don't want to develop an action plan that requires you to eat the whole elephant in a day. Instead, break down large tasks to make them more manageable. When you're faced with actually eating the elephant, the only feasible way you can do it is one bite at a time.
Make your plan as clear and detailed as possible. For instance, if you are trying to lose a large amount of weight, you might focus first on changing lifestyle habits, such as your diet and activity level. You can set a deadline outlining a date by when you want to see changes in this area. Then, you might focus on sticking with these changes, tracking the results you see over time. It's overwhelming to have the goal that ""I need to lose 100 pounds,"" but it's much more realistic to say ""I will eat more vegetables, cut all beverages except water, and walk 3 miles each day.""

Be more mindful.,
Assess your social circle.When you are hoping to bring about major changes in your life, you must activate those around you in this venture as well.,
Find an accountability partner.No matter what kind of big life changes you are undertaking, such an endeavor can be stressful and frustrating.,
Be patient.",How to Make Serious Life Changes3," Mindfulness is a practice that can positively influence both your physical and mental health. Learning this practice can help you enjoy greater awareness of yourself, and as a result, limit the undesirable behaviors you develop. Mindfulness helps you better react to stress, improves sleep quality, decreases worry and anxiety, and promotes life engagement.There are a variety of helpful mindfulness techniques.


Basic mindfulness meditation is used to promote relaxation and calm. Sit comfortably and quietly in a room with no distractions. Breathe deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth, keeping your focus on your breath. Allow your thoughts to enter and depart from your mind freely with no judgment. There is no need to criticize yourself for letting your mind wander—just notice that you have become distracted and promptly return the focus to your breath.
Urge surfing is a great technique for those with addictions or other unwanted behaviors. You simply sit quietly while deep breathing as cravings manifest. You will notice the physical sensations happening in your body due to the craving. Rather than wishing that the craving go away, tell yourself inwardly that--like the tides of an ocean--it will naturally fade in a few moments.

, No, your friends, coworkers, and family members don't have to go on this journey with you, but you do need to determine whether they are helping or hurting your progress.


Sometimes, our friends are so used to us acting a certain way that they rebel against us if we change. If you have anyone in your social circle that is unhappy about you making positive changes, or is trying to sabotage your growth, you need to take action.
For example, you are trying to lose weight but have a friend who is always bringing you cupcakes. You will need to confront the person to ensure that you do not get off track with the sweet treats. You might pull your friend aside and say “Hey, Alice, I know you mean well by bringing cupcakes, but I’m trying to cut back on baked goods. How about next time we get together and make fruit and yogurt parfaits?”

, Having someone with you on your journey can be an invaluable asset, as this person can hold you accountable for reaching your goals.


An accountability partner is someone who you will have to keep updated on your progress. This person may offer you advice, support, or just try to motivate you when the going gets tough.Your accountability partner can be anyone or several people. Your partner or spouse, a sibling, a close friend, or coworker can all help you during this life change. You can even find an accountability partner through an online forum or chat room who is going through a similar journey as you, or who has already made a significant change.

, Whether it's a new exercise program or a complete overhaul of your relationships with the people that you know, once you have your plan, don't give up on it. Work hard to ensure that you reach your overall goals. Changing any part of your life can be a grueling process, celebrate every small win and keep pushing towards the finish line.

This can come with huge ups and downs in your emotions. Don't try to swallow those feelings; allow yourself to go through this phase and let it guide you to finding what's missing from your life.;
, Living the life you want involves really doing things that make you happy, both every day and on a grand scale. Look at short-term pursuits and long-term goals that will make you happy.


It may be helpful to actually brainstorm a list. Write down everything that you think might make you happy, every interest you have that you don't currently dedicate time to and every lifestyle change you might consider. Then prioritize these; rate them both according to difficulty and priority in your mind. This will allow you to get the big picture on potential changes and start small before working your way up to big lifestyle changes that will make a big difference in your future.

, Big life changes can be, well, big. Switching jobs, moving house, or changing your relationship status can't be done lightly. But that doesn't mean these changes aren't worth doing, if they'll make you happier. Be practical about what's financially feasible and realistic given your current situation.


For example, if you want to change jobs but don't have the qualifications or financial security to switch careers right at the moment, start by taking community college or online classes in your new area of interest. Build your skills and resume slowly, while maintaining your current job security, in order to make a bigger switch down the line.
If you want to move to a new town or country but feel like a huge change is impractical, consider some compromises. If the unknown is holding you back, can you take an extended holiday or sabbatical in the place you might want to live, and see how you like it longer-term before deciding whether or not to move? If your financial situation is your limitation, can you downsize your housing in order to live somewhere you'll really love? Brainstorm your options for living your dream without abandoning all practicality.

, You might have heard this phrase before, but how often have you truly been fearless? Making changes in your life is always scary. Have the courage to take the first step and if you really, deeply wish to succeed then you can stay dedicated to a new goal, even if it involves a big transition. Don't be afraid of diving into something you think will really help you live the life you want.

, If you're planning a big life change, it may help to have someone neutral to talk to about it. This will give you a place to share your concerns and anxieties, without being subject to the opinions of your friends and family before you're ready. It'll also give you someone to help you sort through what you really want out of life. While smaller life changes for happiness might be easy to tackle alone, bigger ones can made more feasible with a little outside help.

, Don't just plan once - plan twice. Making a big life change involves risks. You should approach this without fear, but with preparedness. Have a back up plan before you try something new. This will buy you some time to experiment with your plan and try variations if something goes wrong.


Failure is your best guide. Each time you fail, you will identify the right path you missed to take.

, Your interests and pursuits are likely to be varied, so there's no need to focus on only one passion. Be open to new experiences and passions; if you try something and it doesn't make you happy, keep pursuing others. Look around and you will find many multi-passionate people just like you, who are extremely successful.

, We're often held back by people's expectations, but try to break free of this attitude. Do you really need a go-ahead from your parents, friends, relatives, in-laws and others before you make changes that make you happy? You cannot convince everyone right at the start of your journey; focus on what you want, explain your reasons to those closest to you (your spouse, etc), and then accept the fact that not everyone will agree. If you pursue your passions and find happiness that way, they'll come around in time.

, You would never know the right time unless you start now. You always have the liberty to alter your plans; nothing you do is truly stuck in stone forever. Even big life changes can be changed again. So what is holding you back? Go ahead and live a life that you want.

Stay strong emotionally.",How to Write a Eulogy For a Father," A eulogy is different from an obituary. An obituary is an overview of the facts of someone's life. It covers things like achievements, career, place of birth, surviving family, and so on. Eulogies focus on capturing the essence of who someone was.As obituaries are fact-based, they are often less emotional. A eulogy focuses on a person's story. What did this person's life mean? What did this person mean to you?
Avoid writing laundry lists of achievements, and including an excess of facts about the person. Instead, focus on stories and memories that speak to who a person's character.;
, Before you start writing, a brainstorming session can help get your mind going. Spend some time jotting down memories and stories, as well as things you remember about your father's character. This can help you find an angle for your obituary.Start by writing down all initial ideas you have about your father. What do you first think of when thinking about your father? What is your strongest memory of him? What words come to mind when trying to describe your father?
Also, think about what external things you associate with your father. What music reminds you of your dad, as well as movies, television shows, foods, sounds, and smells? You may want to immerse yourself in these things as you write, as this may trigger some valuable memories for your eulogy.

, A eulogy should be concise and make a point. You do not want a disparate connection of memories. As you brainstorm, try to figure out a larger theme. What central theme or message ties the various memories together?You do not have to be insightful or make sense of death. It's okay to admit death is terrible and baffling. Try to make sense of a person's life. Who was your father and what will the world be like without him?
You can figure out vague concepts as a theme. Maybe your father was an attorney who took on civil rights cases. You can focus on the theme of generosity, community, and helping others. Maybe your father was a business man who made his own fortune. Your theme can be something like the benefits of tenacity, hard work, and dedication.
You can also talk about what you learned from your father. What is the greatest lesson he taught you? How do you incorporate that lesson in your life today?

, There are many different ways to organize your eulogy. Your organization method depends on your eulogy's theme, as well as what information you're including. As you pre-write, figure out the best way to organize your eulogy.You can write your eulogy in chronological order. This may be helpful if you include anecdotes from your father's early life, as well as his later life. If you find your stories and memories come from different points in time, chronological order may make sense.
You can also organize your eulogy by ideas. If you're talking about several characteristics of your father, all illustrated by different moments and memories, organize by ideas. For example, you're talking about your father's success as a business man and how this success was due to determination, work ethic, and personal skill. You can have a section on each of these qualities, and include appropriate memories and anecdotes.

, It may feel awkward, as many people at a funeral will know you, but it is customary to begin a eulogy with a brief introduction. Let the audience know who you are, and what your relationship to the deceased was.This will probably be the easiest part of the eulogy. You simply have to say who you are, and how close you were to your father. This helps give you credibility.
For example, you can open with something like, ""My name is Jane Sherman, and we are gathered here today to say good by to my father, Glenn. I was an only child, and because of this particularly close to my dad. We talked almost every day, even after I moved away from home.""

, Tone is important to a eulogy. You will want to stick with a consistent tone throughout your work. Think about what kind of tone would best convey the message you're attempting to get across.You may want to talk with your family and the funeral director here. You want your tone to match the service. If it's a religious ceremony, you may want to adopt a somber and respectful tone, for example.
However, do not let the service completely dictate tone. You want your tone to reflect who your father was as a person, primarily. If your father was a jovial person, always joking around, you can adopt a more lighthearted tone. Think of your eulogy more as a celebration of a life than an act of grieving.

, Most eulogies should include at least one story about the deceased. Opening with a story can help engage your audience. Select a story that speaks to your father as a person here. Your story should convey the overarching theme of your eulogy.For example, say your eulogy is about how your father was always able to find fun, despite having a somewhat difficult life. Select an anecdote that speaks to your father's ability to find levity, despite the circumstances.
Say your father died of lung cancer. You can talk about how he faced his diagnosis with humor. You could start with something like, ""When my father first found out he had cancer, he joked about his treatment options. I remember him saying to me, 'I'm optimistic about radiation though.' When I asked him why, hoping the prognosis was positive, he responded, 'I'm hoping exposure to radiation will turn me into a superhero. I could be the next Spiderman.'""

, In addition to capturing an overarching sense of who your father was, work on recording tiny details. This will help ground your audience and give them small, physical reminders of your father to help with the grieving process.Sensory details can help. Maybe your father loved working outdoors, and he always smelled like soil. Maybe your father loved the color red, and almost always incorporated red into his wardrobe.
Include as many tiny details as you remember. For example, ""I remember my dad was always signing old Johnny Cash songs, and he had a deep, baritone voice just like Johnny Cash. I would wake up Sunday mornings to hear him singing, 'I Walk the Line' from the basement, the smell of fresh coffee wafting into my bedroom.'""

, If you're having trouble figuring out how to express something, pull in outside sources. A quote or a reference can help explain something about your father.If your father was religious, Bible quotes can help. There is a lot in the Bible about life and death, so you can look here.
You can also look into books, movies, songs, and television quotes your father loved. If your father was a huge fan of Robert Frost, you can include a line from a Robert Frost poem in your eulogy.

, A eulogy should not be completely somber. You want to provide some levity. If a eulogy is too serious, it may seem like you're romanticizing the dead. This can come off as overly preachy or sentimental. Find some moments for levity in which you talk about a person's flaws. This can provide a rounded version of the person you're remembering.Think of something funny to say about your father. Was he overly argumentative? Include a humorous story about him arguing about a bill in a diner long after everyone else had let the issue go. You could say something like, ""Despite my father's appreciation for humor, he was not perfect. He could be overly critical, and at times argumentative. I remember once, on a family vacation, we stopped at a Denny's...""
A story that illustrates flaws should be light in nature. You do not want to sound like you're angry at the deceased, as this can come off as disrespectful. You do not, for example, want to include the story of an epic, serious argument you and your dad had to illustrate he was argumentative. This will not provide laughter. Instead, focus on a low-stakes situation that will make people laugh.

, As you wrap up your eulogy, end with a few brief statements that summarize your point. This is where you will get to the meat of your theme. What was your eulogy trying to say? What do you want people to remember about your father?Think of a few final thoughts that will sum up your father for others. Tell the audience, directly, what you are trying to say. For instance, ""What I learned from my father was that life is short, and often brutal, and the best way to combat all that is with a good laugh and an ability to appreciate the small moments of joy, despite any circumstances.""
You should also thank the audience for their time. Briefly say something like, ""I appreciate you all coming out to remember my father, Glenn Sherman, and giving me an opportunity to tell you a little bit more about him. I know he would have been honored to know how many people cared enough to attend.""

, Once you have written a draft of your eulogy, print out a copy and read it through. As you read, look for moments to expand on content and provide more details when necessary.Ask yourself whether your eulogy makes sense. Do your stories illustrate your theme? Do you feel like anything is missing? Is there a story you should have included or an aspect of your father's personality you could have explored more? Is there anything that feels like it doesn't belong?
Add to your eulogy as needed. If you feel like there's room for expansion, expand as needed. You can also cut anything out that you feel like does not add to the theme. Time is an issue. The average eulogy should only last 5 to 7 minutes.

, When delivering your eulogy, it can help to have a portion memorized. This can make the delivery go smoother. You do not need to memorize the entire eulogy. You should keep some notes during delivery, as you may be nervous or emotional when delivering the speech.If you want to memorize the whole speech, memorize small chunks one at a time. It can be daunting to remember everything.
You should write down notes with reminders on them. This will help you stay on track as you deliver your speech.

, You should practice your eulogy several times in the days leading to the funeral. Read it out loud to yourself, or before a mirror. Focus on moments where you stumble, and practice those portions more.You can ask a friend or family member to listen to you practice. They can give you feedback on how to make your delivery smoother.

, It is never easy to write a eulogy, and it can be particularly trying if you're writing a eulogy for your father. As you work on your eulogy, try to stay strong emotionally.Reach out to others. Your existing relationships are important during grief. Lean on friends and family members during your weak moments.
Try to work on reframing your sense of identity. Losing a parent can make you feel you've lost a source of personal guidance. Try to think about who you are without your father, and how you can move forward.
Stay in the present. Remember, the present is where your life is occurring right now. Be grateful for what you do have. Try to be thankful for life each day, and live it to the fullest despite your loss.

Leave your contact information with your friends and family.",How to Leave Home for the First Time," Perhaps the first step you should take when making preparations to leave home is to secure a place to live. Ultimately, without a place to live, you’ll have a tough time managing a job, school, or anything else in your life. As a result, make this search a priority.


Talk to friends or family in the area where you plan on living.
Search online websites that are dedicated to real estate rentals or sales.
Contact a Realtor or a property management firm in the area you’ll be moving to find a suitable place to buy or rent.
If you’re a student, contact your college or university for a list of recommended student housing solutions. You might consider an on-campus dormitory.
Think about enlisting potential roommates. You might also think about renting or subletting a room from someone who already has a home. Having roommates will drastically cut down the cost of renting a home.
Find out exactly what date you’ll be able to move into your new home.;
, After you’ve got a place to live and know when you can move in, you need to set up your utilities. Without setting up your utilities, it will be very hard to function in your new home.


Important utilities you need to think about usually include: electricity, water, and cable and internet. Depending on your region and municipality you might also need to consider a natural gas provider, trash pickup, and sewer service.
Ask your landlord or real estate agent about the utility companies that serve the property you’ll be living on.
If you’re moving in with someone who already has utilities set up, talk to that person about how utilities will be split.
Contact all of your utility providers and arrange a day for them to turn the utilities on.
If you’re starting new service, you may need to pay a deposit or connection fee., Now that you’ve got a home and utilities ready to roll, you will need to arrange for transportation for your move. Depending on your circumstances, you’ll need to arrange travel and transportation to your new home. Either way, it is important to think about transportation as soon as you can.


If you’re moving and have a lot of stuff to bring with you (like furniture), you’ll need to look into renting a moving truck. Make sure you measure your furniture and other things you’ll be moving, so that you will have enough space.
If you’re moving and don’t have a lot of stuff, you might just be able to move it in a car, SUV, or a truck. Use your own vehicle, or a friend or family member’s to move your stuff.
If you’re just moving across town, consider moving your stuff slowly over the course of a few weeks. , One important thing to have as you move out of the home is a support network. Whether you’re moving far from home, or just around the corner, you should invest some time in making sure that you’ll have friends and family available to support you emotionally (and to socialize with). This is important, as without a support network, you may feel isolated.


If you’re going off to college, there is a good chance you might know a few people who are going to the same school. Try to get their contact information ahead of time, so you’ll be able to meet up with them.
Even if you’re just moving across town, try to get a handle of how far your friends and family will be. Also, see if you have any friends and family close to where you’ll be living. Just having someone 10 minutes away could make a world of difference.
If you’re moving to a town or city where you don’t know anyone, consider joining social clubs or similar groups in order to make friends., After you’ve lined everything up, you’ll need to pack up all your belongings. Next to physically moving your stuff, packing can be one of the most stressful things you’ll deal with. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time and think about what you need to take.


Buy plenty of boxes to pack your stuff.
Pack systematically. Move through your dressers and bedroom furniture piece-by-piece. Don’t forget anything.
Make piles or stacks of like-kind items. If you’ve got games spread out, put all of your games together before you put them into a box., When you try to rent or buy a home, your credit score will be checked. If this is your first time on your own, you may not have a credit history, and you may be required to have someone with a good credit score co-sign on loans, leases, and other financial agreements. To avoid this, try building up your credit before you leave home.

Get a secured credit card. Pay it off fully every month to build credit. If you do not pay it off, it will hurt your credit rather than build it.
Make sure you have a checking account open with a positive balance. Taking more money out of your bank account than you have can hurt your credit.
If you already make car payments, these can help your credit score if they are paid on time.

, Moving is an expensive endeavor. You need to make sure you have enough money to pay for initial housing costs, moving expenses, and expenses after you’ve settled in. Having enough money to pay the bills is critical to your success being on your own. You need to plan accordingly and accumulate as much money as you can for your move.


Be prepared to buy items you may not have thought about. One of the benefits of living at home is that your parents, guardians, and family have gone to the trouble and expense of buying all of the little things you need every day. After you out, you won’t have this benefit.
Have your security deposit and first month’s rent (or mortgage payment) ready and available.
Always keep at least some money in reserve for a rainy day., If you're moving into a place of your own, you'll most likely need a wide variety of things that you don't already have. Before you move out, you need to make a list of everything you'll need for your new place.


Plan to buy furniture. While you may be able to put a lot of furniture off, chances are you'll need to buy a bed (or futon or air mattress), a desk, and some chairs and/or a couch.
Be ready to buy a lot of little things. Little things can include dishes, silverware, cleaning supplies, bedding, towels, and more.
Consider shopping at thrift stores for a lot of the stuff you'll need.
If you'll be paying for everything by yourself, make sure that you have enough money saved up. Do not plan on paying for these one-time items out of your monthly budget.

, Before you leave home, you should find a job if you’ll need one. Ultimately, finding a job is the best way to support yourself once you are on your own and out of your house. Without the financial security offered by a job, you’re new status will be in constant jeopardy.


If you’re a college student moving out of your parents’ home, consider finding a part time job or even a full time job to supplement any money you’ll be getting from your parents or from financial aid.
If you’re moving out, and aren’t going to college, make sure you’ve got a full time job lined up before you take the big leap.
Ultimately, whatever you’ll be doing moving out of the house, you will need to make sure you have enough money to pay all of your new expenses., After you've secured a job (if needed) and saved enough money to pay your initial expenses, you need to create a budget to help you manage your finances. Creating a budget will make sure that your income (wherever it is derived from) matches or exceeds your expenses.


Add up all of your necessary expenses. This will include rent, car payments, utilities, gasoline, basic groceries, phone bills, school loans, and more.
Subtract your necessary expenses from your income (financial aid, money from parents, money from work), and see what you have.
Set aside a certain amount of money each month to put into your savings. Do not spend this money unless it is an emergency.
If you have money left over after basic expenses, you can choose to allocate some or all of your extra money to entertainment, recreation, or savings. Do not spend more than this amount each month on fun, but if you have extra money at the end of the month, you can put in savings or roll it over to the next month.
If you don't have enough to pay your necessary expenses, you need to consider a job with higher pay, a part time job, or finding a cheaper place to live. After this, if you still don't have enough money, you should consider postponing leaving home., For most people leaving home for the first time, the reason for leaving is related to either college or a new job. If this is you, you need find out when the semester starts or when you need to report for your new job. Once you get this information, time your move appropriately.


If you’re moving for school, make sure you have plenty of time to get adjusted before the semester begins. You should have at least two weeks prior to college starting in order to complete your move, stock up on supplies at home, get school supplies, and settle in.
If you’re moving for work, make sure you have at least a weekend to get settled into your new home. Ultimately, though, more time is better.

, Before you move, you should talk to your friends and family to see if they’ll be available to help you move when the time comes. This is important, as moving is always made a lot easier when you have people who care about you there to help.


Depending on when your lease, job, or school starts, you may be able to time your move around the schedules of your friends and family.
Consider doing a partial move on your own, and then enlisting friends and family for the rest of the move when they are available.
Remember that enlisting your friends and family in moving is not only about actual physical moving, but about emotional support as well., Before you do anything related to the physical act of moving, you need to pin down exactly when you can move into your new home. This is extremely important as you’ll have to time everything else around your move-in date.


When you talk to your new landlord, make sure to get a concrete move-in date in writing.
If you’re purchasing a home, make sure you have a closing date set before making any arrangements. In most states, you will take position of the home right after signing the closing documents.
Try to put off other moving related responsibilities, like turning on utilities, and more, until you have a specific date that you will move in. However, if you are anxious, you can go ahead and set up accounts with your utilities to save you time once you have a date., After you’ve decided you want to move, you should sit down and have a real discussion with your family. This conversation will help soften the blow or sad feelings your family may feel.


Tell your parents you need to talk. Say something like “We should talk about my future.”
Tell them “you love them,” but you’ve got to strike out on your own.
If you’re moving for college, they may expect this. If you’re moving to pursue a love interest, a job in another city, or simply because you want a change of scenery, you should tell them., Start a conversation with your friends and family about how you’ll stay in touch. This is extremely important, as not only will your friends and family want to hear from you, but you’ll likely need the support that they’ll provide through conversations or visits.


Talk to your friends and family and ask them if there are special days or times that they would like to hear from you.
Set up times when your friends and family will visit you, or when you’ll visit them.
The more ways you can stay in touch, the better., Before you leave, you should go out of your way to provide your new contact information to your friends and family. Not only will doing this enable them to contact you (or visit), but it will let them know that you’re thinking of them and want to stay in contact.


Make copies of your contact information, including phone number, address, and email address.
Distribute the copies to friends and family.
Let your friends and family know that you want to continue to talk as often as possible."

Decide what's most important to you.,
Set boundaries.,
Be assertive.,
Put your priorities first.,
Learn to stand up for what you believe in.,
Be open to new experiences and ways of thinking.",How to Live a Fuller Life After Middle Age1," Now that you've passed middle age, you really don't need to be wasting time on things you don't enjoy. That means you need to figure out what you do enjoy spending your time on. Maybe you love throwing yourself into your work, or maybe your home life is more where you're focused. Maybe you love to travel and have adventures. Whatever it is, work on figuring out what you enjoy the most.Spend some time writing about when you feel the happiest. Ask yourself, ""What brings me the most joy?"" Another good question to ask yourself is, ""If tomorrow were my last day on earth, what would I want to do?"";
, Having healthy boundaries can help you to feel happier, especially if your boundaries are not as firm as you’d like them to be. Work on setting good boundaries in your personal and professional relationships, such as by telling people what your boundaries are and reminding them if they cross your boundaries., Being assertive in the way that you communicate with other people can also help you to feel happier past middle age. Work on developing your assertive communication skills as well, such as by expressing what you want in a direct manner and saying “No” when you cannot or do not want to do something., Once you realize what's important to you, you need to work to rearrange your life to put that first. If family is your first priority, then consider limiting your work schedule if possible. If you love to travel, consider limiting other expenses so you can travel more often., Now that you're past middle age, you've probably sorted out your values. However, you may not have always stood up for those values. Now is the time to start doing it. You have age and experience on your side.For instance, if you feel something is unethical at work, say so. Of course, you want to be civil, but you have the experience to speak up for yourself.
When you see injustice, fight against it. Work to pass local laws to help your community, for instance.
If you see someone being made to feel uncomfortable in public, stand up for them. For instance, if you see someone who is a Muslim being bullied, you could say, ""Leave them alone! Your opinions aren't wanted here."" Then go sit or stand with the person being bullied, saying, ""Are you doing okay? Can I do anything to help? Do you want me to walk you home?""

, When you reach this age, you've certainly got experience behind you. However, that also may mean that you may settle into certain ways of thinking and being. You settle into certain routines and rarely break free. Try to break away from that routine by trying new things and engaging with people you meet.For instance, take the time to listen to younger generations and figure out how they see the world.
Also keep your options open about what you can do. For instance, you may be less likely to try new things, but it's never too late to learn something new. Try scuba diving. Visit a country you've never seen. Try a new food. Do anything to get you out of your routine.
Be aware that there are benefits to trying new things. It gives you a chance to enjoy something you never knew you liked, prevents boredom, and offers a chance for you to grow."

Be aware of scale creep.",How to Know if Your Work‐Life Balance Is Off1," Being hyperaware of time slipping through your fingers can drive you mad. One clear sign that your work-life balance needs readjusting is the feeling that you are racing the clock.For instance, you may have grown to accept a full voicemail or having dozens of unanswered emails in your inbox.
You might also stay at work long after everyone else leaves and still not get everything done. In fact, it seems no matter what you do, you never have enough time.;
, Chronic stress from being overworked can impact your cognitive functioning. You may find yourself constantly forgetting where things are or missing appointments. You might struggle with decisions, big or small. You might also find yourself not being productive due to a lack of concentration.Forgetting things and being unable to concentrate can point to lack of adequate rest and a much-needed break or vacation.
You might also find that you’re spending more and more time on social media or internet browsing as a way to avoid work, due to burnout or your inability to concentrate.

, If you catch yourself snapping off at your kids, partner, or coworkers, you may need to take a chill pill. Patience is often one of the first things to go when you are low on self-care. You might get angry over the slightest inconvenience or frequently be accused of “waking up on the wrong side of the bed.”

For example, if you often have to walk away to calm down in various situations, you may need a break.

, All work and no play make you a very dull boy or girl. Long hours at work without breaks or social connection can leave you feeling quite negative. When you are around people, you might come off as a killjoy. You complain often and beat yourself up for not being perfect.Alternatively, you may notice a total lack of interest in your job performance. Once you were motivated to grow and advance, but not any more.

, Falling asleep at work or during family TV time is one sure-fire sign that your work-life balance needs a reset. When you do go to bed, you may have trouble getting quality rest because you’re worried about tomorrow’s presentation or checking work emails on your phone. When you wake, you never quite feel fully rested.Instead, you may have developed poor coping habits to sleep – staring at a screen until you pass out, drinking alcohol, or becoming reliant on various sleep aids.

Because you’re chronically low on energy, all you want to do during your downtime is watch TV and eat junk food, which only further complicates your health.Have you noticed yourself becoming out of breath during typical activities or experiencing joint pain? You might need to schedule in some much needed exercise and clean up your diet.

Understand how habits are formed.Habits have a lot to do with brain chemistry and everything to do with psychology.,
Start small.,
Gradually build upon your habit.,
Find ways to enjoy the activity.,
Write reminders for yourself.,
Accommodate for slip-ups.Nobody is perfect.,
Give yourself an occasional break.,
Switch things up.,
Get a friend involved.Friends can be a great source of emotional support.,
Enjoy the positive outcomes.,
Set realistic goals for yourself.,
Reflect on the reasons you want change.There will always be a reason why you want to make something a habit.,
Reward yourself periodically.Rewards are a positive force for motivation.,
Remember that it gets easier.",How to Learn Good Habits," If we do something enough times, the brain will adapt to fit it. Left to our own devices, we will follow things that make us feel good, and avoid the things that make us feel unpleasant. Even when we know something like exercise (adding discomfort) or dieting (removing comfort) will help us more in the long run, your current brain chemistry will do anything to get you to stick to your routine. This is where willpower comes into play.


On a brighter note, habits naturally become a lot easier to follow through with the longer you stick with them. Someone who goes out running every day for a year won't even feel the need to be motivated to keep going out.;
, All habits take time to grow. At the start to something new, it's natural to feel excited. The most common mistake people make at the beginning is by taking on too much, too soon. Even if you're feeling really motivated or anxious for change, a more gradual habit will be much easier to stay true to.For example, if you're wanting to go out running every day and want to ultimately run for 45 minutes each morning, trying starting with 10 minutes. At first it may seem like you're selling yourself short, but it will seem a lot more manageable than the full amount for the times when you need to be motivated. Of course, you can do the full amount on days you're feeling up to it.

, Once you start very small, you'll be able to build up the habit as your motivation for the activity increases. This should be done in small, non-threatening increments. For instance, if you started out going for a 10 minute run each morning, you should try pushing it up to 15 minutes after a week, adding 5 extra minutes onto your total until you reach the end goal. By keeping the increases small and gradual, you'll be able to give yourself the time to adapt.

, If you feel difficulty in starting a habit, there's a very good chance you don't naturally see enough pleasure involved in the experience. Luckily, for the vast majority of beneficial activities, there are plenty of ways you can see something positively. Finding the joy in something will make you enjoy the experience more, and this will make you feel more motivated to keep up with it.For example, many joggers report getting a ""runner's high"" after running for a while. Exercise can be a naturally pleasurable thing once you get the hang of it. Other ways you could improve a jogging situation would be to bring music or a running partner along with you.
If you're studying a topic for school or work, you should try to acknowledge what things are interesting in the given subject you're working on.

, No matter how motivated you are right now, there are going to be times when the goal slips your mind. Posting reminders of the habit you want to learn is a good way to keep your mind in the right spirit. Write a note on your calendar about it, or include a post-it note next to your computer. Because habits are best learned when they're daily, try including the notes in places you'll probably go past every day.If you have a cellphone with a built-in alarm clock, one thing you can do to remind yourself of your habit is to record a voice note where you tell yourself to follow through. Set your phone to play this voice memo when you wake up. That way, the first thing you'll hear in the morning is a direct, customized reminder to work on your chosen habit.
Remember the adage: ""Out of sight, out of mind."" You want to get the opposite of this.

, However, when we're trying to stick with a new habit, it can feel devastating to relapse or lose your winning streak. Many people who give up on forming good habits do because they lose motivation for keeping up the effort once they've slipped up. Some dieters will let themselves binge eat after slipping once because they feel they've already failed. Embrace an occasional slip-up as part of the process, and don't let it bring you down. The bigger picture is the most important thing.

, Although habits will eventually become easier to keep up, you may run the risk of burning out in the early stages. If you're working in a new healthy behaviour like exercise or studying, it can be a good idea to give yourself a break now and then. Set aside a day to take it easy and do what you want. After having that time to relax, you should be feeling more motivated to keep going.


If you do give yourself a break, make absolutely sure that you don't turn this into an invitation to slack off for a longer period of time. If a break doesn't make you feel refreshed and motivated, it's not worth the risk.

, After a while, your habit will begin to settle. While you usually won't have to fight a lack of motivation if you stick with something for longer than 3 weeks, there's a chance your routine may become stale. Even if your routine is effectively in place by this point, it's a good idea to play around with it. Getting the habit in place is the hard part; once the habit is steady, it's recommended you tweak your activity. There are usually ways you can make it more effective or beneficial to you, and a dynamic approach will keep it interesting for you.


It's not recommended you play around with your routine until the habit is relatively settled. Making a habit is a hard enough thing on its own. Adding new strains to it risks limiting the habit's development.
For example, if you're running, you might try a different path. New paths are especially good if you can switch from an even path to an inclined one.
If you're sticking with a new diet, working with new recipes will keep things interesting.

, When it comes to forming new habits, they can be essential in keeping you motivated and accountable. Often, simply telling someone else about your goal can lead to a social pressure to follow through with it. This positive pressure can be especially effective if you see the person on a daily basis.


It's even better if you're trying to make a new habit with someone together. That way, the two of you will understand what the other person is going through, and you can offer more specific advice as such.

, Almost all healthy habits come with positive outcomes. This is why they're considered healthy in the first place. Some of these habits, like exercise, will have a major and noticeable impact on the way of look and feel. The results of other habits may be more subtle. All the same, taking the time to pat yourself on the back for a job well done is an important part of keeping a habit in the long-term.

, At the beginning stages, people are often very motivated or excited over their goals. This causes them to get overzealous with their goals. Unrealistic goals will work against you. Although you may think they will simply push you to become excellent, an unattainable goal offers little reason to pursue it. Keep your goals small at first, and develop them slowly from there.


Unrealistic goals usually have at least one unlikely aspect about them. In order for a goal to be realistic, you already need to have most (if not all) of the skills and resources to accomplish it. If your goal is to get those skills in the first place, you need to set your sights low at first. After time, you'll be able to get a practical insight into what is and isn't realistic in that area for you.
Specific goals are much more effective motivators than broad goals., The positive effects of doing something are a big incentive. If you feel less motivated to stick with something, think about all the things you'll get if you follow through with it. Positively imagining the future has a significant impact on someone's psychology, and it can work to your advantage if you need the extra motivation.


Remind yourself of the end goal. Even if you want your habit to become a permanent thing, there will be permanent changes that could potentially have a major effect on the way you live.

, Although they can sometimes be tough to administer to yourself, promising to treat yourself to something upon reaching a certain milestone can give you something new to work towards. Whether it's a new book or a night out with friends, anything pleasurable can work to your advantage in this case.


It's important that your reward doesn't contradict the thing you're working on. For example, a dieter should not reward himself at the end of a week by gorging himself on fatty foods.
Don't reward yourself before you actually do the thing you set out to do. Rewards require a clear cause-effect relationship in order to feel motivating.

, The longer you follow through with a habit, the more used your brain will get to it, and the less motivation it will take to keep doing it. This is the basis of all habit-making. Knowing that it will keep getting easier and easier the longer you do it can be a source of motivation itself.

Express your love and gratitude.,
Meet up with friends.,
Volunteer.,
Take a class.,
Pick up a new hobby or skill.",How to Live a Fuller Life After Middle Age2," After many years of being friends with someone or being in a family with someone, we tend to forget to express our love and affection as much. However, expressing your love and gratitude lifts up the other people in your life. Plus, it deepens your relationships with those people, helping you to be happier overall.Try to say, ""I love you,"" when you're feeling affection towards someone you love and care about.
Show a person you care by doing little things for them. Do a chore before they have a chance to do it, or show up with their favorite snack out of the blue.

, When you've reached middle age, you may have a tendency to settle into a routine with just your family. However, it's equally important to maintain friendships outside of your family. For one, if you have kids, they will eventually move out, and you'll be glad you have a social net to fall back on. Plus, it's healthy to have relationships both in and out of your family to help you maintain your own independence.

, Volunteering is a great way to stay engaged in the community while giving something back. You've developed skills for years now, and those skills can be put to good use helping the community. Besides, volunteering will keep you more active physically, which helps keep you healthier.Think about what you have to offer, then try to connect those skills to a local nonprofit, charity organization, library, or school.
For instance, maybe you have skills as a cook. Offer to work at a local soup kitchen to help prepare food. Or maybe you've worked with kids most of your life. Consider reading to kids at your local library when you have the time.

, Another way to get out into the community is to take a class. When taking a class, you can learn new skills like car mechanics or building websites. You could also learn a language or take a class in literature. Plus, you get to meet new people who have similar interests to yours.Look for a wide variety of classes at your local community college.

, Another option is to take up a new hobby or pick up an old one. Hobbies can make life more enjoyable, as long as you pick something you love. Consider what you've liked doing in the past, and use that as a jumping off place.For instance, you could learn to cook a new type of food, try crocheting, learn to play the guitar, or take up gardening.
Browse for books on your hobby at your local library.
Consider joining a local group that focuses on your hobby.
Look for classes at your local library, with your local art museum, or through your parks and recreation department.

Exercise regularly.,
Eat healthy foods.,
Sleep well.,
Stop smoking.,
Promote bone, joint, and muscle health.,
Work on your memory.,
Visit your doctor regularly.",How to Live a Fuller Life After Middle Age3," You've heard it before: exercise is good for your health. It becomes even more important after middle age as your body starts to slow down a bit. Aim to get in about 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week.Find an exercise you love. If running isn't your thing, try yoga or swimming. Don't be afraid to branch out, especially as your body may rule out certain exercises over time.
Add more activity to your everyday life. You don't need to set aside a special time to go to the gym. Rather, you can just add more activity throughout your day. Take a walk at lunch. Swing around the office a few times when you go the bathroom. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Park farther out at the store.
All these bits of activity add up. In fact, you can break up your 30 minutes of activity as you see fit. You can have three sets of 10 minutes or even six sets of 5 minutes.

, As you age, your metabolism starts slowing down and you're at a higher risk of heart disease. Sticking to a healthy diet can help with both of these things, as it can keep your heart healthier and lower your caloric intake for your slower metabolism.Make your proteins lean, such as chicken, fish, beans, and lentils.
Eat whole grains instead of refined grains. Eat oatmeal, whole-wheat bread, whole-wheat pasta, quinoa, barley, and other whole grains as your carbohydrates.
Eat your fruits and vegetables. Make sure you are ""eating the rainbow"" as often as possible, meaning you incorporate a variety of fruits and vegetables.
Skip foods that are high in saturated fat and sodium.

, Getting enough sleep is just as important after middle age as it was when you were younger. While not everyone needs the same amount of sleep, you should aim for about 7 to 8 hours every night. Getting enough sleep keeps you healthier overall, but it also helps you feel better rested and happier.Try setting up a sleeping routine, going to bed and getting up at the same time every day. Start going to bed an hour before you need to go to sleep. It's important to turn off electronic devices at this time, as those can affect your sleep. If you have trouble remembering when to go to bed, set an alarm to remind you to start getting ready for sleep.
Block out as much light as possible. If you get light from outside when you're sleeping, try block out curtains to make your room dark. You sleep better when you block out the light.
Use white noise or ear plugs to block out any noise.
Talk to your doctor if you're having trouble sleeping. You may need to get a sleep study done to find out if have a sleeping disorder.

, If you want to stay healthy as you get older, you should skip smoking. Smoking can lead to a variety of health problems, from lung cancer to heart disease, just to name a few. Plus, it increases your blood pressure. If you're looking for a reason to quit, make maintaining your health one of those reasons.To help yourself quit, list all the reasons for quitting, such as your health, staying alive for your family, and your finances.Ask for support from your friends and family. They can offer support as you try to quit.
You can also try assistance such as a patch or gum. They can help wean you off of nicotine.

, As you get older, your muscles and bones start to wear down a bit. One thing you can do to help is to take supplements of both vitamin D and calcium, which can help with bone health. You should be getting 1,000-1,200 milligrams of calcium each day, either from food or a supplement, and 600-800 international units of vitamin D each day, depending on your age. Talk to your doctor about whether a supplement is a good idea for you.It can also help to make sure you don't drink too much. Generally, keep it to one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men.

, Your brain can start to decline after middle age as well, if you don't do things to keep it sharp. One step you can do is to work mental puzzles, such as crosswords or sudoku puzzles. You can also do things like change up your driving routine. Learning a new skill, such as how to throw a clay pot or how to play the violin, can also help, as learning new things keeps your brain sharp., Another way to keep up your health is to make sure you schedule regular checkups. Your doctor can keep an eye on things like your blood work, as well as things like your eyes and ears and overall health. A doctor can catch things that maybe you've missed, particularly if it's something that shows up in your blood work.If you're having trouble sleeping, you could say, ""I get 8 hours of sleep of night, but I still wake up feeling exhausted. Do you think you could help me figure out what's wrong?""
You could also say, ""As I'm getting a bit older, is there anything I can do to keep my energy and health?""

Start counting your excuses.,
Listen for complaints from your loved ones.,
Think about your close relationships.,
Count your remaining vacation days.,
Ask yourself when did you last do something just for you.",How to Know if Your Work‐Life Balance Is Off2," The ‘life’ aspect of work-life balance is typically what suffers. You may be so involved with work that you regularly bow out of family or social events. You find yourself making excuses as to why you never have time for friends or family.It’s possible you also find yourself “put out” by family and friends, as if their requests are unreasonable or inconsiderate. You resent the fact that they “don’t understand” how hard you have things.
If you start counting them, you'll probably find that your excuses outnumber the events you actually attend.

, Friends and family may understand initially when you have to miss a wedding or graduation. But, eventually they will start to resent you. You might hear complaints about your lack of commitment to those closest to you. Your relationships may start to suffer. Over time, you may notice that you are no longer being invited because they don’t expect you to come anyway.

Don't ignore these complaints. Get real with yourself. Your loved ones aren't nagging because they're bored--they're trying to send you a message that you're neglecting them.

, Do you feel alone, like you’re no longer close to anyone? Try to think about who you go to for emotional support, your closest friends and confidants. Who would you turn to if you needed to talk or wanted to do something fun? If you can’t think of anyone, you’re likely too consumed with work., If the word ‘vacation’ is a foreign term, your work-life balance may need some tweaking. When you first got the job, you were thrilled by the annual two-week vacation allotment. But, you’ve never actually used your vacation time. Your partner or friends may often suggest cool places to visit. Unfortunately, you never seem to carve out the time for a getaway.If you have all or nearly all of your vacation days remaining at the end of a year, you are probably working too much.
You may push yourself to work through illnesses instead of taking time to recover. Use your sick time - that's what it's there for.

, In your current predicament, you may be challenged to remember the last time you had some rejuvenating alone time. This doesn’t count your five-minute showers or hour-long commute to work, because you spend these activities reflecting on your to-do list. In order to achieve work-life balance, you need some time alone to decompress and to things you enjoy.If you can't remember the last time you read a good book or played poker with your pals, you may be putting work ahead at the top of your priority list.

"
"
Prioritize what’s important.,
Ask for help.,
Set aside time for yourself.,
Unplug regularly.",How to Know if Your Work‐Life Balance Is Off3," When it comes down to it, work-life balance is really the skill of effective time-management. You will find that you have more time for the most important things when you use your time more wisely. To do this, you first need to figure out your top priorities. Make a list.Write down those aspects of your life that are most important to you. These may include work, family life, non-work social connections, spirituality, and physical health. Rank these items on a scale of one to ten based on their significance.
Now, try to estimate how much time you are dedicating to them. If family life is ranked No. 1 but only gets about 25 percent of your time, you will have to cut down on less important obligations to make more time for it.

, There are an abundance of resources available to help you regain balance in your life. More than likely, you’re not using them because you enjoy being a superhero. Recognize that in order for you to focus on what’s more important you will need to delegate some tasks.This may mean asking a team member to lead the morning meetings so you can make breakfast and drop your children off at school. Or, it may mean outsourcing your laundry or cleaning chores in order to have more time for family or work.
Think hard, too. Search for the reasons why you push yourself. Deep down do you enjoy feeling like a hero or a martyr? Are you trying to compensate for low self-esteem? Or, do you have unrealistic expectations due to the way you were raised?

, Develop a routine that allots time for you. Things like hobbies, interests and self-care often slip through the cracks when work becomes demanding. Create a routine that incorporates these activities into your day so you never have to sacrifice them.

For example, you might schedule 30 minutes each morning for reading your scripture, meditating, or writing. You might carve out time each evening to pampering yourself with a relaxing bath and a scented candle. Plus, having a more consistent schedule will improve your sleep.Consider researching how to recalibrate your time for more relaxation. Find out more about time management techniques, better organization, effective delegation of tasks, and other ways to be more efficient – and save time.

, Being tuned in 24/7 can easily drive you insane. Carve out some time to be tech-free. Reflect on which areas of life need your attention, and use your unplugged time for these. For instance, you might establish a strict no technology after 8pm each evening. You can use that time to meet up with friends face-to-face, catch up with your partner, or engage in creative pursuits.Get outdoors, too! Overworking usually means that you are spending most of your day inside, which can lead to things like vitamin D deficiency or upset your circadian rhythms.

Consider all sides in preparing to grow the family.",How to Live in Harmony in a Blended Family (as a Step Parent)," As the stepfather (or mother), you're jumping in a ""already made"" entity. The parent and one or more kids. They have their habits, their opinions, their defaults.


The temptation is big to arrive the arms full of presents for the children. But this is an error: They won't love you more; they will just take advantage of you. That is a bad start. You are the stranger trying to buy them and take them away from the absent parent.;
, You can have your opinion, but don't judge and don't criticize. Note mentally your thoughts, but keep them locked.

, The stepparent chose you, but the kids will always come first. Be understanding. No one ever told you it would be easy. If you live together, be prepared to do things by yourself pretty often. The habits will change and include you, but it could take time.

, If the kids come to you and ask embarrassing questions, be prepared to never say a bad word about the absent parent. Even if daddy is a real jerk who left wife and kids for a young and big-breasted woman, you are not allowed to criticize. Not yet. For any questions about your personal life, be true as much as you can be. Kids feel and appreciate honesty. Good points for you!

, ""Can I ask your son to help clear the table ?"" or ""May I take the kids out for an ice cream?"". Yeah, sounds overly cautious, but another point for you. They are not your kids. Not yet.


In the same context, never decide to bring the little daddy's girl to the beauty institute or the hairdresser without the parent's approval. Keep safe! No need to argue in a war you're sure to lose.

, Being part of the tribe doesn't mean you are 100% integrated, but you can share your point of view (at your own risk and peril). You are authorized to propose a TV program or a recreational occupation. If you can speak to kids' stomach, you have made a big part of the way

, Now you are allowed to tell the kids to clean up their rooms, but be careful with the words you use. Don't be aggressive. You can also, if you're asked to, help with the homework. Once again, use caution!

, As any other couple, you will fight with your partner. This one is pretty hard, but please try never to criticize the way your companion parents. At this point in your relationship, you have probably seen things you don't approve. But a conflict is not the perfect timing for that. If you disapprove something about the kids' education, try to speak quietly with your partner. But choose the right time and place.

, Don't be the bad step-parent. Always keep the best role.

, As a stepparent, never forget that you will never be 100% independent ""parent"" (unless you received the approval, but always be careful). The final decision has to be made by the parent.

, It sounds hard? But the life you chose isn't easy.

, If you and your partner decide to add another family member, the dynamics will change yet again. Be honest with your partner and their children about your concerns, and try to all grow together as a family unit. Make sure you include your partner's children in any family planning you do - sure, they can't be the ones to decide whether you have more children or not, but they can be involved. Giving them some insight and input into the decision will help them feel more like part of the family, and will ease any concerns that you're ""replacing"" them with a new child.


Being in a blended family can be a joy - it just takes some extra care and an awareness of boundaries.

Hang on to each other and love each other.,
Respect your spouse's grief.,
Encourage your spouse to talk about their feelings and listen without judging or condemning.,
Love each other and be there for each other.,
Talk it out.,
Don't look back on the past, no matter how much it hurts you.,
Laugh about it.,
Work on rebuilding your life and marriage at the same time.,
Renew your vows.",How to Keep Your Marriage Alive After Losing Everything to a Natural Disaster," Especially in one of these situations and in times of need. This person may be all you have, so keep him/her close. Respect boundaries though. If your spouse feels stifled and says so, you're hanging on too hard. Holding your spouse close means caring more about your spouse's happiness than your own. Hold your spouse close in ways that your spouse finds comforting - like thinking of how to make your spouse happy while you do an errand to give your spouse some time alone and bring something needed. Like when you were first dating, try in all ways to please your partner and let your partner set the pace.;
, Each person grieves in different ways. If your spouse is pulling away rather than leaning on you, first look at how you're behaving in the crisis. If you're comforting your spouse in order to ignore your own pain and pretend not to feel it, that may become overbearing and not give the comfort you intended. Be real with yourself and your spouse. Try to face your own grief at the loss in ways that don't demand effort from your spouse.

, This is the number one kindest thing you can give anyone who is grieving anything - let them cry, rant, plead, pray, bargain with God and work through all of the stages of grief while you're listening and being supportive. Educate yourself on the stages of grief - they are the same across cultures and all human beings go through them at their own individual pace. Some take years. Others might go through all five stages in a 24 hour period. The five stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.


Do not get angry at your spouse for not sharing your feelings at the time you do. Some people are resilient and can take disaster in stride. Others grieve in different ways and at a different pace. Take care of your feelings in a way that does not involve lashing out at your spouse.

, Support your spouse in any family deaths/losses he/she may have experienced. This means being especially considerate of your spouse while your life is that precarious. Now is when all small kindnesses will carry deep meaning and convey your loyalty, reassure your spouse that he/she has not lost everything in this world, still has a loving partner.


Anything from small errands like bringing water to speaking softly and not arguing about anything makes an enormous difference. So does thinking of your spouse first when sharing limited resources like food and water. If you're both doing this, you're building a deep trust that may give both of you a happier marriage after the disaster than you had before it.
Be gentle. Most of all, be gentle with your spouse and accept his or her moods as natural for the state of grief. If you get shouted at, blamed for choosing the wrong possessions to pack or leaving behind a pet, worst of all blamed for the death of other family members, remember this. People in the anger stage of grief may take it out on anyone in reach. Anger over not saving an irreplaceable keepsake can be the way your spouse is channeling anger at having lost the whole house and everyone who's died.
When you get angry at your spouse for this unfairness, remember it's not about you. It's about the disaster that's bigger than both of you. Walk away and shout at God, rant to the sky, journal about it, face the real problem and find a way to express your anger at nature about the disaster. It's bigger than you are, but you're grieving too. If you don't turn that anger against your spouse you will have a much better chance of still having a marriage afterward.
If you're both doing this, you can shout at God together and become closer. The anger stage of grief is the most dangerous part of mutual loss for a couple, the other risky part is the despair stage when partners may give up on each other rather than comforting each other.

, Talk about the disaster, the losses, anything. Just let it out and put your trust in your partner. Make new plans together. Find out if your spouse was unhappy about something in the past. It's much easier to make changes in your life when it's already been that disrupted.

, That will just bring back hurtful memories. Plan for the future as a fresh start. This is a time in life when you may be more free to relocate or change other life choices than you would ever have been otherwise. If your workplace was destroyed but you hated your job, it could be a blessing in disguise once you find a job that's more satisfying.

, What seemed so important before the disaster is honestly ludicrous now. Were you worried that you couldn't get a stain out of the counter? Or worried that you'd never make time to do those minor repairs? The house is gone. Guess what chores are gone with it. That's worth a laugh. Black humor is still real humor and it's one of the healthiest ways to cope with loss that there is. If you can get into a frame of mind where you're laughing, laughter is a glorious way to release the tension. Always poke fun at yourself with this, not your spouse - teasing that might have been fine before the disaster could cut like a knife when a person's at their most vulnerable. The idea is to make you and your spouse feel better, not worse.

, Imagine your new home as your marriage and as it builds itself up you build yourself up. This can begin right in the shelter as you stand in line to get a blanket for your spouse or salvage something that's a small comfort. The more you do this with a goal of making your spouse happy, the greater the chance your spouse will reciprocate and you will be rebuilding your marriage from the ground up - in a sound, strong way that can survive any troubles.

, This is important. In grief a person may feel lost and alone, but when you show that you're going to be there for your spouse throughout the trouble and receive that promise, you have not lost everything. You've kept and strengthened the most important thing. Material possessions are replaceable, even lost keepsakes can be remembered for what they were. But the people who lived are infinitely more precious and you may have a deeper, richer marriage afterward.

It is not a good idea to keep poking and prodding a person to see whether they'll come to; if a fast check of the person reveals nothing, get proper help immediately; they may not be dead but need medical aid fast. If there is any chance at all of reviving a person, pursue it. For emergency numbers pertaining to your location, see this guide. (Other emergency numbers can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number.)


If you have a doctor who is able to make emergency house calls, call this person.;
, Ask ""Are you okay?"". At the same time, standing or squatting behind the person, tap him or her on the shoulders, quite firmly. This is standard first aid practice (you stand behind the person in case they react forcefully to being tapped and accidentally harm you; jump away after tapping).

, Say something like: ""This is serious, stop playing. I am going to call the ambulance right now."" If the person is fooling around, the action of going to the phone and dialing the number for help will most likely rouse the prankster to reveal the game.


Alternatively, if you suspect that the person is faking it, press your knuckles down on their sternum/breast bone a little. This can either make the person laugh or, if you press a little too hard, react to feeling the uncomfortable pressure and cause them to fess up to make you stop. (Do not press so hard that it breaks the bone or harms the person; you are assaulting the person if you take it too far.)

, If there is any sort of reaction, the person is likely to be alive; however, even this isn't a certain indicator either way, as an unconscious person may show no response, while a dead person may expel air and noise.


If the person seems to be sleeping, gently shake him or her.

, Hold your fingertips to the person's wrist or neck (either side of the throat). Wait for a pulse.


A pulse can be notoriously difficult to find, even for trained professionals. This should not be taken as a definitive sign on its own.
Can you hear breathing? Basic first aid training requires you to check for breathing and wait at least 10 seconds before assuming someone isn't breathing.

, If yes, they are not dead.


The back of a spoon can also be held under the nose; again, if it steams up, the person is not dead.

, If the person is alive, the pupils may constrict. Again, this is not a sole indicator (for example, drugs, a deep coma, eye surgery, or some other thing may interfere with or mimic this reaction) and it needs to be taken as one possible sign along with others., In the old days, snuff was often used to revived people who fainted. Although the sniff test might revive someone who has fainted, it's a test of last resort (and really, by now you should be calling emergency services). Possible smelly tests for aliveness include:


Cutting an onion in half. Place under the nose of the person who is possibly dead to see if they can smell it. If he/she is alive they would wake up right away.Using alcohol to wake them up. Drop a few drops of alcohol on tissue paper or whatever you want and let them smell it."

Empathy marks social maturity as it requires putting oneself in another person's shoes, which is often a difficult thing for a young child to do. Throughout your day-to-day life, look for opportunities to teach your child about empathy.Encourage your child to consider things from another person's perspective. When something happens, ask your child how he or she would feel about that. For example, say you see a man miss the bus on his way to work. Say to your child, ""That man missed the bus. How do you think he feels? How would you feel if that happened to you?""
You can also ask your child to put him or herself in a character's shoes while watching television, movies, or while reading. Encourage him or her to stop and think how a character feels. If a character is behaving in a negative way, ask your child why a person may behave poorly.;
, Basic manners are important to social maturity. As your child grows up, teach him or her manners. What manners a child should learn varies by age.For young children, between 2 and 3, encourage them to greet others by saying ""Hi."" When leaving, tell them to say ""Bye."" Also, encourage eye contact and smiling when appropriate.
Children between the ages of 3 and 4 should be able to take turns during games and start initiating conversation with others.
Between the ages of 4 and 5, children should be able to express needs by saying things like ""Stop!"" or ""No!"" Between the ages of 5 and 6, you can teach your kids to say ""Please"" and ""Thank you"" and discourage them from using foul language.

, Children can often use social skills via playing. You can teach kids about manners, cooperation, and other vital life skills by allowing them to learn via play.Teach kids how to take turns by playing simple games that require turn-taking. You can also play games with simple instructions, or games that require teamwork.
Teach children to share. Encourage your kids to share with other children during games. If you have multiple kids, require them to share certain toys during play.
Fantasy play can also help, especially for children between 4 and 5. Kids of this age may benefit from pretending to be someone older or taking on the imaginary role of a mother or a father.

, Your children learn a lot from watching you. You can teach children how to mature socially by modeling good behavior for them. When you're taking your kids with you during daily activities, strive to be on your best behavior.Say ""Please"" and ""Thank you"" to cashiers, other parents, and teachers. Make small talk with people you know, showing your children how to hold a conversation.
If you slip up in front of your child and snap at another person, offer a genuine apology. This can teach children it's okay to screw up occasionally, but apologizing for your mistakes is important.

, Very young children especially may struggle to understand personal space. Tell your kids everyone has a personal space bubble that needs to be respected. Discourage children from hugging, kissing, or physically touching another person without asking first. Make sure your children respect boundaries during playtime. Discourage hitting, kicking, or other aggressive ways to show frustration.You should also teach children they have a right to their own personal space. It's okay to refuse hugs, for example, and to speak up if another child or adult is making them uncomfortable. Encourage children to let people know when their personal space is violated.

, Self expression can be difficult for young children. In early childhood, children cry or act out as a means of expression. Try to catch negative means of self-expression when they happen. Encourage your child to express what he or she is feeling in healthy and straight forward manner.If your child angrily snatches a toy out of his older brother's hand, tell him he should not have done that. Instead, encourage him to say something like, ""Can I have a turn now?""
If a child is crying or throwing a tantrum, work on calming the child down. Once your child is relaxed, have him or her calmly explain what's wrong. Tell your child, in the future, if something is wrong he or she can tell you instead of having a fit.

, Children often fail to recognize how their tone sounds to others. An important part of social development is teaching children how to speak in an appropriate manner for a given situation. Use a tape recorder and record yourself speaking with different emotions. Play this back to your children and have them guess the emotions. This can help children see how their tone affects interactions with others.You can also have children pay attention to tone while watching television. Encourage them to pay attention to how a character sounds when angry, sad, happy, and so on.

, Reading can help with social maturity in a lot of ways. Reading literary fiction to children can help them learn empathy. This can lead to kinder interactions with other people.Make a point of reading to your children every night. Incorporate a bedtime story into your nighttime routine.
You should strive for high quality fiction with original characters. Stories full of cliches may not have as big an impact on empathetic thinking. Go for classic children's books that have received good reviews.

, Supporting your child's friendships is one of the best things you can do to help your child mature socially. A solid friends group will help your child learn boundaries, manners, and empathy. As your child starts making friends in school, branch out to other parents. Offer to host play dates and sleepovers so your child has a chance to solidify friendships made in school outside the classroom.If your child is shy, one-on-one playdates may work best. It can also be helpful to schedule playdates with a particularly outgoing child, as this child can model good social behavior for your child.
If your child has an issue with one of his friends, encourage him or her to apologize. You want to teach your kid how to repair rifts in friendships. Learning to apologize is a big aspect of social maturation.

, Studies indicate participating in physical activity, especially in the form of team sports, can help social maturation. Children who engage in team sports learn skills like leadership and empathy. Down the road, they'll be better equipped to handle social situations.Encourage your child to sign up for an after school sports league in his or her school. You can also enroll your child in a local little league team.
Not all children will take well to team sports. If your child truly hates being involved in such activities, try not to push him or her. While sports can certainly help with socialization, they are only one of many routes to help a child mature socially.

, If your child does not take to team sports, other extracurricular activities can help him or her make new friends. This can help a child adjust socially. Try to get your child involved in an extracurricular activity he or she would enjoy. If your child loves art, for example, sign him or her up for art classes. If your child is captivated by science, see if there are any after school clubs that teach kids about science.

, If you're pushing your child to mature and it does not seem to be working, your child may be delayed socially. Social delays can be a sign of disabilities such as autism.Children with social delays may avoid eye contact. They may dislike being touched or hugged. They may not respond to questions about how they are feeling or what they are doing.
If your child is socially delayed, they may struggle with even basic self expression. A socially delayed child may not express feelings like hunger or pain.
Socially delayed children may not be able to follow directions. They also may not engage in make believe play, like pretending a banana is a phone, like other children do. Instead, they may be content with lining up objects, with their imaginative tasks taking place only in their head.

, If you suspect your child has a social delay, talk to a pediatrician. A qualified pediatrician can help identify socially delayed children. He or she may be able to recommend a therapist or a treatment program.


If your child is under 3 and you're in the US, you may be qualified for a program called Early Intervention. This program can help get you in touch with psychiatrists and therapists to help treat your child's delay.

, If your child is struggling socially, talk to his or her teachers. There may be something teachers can do to help your child adjust in class. If your child is very shy, a teacher may be able to give him or her special attention.


If you do find your child has a disability such as autism, it's important to notify educators. Your child's teacher should know how to best help them get through school.

, If your child is not developing socially, make an appointment with a child psychologist. If your child has a disability, the sooner you get your child diagnosed the better. A qualified therapist can recommend treatment to get your child back on track to solid social development.


You can find a therapist by asking your regular doctor for a referral. You can also find a therapist online, or through your insurance provider.

Exchange daily stories.,
Eat together.,
Have a weekly family night.Designate a separate night of the week to engage in something oriented around having fun together.,
Encourage organized activities.,
Develop rituals.,
Laugh together.,
Read to one another.",How to Keep Relationships Healthy Within Your Family1," As soon as you get home, show that you’re excited to reunite with them by immediately speaking with your family members about each other’s day. Ask your family members how their days were, and share a story from your own day with them. Sharing the narratives of our daily lives allows us to be more in tune with our loved ones’ lives.


Seek out younger family members as soon as you get home. Familial companionship means a great amount to children. They will be especially excited to see you (and will likely be the most interested in whatever story you have to tell).
Record stories that one of you find especially interesting or humorous. These recordings will have immense value later in your lives.
Consider telling a story together. StoryCorps is an organization that records conversations - usually between family members cooperatively reflecting on an experience they shared - and stores these recordings in the Library of Congress.There’s even an app for that!;
, Have at least one meal with all family members present once a week. Though simple, maintaining weekly meals can be a challenge with children of different ages and working parents. Eat as many meals together as possible.Know that family meals can be entirely casual.


Don’t feel as though a family meal must be formal or special. Emphasize the fact that you’re eating together, and that that’s what matters. Alternate types of food at home or try a new spot if you’re going out.
Have a back-up plan. Don’t expect every family meal to go perfectly. When multiple people are involved, or you are depending on scenarios outside of your control, understand that time spent with family members may not go exactly as planned. Make light of unexpected hiccups in plans, and recall that the point of spending time together is the time together, not the plan.

, Consider the following options, and switch from one activity to another depending on your family’s preferences:


Go bowling. Bowling a classic example of an activity that can appeal to all age groups. To keep older kids interested, keep track of high scores for each family member, and see if you all can beat your own personal record. Splitting into teams and scoring accordingly can increase feelings of cooperation and reduce competitiveness.
Go see a movie. Lots of cities have discount movie theaters, or theatres that offer cheaper tickets on certain nights of the week. Be aware that discounted days may be busier, however.
Stay in and play board games. Depending on ages and interests, there are literally thousands of games to choose from.
Go for a group hike. Sunlight, fresh air, and light exercise are not only healthy for your body, they’re great for your mind and familial comradery too.

, Children learn and grow from interacting with peers and positive adult role models. While it is important to make sure kids have family time at home, it is also important that they participate in organized activities outside of school. This will provide important socialization, constructive energy use, healthy physical activity, and something for children, parents, and siblings to talk about and bond over.Attend children’s events together as a family. The participant will feel your family’s support, and everyone can talk about interesting or humorous moments afterwards.
Siblings in particular can bond over shared interests in organized activities. A brother or sister (or parent!) that has previously participated in similar organized activities can practice with a younger member of the family and speak with them about the challenges and enjoyment of those activities.
Limit unorganized extracurricular activities. One of the reasons it can be hard to find time together is that kids often end up with many opportunities outside of the home. Don’t allow extracurricular activities to take priority to the happiness and wellbeing of your family.

, Build rituals around events or other reoccurring moments. It doesn’t matter what they are, just that there is something that you all can look forward to enjoying together. For instance, go out for Chinese food on birthdays. Or, get donuts together once a month. Have everyone choose a different type and share them. Cast votes to determine the family’s most popular confection!


Be flexible in the execution of your rituals.If you go the same pizza shop once a month, and they happen to be closed on a day you try to go, don’t let it derail the evening, or the ritual. Try another pizza spot. Let your family rituals develop naturally!
Don’t work too much! Work is a major reason that kids don’t get enough time with their parents. This is especially true for fathers and teens. Too many hours at the office or out of town prevents your family’s ability to develop and maintain healthy, fun rituals. Do not let your job overshadow your family.

, Laughter has an incredibly positive effect on our relationships with one another.Be comfortable laughing with one another. And don’t hesitate to laugh at yourself! Next time you all find something humorous, remember it and reference it later. An inside joke can deeply strengthen the familial bond between you and your family members.

, Read bedtime stories to very young children – and choose books that will amuse you both.As kids learn to read, sit with them in the evening and read a chapter from an age-appropriate novel. In the company of adults or older children, read sections of an interesting or funny piece aloud to nurture feelings of comfort and support.

Find out where your ancestors are buried:


Ask relatives or friends if they know where family members are buried.,
Get your basic supplies that will be needed to make your visit to the cemetery useful.,
Check to see if the historical or genealogical society in the locality of the cemeteries or likely cemeteries where your ancestors are buried has published (in book form or online) a recording of gravestone data for the cemeteries in question.,
Be prepared to do a lot of walking while attempting to find the correct grave, especially if there is no groundskeeper to direct you.,
Plan a spring or fall visit if this is an old cemetery, or phone ahead and verify that this lot is mowed regularly.,
Copy down all the information on the stone if you find a family member's grave, even if you think you don't need it.,
Remember if there is a military marker or flag next to or on the grave.,
Bring a camera and take pictures of each gravestone in the family.,
It is also very important, again for purposes of relocating a stone, to not only take closeups of each gravestone of interest, but also shots of the ENTIRE stone, with nearby stones also in the photograph, as well as overview shots of the entire surrounding cemetery.,
Also (very important!),
Note that if the gravestone is hard to read because of age or deterioration, use shaving cream and a squeegee to make it easier to read.,
Leave a sign that you have visited the grave, according to your faith's traditions.,
Make sure all of your notes are clear.",How to Visit Old Gravesites for Research Purposes,"
Look through old family papers and photos for copies of obituaries, funeral records, or other records that might give you a clue about where to start
Read back issues of newspapers searching obituaries or funeral notices. They often list the cemetery name and location. Funeral home records may also provide information on burial sites. Sometimes the records of funeral homes no longer in existence have been preserved at a local museum or library.
Check with the temple, church, or mosque for interment information if you know your ancestors' religion. Find out if they belonged to any Lodge or Military Groups that included in membership, a burial cemetery. They typically keep this information forever.
Look at a map of the cemeteries nearby your ancestors' place of residence. People tended to be buried within a few miles of their home, especially in times before cars and trucks were so abundant.
;
, See if there is a grounds keeper's office on the grounds of the specific cemetery that you know your ancestors are buried in. While they will not do research for you, they often have plot records sorted alphabetically or by year, which can assist you locate the graves you are searching for.

, These are helpful to both identify the correct places to look and to guide you to the proper grave site. The library in the locality where you are searching may have information on how to contact the appropriate local organizations or may be able to tell you if they have a copy of any published works.

, Graves are typically mixed rather than being arranged by year of burial, so you will have to look at every one to identify names. Be prepared to consider misspellings of family names — standardized spelling is a fairly recent phenomenon.

, If not, you may want to consider wearing boots or other protective clothing.

, Little details can sometimes prove useful later.

, Note the branch of service or event it commemorates as this information can be used to learn more about your ancestor later.

, Also consider purchasing an inexpensive GPS device so that you can record your exact location for each photograph taken. This will make it easier for you or others to find the grave again in the future (this may be harder than you think!).

, Since gravestones come in a variety of interesting shapes and sizes, such photos will help to orient future searchers.

, photograph and record the information on the graves immediately surrounding your family's stones. They may be relatives you have not yet found in your research. This will save you research time and a return visit to the graveyard once you do find the names.

, Take a photo of the stone with the shaving cream on it as well. If the stone contains writing in a language you do not understand, copy down as much as you can, and take several close up photos. Arrange to have them translated later, as they may give you additional information. However, keep in mind that many people believe that shaving cream may harm the gravestone. Consider using water and a soft brush to clear up the inscription. Using a spotlight or changing camera angle may help the inscription ""pop."" If you decide to use water, remember to dry the gravestone. Never put any wax on a gravestone; it will keep water inside the gravestone.

, In many cultures, this would be flowers. In a Jewish cemetery, a single stone is placed on the top of each visited grave. Before leaving, walk around and see if other family names are in the same cemetery. People who lived near each other are often buried in the same graveyard.

, Copy them over when you get home if needed, making sure that dates and spellings are transcribed accurately.

Don’t shout at one another.,
Maintain mindfulness.,
Nurture fondness, admiration, and affection.,
Be aware of rough periods in family life.",How to Keep Relationships Healthy Within Your Family2," Maintain stability in the home by prioritizing calmness. Children sometimes need to be disciplined, but never lose control and allow anger to dictate your interactions with one another.One of the best ways to stay calm is simply pausing for a few moments and taking several deep, slow breaths. This not only provides a physiological defense against anger, is also gives you a chance to evaluate your response to the situation. Take a peek at the article How To Control Your Temper if you find yourself becoming agitated with regularity.
Don’t try to work out disagreements with your spouse in front of your kids. If you do have an argument in front of your kids, explain that it was just a disagreement and that everything is alright., Take a few minutes every day to focus on your breath. Breathe deeply and evenly. Push away the thoughts and concerns that inevitably arise. Once your mind is calm, shift your focus to a positive aspect of a relationship with someone in your family. For instance:Reflect on what you are grateful for about your family, what you like about a certain family member, or the concept of patience.
Remind yourself that it is within your capacity to nurture the relationships you take part in.

, One way to maintain these feelings towards is to remind yourself of your family members’ positive qualities. Short, genuine comments can go a long way in improving one another’s moods and deepening bonds between family members.Compliment each other. Don’t just compliment your family members when it seems they’re down. Convey the positive thoughts you have about each other as the thoughts arise.
Remind your spouse how attracted you are to them when they change their hairstyle or get a new jacket. Even better, mention your attraction out of nowhere.
Tell your family members you believe in them. If one of your family members is stressing about school or work, tell them you have faith in them. Tell them you’re proud of them when they reach achievements they’ve been working towards.

, Relationships between family members are inevitably effected by stress or tension in normal family life. Watch for signs that your relationships may need particular attention from time to time. Consider these options:


Take a step back. Since many family members often inevitably spend a lot of time together, whether intentionally or by nature of proximity, it can sometimes be helpful to spend time apart. Everyone – not just the kids – should involve themselves in some sort of activity outside of the home with some regularity.
Talk to someone else. If there is something you cannot talk to a family member about that is bothering you, talk to someone else. The important thing is to express concerns constructively. A friend, counselor, therapist, or doctor can help you deal with uncertainties or concerns about your own life or something happening in your family. Don’t allow personal conflicts or concerns to negatively affect the relationships you have with family members.
See a family counselor. If your family is having a significant amount of trouble maintaining healthy relationships and you or other members of your family are unhappy, consider getting help. Re-assure yourself and your family members that there is nothing wrong with seeing a counselor, and that doing so will strengthen your relationships with one another."

State that you want to maintain strong relationships.,
Insist on open and honest communication.,
Express yourself!,
Be an active listener.,
Take advantage of teachable moments.,
Emphasize trust.",How to Keep Relationships Healthy Within Your Family3," Tell your family members that you value their love and support. Do not allow momentary feelings of anger, skepticism, or simple confusion to lead to more serious issues between family members.Share what you appreciate about what you do for another. Thank each other for attending one another’s events or obligations.
Thank each other when you’re there for one another. This doesn’t require a long or dramatic conversation, simply say thank you for the acts and behaviors you appreciate.

, Talk to one another frequently about how everyone is feeling. This is vital to positive relationships within your family. It is also easier than it seems once you do so regularly. Make sure you understand what your family members are feeling so that you’re aware of any unmet needs or desires.Be explicit. Use short, direct statements. It’s always helpful to say positive things like, “We can figure out a way to handle this that works for everyone” or even, “We’re in this together.”
Alternatively, be clear about what you need by saying things like, “I’d feel more comfortable with _______,” or “I don’t like it when _______.”
Do not allow negative emotions to build. Never maintain silence simple to “keep the peace.” This will lead to larger issues in the future.
If your family goes through a major life change, such as a new member in the family, a loss, or a significant move, be especially aware of the greater need for open communication in periods of transition.

, Contemplate your own needs, wants, and feelings. Share these thoughts with your family. You will feel better, and your family members will better understand you. Begin statements with phrases like “I feel like…” and avoid accusatory language or complaints.Avoid contentious statements or language that might escalate a conversation. In particular, avoid beginning statements with accusations.
Instead of, “You always _______,” try “I’m frustrated that this keeps happening,” and go on to explain why you are unhappy with the situation.

, Put effort into improving your listening skills.Everyone needs the opportunity to express themselves, especially in the context of close relationships. Ensure you are allowing others to effectively communicate with you by doing the following during important conversations:


Maintain eye contact.
Don’t interrupt.
Watch your body language. Ensure that you’re conveying respect and genuine interest in what your family member has to say by sitting or standing attentively, and facing towards them.

, There are many conversations between parents and children that can be challenging or feel awkward. Allow certain conversations to happen naturally, and don’t hesitate to start a conversation when an opportunity to do so presents itself.


When a child or sibling becomes especially frustrated at a situation outside of their control, be there for them. Wait for them to calm down and then encourage them to talk about how they felt. Speaking with one another about how anger develops can help us learn how to control our emotions.
Talk about sexuality and bodily awareness with young children early and often. This actually encourages responsible sexual decisions later on (and does not encourage promiscuity).This can also diminish the need to have an intimidating, dramatic talk about sex someday.

, Ensure your family members can trust you by following through on promises and staying true to your word. If you’re communicating effectively, trust will be built into the relationships you have with one another. In the event that you need to rebuild trust, begin by stating that it is your intention to do so, and put extra effort into communicating openly, honestly, and as often as possible."

Incorporate relaxation exercises into your daily routine.,
Enter into a meditation or use guided imagery to further calm your mind and body.,
Get regular massages.,
Explore a spiritual practice.,
Take up a hobby.,
Practice alternative therapies.,
You can also try the art of shaking.",How to Improve the Mind Body Connection," You can spend as little as 15 minutes a day relaxing your body and your mind, which will reduce tension, stress and anxiety.


Sit quietly and focus on your breathing. Take at least 3 deep breaths, exhaling slowly after each breath. Then continue to sit and breathe quietly for another 5 minutes. This isn’t a meditation, it is simply taking a few minutes to get centered and calm.
Alternately tense and release your muscle groups. (This is also referred to as progressive muscle relaxation.) Begin with your feet and work all the way to your face and head. Simply tighten your muscles for a few seconds and then release. Allow a few seconds to feel each muscle group relax.
Mentally scan your body from head to toe. Become aware of any area that feels tense and concentrate on relieving that tenseness. For example, if you have a cramp in your shoulder, tighten and release those muscles until your shoulder feels loose and relaxed.
Focus on happy thoughts and memories after you are completely relaxed. You can recall a pleasant encounter with a friend, visualize your favorite flower or conjure up one of the happiest memories you have, such as your wedding day, or the day you graduated from college.
Take 3 more deep, cleansing breaths after you have entertained pleasant thoughts for at least 5 minutes.;
, Think of guided imagery as a self-directed daydream. See yourself going about your day with calmness and meeting success in all your endeavors. Some people like to use guided imagery audio tapes, but you can create your own routine. This is a particularly effective method to use if you are experiencing any anxiety about an upcoming project or a job interview. Mentally see yourself as successfully negotiating any situation that is causing you concern.

, If a weekly massage is not in your budget, ask a family member or close friend to give you a light massage once a week. It can be as simple as a shoulder rub. Physical massage is a great way to relieve tension and improve blood circulation. Massages also facilitate the natural healing process in your body.

, Attend church services or join a prayer and meditation group. Prayer and meditation can relieve anxiety, pain, stress, depression and insomnia.

, Any activity that gives you enjoyment will help calm you, and it can serve as a form of meditation. Try writing, painting, stamp collecting, or gardening. You could also take up a new sport that you’ve always wanted to try.

, Learn how to do yoga, Qi Gong or Tai Chi. All of these therapies have proven benefits that help strengthen the mind-body connection:


Increased energy
Increased relaxation
Improved immune system response
Sharper mental focus
Increased physical flexibility

, This is a form of mind body medicine that allows one to free their mind and release stress through the form of dancing. You can find shaking music all over the internet and that's about all you need! Because most people don't like to dance in public or are afraid of what they will look like, encourage your participants to close their eyes while doing this activity. The energetic vibe that everyone will feel afterwards is so incredible.

This is one of the most beneficial ways to strengthen your mind and body connection and to get you ready to practice yoga.Prior to starting your yoga practice, sit quietly for about 10 minutes. Use this time to meditate prior to starting your practice. This quiet session can help prepare you to begin practicing on strengthening the mind body connection.
Work on calming your mind prior to your exercise routine. Try to let the day, your ""to-do"" list or other issues drift away from your mind.
You may need to focus on your breath or a mantra you’ve developed for yourself. This is especially true if you have difficultly clearing your mind completely.;
, This is a crucial step of your yoga practice and is essential to allowing yoga to improve your mind body connection. You can create and focus on your intention as you begin your practice with meditation.


An intention is a conscious focus on a specific virtue you’d like to work on. For example, patience, mindfulness, awareness of breath or being present in the moment.While you move through each pose during your yoga practice, focus on your intention and try to embody it. You may even want to repeat it softly or silently as you move through different poses.
When you step off your mat after your practice has completed, continue to focus on your intention for the day. Try to make this a priority with how you act towards others and your mental state of mind.

, Proper breathing techniques are very important to an effective yoga practice—especially if you’re attempting to strengthen your mind and body connection. Focus on your breath and bring your attention to it during your practice.


If you are taking a yoga class or even following a video online, your instructor will most likely guide you on appropriate breathing techniques. Most poses that are contracting of a muscle group are accompanied by an exhaling of your breath. Those that are releasing of a muscle group are accompanied by inhaling.When you’re practicing yoga, you will be forced to focus on your breath. It’s important that you focus on the rate of your breathing and whether or not your breathing is deep or shallow. This forced focus can help strengthen the mind body connection.
Even when you’re not practicing yoga, take time in your day to practice your breathing. Even if you spend two or three minutes focusing on deep, slow breathing, this can help extend the practice of strengthening your mind body connection past your yoga mat.

, Once you’ve focused your mind and set your intention, you’ll begin your practice. In addition to focusing on your breath during your practice also focus on your muscles. This solidifies the mind body connection.As you go through each pose, your yoga instructor will guide you on what muscles you should be contracting and which ones you should be relaxing. Use this as a guide on what to focus on.
When you’re in a pose, imagine what your muscles are doing. Focus on the individual muscle or muscle group that is being worked and try to focus and control that particular area.
Many times when you’re contracting a muscle group, its advised to think of that muscle hugging your bone. Or if you’re doing a lengthening pose, try to imagine the muscle being pulled into a long, toned form., Like any type of physical activity, you’ll need to continue to practice with your yoga. In addition, it’ll take continued practice to strengthen your mind body connection through yoga.


Most professionals will recommend doing yoga at least 2-3 times per week. This is appropriate for those who are beginners and even those who are advanced.
Start with a simple routine and continue to advance yourself over time as you become more proficient and your muscles become stronger.
Also continue to practice your meditations and intention. This can be even more difficult than the actual poses at first, but is just as important to improve over time.

, Most, if not all, yoga practices will end with corpse pose, or Savasana. This pose, although easy to perform, can actually be quite challenging as this exercise totally focuses on the mind body connection.Corpse pose is when you lie flat on the floor at the end of your yoga practice. You should work on quieting and focusing your mind. Many instructors say to focus on your intention for the day and concentrate on how you’re going to continue that intention outside of your yoga practice.
If you’re having trouble keeping your mind quiet or focused, repeat your intention like a mantra or focus on your breathing.
This should be done for 5-10 minutes at the end of each practice. If you find it difficult to maintain your concentration, aim for only 5 minutes.

, Lotus pose is one of the most common yoga poses. It helps you start your yoga practice and strengthen the mind body connection.Start by sitting on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Your back should be straight and your head and neck should be relaxed but facing forward.
Slowly draw your right foot up towards your pelvis. Rest the outside of your right foot up on the inner thigh of your left leg.
Then slowly bend your left leg up and over your bent leg. Again, aim to lay the outside of your left foot on your inner right thigh.
Shift your body as needed so you feel comfortable. Rest your hands, palms facing up towards the ceiling, on your knees. Breathe in and out deeply. Keep this position as long as you can and until you're focused for your practice.

, Chair pose is a fairly easy yoga pose, but forces you to concentrate on multiple muscles in your body and also your form while holding the pose.


Start chair pose by standing tall with feet hip width apart. Keep your arms down by your side, relaxed, with your palms facing inwards.
Slowly lower down as if you were about to sit down into a chair. Keep bending until your thighs are almost parallel to the floor.
Lean your torso forward slightly, however keep your back straight and your core muscles tight.
Sweep your arms upward so your elbows are tracking near your ears. Your arms should remain straight with palms facing inwards toward each other.
Hold this pose for at least 30 seconds. Continue to breathe deeply as you hold this pose.

, Eagle pose is great for strengthening your body and the connection between your mind and body. It relies on balance and forces you to concentrate on maintaining your balance and therefore relaxes your mind.Start eagle pose by standing straight with your feet hip width apart. Keep your arms by your sides with your palms facing inwards.
Slowly bend your knees (almost as if you were getting into chair pose) and then while focusing straight in front of you, lift your right leg up and over your bent left leg. Your right leg should rest just above the knee on your left leg.
Try to bring the top of your right foot behind your left calf. It should be somewhat ""hooked"" behind your lower left leg.
Bring your arms in front of you. Bend your arms so that your upper arm is parallel to the floor and your forearm is perpendicular to the floor. Hook your left arm underneath your right arm. Your elbows should almost be right on top of each other.
Turn your hands so your palms are facing towards each other. Place your palms together flat against each other.
Hold this position for at least 30 seconds or as long as you can hold it or maintain your balance. Continue to breathe deeply while holding this position.

, Like eagle pose, warrior pose also relies on the strength of many muscles in your body. In addition, it requires your to maintain your balance and focus on continually contracting muscles to maintain the proper posture.Start by standing straight up with your feet hip width apart. You arms should hang gently at your side.
Step your left leg forward about 4-5 feet (almost like you're starting a lunge). Turn your toes of your right foot out away from your body at about a 45 degree angle.
Lower down, like a lunge, so your left thigh is almost parallel to the floor.
As you lower down, sweep your arms upwards over your head with palms facing each other. Your arms should be straight, however elbows shouldn't be locked.
Arch your back slightly and look up towards your hands that are over your head. Squeeze your buttocks and leg muscles to help you balance and hold this position.
Stay here for at least 30 seconds. Breathe in out and deeply as you hold this position.

, Most yoga sessions end with corpse pose. Although one of the easiest poses to do physically, its requires a lot of mental concentration and meditation to be able to perform correctly.Lay flat on the floor on your back. Keep your head straight with eyes forward. Try to relax all the joints and muscles in your body.
Position your legs so your toes fall out away from your body. Your legs should be slightly wider than hip width apart.
Your arms should also follow suit like your legs. Your palms should be facing upwards and your fingers pointing away from your body. Your arms should be at a 45 degree angle from your torso.
While inhaling and exhaling deeply, focus on relaxing one part of the body or one muscle at a time. Try to keep your mind clear as you allow your body to fully relax.
Hold this position for at least 5 minutes but you can stay here up to 10 minutes if you'd like.

, In addition to practicing yoga, there are other methods you can do or use to strengthen your mind body connection. Going outside has been shown to be vastly beneficial to your health—especially in regards to your mind body connection.


Studies have shown that a walk outside, especially in a quiet, wooded area, is associated with a rejuvenated mind and an increased ability to pay attention and focus.If you can, make it a point to spend some time in the outdoors. You can just go for a walk and enjoy the peacefulness of the nature around you.
You may also want to consider doing your yoga practice outside or even choosing to sit and meditate outside as well.

, Sometimes during the week you may feel like you’re losing your mind body connection. The stress of our daily lives, commutes and jobs will test your mind body connection daily. Taking an active break at work can help prevent this.


If you find yourself getting lost in the business or stress of your day, consider taking an active break. Get up from your desk and do some light exercise or movement. You can go for a walk, sit and meditate in your office, spend some time journaling or even perform a few relaxing yoga poses.
Taking an active break might be something you choose to incorporate into you daily schedule on a regular basis. This can help you refocus and pay attention to your work without losing your mind body connection.

, Journaling is an excellent tool for many, many reasons. However, it can really provide you with great insight into your own mind and help strengthen your mind body connection.


Studies have shown that putting your thoughts on paper, especially stressful or worried thoughts, can help reduce your overall stress.To start journaling, consider purchasing a nice journal for yourself. You can always use your computer or online program, however there is something therapeutic about writing. Pick a journal that entices you to open it and write.
You do not necessarily need to journal every little thing, each day, however making it a point to spend some time writing most days of the week will be helpful.

, Regardless of how much yoga you do, or how often you practice strengthening your mind body connection, if you’re not getting adequate rest you will see very slow progress.


Experts recommend getting at least 7-9 hours of sleep nightly for adults. Many adults get significantly less than this.
Studies have shown with proper sleep each night you have improved memory, better attention span and more energy.Getting adequate sleep each night will rest your brain and mind and allow it to become stronger over time. Try to get to bed earlier or sleep in later to help you get enough rest every night.

Go to a park.,
Plan a nature oriented vacation.,
Play a game or sport outdoors.,
Take walks with the family.",How to Spend More Time in Nature As a Family1," Do an online search to find local parks that are near you. Whether it's a smaller local park or a larger national park, a day-trip is an excellent way to spend a couple of hours outdoors with your family. If you have young kids, consider taking them to a place that has activities, such as a playground, to maintain their attention.If there are no parks near you, you can plan a camping trip in your own backyard.
Some of the most popular national parks in the United States include Yosemite, Zion, Yellowstone, and Acadia.Other national parks include Corcovado National Park in Costa Rica, Göreme National Park in Turkey, Pacific Rim National Park in Canada, Nairobi National Park in Kenya, and Skaftafell National Park in Iceland.;
, Instead of going to a theme park or partaking in entertainment that's digitally based, consider going fishing or camping instead. Try to keep the use of electronic devices to a minimum and enjoy the natural beauty with your family instead.Some great nature oriented vacations in the United States include the Grand Canyon, Kauai, Jackson Hole, and Lake Tahoe.Other vacation destinations include Pulpit Rock in Norway, Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania, and the Pembrokeshire Coast Path National Trail in Wales.Search for camping, hiking, canoeing, or fishing opportunities near you.

, Discover which games that your children like to play the most, and make it a habit of playing them outside. Talk to your kids about what sports they like and make sure to get the proper equipment so that your family can all play together.

Outdoor sports and games include basketball, baseball, football, soccer, and lacrosse.

, Determine a time when the family will be together and schedule a time to take a walk with your family. Plan a 20 minute walk and have everyone in the family turn off their cell phones. The more you walk together, the more natural it will feel and it will encourage everyone in the family to spend more time outdoors.A great time to schedule a walk is right after dinner or before you take your children to school.

Find a time to meet in person.,
Establish ground rules for the discussion.,
Express yourself with love.,
Listen to each other.,
Agree to move on.,
Stay in touch.",How to Heal Family Wounds1," Confronting past grievances in a face-to-face meeting can help bridge old rifts and improve communication. If you have ongoing conflict and you’re a tight-knit family, you might even want to arrange a standing weekly or biweekly family meeting where everyone gets together to talk. This will help to keep everyone abreast of current issues and give everyone the opportunity to express themselves.Many families are dispersed across wide-ranging geographical boundaries, so getting together in person can be a somewhat rare occurrence. It may be necessary to talk over the phone or video chat.
Even if the next such occurrence is a few months away, you can use the intervening time to organize your thoughts and plan your peaceful confrontation.
If the only time your family gets together is the holidays, try not to use this as a time to work out your problems. People put a lot of expectations of magic of the holidays, and they can become more emotional and irrational when they feel that their holidays are ruined and become resentful of whomever they feel is responsible. Also, it can make people start to dread the holidays, as they come to associate them with stress and fighting. Reserve the holidays for savoring family time and find another time to talk about serious issues.;
, Since the conflicts you’re addressing are deeply personal, discussions can get heated quickly. Excessive emotion can derail the conversation and make it almost impossible to reach a productive resolution, so you should try to keep things calm and controlled. Do this by establishing a general code of conduct which forbids certain destructive behaviors, such as interrupting, bringing up unrelated quarrels, and name-calling.It can be helpful to enlist the input of the other party in formulating these rules so they don't feel like you are just parenting or lecturing them.
Regulating the discussion can be easier if you have a disinterested party like a family friend or level-headed relative to mediate your discussion.If you have a big family but your lingering resentment involves just one or two other family members, you’ll probably want to carve out a special appointment or time when just the aggrieved parties (and potentially a mediator) can meet and talk. This will avoid unnecessary interference from well-meaning relatives.

, You might assume that everyone in the family knows how much you love them, but this isn’t necessarily true. In fact, people often feel neglected when love isn’t expressly articulated, so you should make sure to say it often, especially during an argument which addresses old wounds.So, when explaining your side of the story, make sure to do so with explicit declarations of love and affection. A good way to do this is bringing up positive memories and good times you’ve shared throughout the discussion. You’ll be amazed how quickly these feel-good throwbacks will get everyone smiling and feeling closer.


For example, preface a statement about how you've been hurt with, ""I love you, and the reason I'm bringing this up is because our relationship is so valuable to me.""

, You won’t make any progress in your confrontation if you use the time when others are speaking to plan upcoming responses. Rather, you should be listening to others’ feelings and words with an open and empathetic mind. Practice active listening by asking questions when you need clarification and repeating key points back to the person to ensure you understand. This way you show you’re attentive and genuinely concerned with understanding them.You can also give small feedback gestures like nodding, leaning in, and light touches on the arm in order to make your interlocutor feel attended to.
You might say something like, ""What I'm hearing you say is... Is that right?""

, Perhaps the most important part of healing interpersonal conflict is coming to a mutual, explicit consensus that you’re all going to make an effort to move forward. This agreement shifts the emphasis of old wounds to the future: you’re all acknowledging the hurtful past while also recognizing that this past cannot be changed. The only things you can control are your actions and words going forward, so say something at the conclusion like, ""Now that we've talked about this, let's agree to let this issue go and concentrate on improving our future behavior and relationship.""It can help to write out a list or “contract” of behaviors and words you both agree to avoid or follow in the future. Things like “no passive aggressive texts,” “everyone must extend invitations to all family events—no petty exclusions!” and “no venting to mutual friends or family members” can help to remind everyone not to slip back into old habits and aggressions.
Remember, too, that no one is perfect, and it can be hard to change ingrained behaviors. Forgive people when they slip up.

, Moving forward, strive to speak or write to one another more frequently. This small effort will keep lines of communication open and allow you to remind one another how much you care. It will also boost your psychological well-being and amplify your sense of satisfaction from unrelated aspects of life such as your career and friendships.This communication can be a brief text every few days saying, “Hi, how are you?” or “Thinking of you!” You could also tag each other in social media pictures or memes, such as a #TBT photo on Instagram, or set up a ten-minute weekly phone call.
It's important to emphasize taking an interest in the other person and asking about their life, not just sharing your own information, to show that you truly care about them.

Set up tables and chairs outside.,
Set up a backyard movie night.,
Make time to spend with each other.,
Try to move other regular activities outdoors.",How to Spend More Time in Nature As a Family2," If there are places to sit and relax, your family is more likely to spend their time outdoors. If you have a yard, put out chairs and places where people can sit and relax. Take advantage of any outdoor space that you have access to. If you have enough space, you can host outdoor parties in your front or backyard.Hanging hammocks will also encourage people to be outside.

, If your children aren't into nature, you can try to bring some technology to your backyard instead. Purchase a projector online and hang up a large white sheet in between two trees. Plug your projector into your laptop and play a DVD or streaming movie. This is a great way to get electronic-oriented children playing outdoors., If your family has a busy schedule, it may make it harder to go on all day outings in nature. If this is the case, make sure that you coordinate your schedule with your family members and figure out a time and date that is open for everyone. Even if you don't have a lot of time throughout the week, you can still allocate a couple of hours spending more time in nature as a family.

Instead of using the time to watch TV as a family, your family can have a conversation outside.

, Simple activities like reading, shopping, studying, or eating can all be moved to an outdoor setting. Move some of these things outdoors to set the tone for your family. If you insist on being outdoors more often for regular tasks, it will rub off on other people."

Talk to your family.,
Encourage fun.,
Talk about the benefits of being outdoors.,
Consider the age and temperament of your child or children.",How to Spend More Time in Nature As a Family3," Talk to your family and figure out what everyone likes to do. If they already like to do outdoor activities such as hiking or canoeing, then you can partake in those activities as a family. If they don't like the outdoors, think of things that can link to their interests, such as looking for exotic insects, taking photos of wildlife, picking flowers, or growing plants in a garden.If your kids like animals, you can take them to an outdoor zoo.
If your family has an interest in growing fruits and vegetables, you can start an outdoor garden.
You can say something like ""Hey everyone, I'm going to try to make an effort for us to spend more time in nature. What do you think and what are the things that you'd want to do?""

, Don't try to force a harsh regime on children because they are likely to rebel. Instead of concentrating on what your family should be doing, live in the moment and allow your entire family to enjoy the experience. For example, if you want to finish a long hike, but your kids would rather play in the giant field, encourage the fun rather than obsessing over your pre-defined plans., Try to impress the benefits, especially on child development. For children, being outdoors helps build confidence, promotes creativity and exploration, and teaches the child responsibility. For adults, being out in nature can make someone more physically and mentally fit and reduces stress.If your child doesn't want to go outside you can say something like, ""Being inside all the time is bad for your health and can make you feel more stressed out. Take a two-hour break and spend some time in the backyard.""
If your spouse is reluctant you can say something like ""Bill, if the kids see you doing it, then they are more likely to go outside. Also, it's better for your health and can reduce your stress. Why not give it a try?""

, Engage toddlers in their interests and explore nature with them. When your children get into grade school, try to keep the activities exciting and make sure to include a physical challenge. Teens are old enough to do more complicated things like canoeing, hiking, and hiking complex trails. Think of the age of your children and do something that correlates to their age.Toddlers are fascinated with discovering new things like bugs, plants, and flowers.
Toddlers also love digging holes, so purchase a shovel and pail.
You can also teach grade age children how to catch exotic bugs and amphibians, build forts, camp at night, and climb trees.
You can go backpacking or do community service work with your teenager.

Reflect on your wrongdoing and resultant guilt.,
Apologize.,
Emphasize your desire to make amends.,
Accept that forgiveness and healing take time.",How to Heal Family Wounds2," If you have done something offensive or hurtful to your family, the first steps to making amends are to recognize your blame in the conflict, reflect on the reasons for your behavior, and what impact it has had on everyone. This thoughtful introspection will help to make your apology more meaningful and effective when you eventually deliver it to injured family members.Make sure that you analyze the underlying motivations behind your urge to apologize. A genuine apology cannot be contingent on speedy forgiveness, so if you’re wanting to make amends simply in order to feel the relief of forgiveness, you should reconsider whether or not you’re truly ready to make a heartfelt apology.

, Once you’ve gathered your thoughts and feel ready to approach those you’ve hurt, extend a heartfelt apology to your loved ones. You can do this through a letter or email, or in person. No matter what method you choose, the most important thing is to be direct, accept accountability without dodging blame or rationalizing, and show you have thought about the impact of your actions.For example, don’t say something like, “I’m so sorry for hurting your feelings. I never intended to hurt you, and in any case I was really upset about what you said to me that one time. But anyway, I’m sorry!” Instead, say, “I’m so sorry for what I did. It was a foolish and small-minded thing to do, and I want you to know how regretful I am.”
Allow the other parties to explain how they were hurt by your behavior. Feeling heard is an important part of being able to forgive someone. Listening to the person without interrupting, defending yourself, or making excuses does a lot of the work for you.

, An apology seems somewhat hollow if it focuses solely on the past wrongdoing. In order for your compunction to ring true, you should also promise never to repeat the same offense. In other words, you’re not just extending a flimsy, retrospective excuse, but vowing to work at correcting your behavior in the future.Be as specific and concrete as possible in order to demonstrate that you’ve thought about how to realistically amend and avoid personal pitfalls. For example, if you are apologizing for gossiping and saying malicious things about a family member, don’t just say, “I’ll never do it again!” Rather, say something like, “I feel terrible about what I said and promise not to repeat it. I think I was using these texts to friends as a way to vent about other things and frustrations in my life, so I have started writing a journal or seeing a therapist in order to deal with my problems in more productive ways.”
It can often be helpful to ask, ""How can I make this up to you?""

, Of course you want your family to forgive you for what you’ve done, but you need to manage your expectations regarding this process. Acknowledge your family’s right to take as much time as they need to think about your apology and that, just because you’ve apologized, you’re not owed forgiveness. In the same way, if you've also been hurt by your family members and they've apologized, you should recognize your own right to take time before accepting and forgiving.


It’s not a bad idea to include this lack of expectations in your apology. This will show your family that you’re respectful of their feelings and aren’t putting pressure on them. Say something like, “No matter how you decide to respond to my apology, I needed to express my sincere regret. Of course I want you to forgive me, but I know that I have no right to expect this from you, so take your time and know I’m here to talk whenever you’re ready.”

Seek help from a licensed professional.,
Identify your goals for recovery.,
Do things that make you feel good about yourself.,
Build strong relationships with others.,
Write a letter or make a phone call.,
Forgive.,
Know when to end the relationship.",How to Heal Family Wounds3," If you’re nursing a serious family wound, such as childhood abuse or neglect, you should deal with this injury as soon as possible. Otherwise, if you keep suppressing it, you’ll find your ability to trust and love in other relationships and aspects of life will suffer. For serious problems, you should seek the help of a therapist to analyze and guide you through your feelings. A licensed professional can also help you brainstorm ways to deal with the past and move on in the future.If you have health insurance, you should ask your provider about which doctors or services they cover. Websites like PsychologyToday and goodtherapy.org have searchable online databases that can help you find professionals in your area.

, When reflecting on the impact a betrayal or trauma has had on your life, have your therapist help you identify your objectives for the process. For example, do you want to eventually forgive your family member and re-forge former bonds? Or, do you just want to find a way to get over the past so that it doesn’t affect your life in the future?


Since seriously abusive family members rarely apologize for the past, your goals should not include receiving an apology or even recognition from the injurious person., Personal healing after painful family wounds is largely dependent on self-esteem: you’ll only be able to acknowledge your pain and get over any associated shame if you believe you’re a person worthy of respect and happiness. You can work on building this self-esteem by investing time and energy in yourself and your interests.


Physical activities like jogging, swimming, or team sports will buoy your mood by releasing endorphins and relieve anxiety by burning off adrenaline.Creative pursuits such as painting or writing will help you to express your feelings and feel a sense of accomplishment, as well as helping you recover from family trauma. , Getting over a troubled family past is much easier if you work on building trust and intimate relationships with friends. It will improve your self-esteem, improve your mental health, and even boost your physical health, all while proving that you aren’t totally dependent on nuclear family ties. You can strengthen existing friendships by making time for personal conversations, trust-building activities, and attending one another’s special events.

, One of most important parts of the healing process is closure, and a wonderful way to achieve closure is to write a letter and express unaired feelings.Even if the other person doesn’t claim accountability or never even responds to the letter, you’ll feel a sense of relief at having released pent-up sadness and anger.


Depending on your goals, you might have decided not to address the family member directly. You can still reap the therapeutic benefits of this step, though, by writing a letter which you won’t actually send. You can say all the things you’ve always wanted without putting yourself in a vulnerable position and potentially re-aggravating healing wounds.

, Even if you intend to never see or speak to the offending family member again, you might want to consider forgiving the family member for the sake of your own mental and emotional wellbeing. This is because forgiveness can help you let go of the past and feel liberated moving forward.You can ask your therapist for help creating a manageable, productive plan for forgiveness that doesn’t compromise your progress.

, If there is an abusive family member, it may be necessary to dissolve your relationship with that person. As hard as it is to repair conflict within the family, it is equally as hard to protect yourself from an abuser within the family, especially if you experience pressure from other family members to have a relationship with the person. This can be very difficult and complicated, so enlist the help of a therapist to strategize how to do this.


You may wish to tell the other members of your family why you are ending this relationship. An unfortunate truth is sometimes other family members will not want to believe what you are saying. Your therapist can help you prepare for this. If other family members are siding with your abuser, then you may need to remove them from your life as well."

Appreciate the uniqueness of your family.,
Focus on the present.,
Be vocal and positive about the progress you’ve made.,
Demonstrate love.,
Find times to laugh together.",How to Heal Family Wounds4," Building a better future for your family will be a lot easier if you recognize how special your family is and how these bonds are worth preserving. Do this by looking at your family’s quirks, complicated dramas, or unorthodox structure not as embarrassing problems, but as special strengths and reminders of how irreplaceable your family really is.It can also help to remember that, no matter how perfect other families may seem, every family has its own problems.

, It’s important to acknowledge past problems and conflicts, but you shouldn’t belabor the past and let it dominate the present. This will just extend old problems and delay healing in the present.Show everyone you're serious about this principle by establishing a common family rule to leave the past in the past and focus on positive behaviors and supportiveness in the present.


Making new memories can be helpful in this regard. If old traditions seem to belabor pain from the past, try new experiences together as a family.
A good, concrete way to stop belaboring the past is to avoid bringing up past resentments in current conflicts. For example, if you’re arguing with a family member about a loan which hasn’t been paid back to you in the agreed time frame, stop yourself from using past money issues and unpaid loans into the present argument. Focus on steps for resolving the current issue and, if the same thing happens again, make a policy never to lend money to that family member again.

, While old family wounds can take time to heal, you should remind one another how far you’ve come and what positive steps you’ve made. This way you won’t feel like the process has been futile and that you’re just slipping back into old behaviors.For example, when a family member who always missed your concerts or basketball games in the past shows up to one, send them a text afterward saying how much you appreciated their presence and support. If you’ve noticed a family member making an effort to use kinder words and tones in disagreements, compliment them on their effort and express your appreciation.

, While conflicts are unavoidable to some extent, you can minimize their damage by spotlighting the love and deep bonds among one another. You should do this in many ways: don’t just articulate your love verbally, but also perform actions which demonstrate love.For example, give small presents such as hand-picked flowers, favorite candies or cookies, and little seasonal knick-knacks for no particular reason.
You can also show that you care by being of service in simple ways. For example, bring over morning coffee and bagels, drop into your family member’s workplace just to say hello, make dinner for the family, or offer to help with fixing a computer bug or installing a shelf.
For many people, physical affection is the most significant sign of love. It's a person by person basis, but you may consider hugs and handshakes.

, Laughter has been shown to have numerous mental and even physical health benefits, and you’ll be surprised how much of a positive impact it can have on your family dynamic.Next time you’re planning a family gathering, make sure it includes plenty of chuckles and fun.


For example, rent a funny film and have a movie night, play a side-splitting board game like Apples to Apples or Taboo, or go see an improv comedy show in a group outing.

Occupy your time.,
Don’t try too hard.,
Wait with other people.,
Break up a long wait.",How to Wait Patiently1," One of the best ways to avoid become anxious during a long wait, is to do something else at the same time to occupy you. One of the most frustrating aspects of waiting can be the sense that you are losing valuable time, so you can tackle this by filling this time with another activity to help the time pass more quickly.This won’t always be practical, depending on the situation, but here are some examples to keep in mind:


If you are being kept on-hold on the phone, use the time to answer some emails.
If you are waiting for an appointment, read a book or newspaper, or play a game on your phone.
If you are stuck in traffic, don’t sit there and stew, put on some music or a language tape and try to make the most of it.;
, Finding ways to distract yourself is a tried and tested way of keeping impatience at bay and helping time pass. Research has suggested, however, that this technique can backfire if you are trying very hard to consciously distract yourself from the wait. Trying to force yourself not to feel anxious can prompt even greater anxiety.Accept that you will have to wait and there is nothing you can do about it.
Take a minute to relax before you find something that will occupy you for a while.

, There is evidence which suggests that waiting for something with other people can help the time pass quicker. For this to work, it’s important that the people are engaging with each other, talking about what they are waiting for and sharing their excitement in a positive way. For example, a group of fans waiting to get a newly released video game might have a fun time in the queue together.Being stuck in a long silent queue will not work in the same way.
Equally, being stuck in a waiting room with people being angry and impatient will not make the time go faster.
Look for a more positive engagement with other people.

, If you have a very long wait for something, it can help to break it up into smaller chunks. Identifying short term goals and focussing on achieving these rather than the final end goal can help you to avoid becoming impatient. Setting small goals that you can achieve can help you to feel like you are taking control of your life, while also distracting you from the long wait that you cannot do anything to shorten.For example, if you are growing impatient to find out whether or not you have been accepted to your first choice college you can give yourself small goals to reach each week in the meantime.
This could be anything from learning twenty new words in a foreign language, to mastering a new card trick.

Recognise when you are being impatient.,
Accept inevitable waits.,
Think positively.,
Try some deep breathing.,
Think of patience as compassion.",How to Wait Patiently2," We all feel impatient and can get stressed out and anxious waiting for something to happen. The first step to learning to wait patiently is understanding when impatience has arisen, and where that feeling is coming from. Although you may be waiting for something to arrive, or happen, it is your response to that situation that results in the stress of waiting.


For example, if you were stuck in a traffic jam you would probably get annoyed at the situation or maybe the other cars for holding you up.
It is, however, your response to this situation which determines whether you wait patiently or impatiently.
People often get impatient when they perceive the environment as not conforming to their expectations.
Recognising that expectations are only expectations and are often not totally realistic can help you to identify impatience., Waiting can be frustrating because you feel you have lost control over something. The fact is that you cannot control your environment and there will inevitably be times when you have to wait for extended periods. Accepting this can help you to feel more free and calm.


Acknowledging that you cannot clear an accident that has caused a traffic jam is much better than getting annoyed and frustrated about something you have no influence on., Often anxiety about waiting is connected to the feeling that the wait will be followed by bad news or a negative outcome, which can make it harder to wait patiently. Research suggests that those people who have a more positive outlook, and are generally more optimistic about the outcome of what they are waiting for, will find waiting patiently easier.


Try to foster a more optimistic outlook, and learn to feel more comfortable with uncertainty.
If you are anticipating bad news, try to find a positive in it in advance. This could be preparing for failure and thinking of an alternative way forward.
For example, if you are waiting for an exam result, thinking positively about what you could do if you don’t get the grades can help you wait more patiently., If you’re stuck with a long wait, and have accepted that there is nothing you can really do about it, practicing some relaxation techniques might help you to avoid becoming stressed and impatient. A simple relaxation technique that you can do anywhere and at any time is deep breathing.


Take deep deliberate breaths, inhaling for three or four seconds.
Fill your lungs and hold the air in for a few seconds before slowly breathing out for another three or four seconds.
You could also combine your deep breathing with a mantra, such as “I am breathing out stress, and breathing in relaxation.”, Becoming impatient about something in your life is entirely normal and happens to all of us all. You will feel the stress of impatience in both your mind and body. Try to recognise that if you become particularly anxious and upset when you are waiting for something, this impatience is a stress response to the situation. Learning to be more patience is a way of being more compassionate to yourself.


By being patient and limiting the stress response you are actively taking care of yourself.
You will suffer when impatient, so learning to be more relaxed will help you feel better about yourself and the situation.Learning to be patient will also help you feel more compassion towards others who get frustrated when things don’t conform to their expectations."
"
Recognise that uncertain waits make you more impatient.,
Know that unexpected waits prompt impatience.,
Realise that getting anxious will only make things worse.",How to Wait Patiently3," To really learn to wait patiently and avoid becoming anxious when you are waiting for something, it’s helpful to think about the different waiting times we experience. It is generally thought that an uncertain wait prompts more anxiety than one you have a clearer timetable for.


Uncertain waits can feel longer than if you know how long you will have to wait for.
For example, if you are told you will be seen in 30 minutes, it can be easier than if you are just told you will be seen soon.If you're facing an uncertain wait, try to find out a clearer timetable so you have a better idea of how long you'll have to wait.
If you can't get any extra information, try to relax or occupy yourself and accept that there is nothing to do but wait.

, Sometimes you will expect to be able to see your doctor at a set time and you arrive only to find out that there has been a problem and you will now have a lengthy wait. This situation can prompt heightened impatient because it was unexpected and it contradicts what you understood would happen.


If you find yourself in a similar situation, recognise it and try to relax and shrug it off.
Consider finding out the reason for the wait, perhaps somebody is unexpectedly off sick, or has been held up in traffic.
This may help you to understand that there is nothing you can do to change it and then wait more patiently., Everyone gets impatient, but it’s important to understand that getting frustrated and restless will only increase your impatience. Try to relax as much as possible and take things in your stride. If you are queuing at the supermarket and you are anxious because your line is moving slowly as all the others go quickly, your wait will likely seem longer than it actually is.Treating these situations more lightly, and trying to maintain a good sense of humour about all the waiting around you have to do, can help you wait more patiently and happily."

, They took the time to raise you and provide for you. Be sure to thank them when they do something nice for you. This will let your Mom know that you appreciate her.

, If you know that she sorely objects to the amount of money you spend on your car, do not bring it up in conversation. Understand that she will likely never understand your view on certain subjects and avoid them in conversation. This does not pertain to subjects that must be discussed, like children, spouses, abuse or other serious family matters.

, Even if she needles you to discuss a private subject, politely tell her that you do not want to talk about it. If you stick to your guns, she may be frustrated at first but soon learn that her meddling is to no avail.

, If you know your Mom needs a few days to recover from an argument, don't pressure her to talk about it too soon. Doing so may cause tensions to continue to rise.

, If you sense that tensions are rising, say that you are aware of her opinion and simply walk away. Be sure to physically separate yourself from tension; take a walk, a bike ride, or go into your room and listen to music. Take deep breaths to calm yourself.

, It is not okay for someone to say cruel things to you, even if she is your mother. Certain boundaries should never be permeated. Show your mother the same respect and refrain from insulting her or cussing at her.

, This can be either temporary or permanent. Keep in mind that if you leave home, you may not be permitted to move back in at a later stage.

, After an argument, go into a private place. Continue with your daily life but just refrain from talking to your mother. Keep it up. Do not cave in or let her win. Let her come to you. She will. When she finally gives in, welcome her with open arms. She'll be happy you're interacting with her again, and peace will reign.

Take time to enjoy your family.",How to Study when You Have Children," On your calendar, planner, or scheduler, designate specific times (at least one per day) when you will try to study with minimal distractions. You may find that you can't always stick to this schedule, but getting into a study routine will help you be as efficient as possible and avoid letting parental tasks encroach on your at-home study time.You should experiment with different times of day/evening to find which periods work best for you. Are you most focused right after work? After dinner? Late at night? Only you can determine this.
Consider creating a rotating study schedule if your parental duties and other obligations change from day to day; just make sure to write this down somewhere so you don't forget and get off-schedule. The more consistent your schedule, the easier it will be to stick to.
Having a study schedule doesn't mean you can't squeeze in additional study sessions when you have time. In fact, doing so can help spread out your work load and keep you from feeling overburdened.;
, If at all possible, create a space at home in which you can study with minimal distraction. For this strategy to be effective, make this area strictly off-limits to your kids. In addition to helping you maintain focus while studying, this can also help ensure that your unfinished work or your place in the textbook or study guide won't be lost or disturbed by your children.


If you don’t have space in your home you can dedicate to studying, at least have a box, drawer, or cabinet where you can store all your materials while they are not in use; this way, your work will stay safe.
If you have a space you can use for studying but can't keep your kids away from all the time, make sure they understand that while you are working they are not to enter the room or disturb you unless there is an emergency.

, Making a set study schedule can definitely beneficial but you should also look for small portions of time throughout your day that you can devote to studying. This way, your studying is integrated around your family commitments and you do not feel that you are losing out on time with your children.


Do some studying while the pasta is boiling for dinner or the roast beef is cooking in the oven. Fit studying in while you wait for your child to finish soccer practice or while you are waiting in line doing errands. This will allow you to maximize your time and feel like you are still able to follow through on your family commitments.

, If your children are old enough, assign them chores around the house while you are studying. This will help keep your kids busy while you are studying so you can focus on your work. This also carries the added benefits of accomplishing household tasks and teaching your children work ethic!If your kids are school-aged, establishing a rule that they do their homework while you are also studying can help avoid unplanned distractions during your dedicated study time.
If your children are too young to do chores, having them help out might not work as well. However, even toddlers can be assigned ""fake"" tasks such as sweeping that they may see as a game.
If your kids resist this plan of action, consider developing a points or reward system in which they can receive small benefits for putting in work. For instance, maybe 2 hours of work earns your child 30 minutes of uninterrupted TV time.

, If you have a spouse or partner that lives with you and your children, you may want to sit them down and discuss your planned study times. You can then ask them for assistance and support as you try to get some studying done during the day. They can support you by offering to take care of the children during your study times or by doing chores for the children that you may not be able to do due to your studying.


Don't be afraid to ask your partner of help. Parenting should be a team effort and your partner should be willing to support your educational goals.

, If you can afford to pay someone to help you out with childcare or household tasks (such as cleaning or cooking), do so. This will take a lot of the burden off your shoulders and give you time to study when you need it. If you can't afford to pay someone, look into trading off with family or friends. An arrangement like this can be mutually beneficial and will allow you to time to study without having to tend to your children.If you have a spouse at home, he or she should definitely be able to handle the extra responsibility of watching the kids alone a few nights a week. Ideally, this is a discussion you and your spouse will have before you decide to go back to school.
If you are decide to hire someone to babysit while you study, try to find someone who can work around your ideal study schedule.

, Having a family obviously takes priority for most people, but if you commit to going back to school, make it count. Skipping out on lectures because you feel guilty about being away from your family will only reduce the benefit you receive from your studies. If this is something that matters to you, get the most out of it by attending every class meeting.


Every once in a while, you may experience situations or parenting-related scheduling conflicts that keep you from being able to go to class. If an unavoidable circumstance arises, be sure to explain it to your professor ahead of time and ask what you can do to make up for it.
Make sure you get the lecture notes from a classmate if you are ever unable to attend class. However, you should understand that this is a poor substitute for actually showing up and participating!

, Showing up to class is important, but it isn't enough to be successful. If you go to the trouble of attending class, make sure you get the most out of it by actively participating in class activities and discussions, asking questions during lectures, and taking diligent notes on the material being presented. Putting in extra effort while in class could mean less studying later and more time with your kids.


Think of your class time as the prime opportunity for you to learn without distraction. This is a time during which you are guaranteed not to be disturbed, so don't waste it by worrying about what you have to do at home or feeling guilty about not being with your kids., When choosing classes, pay attention to the days, times, and locations. Take the time to build a schedule that makes it as easy as possible for you to commit to attending. Try to stack your classes so you don't have to take multiple trips to campus each day or so you only have to go to campus a couple of days per week.If possible, use public transit to get to and from class so you can study during your commute. If you do this, just make sure your class schedule fits with the bus or train schedule.
If you don't have a day job, try to schedule your classes during the day while your kids are in school. This will minimize the time you need to spend away from them.

, Colleges usually have lots of resources available to their students for helping them study, manage their time, and even help them complete assignments. Ask your counselor or academic advisor about these services, or check your school's website for information about the services open to you.Ask your academic advisor for help and advice when you need it; this is one of the greatest resources available to you. Advisors can help you get the most out of your effort.
Don't forget about resources indirectly related to your studies; these might include the school health center, disability services, and recreational facilities. The more balanced you feel overall, the better you will likely do in your studies.

, Seek out dedicated study areas on campus to get in quick study sessions while you are between classes or while you wait for traffic to subside before driving home. Places like the school library likely have dedicated study areas where you can find ample desk space, open access computer labs, reference books, and a quiet, relaxed atmosphere.Depending on how far away from campus you live, you might even want to consider making these on-campus study spaces your go-to spot for doing all your after-class work. This is a good way to avoid the distractions of home.
By keeping your home life and school life separate, you can make the most efficient use of your time because you won't be trying to wear your 'parent' and 'student' hats at the same time. After all, kids are not known for willingly allowing parents time to themselves.

, Your professors hold office hours for each class they teach. This is a prime opportunity to get one-on-one help with projects, assignments, or topics you may be struggling with. Build this into your schedule and plan to go each week, even if you are not in desperate need of help. This will help build a rapport with your professors and will keep you from having to rearrange your schedule when you do need to get extra help.


If your professor's office hours don't work with your schedule, explain your situation and ask her to set up a recurring appointment right after or before class.
If you are a distance learner (attending online classes), your professor probably has online office hours; be sure to make use of these just as you would in-person office hours.

, Try not to dwell on negative thoughts, such as worrying that you haven’t studied for a long time, that you'll be older than the other students, or that you shouldn't take so much time away from your family. Remind yourself that you are doing this to better yourself and that you have the support of your family and the maturity and experience to succeed.


Deciding to go back to school is one of the hardest steps; once you've done this, you can take comfort in the fact that you made a difficult decision and are now in a position to benefit from it.
Remember that by doing something so significant for yourself, you are taking steps toward a better you -- and this will benefit your children in the long run. Dismiss any thoughts that your choice is selfish or bad for your kids.

, If you are given a course syllabus or schedule, take the time to plan ahead so you can be sure to complete assignments on time. This might require scheduling extra study time before due dates or exams. Being prepared for what is to come will help keep you from falling behind, which can be hard to recover from, especially while juggling kids and school.


A good way to stay on top of your studies is to do a little bit each day rather than ""cram"" before the final exam.Even if you can only set aside 20 minutes a day, this will add up in your favor if you commit to studying during that period.
If you are having trouble keeping up, request extra help from your professor with course concepts, more assistance from your spouse in handling the kids, or add 30 minutes a day to your babysitter's schedule.

, Any way you slice it, being a parent and a student is no easy task. Try not to put too much pressure on yourself to excel at everything. Your educational goals should be set based on what you hope to achieve in the long run and within the context of your personal and family life. Are you simply taking a class for fun, or do you need to do well in order to keep your job?


Work out what you have to do to pass your classes, commit to that, and take pride in anything extra you are able to accomplish.
In likely the worst case academic scenario, you fail a class and have to retake it later; this is a far less serious consequence than if you were to neglect your children in the interest of studying harder. Your priorities as a parent should help define what you can reasonably accomplish in school., Though it can be difficult to balance school work and a family life, you should try not to guilt yourself for spending time away from your children. You can still be devoted to your children and achieve your personal goals, especially if you establish a study schedule around your family commitments.


You can also view your education pursuits as positive behavior that your children can use as a model. Your ability to balance school and family can act as a positive example that your children can observe and hopefully model in the future.

, Avoid letting your studies consume your life by making sure you don't miss out on special moments with your kids. If necessary, schedule time to spend with your kids doing fun activities or relaxing together. This will help keep you from feeling burned out, will relieve any guilt you may have about spending so much time in school, and will help your whole family stay close with one another.Family time can include attending a child's recital or sporting event, watching a movie together, or even taking a short vacation. Whatever brings your family together, make time for it.
You will likely regret missing critical moments in your child's life much more than missing class or even an exam; this is something to think about when sorting out your schedule and priorities.

"
"
STOP.,
Make a list of what needs to be done.,
Put a star next to the SMALLEST things on the list.,
Star the things that are of MEDIUM importance.,
Finally, it's on to the important things, like making up with a friend after a big fight, or finishing a huge project for school.,
Last but not least, give yourself a pat on the back.",How to Straighten out Your Life if It Has Become Too Hectic," Literally. Just stop. Stop whatever you've been doing up until now, and breathe. It's okay. You're already in this deep. Breathing isn't going to dig your hole any deeper. So just close your eyes for a moment, and breathe.;
, This list can have anything from ""Clean my room"" to ""Apologize to Jenny"". You can write it or type it, it doesn't matter. Just make it.

, These are the things you want to get done FIRST. They're the easiest, and once they're done, you'll have the complete rest of your time to focus on just the important stuff, without that nagging feeling that you have to go home from a rough day of school to a bunch of chores.


So go ahead, do your laundry. While it's in the wash/dryer, pick up your room a bit. Play some relaxing, upbeat music while you clean, to keep you motivated. Check off everything that you complete.
Do NOT check off things that are ""half done"" or ""almost complete"", because you still have the stress of having to come back to finish it later. Only check off things that are truly done.

, This includes things like homework, getting along with family, etc.


For homework, you can either complete all the homework for one subject, then all the homework for the next subject, etc., or, you can do a little bit from each subject, then do a little bit more, and a little more, until you basically finish up all the subjects at virtually the same time. Both ways may take a couple days, but either way, you're making good progress.
For homework also, don't be afraid to TALK to your teachers! Explaining your personal life can be embarrassing, yes, but at the same time it's so much easier if you have 3 days to turn in an assignment rather than 1, just because you have too much ""pride"" to let your teachers know that you are really struggling.
As for family, if you're arguing a lot, start by doing little nice things for them. If you're doing your laundry, throw theirs in, too! Maybe set the table without be asked, or even just ask them how their day was when they get home from work. Try to avoid back-talking them or arguing with them; they're probably going through just as much stress as you, but with the added stress of bills, raising kids, approaching deadlines at work, etc. Sympathize with them; and they will with you, too.

, When it comes to making up with a friend, start by trying to slowly work your way back into their life.


If a group of you is talking, including both you and said friend, try to direct a question or topic for discussion very friendly-like to your friend, or ask the whole group a question and make eye contact with your friend to let them know you're interested in their answer/opinions too.
Once you obtain an acquaintance-level with them again, it becomes much easier to just step in and apologize. Even if the situation wasn't your fault, the majority of the time, a simple ""I'm sorry"" from you can be the one spark your friend needs in order to apologize as well, ans from there you two can sort out what happened and make amends.
However, believe it or not, it's a good idea to actually keep some space between you and your friend for a few days first, because it gives both your friend and you a lot of time to reflect and figure out the best ways to apologize.
Now, for finishing school projects: Start out slow. Make another list of what needs to be done. If the project is an essay, including works cited, and perhaps a poster or just some form of presentation, start small and go up. Find your resources first, and use them to jot down notes. Then, write the paper. When done, proof-read it and edit as necessary.
Now, move on to the presentation part (if you have one). Also, don't be afraid to ask your friends for help. Asking your friends and family may result in you getting done three times faster than you ever imagined.

, And not just at the end, but EVERY time you accomplish something. Did your laundry and cleaned your room? Go take a computer break! Finished ALL your homework? Go to the movies with your friends! You deserve it. Good luck!

This may tie into feelings or experiences you have had as you’ve gotten older. Keep in mind that healthier lifestyles and medical progress make 50 look very different for you than it did for even your mother or father. Taking some time to think about how you feel about turning 50—and staying nifty—can help you more gracefully welcome your milestone.Ask yourself some of the following questions that may help you more fully explore your feelings:


What are my conceptions of a 50 year old person? Do I know anyone who is 50? How did the person change?
How do I see myself today? Is that going to change much the day I turn 50?
Is there anything specifically that scares me about turning 50?
What can I do to keep myself feeling the way I always have?;
, No one can turn back the clock. Instead, try accepting—and heartily welcoming—turning 50.

This truism is especially appropriate today because people are living longer and looking younger at the same age than the generation before them.Taking care of yourself with exercise, diet, rest, and reducing stress may even make you healthier than a person younger than you.
Repeat Mark Twain’s, “Age is an issue of mind over matter” to yourself. This can help you focus on everything that you can do and how great you feel., By the time you turn 50, you have probably already led a full life. Maybe you’ve had a family and are successful and happy in your job. Thinking about what you’ve accomplished to this point can set you up for turning 50 gracefully and the exciting decade to follow.Think about milestones you’ve reached such as finishing your education, starting a family, or landing the job you’ve always wanted. It could even be something as simple as, “I finally learned how to swim.” These accomplishments can be a starting point for goals and wishes when you turn 50.
Forget any perceived failures. Every person will have some type of failure in life. Try letting go of expectations you may have for yourself at 50.

Making plans and goals that are enjoyable can help you welcome this new phase in life.Set personal and professional goals for yourself. For example, you might want to go back to college or travel the world.
Plan to enjoy experiences from a different perspective as you turn 50. Your previous experiences can help you enjoy things such as travel, learning, or engaging with others more because you’re wiser at 50. In fact, they may even help you feel younger than you did before 50.

, You may have also wanted to try something new in your life and never had the opportunity. Turning 50 is the perfect opportunity to try out something you’ve always wanted to do. Allowing yourself to be curious about the world around you is a great way to turn 50 gracefully.Keep in mind that there is virtually no limit to what you can do at 50. Think about trying things such as painting, dancing, or constructing fish flies. You could try a new sport or join a sports club for masters. You might want to work on skills such as photography or start a book club.
Stay open-minded if new activities aren’t appealing at first. You may end up truly enjoying something you thought you would hate.

, Your mind is key to turning 50 gracefully. Challenging your brain can keep you involved in life and may keep you younger longer. Take part in activities that stimulate your brain such as continuing education classes or doing the daily crossword puzzles.Take classes, lectures, or seminars in subjects that interest you. Many institutions offer courses for “senior associates” or may offer online courses.Remember that activities such as visiting museums, reading books or other literature you enjoy, doing crosswords, and engaging in conversations also stimulate your brain.

, Consider participating in your local community. You could work at a chamber of commerce, a local school, or firefighters. If you want to go beyond your community, travel as often as you can. These types of activities let you stay engaged and help others. It may introduce you to other fifty-somethings who want to be graceful at 50, too.Join local clubs or consider running for local political offices such as the school board.
Give your time to the less fortunate by volunteering in your community at a local school, hospital, or recreation center. Simple acts of kindness can boost the feelings of others and yourself. Volunteering can also put turning 50 into perspective and help you embrace it more gracefully.
Travel to places that interest you, which can open you up to new experiences and perspectives. You don’t have to go far, either. Neighboring communities may have interesting sights to see. You can also use the Internet to “explore” the world and get you off the beaten track.

, You might realize that your perspectives and tastes change throughout your life, especially as you turn 50.

Think about what you want to achieve.,
Get specific.,
Do some research.,
Determine the steps.,
Assess your commitment.,
Consider personal limitations.,
Determine the external obstacles.,
Revise if necessary.,
Make a plan.,
Set a timeline.,
Get to work.,
Track your progress.",How to Set Realistic Goals," The first step in setting any goal is deciding what you want. Most people have a general sense of things they want. It might be happiness, health, wealth, or a better relationship with your spouse. Your first tasks is translating that into some things you'd like to actually accomplish.


A good place to start is defining your terms. If you want to be happier, think about what happiness means to you. What does a happy life look like? What would you need to do to be happy?It's okay to be general at this stage. You might decide happiness, for example, means having a fulfilling career. Your general goal might be to get a job you find personally satisfying.
You may have several goals at this stage, some long-term some short term. It's a good idea to write them down.;
, Before you can determine if a goal is realistic, you have to make that goal specific. This will provide greater clarity in terms of what you actually would have to do to achieve it. Specific goals are also more motivating and achievable than vague ones.Your task at this stage is to take your general ideas and get as specific as you possibly can.
For example, imagine you goal is to start a new, more satisfying career. At this stage, you need to decide what career would be most satisfying to you. You might decide you'd like to become a professional musician. That's a great start, but you can get more specific. What style or styles of music do you want to play? What instrument or instruments do you want to play? Do you want to be a solo artist, or play in a band or orchestra?

, Determining how challenging a goal is might require some research, if you aren't already familiar with the process. The more you know about the process the better.As you do your research, try to answer questions like:


What skills will you need to learn?
What lifestyle changes will you need to make?
How much will it cost?
How long will it take?

, To determine if a goal is realistic, you must know exactly how a goal would be achieved. In this step, you need to break your goal or goals into parts or steps.Breaking your goal down into subgoals will also help you make a plan for achieving it later on. It's a good idea to write the steps down as you go.
For example, imagine your goal is to become a professional cello player with a classical orchestra. In general terms, this goal breaks down into several steps. You'll need to buy a cello, if you don't have one. You'll need to get very good at playing it. This will probably require taking lessons. You probably will even want to attend a conservatory or other music school or college. Along the way, you'll probably need to learn some musical theory. Then, you'll need to get a job playing for an orchestra. This will mean at least one (and probably several) auditions. Depending on where you live, this might require moving to a town with a professional orchestra.

, Once you have an idea of what it will take to achieve your goal, you can determine whether you are committed enough to follow through. You must be determined to put in the necessary time and effort to achieve your goals.Especially if your goal is a difficult or complicated one, you must be fully committed to it. You are less likely to achieve a goal that is only somewhat important to you.
If your aren't sure you are committed enough to follow through on a goal or goals, it probably isn't realistic. This means you should either revise your goal or create a new one you are more committed to.
Let's stick with the example of becoming a professional cellist. You might decide that moving to another city is something you can't commit to. If there isn't a professional orchestra in your town, you'll need to revise your career goal.
If you have multiple goals on your list, it is a good idea to rank them in order of how important to you they are. Trying to achieve too many goals at once can make it harder to achieve any of them. Go for the ones you are most committed to first.

, You've probably heard people say that if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything. In some cases, this is true. In other cases, your personal limitations might make a goal unrealistic. So, you should consider whether the goals you've set are reasonable for you.Limitations come in many forms. They can be monetary, for example. They can also be physical. While some can be overcome, others might present too much of challenge. In such cases, you may wish to revise or reconsider one of your goals.
Let's stick with the career as a cellist as an example. If you've been in a car accident and don't have full use of your hands, this will make achieving this goal much more difficult. You might be able to overcome this through intensive physical therapy and years of training. Certainly though, it will make the goal much harder, and might make it impossible. You should keep this in mind while assessing whether your goal is realistic.
Write your limitations down. This will help you develop a more complete picture of the challenges you face.

, Aside from your own limitations, most goals also involve overcoming external obstacles. These are things that might happen, outside of your control, that could make it harder to achieve your goal. You should take such obstacles into account.


For example, think about the music school you want to attend for cello training. How difficult is it to get accepted to that school? How likely are you to to be accepted? What if you aren't accepted? What other options are open to you?
You won't be able to anticipate every obstacle that might arise, but try to brainstorm as many as you can, writing them down as you go. This will help you develop a sense of how realistic your goal is.
This can also be helpful later if you do decide to pursue your goal. Trying to anticipate obstacles in advance helps you develop ideas for dealing with them when they arise., After careful consideration, you may decide your goal is realistic. If so, you can move on to working toward making it a reality. If not, you're going to need to revise your goals.


If you decide your goal isn't realistic, you have two options. You can try to revise the goal to make it more achievable. Or, you can let it go in favor of creating a new goal.
For example, imagine you've decided that a career as a professional cellist isn't realistic for you. If your big-picture goal is a more fulfilling career, it's time to go back to the drawing board. Think about some other careers that would also make you happy.
Keep in mind that this doesn't mean you need to give up on the cello. If you love music and the cello, you can also revise your goal. You can aim to learn the cello and play it as a hobby. This goal would be less challenging and might be more realistic for you and your current circumstances.

, Once you've settled on an realistic goal, your first step is to create a detailed plan for achieving it.


This should be fairly easy at this point. You have already written down the steps and potential obstacles you might face. The main parts of your plan are already developed.
You may need to get a little more specific with your steps. For example, if you are applying to a music school, you'll want to include the details of the application process in your plan. You might need to get letters of recommendation. There might be an essay to write, a form to fill out, and/or an audition. Completing all of these should be in your plan.
The steps should be defined specifically enough that it will be clear when you have achieved each one.It's also a good idea to develop contingency plans for the obstacles you anticipated.If you aren't accepted to your first choice school, will you apply to other schools? Or wait and apply to your first choice again after strengthening your application?
Come up with a goal/sub-goal statement which is measurable and time bound. For example: ""I will save 20% of my weekly pay for the next 12 months and will purchase my cello on June 1st 2016.""

, Many people find having a specific timeline in their plan helps make their goal more achievable. It helps you track your progress an stay accountable.For example, you might aim to have money saved for a cello in six months. You might start lessons the following month. You might aim to have mastered the basics by the end of the year, and so on.

, Once you've got a detailed plan, pick a date to begin and dive in! The only way to achieve your goal is to put in the necessary time and effort.Picking a date that's at least a few days in the future can help you build anticipation and motivation as the date approaches., Once you get started, keep track of your progress. You can use a journal, an app, or a simple calendar.


Tracking your progress helps keep you accountable to the deadlines you've set.It also helps you see the progress you've made as you move through the process. This can help you stay motivated to keep making progress.

Know your rights.",How to Select a Headstone1," Each cemetery has its own set of rules and regulations for the size and type of headstones that can be erected. While large headstones might be accepted by some cemeteries, others have strict rules that limit a headstone’s size.Call the cemetery where you will be interring your loved one and ask them if there are size limitations on headstones.;
, Many cemeteries strictly monitor the type of headstone you can erect or the material from which it is constructed. For example, there are cemeteries that allow only bronze or granite headstones.


Try calling the cemetery and ask them if there are any restrictions on the type of headstone or headstone construction materials.

, While some cemeteries offer installation services, others will require that you hire a local monument installer to safely erect the headstone. Be sure to inquire about installation costs if this is a service the cemetery offers.If the cemetery doesn’t offer installation services, use the yellow pages or internet to locate a local monuments installer.

, Many cemeteries charge a variety of fees for installation of the monument, perpetual care, and other add-on services. Some may try to tell you that they are the only ones who can install a headstone in the cemetery, but this may just be a way to dissuade customers from using an outside source and thus increase internal revenue. If a cemetery tells you that gravestones from outside sources are not allowed, ask them to show you their by-laws."

Familiarize yourself with headstone designs and materials.,
Set a budget.,
Select a supplier.,
Decide on what type of headstone you want.,
Choose a headstone material.,
Choose a headstone finish.",How to Select a Headstone2," Take a walk through several cemeteries to get an idea of the shapes, sizes, materials, and designs available. Use this to develop a rough idea of what kind of headstone you want.


Try taking photos that you can show to the cemetery, funeral home, or monument dealer.

, Selecting, purchasing, and installing a headstone can be expensive. Knowing what your budget is before you visit a monument dealer, funeral home, or cemetery can cut back on unneeded stress and help you make a decision you feel good about.The average cost of a tombstone is between $1500 and $2000.Did your loved one set aside money for funeral expenses? If so, determine what part of this fund can be used toward purchasing a headstone.

, Headstones can be purchased from cemeteries, funeral homes, monument dealers, and the internet. Take time to explore your options and make sure the supplier has headstones that meet your guidelines. Cemeteries tend to have the highest prices, followed by monument dealers and funeral homes. Internet dealers can be more budget friendly.Talk to friends and family to get referrals for headstone suppliers in your area. Ask about the company's dependability and integrity.
If shopping on the internet for a headstone, be sure to carefully read all customer reviews.

, Headstones come in a variety of types and styles including upright, flat, and kerbed. An upright headstone is a popular, yet traditional design and is usually made from granite, marble, or limestone. A flat headstone is usually made of granite or bronze.


If you are seeking a more personalized expression in a headstone, try a kerbed headstone.

, The material out of which a headstone is crafted affects its longevity and durability. It also contributes to the overall aesthetics of the headstone.


Choose granite for overall adaptability and price as it comes in many colors and is generally on the lower end of the price scale.
Avoid limestone if you are concerned about weathering over time, as this will affect the readability of the stone’s inscriptions.

, The finish you choose for the headstone will affect its durability and appearance over time. Some cemeteries forbid polished headstones because of their reflectiveness, but partially polished, honed, and pitched headstones are all good choices for long term durability.Try a honed finish to give depth to a tombstone with three or more colors.
For a rustic look, go for a pitched finish. Created with a hammer and bolster, headstones with pitched finished often appear in older cemeteries.

Ask for proofs.",How to Select a Headstone3," An epitaph can say many things, ranging from details about a person’s life to a quote from religious text. Some might detail the circumstances of a loved one’s death, while others celebrate their life with words from the deceased’s favorite author. Consider your loved one’s personality, life achievements, and style when choosing an epitaph.Consider the size of the monument and the associated font size when choosing an epitaph. For example, a small headstone might not fit the entire religious verse you wish to include.

, The font in which the epitaph and information about your loved one including their name, birthdate, and date of death is inscribed is an important consideration in the overall design of a headstone.Try using a Roman or Old English font for a traditional look.
Reserve italics for epitaphs, including quotes, religious text, and poetry.

, While some families will choose a headstone with strictly text, others may want to include images such as religious iconography, animals, or flowers. These images can reflect your loved one’s tastes, life accomplishments, and religious affiliation.


Most suppliers will have a fairly sizeable library of artwork from which you can choose images for the headstone.

, Once a design is chosen and you have paid the supplier a deposit, they will send you a proof of the headstone to be approved by you and your family. Make sure you go through this important step to avoid ending up with a headstone that meets your expectations. Once you approve the proofs, the supplier will manufacture the headstone.If you don’t like the first proof, ask for another rendering. Most suppliers will provide you with two or three proofs before adding on additional charges.
If the supplier you are working with does not offer a proof, you might want to consider another supplier.

While you may be afraid of telling them for fear of scaring them or upsetting them, it is better for them to hear it from you than on the grapevine - or worse: at your funeral.;
, A local garden or your own home are good choices. It helps to be seated as this is never the stuff of strong legs. Include coffee or a pot of tea to ease dry throats and provide a source of distracting comfort.

, Recall that you have had both good and bad times together and have always pulled through and that now you have some news to tell that you want your friend to hear with good grace and understanding.

, Do not beat around the bush but use clear language. Tell your friend ""Betsy, I have lung cancer and the doctor says it is inoperable. I am dying. They have given me three months to live.""

, Your emotions will be hard to control because you are telling a good friend you know you won't be talking to in a few months' time. Use hugs and holding of hands as a sign of deep connection. At a time like this, often no more words are needed but a great deal of comfort is essential. At this point, there is no rulebook or how-to - you will both do what feels right at the moment.

, Your friend is in shock and may say things that don't quite gel with your needs or interests. Just listen and let it flow out; it'll become quite clear later to your friend what she or he has said in moments of un clarity. Your own emotions will be turbulent but it is best to try to not think ""but I'm the one who's dying"". This doesn't change anything and will only embitter you.

, Your friend will want to help and it is always a good idea to have something in mind for your friend to do.

Sort out your own feelings first.,

Understand your child’s developmental level.,
Avoid euphemisms.,
Explain that death is permanent.,
Let your child know that death is inevitable.,
Reassure your child.,
Be prepared for detailed questions.",How to Talk to Your Children About Death1," Before you talk to your child, you’ll need to take care of your own grief. If your feelings are still too raw, you may be unable to help your child process her experience safely. Talk to others who can help you process your own feelings of sadness to avoid overwhelming your child.If you feel uncomfortable talking about death, your child will notice this. Try to come to the topic with a clear and open mind.
It’s okay to show sadness and emotions. However, if your feelings about death are too raw, your child may be more upset by your feelings than the death itself.;
, Talk to your child in the car, before dinner, or before bedtime when she's most receptive to slowing down and having a conversation together. Bring up the topic in a direct and straightforward manner, saying, for example, ""I want to talk to you about Grandma.""Let your child know that you're interested in her feelings and her thoughts.
Make sure you have your own feelings under control when you bring up the topic. Don't bring it up at a time when you're feeling stressed, upset, or tired.

, Infants and toddlers won’t be able to understand a conversation, but will react to their parents’ emotional state. Starting at around age 3, you can talk to your child using clear, concrete language. School-aged children should receive simple, honest explanations about what happened to cause the death. Older children and teens may be able to understand death as well as an adult, but may have difficulty expressing their feelings about it.Be aware that children and young people grieve in a more sporadic manner than adults do. Their feelings may veer abruptly from sadness to excitement.
Your child may be processing his feelings through his play, so be watchful and alert for any signs that he’s trying to communicate in unexpected ways.
Remember that you are the best interpreter of your child’s communication. You’ll know whether he likes to communicate through his drawings, his play, or by having conversations.

, Children are literal in their understanding of words. Many common euphemisms for death are confusing and frightening when taken literally. For example, don’t say the dead have “gone to sleep”, “gone to a better place,” or “passed away” as this will likely result in fear for your child.It can help some children to know that these are words that other people might use to mean death, but don’t substitute them for the word death itself.
You can show other concrete examples of death: the death of a flower, a plant, or a pet. Use these examples to show your child the consistent facts of a death: final, inevitable, and natural.

, Whether it’s the death of a person or a goldfish, your child won’t see the dead living again. What death means primarily is that you won’t see the person (or pet) again. It also means that the dead won’t experience any more sadness or pain, and you can reassure your child of this.Some religious explanations about afterlife can be confusing for children to sort through.
It’s likely that your child may need reminders that she won’t see the dead again. Expect questions such as “Will ____ be there?” or when the dead will be coming back.

, If your child is school-aged, she may be able to understand that death is final, but she might not know that it’s inevitable. It will help your child if you’re able to provide simple and honest explanations for the death.Make sure your child knows that the death isn’t because of something she did or didn’t do.
Talking to your child about the cause of the death will be helpful. The more your child knows about the reason for the death, the less likely she will be to blame herself.
If your child is too young to understand the exact cause of death, you can explain it using terms she might understand. For example, you could explain that her body wasn’t working anymore, and couldn’t get fixed.

, After all, not everyone who gets sick will die. Remind him of a time he was sick and got better. Make a list of all the people who he loves who are not sick, so that he’s comforted that he won’t be left alone. This can be a good opportunity to remind him how many people care for him.Don’t be surprised if your child becomes clingier or needier at this time.
If your child is older, he may distance himself from you instead. Don’t get angry at him, but continue to hold the same standards of behavior you expected prior to the conversation about death.
Encourage your children to express how they feel, no matter what age they are.

, Children may have questions that you didn’t expect, such as “What’s it like inside a coffin?” or whether it dark and cold under the ground. These questions aren’t intended to be disrespectful, but reflect a child’s attention towards the concrete. Answer each question as best you can.If you don’t know the answer to your child’s question, you should say so. If there’s a way to find out the answer through research, you and your child can engage in the research together.
Your child’s questions might be less abstract and philosophical than they first appear. For example, a child asking about where the dead person is now might not need a lengthy explanation of the afterlife, but simply need to be reassured that the body is buried in the cemetery.Because your child is unlikely to sit and talk with you for a long time, be alert for these questions to pop up in other contexts.

Don’t joke around or talk about frivolous topics. Remember that you are there to show your respect for the dead and to comfort the deceased’s family and friends.A mourner is usually considered a spouse, parent, sibling, or child of the deceased.;
, It is very important in Jewish law for mourners to be allowed to grieve fully, especially in the days directly following the death of their loved one. During this time, it is customary to allow the person mourning to initiate conversations so that they may grieve in their own way, alone if they want or with others if that is what they choose., When you are calling on friends or family during their period of mourning, it is important to allow them to fully express their grief during this time. Thus, it is inappropriate to change the topic or to avoid conversation about the deceased in general.You should encourage the mourner to talk about the deceased if they want to.
You can relate fond memories of the deceased or other positive topics, but do not bring up anything that would cause more grief for the mourner.

, These kinds of standard responses to grief minimize the mourner’s emotions during their time of great grief. You should avoid saying things like this because the mourner may feel like you are simply trying to placate them.Some examples of things to avoid include “Everything happens for a reason” or “Time heals all wounds.”

, As you take your leave of the mourners you are visiting, it is customary to utter some traditional words (often called the Condolence Declaration). This is all part of the ceremony of supporting a mourner during their time of grief.The traditional Condolence Declaration when leaving a house of mourning is “May the Almighty comfort you with all the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.”

, The Jewish family of the deceased person ""sit Shiva"" at their home. Shiva lasts for seven days and is not allowed on Shabbat, which is from Friday at sundown to Saturday at sundown.Sitting Shiva is not simply a social call. The purpose of your visit is to show the mourner that you are concerned about their distress in this time of grief.

, Some people become worried about whether or not they should attend Shiva – if they are “close enough” to warrant an appearance. However, showing up at a Jewish house of mourning is the most powerful thing you can do to show you care during this difficult time.Don’t ring the doorbell; just walk in. Doors are usually left open during Shiva.

, If the family is Chabad or Orthodox, they cover their mirrors and take off their shoes, and they don't work. Friends come to their home to provide help and support and even help them with their daily chores.Mourners sit in low chairs, stools, or on the floor. Family and friends can sit in the regular chairs.
Mourners typically don’t cut their hair, shower, or change their clothes during Shiva.

, Traditionally, a group of Jewish men get together at the Shiva and say a prayer called Kaddish. In the Conservative and Reform movements, Jewish women generally are counted as part of the minyan (a group of ten Jewish adults) necessary to say Kaddish. It is a great honor if you can help out to make sure there are ten adult Jews available at the Shiva every day., For a period of 30 days after the burial, there is another period of mourning called shloshim. During this time, mourners are not supposed to attend parties or other celebrations. They also should not cut their hair, shave, or listen to music.If you are a friend of a mourner, you should respect their grieving by not inviting them to parties during this period of shloshim.

, Sometimes after the funeral (about up to a year later), the family and friends return to the cemetery plot for the gravestone to be placed upon it. There is a veil covering the person's name, so they have an “unveiling” memorial ceremony for the deceased person.The unveiling ceremony customarily includes a recitation of Psalms, a brief eulogy, removing the cloth from the headstone, a recitation of the El Maleh Rahamim prayer, and the Kiddish prayer (if at least ten people are present).

, One year after the death of the deceased (on the anniversary of their death), mourners and friends can remember the deceased by practicing Yahrzeit. During this ceremony, the sons of the deceased recite Kaddish and take an Aliyah (read from the Torah).This ceremony should take place in a synagogue, if possible.

Encourage your child to express his feelings.,
Help children hold onto memories.,
Share your values with your child.,
Look for children’s books that help explain death.",How to Talk to Your Children About Death2," Children may express their feelings indirectly, through their play or artwork. They might try to hide their feelings, particularly if they’re older children or teens. Your child might become more irritable, or suddenly seem younger than her age.Accept whatever feelings your child might have about the death. Let your child know that it’s fine for her to feel happy, sad, confused, scared, or angry.
No matter what she feels, you should reassure her that she is safe and cared for.
If your child’s feelings cause you to be upset, she’ll be more likely to hide her feelings from you.

, It can help your child in the grieving process to remember the good times with the dead. Try making a photo album or storybook including pictures and memories of the dead in happier times.Remember that grieving isn’t about forgetting, but about processing the loss of a special friend or animal.
Looking at pictures, remembering stories or writing them down is one way of keeping the connection with the dead person or pet alive as your child gets used to the fact of their absence.

, If you have religious beliefs, share them with your child in a way that your child can understand. For example, if you want to tell your child that her grandmother is “in heaven,” be prepared to say more about that.If your religious tradition has special observances, services, or rituals surrounding death, you should include your child in these preparations.
Ask a leader in your religious community for help in explaining your faith tradition’s ideas regarding death.

, If you read regularly to your child, you might consider reading books that talk directly about death. This is a safe way for you and your child to share this information together, through the familiar routine of reading.Books that have been written to help explain death and loss to children include:

Don't assume that your child doesn't know about it.,
Listen to what your child thinks and feels.,
Model healthy grieving.,
Acknowledge that bad things happen.",How to Talk to Your Children About Death3," School shootings, acts of war and terrorism, as well as community violence are commonplace in the media. Children are alert to violence reported in the news, and may want to ask questions. Not talking about it doesn't help a child feel better, or gain understanding.If you avoid the subject, you're communicating that the topic is ""taboo"" even if you don't intend to.
Instead, allow yourself to be available to talk about anything your child brings up. Be available to help your child process her feelings about these events.
It's okay to try to limit your child's exposure to negative news stories. Research studies have shown that children who see repeated instances of the same news story may assume that the incident has happened again.
Even with limited exposure, don't assume that you can prevent your child from learning about bad news altogether.

, By being available to listen to what your child feels about these events, you're communicating that her thoughts and feelings are normal and safe. At the same time, you might be able to put any unrealistic fears into perspective.Ask direct questions to find out more about your child's perspective on these incidents, rather than waiting for your child to approach you.
Don't force your child to talk to you about feelings if she's not ready to.

, It can help your child to feel less alone if she knows that you're also feeling upset in the aftermath of a tragedy. Children often look to adults to know what's okay to feel about something. If you're able to show your emotions, your child will learn that even difficult feelings are okay.Healthy grieving involves balancing internal processing of feelings, paired with coping within your day-to-day life.
It's a good idea to model gentleness with your own feelings, as well as those of your child.
Recognize that there's no ""right"" way to grieve.

, Even though it's sad, it's true that people sometimes die for reasons that no one really understands. Make sure you reassure her often that many people are working hard to keep her safe, including you and other adults, including teachers and police.Talk to your child's school to learn specific ways that the school keeps the children safe.
Point out instances where safety measures have worked effectively.

Ask for help.,
Get up before the kids.,
Stay calm.,
Get chores done the night before.,
Keep breakfast simple.",How to Set a Morning Routine As a Working Parent1," If you have a spouse or partner, talk about how you might divvy up the responsibilities in the morning. Maybe your spouse can make breakfast while you get the kids dressed. This can not only help the morning go more smoothly, because you're not trying to tackle everything on your own, it may also give both of you a little ""me"" time to prepare yourself for the day ahead.


Even if your spouse goes to work very early, they may be able to help you by making the kid's lunches, setting out the cereal and bowls for their breakfast, cleaning up the house a little, and so on.;
, A sure-fire way to sabotage your morning is to have the kids coming at you full-force when you first wake up. One way to combat that is to get up before they do. Doing so allows you to have some time to yourself to take care of your needs, before you have to start addressing the needs of your little ones.


Use this time to meditate, read a book, take a shower, watch TV, or just sit with your cup of coffee. Even if you only have 30 minutes to yourself, you’ll likely notice that it makes a huge difference in your mood and stress levels, and how the morning goes., Although this is easier said than done, staying calm during the rush out of the door can make your morning dramatically better. Children play off of the energy of their parents, and if they find you upset and stressed, your negative energy may rub off on them. When you stay level-headed and stress-free, the kids will tend to mirror your mood.


If you find yourself getting upset, take time to breathe. Go into the bathroom or somewhere else you can be alone, close your eyes, and take a few deep breaths. Or simply count to 10. Taking a moment to let yourself wind down can make the morning go a whole lot smoother., One of the most difficult parts of the morning is having time to do everything. You can give yourself a great head-start by getting some of your chores done the night before. Not feeling the rush and pressure of having to do everything right after you wake up can dramatically improve your morning routine.


For instance, pick out what you are going to wear to work the night before. Do the same for your kids, including their shoes and socks. Pack yours and their lunches and have bookbags and work bags ready and waiting by the door. Getting this done the night before relieves some of the mental and physical stress your morning may normally include., Preparing breakfast and having your kids eat it in a timely manner is often difficult. However, when you make this meal as simple as possible, you can shave off minutes — and lots of stress — from your morning plate. Do this by preparing as much as you can the night before, and making the meal easy to create.


For instance, pull out a bowl, spoon, and box of cereal on the counter so that it is ready when you need it. You can do the same with toast or bagels, as well. Having it out there and waiting allows you to prepare it quickly.
If your drink coffee in the morning, buy a coffee maker with a timer. You can put the grounds in the night before and wake up to freshly brewed coffee without having to lift a finger.
Additionally, consider portable breakfasts like sandwiches or waffles if your kids struggle to eat before you leave. Doing this allows them to eat while on their way to school. However, you may want to use this option only on rushed mornings since on-the-go breakfast options tend to be less healthy. Also, sitting down for meals instills better habits."
"
Ensure they are getting enough sleep.,
Provide choices.,
Give time warnings.,
Use incentives to get them moving.,
Do something fun on the weekend.",How to Set a Morning Routine As a Working Parent2," It doesn’t take a genius to know that a tired kid is often one that is cranky. You may not know it, but your kids might not get the adequate amount of sleep they need in order to be happy and able to focus at school. Consult with your child’s doctor about the appropriate amount of sleep they need if you’re not sure.


In order for your child to get enough sleep, you may have to start putting them to bed earlier. Although this can be challenging, you can get it done by putting them to bed sooner and sooner over time. Eventually, they will get used to it and likely respond better to the morning rush.According to the National Sleep Foundation, preschoolers should get about 11 to 13 hours each night and kids ages six to thirteen should sleep at least nine to 11 hours. Older kids' sleep schedules can be set at your own discretion., Just about every parent knows how rough it can be to get your child to do what you want; however, if you give them options on how to get the job done while still getting the same outcome, you may find that your morning routine becomes a lot less stressful. Giving them a choice helps them to feel more in control, and in turn, often more cooperative.


For example, if your child doesn’t like to brush their teeth first thing in the morning, allow them to eat their breakfast first. Or, if they don’t want to put their shoes on while they are getting dressed, let them do it right before they walk out of the door. Giving them this little bit of control creates the same end result, and can reduce the amount of stress you feel., Moving from one task to the next without any warning is often difficult for a child. When you make your child stop what they are doing abruptly without preparing them for what is to come can result in a temper tantrum. Instead, give them a heads-up that they need to finish what they are working on and move on to the next task.


For example, you could say, “You have two minutes to finish playing that game before we go to school.” Allowing time to prepare themselves can make the transition easier for everyone involved., If your child is consistently slow-moving and resistant to the morning routine, use something to entice them to get them going. Just simply getting done only so they can go to school isn’t usually enough motivation. Giving them a reward, however, can be what it takes to get them moving.


For example, you could say, “After you get dressed, you can play with your toys until it’s time to leave.” Using this type of reward could get them to accomplish what they need to do without the argument.You may be able to bring a sense of fun to the chaos by turning morning tasks into a game. If your kids love playing pretend, you may come up with a character who must do their chores. Or give them their own kid-sized cleaning tools to help, like a scrub brush that is their size to clean off their breakfast dishes. Or you can make it a race to see who can be ready and waiting by the door first, dressed and with all their things packed. The winner gets to pick what you have for dessert that night.

, Entice your kids to stick to the schedule during the week so that they can relax on the weekend. Although you don’t want to get too far away from your routine, you can slow things down so that they don’t feel rushed. Looking forward to this special time may encourage your kids to cooperate during the weekday mornings.


For instance, you still want your little ones to get enough sleep on Saturday and Sunday; however, you can create a weekend routine that doesn’t include rushing out of the door. You can make a special breakfast on the weekend or enjoy a family activity, such as reading the paper or watching cartoons."
"
Be realistic.,
Create a chart.,
Build in time for connecting.",How to Set a Morning Routine As a Working Parent3," Running your morning on a tight schedule will likely only end in disaster. Instead of setting yourself up for failure by trying to get a lot done in a short amount of time, give yourself and your kids some extra time. Creating a schedule that seems impossible to complete likely is, and will only cause extra stress for you and your kids., Seeing what is expected of them may help your kids get their tasks accomplished. Make a chart that lists out what needs to get done and set it in a place your children can easily see. Allow them to check off or put a sticker by what they accomplish.


For instance, you could list “get dressed,” “brush your teeth,” “make your bed,” “go to the bathroom,” and “eat breakfast” on the chart. Allowing them to check off what they accomplished gives them incentive to get the job done. You can up the ante by giving them rewards at the end of the week if they get all of their tasks accomplished without arguing about it.This can also help them feel a sense of accomplishment when they get things done and teach them responsibility.

, Getting out of bed and starting your day immediately may be ideal for you, but most kids just can’t handle that. They need time to adjust and attempting to force them into getting ready right away will likely result in a reluctant child and melt down. Instead, set aside a few minutes each morning to allow them to wake up.


For example, you may want to start the day by reading a book or two to them in their bed. Or you may want to simply cuddle with them on the couch."

Seek support.",How to Set Healthy Boundaries About Helping Others," Arrange to meet the other person in a private, non-distracting location. Choose a time when you and the other person are relaxed and calm.Avoid having this talk when you’re feeling annoyed or frustrated. You might speak more harshly than you intended to, making the situation worse.
When you tell someone about your new boundaries for the first time, it’s best to talk face-to-face, instead of over email or text.;
, Bring up any behaviors that have been bothering you. Be honest, even if you feel embarrassed about asserting yourself.For instance, you could say, “I want to support you, but our conversations have been wearing me down lately. It’s hard for me to focus on your problems all the time.”

, Tell the other person what you need from them. Keep your request as simple and brief as you can.Say something like, “During the week I need time alone to unwind, so I need you to stop coming by my apartment every night. It’s okay if you visit on the weekends, though.”

, Avoid accusing the other person of anything. Instead, take a constructive approach to the conversation. Talk to the other person as if you’re looking for a solution together.By putting a positive spin on the conversation, you may be able to avoid making the other person feel bad, and they will probably cooperate with you more readily.
Watch your body language. Avoid crossing your arms in favor of letting them hang loosely at your sides.
Use ""I"" statements rather than ""you"" statements to minimize them becoming defensive. For instance, say ""I feel overwhelmed."" instead of ""You make me overwhelmed.""

, Communication goes both ways. After communicating your needs, be sure to ask the other person about how they feel or think about the matter. This can help create more collaborative solutions to everyone's needs while also reaffirming that your own needs have been heard.

You might ask, ""What do you think?""
When they respond, avoid feeling defensive. Instead, keep using I-statements, and let them know that you are listening. You might say, ""I hear what you are saying. Perhaps we need to work out a solution together.""

, If you always said yes to requests in the past, it may take a while for other people to get used to your boundaries. When someone asks for more help than you can give, gently remind them of the conversation you had with them, and tell them again why you can’t agree to their request.It’s fine to say something like, “I wish I could help, but like I told you last week, I’m already so busy at work that I can’t commit to anything else right now.”
Don’t assume that people are intentionally disrespecting your boundaries – they may have simply forgotten.

, Other people will respect your boundaries as much as you respect them yourself. By sticking to the boundaries you decided on, you’ll give others the message that you’re serious, and they’ll stop asking for things you can’t deliver.It’s OK to be flexible about your boundaries. Relationships are fluid, and circumstances change. But if you decide to make an exception, be clear about why you’re doing it, and don’t let it become the norm.

, Some people may try to make you feel guilty because they feel entitled to your help. Recognize this for the manipulation tactic it is. Setting boundaries you’re comfortable with is your right, not something you have to apologize for.As you practice standing up for yourself, it will become easier to maintain your boundaries without feeling guilty about it.
To make it easier, bite down on your lip after you have delivered your message. This is a physical reminder not to ramble on with explanations or justifications. State your case and wait for their response.
You do not need to justify yourself or give excuses for your decisions. If someone keeps bothering you, just repeatedly say ""No"" or end the conversation.

, If a friend or family member refuses to acknowledge your boundaries or tries to manipulate you into doing what they want, think about whether you’d be better off cutting ties with that person. Someone who doesn’t care about your well-being may not deserve a place in your life.If you decide the relationship isn't worth keeping, you might tell the person, ""I have enjoyed spending time with you, but I can't continue to be friends with someone who refuses to respect my boundaries.""
If the person isn't someone you can distance yourself from, let them know that not respecting your boundaries will have consequences. For example, you might say to your sister, ""If you cannot respect my privacy, I will stop confiding in you. I want us to be able to share, but I also do not want my business spread throughout the family.""

, Remind yourself that your physical and emotional needs are just as important as everyone else’s. Taking care of yourself isn’t selfish – it’s your right.Taking good care of yourself makes you better able to help others as well.
If you’re used to putting everybody else first, it may take some time to make this mental shift. Be patient with yourself, and remind yourself that you have nothing to feel guilty about.

, Take a few minutes to think about and write down the things you value most. Defining your priorities in life will guide you towards creating good boundaries.For instance, your values might include things like honesty, good communication, and spending time with family.

, Look over your list of values and priorities again. Based on this list, consider whether there’s anything you’re not comfortable doing or any issues you refuse to budge on.The things you’re not willing to compromise on are your personal boundaries.
For instance, if integrity is one of the things you value most, you might decide that you can’t keep doing your friend’s homework for her, even if she’s afraid of failing the class without your help.

, Does a friend or family member routinely ask for more than you can give? If you often feel burned out or taken for granted, think about what boundaries you can set to protect yourself.For instance, if you’re feeling overburdened because your friend asks you to watch her kids every weekend, you could set a boundary by telling her you can’t babysit any more.

, Make a plan for meeting your own physical and emotional needs, and commit to it. Setting and maintaining healthy boundaries is easier when you’re in the habit of taking care of yourself.Take care of your body by eating well, exercising, and getting enough rest.
Making time for hobbies and relaxation helps you stay emotionally healthy.

, Setting boundaries with those you love can be taxing. Although boundaries are essential in forming healthy relationships, the process may be challenging to navigate. Reach out for support from friends and family members who understand and value you during this process.For instance, if you have a trusted coworker who understands your need for boundary-setting with a friend, you might share your progress and ask the person to help hold you accountable.

Know the law.,
Shop around for funeral services.,
Decline embalming.,
Pick an affordable casket.,
Save on flowers.,
Find an affordable person to lead the memorial service.,
Shop around for a headstone, burial vault, and/or grave liner.",How to Reduce Funeral Expenses," Perhaps the first step you need to take is to research the cost of a traditional burial. Traditional, casket-based, burials are the way that most Americans choose to be buried. Remember that:


This option will usually be the most expensive. Costs can and often do exceed $10,000, however, depending on what you pick, simple traditional burials can be done for less than $4,000.
Traditional burials require a place for your loved one to be buried. If you do not already have a pre-purchased plot in a cemetery, this could add a considerable cost.
There are no laws that require traditional burial. However, you should consider the last wishes of your loved one as well as their religious and spiritual affiliation.;
, Cremation is an excellent alternative to traditional burial and offers a number of benefits in terms of cost. As a result, any budget minded person should consider cremation as a worthwhile option. When thinking about cremation, remember:


Prices are substantially less than those for a full burial. While traditional burials could cost $10,000 or more, the average cost of a cremation is between $2,000 and $4,000. The price disparity is because you are saving money on a casket, embalming, and a variety of other products and services.
Normally the funeral home will make the necessary arrangements for you and will call you when the remains are ready to be picked up.
One way to save even more money on a cremation is to arrange it directly through a crematory, rather than through a funeral home.
Several companies offer already made, or custom-made, urns. Do comparison shopping for the best price. Urns can cost from as little as $100 to several thousand.
You may want to forgo the urn and, instead, scatter the ashes in a special location., Donating your loved one’s body to medical research is an important option to consider. Donation to medical research will both benefit the larger society and help enable you avoid the huge cost of a cremation or burial.


You should consider your loved one’s thoughts on donation to medical science. Many people who want to be donated to science put a stipulation in their will or will otherwise inform friends and family of their wishes.
If you (or your deceased loved one) favor/favored this option, you can contact your local university of hospital to see if it is a realistic possibility.
This is by far the cheapest option. Normally the only cost of donation is transportation. After that, you just have to choose and plan a memorial service., Depending on your choice of a final resting place, your budget will vary widely. Ultimately, though, your budget will in effect act as a guideline for every other step you take after establishing it. As a result of this, figuring out a budget should be your first priority when you begin the process of planning a funeral.


Keep in mind that the lowest possible cost for a funeral will be between $1,000 and $2,000. This will cover the bare minimum: the cost of caring for, transporting, and cremating your loved one (if you choose those options).
Take into account any life insurance, burial insurance, or other money the deceased has left behind or specifically earmarked for their final expenses.
Think about what you can realistically afford.
Figure out if other friends or family want to or are able to contribute to your loved one’s final expenses., After you’ve set your budget, you need to decide what type of funeral you want to have. During this decision-making process you’ll determine the several things about the funeral. You’ll consider:


Whether the funeral should be open to the public.
Whether you will advertise the funeral publically.
If you want to have a long or a short service.
Whether you want to have just a memorial service at a place other than the cemetery (this makes a lot of sense if you choose to donate the body to science).
The wishes of the deceased.
The cheapest funerals/memorial services tend to be simple, private, and held at the graveside or at someone's home., After deciding the type of funeral you want to have, you should decide where you want to have the actual funeral or memorial service for your loved one. The location of a funeral can (depending on certain factors) be a substantial part of the cost of a funeral, so it is important that you consider this early on. Think about:


If you want to hold the service at your loved one’s church, synagogue, or other place of worship. In most cases, these locations will be at low or no cost.
If you want or need to have the funeral far away from home. If you need to travel to bury your loved one, or if the majority of your family lives in one place far away, this might add considerable expense in terms of transporting your loved one.
If you want to hold the memorial service at a funeral home. Often times, funeral homes will allow you to hold a service there for no cost or for a very low cost.
If you want to hold a simple memorial service at your home or a simple graveside funeral. These are in many cases the cheapest options., The Federal Trade Commission has laws that govern funeral homes and related professionals. Before you even begin to consult with funeral professionals, you should know the laws that govern them and protect you as a consumer.


Funeral directors are required to give you itemized quotes in person. If you are communicating over the phone, you have to ask for prices explicitly.
You are not required to purchase packages from funeral professionals. You are allowed to purchase items individually.
If any items is required by law, the funeral professional must be able to reference the specific law.
You are allowed to bring your own casket, and you don’t have to pay a related service or handling fee.
You are not required to purchase a casket for cremation.
Before viewing caskets, funeral professionals should give you a list of caskets and prices., After you’ve determined your budget and what sort of funeral you want to have, you need to begin to shop around for funeral services. For the vast majority of people, it is impossible to do without the services of a funeral home, as they accept delivery of the body, prepare the body, and coordinate many aspects of the funeral.


Funeral homes, as one of the main purveyors of all funeral-related services, serve as the highest costs of any funeral. One of the easiest ways to save money on a funeral is to shop around for funeral homes and services.
Call several funeral homes in your area and ask them to provide you with a list of charges.
Try websites which will allow you to receive estimates from providers.
Check out the Funeral Consumers Alliance website which will help you make important decisions about funeral related costs., Embalming is the process in which morticians use chemicals to help preserve your loved one. Embalming is often done to slow the deterioration of the recently deceased in order to make an open casket possible at funerals. As a result, depending on your budget and wishes, you can opt out of embalming.


If you opt out of embalming, you will most likely not be able to have an open casket.
Declining embalming can make the cost of a funeral substantially lower.
If you opt out of embalming, you will most likely need to hold a memorial service and bury the deceased within 1-3 days of death.
You do not need to embalm if you choose cremation or donate your loved one’s body to medical science., One of the most expensive single items when it comes to funerals are the caskets (if you choose to go with a traditional burial). When making decisions about burying a loved one, many people think that they need to spend a lot on a casket to show a final act of love. This is not true. Pick a casket that is in your budget and is affordable.


Avoid “gasketed caskets.” These caskets are designed to seal better than regular caskets. While gasketing the casket only costs the funeral home a nominal amount of money, it could cost you hundreds of dollars.
Pick a respectable casket that is in your price range.
Buy your casket from a wholesaler or online. While your funeral home might not be happy, this could save you a lot of money.
Let the sales person know you are on a budget, but don’t divulge your budget., Flowers are another major expense when it comes to funerals. While you may want the memorial service/funeral for your loved one to be beautiful and memorable, the cost of extravagant flowers may hurt you in the pocket. Remember, you can have a wonderful and memorable funeral without breaking the bank. Make sure the flowers you choose fit into your budget.


Pick flowers that are in season and available locally.
Track down the flowers yourself, instead of having the funeral home supply them.
Decline the funeral home’s flower package. Chances are, they’ll charge you substantially more than you’d pay if you hired a florist or brought in the flowers yourself., While the cost (“gratuity”) of a minister or other religious/spiritual leader may not be that much, it is an important cost to consider when trying to plan a funeral on a budget. When finding a minister or someone to lead the service, consider:


Your loved one might have known a minister, rabbi, or another spiritual leader who will be happy to speak at or lead the service free of charge.
The cost of someone to lead the service might be between one hundred and three hundred dollars, depending on region.
If you are on a really tight budget, lead the service yourself and recruit friends and loved ones to help and to share remarks., One of the last substantial costs you need to consider when arranging for your loved one’s final expenses is the cost of the headstone, burial vault, and/or the grave liner. Make sure to shop around for these purchases. Consider:


Typical flat grave markers may cost $1,000 or more.
Average upright headstones can cost up to $10,000. However, simple headstones often average between $1,000 and $3,000.
Burial vaults (above ground structures or below ground structures) can cost $10,000 or much more.
Grave liners are concrete structures placed in the ground to prevent the ground from subsiding as the casket deteriorates over time. Grave liners can cost up to $1,000. Talk to independent vendors for competitive prices on grave liners.
While your funeral home may sell you a headstone or burial vault, you should definitely shop around and contact wholesalers and other independent vendors in order to save money."

The person you’re with will appreciate the fact that you’re being honest and open and won’t want you to act like nothing is wrong. That said, you should still treat your loved one with kindness and make sure to be sensitive to his or her needs. You may be at a loss for words, but when you’re in doubt, make sure you say something that makes your loved one feel better, as much as that is possible.


Some people and cultures are uncomfortable talking about dying. If your loved one feels that way, avoid discussing death.;
, Another thing you can do when you talk to your loved one is to ask how you can make the day easier. This can mean running some simple errands, making a phone call or two, or even getting a snack for the person. Maybe your loved one wants a hand massage or just to hear a funny joke; don’t be afraid to ask about what you can do to ease the pain. Your loved one may feel like asking you to help out even more would be a burden, so you can take the initiative and ask yourself. If the person really doesn’t want help, accept it and move on.

, Your loved one may want to start talking about an old memory or may have a story or an idea to share. You should encourage him or her to talk, even if the subject matter is painful or serious. Just be there for them and let them know that you care about what they have to say. If they’re not thinking clearly or losing their train of thought, then you can be there to help out. Encourage the person by making eye contact and asking the right questions after he or she speaks.If the person is really making him or herself agitated by talking, you can talk about slowing down a bit or taking a break. But in general, talking is the person’s right, so allow them to take the lead.

, While you should be honest and open with the person who is dying, you can also hold back when it’s necessary. Sometimes being too honest will only lead the dying person to feel your pain and to feel a loss of control because he or she can’t do anything to stop it. If your mother asks you if you and your brother are still feuding, for example, it may be best to say that you’re patching things up even if you’re only just working on it; in these cases, offering a bit of relief may be better than the brutal truth.


When you look back on these white lies, you won’t regret telling them. However, you may regret being too honest when the moment would have been better if a white lie was given.

, You may think that everything has to be solemn when a person is dying, but your loved one may have other plans. Maybe he or she just wants to spend the final days laughing, talking about college football, or telling hilarious old stories. If you’re trying to make everything serious, then the dying person may wish you could change the topic to brighten the mood once in a while. It's okay to make jokes, tell the story of a funny thing that happened to you that morning, or ask if your loved one is in the mood for comedy. Lightening the mood can bring some joy to the tense situation., The sense of hearing is often the last sense to go when people pass away. You may feel like there’s no sense of talking to the person if he or she is in a coma or just resting, but your loved one may very well hear the words you’re saying. Just the sound of your voice will bring peace and comfort. Say what’s on your mind, even if you're unsure if it will be heard. Your words alone will make a difference, even if the person you’re talking to doesn’t respond right away or may not be able to hear you., If your loved one is reaching the very end, he or she may suffer from a hallucination due to medication or disorientation. If this is the case, then there are two things you can do. If the person is seeing something unpleasant and is afraid or pained by it, you can gently try to coax that person into reality by saying it’s not really there; but if the person is seeing something pleasant and seems happy about the vision, then there’s no sense in telling the person that he or she is hallucinating; just let the person be comforted., Many people feel like they should say the ultimate right words that show their love for the person who is dying while bringing peace. While this is a nice thought, if you spend all of your time trying to form the perfect words, then you may find yourself at a loss. It's more important that you just start talking without feeling too self-conscious, and make it clear how much you love and care about the person.

, You may think that the best you can do for a dying person is to offer words of comfort, but in fact, sometimes the best thing you do is offer a listening ear. Your loved one may want to reminisce about old times, talk about his or her thoughts about the end of his or her life, or even laugh about a recent event. You don’t have to interrupt or offer wisdom or your own thoughts. It's okay to just make eye contact, hold the person’s hand, or just be there in mind and body.Make eye contact or hold the person’s hand while he or she is talking. You don’t have to say very much to show that you’re really listening.

, You may be worrying about whether this is the last time you’ll get to talk, whether it’s the last time your loved one will call you by your pet name, or whether you’ll ever be able to laugh with the person again. Though it’s natural to feel this way, you can save these thoughts of for after you end your visit with the person, so you can focus on being there, enjoying every moment you have with the person, and not letting worry keep you from being fully engaged., Though it’s likely that you feel overwhelmed by sadness, regret, or maybe even anger, you can’t show this face to the dying person all the time. While you shouldn’t lie and act like you’ve fully accepted what’s happening, you shouldn’t talk to the person with puffy eyes and an inconsolable spirit every time you see him or her, or you may be dragging him or her down. Work on bringing joy and optimism to the person when it’s possible. Your loved one already has enough going on, and offering you comfort about his or her impending death all the time may not be part of the agenda.

, While talking to the person and being there to listen is important, you should also remember that what’s most important is that your actions show how much you care. This means visiting as often as you can and checking in when you can’t. It means watching movies, looking through photo albums, playing cards, or doing whatever you and your loved one like to do together. It means showing up when you say you’ll be there and demonstrating your love through everything you do., You may have complicated feelings about the person who is passing away, and your relationship may not have always been so perfect. Still, it’s better to talk to the person as soon as you can before it’s too late. When a person you care about is dying, even if you have a difficult relationship, it’s not about settling the score or getting the record straight, but about being with him or her in a time of great need. If you wait too long to talk to the person, you may miss the opportunity altogether.

, Even if you’ve never said them before to the person or haven’t said them in years, it’s important to get these words out while you still have meaningful time with the person. You’ll regret if you don’t find the time to say it. Stop looking for the most perfect moment to be honest and just be true to your feelings.

, Talk about your favorite memories or the strengths you developed because of him or her. This may make for an emotional moment, but the person will really want to know.

, It’s tempting to tell a dying person that everything is going to be fine. The person will generally be all too aware of his or her physical state and will appreciate the fact that you’re offering your support without trying to sugarcoat anything. Focus on just being there for the person instead of offering false hope when the end is very near., Your loved one still cares about you and wants to know about your life. Sharing the good parts of your life with a person who is dying will make him feel happy to be a part of your life. Besides, if the person is leaving this life soon, he or she will be comforted by the thought that you are in a good place in your life., Though you may not know what to say, try not to say something like, “It’s all in God’s plan,” or “Everything is meant to happen for a reason.” Unless the person is deeply religious or uses these words him or herself, this kind of talk can be a bit frustrating. It can even make it sound like the person deserved to die and to suffer for some reason and that there’s no sense in fighting it or feeling angry. Instead, focus on being in the present with the person instead of reasoning why the person might be dying.

, If your loved one is just days or months from death’s door, then this is not the time to give unsolicited medical advice. Your loved one has likely tried everything and considered all options, and this kind of talk is only frustrating, hurtful, and rude. He or she just wants to be in peace at this point. Suggesting other health options will only lead to stress or anger.

, If the person is feeling really tired and just wants to enjoy your presence, then don’t feel forced to make conversation. This is different from trying to cheer up a sad friend, and your loved one may be physically and emotionally exhausted. While you may be wanting to have a conversation or you may think that talking is preferable to silence, let your loved one decide whether or not you should speak. You don’t want to force him or her to use so much energy during such a trying time."

Help others in need, maybe donate some money to charity, do community service like help at homeless shelters, or just be a shoulder to cry on. The people around you will feed on your energy, and will carry it. So if you display a sunny disposition, the people around you will feel good too.;
, Yoga is a good form of relaxation, meditation and exercise. It's best to take professional lessons as it will keep you motivated. This will probably be most enjoyable in the morning or at the end of the day. Also consider taking pilates which also relaxes your body in a calming, healthy way.

, That way you wake up feeling fresh and energized. Sleep at least 8 hours a day. Did you know scientists have proved that losing just 20 minutes of sleep can bring down an A+ student to a C? That means less concentration, less energy, and that groggy feeling. That's how much sleep is important to the human body. It's easier to go to sleep early than wake up early, so why not give it a try?

, Being hydrated can make you feel a lot better and it's a great way to start the day. Plus drinking plenty of water is great for your skin. Try to add some lemon juice that can give you a refreshing start for the day.

, Use your favorite soap and get really clean. Make sure that you have a towel ready for when you get out of the shower. Put the clothes that you're going to wear in the dryer for about 3 minutes so that they're warm when you put them on. Get ready for your day.

, Go on Google and find some recipes. There are loads of quick and easy, but oh-so-tasty and healthy recipes available! Breakfast is the most important meal of the day- having a great breakfast means loads of energy and your brain will function better. Remember to keep it in moderation and give yourself time so you won't be late. And try to have variety, the same cold cereal each day can become monotonous and can add gloom to your day.

, Do something that you like to do and have a good time.

, Sometimes doing something new or straying out of your routine could make your day much more exciting. Today doesn't have to be just another day, so let yourself enjoy it and make it as unique as possible. This includes following your whims. Doing the unexpected can help spice up your day and add some interest.

, There will always be something that you can find that will bother/annoy you. You just have to ignore those things or accept that they exist and that's just the way it is. Concentrate on the good things that are happening and don't let yourself get hurt by something someone said or did. Try not to compare yourself to others, as this will only lead to disappointment and the feeling of never being satisfied with your good self.

, Whether it's bungee jumping or just calling a new friend, let yourself do something you fear doing. You'll feel proud of yourself later for accomplishing it and be more confident in your doings. Remember, anything's possible as long as you believe.

, That gives out the ""I'm a person you want to know!"" signal.

, You want your happiness to radiate and influence others.

, Ignore external distractions, unless the adult is teaching something/talking.

Just do the right thing, even if they think it's wrong, you know it's for the better.

, The time for everything will come, just waiting is a little hard to keep. It's natural to be a little impatient, but force yourself to just stop, and calm down and look at what's current. If you can't get out your message, determine if it's Important, then go ahead.

, When you know your doing the right things, you may notice 90% of others are annoying, mean, gossiping, etc. So, if you compare yourself to others, sometimes it can feel better to know you're mature, and that there's always someone more fortunate or unfortunate than you.

, Throughout the day, good and bad things will happen. A day can never be completely good, or bad. Striving to make a day better, doesn't always mean to feel more good, but to adapt to the new and uncomfortable aspects. To have a good day, is to want it better, do what's right, and tip two.

, Of course your health comes first, but other than that, contribute to others, and make them happy, and they'll be relieved of your efforts. Remember, they only need/want what they can get from you.

, Forget about all stress and distractions on the situation, and just go ahead to do what's necessary right away.

Write down your three most important tasks.",How to Get Your Life Back in Order," Unless it’s down time you’ve established, any activity that doesn’t produce a tangible result or lead you to success is most likely a waste of time. Simply choose which things in your life are important to you and which are not. First, make a list of things that you normally do on a daily and/or weekly basis and write down how much time you spend on each activity. Then, take the items on that list and cross off the things that are useless in your life and you spend too much time on.;
, Look at the things you crossed off and what you still have on your other list. Does this seem reasonable? The main goal is to get you to stop spending so much time on useless things. Now that you know what to avoid doing, replace them with more productive activities.


For example, going to the movies or browsing on the computer half as often will give you more time. Or, if you watch TV for 5 hours a day, you're definitely wasting some time in your life.

, Some people are big on having as many windows open as possible when they are on the computer. They say it helps them to not forget important tasks and to stay on track. But if it sounds like you, you probably notice that the notification figures are constantly flashing, and before you know it, you’re distracted by tweets directing you to another great article, photo updates about dinner selections, and an irresistible yet pointless online argument. Shut these social communities down and take control.Figure out times of the day to check back in. Take advantage of the useful time management tools out there to schedule updates for the day. You’ll soon be so busy being productive that you won’t notice that the social world you were so heavily immersed in has disappeared.

, Take advantage of the energy that comes with the rising sun. As many people are still not up and creating chaos in the world, it’s a great time to be highly productive. Leave the social sites and personal emails for later. Start right away on the work that will help you achieve your goals.Though you can also use part of this time for meditation or exercise. Meditation can help greatly to clear your mind and to help you feel refreshed and relaxed again.
If you set 5:30 to 7:30 a.m. aside each morning, this will give you a solid two hours of concentrated work. It’s incredible what you can achieve in this time.

, There are periods in life when it’s nearly impossible to keep up. There are meetings, dinner dates, parties, conferences and all kinds of other situations that demand our presence. It’s great to feel wanted but at what cost? Trying to go to every single thing will almost definitely have a negative effect on your productivity. Say no to things that aren’t absolutely essential. By doing this, you will be opening the door so that more important opportunities can take priority.Ask yourself: How will saying yes help you to improve the most important areas in your life? If it doesn’t, then say no.

, A healthy diet can have a powerful effect on your overall energy levels as well as your mood. Even eating healthy foods for one or two days can make you feel like you’ve gotten your life back under control again.

, Certain vitamin supplements can have a tremendous effect in reducing the amount of stress that you most likely went through during that recent, hectic period of your life. No matter how healthy your diet is, you may still be deficient with certain nutrients due to stress and anxiety. The absolute best vitamins to help in bringing stress levels back down are B vitamins and Vitamin C.

, As mentioned above, stress can have such a detrimental effect on a person’s productivity levels. When you feel that you have too much on you, it’s easy to forget to breathe properly at times. So take deep, long breaths, and instantly improve the flow of oxygen to your brain.

, Being in the great outdoors is never a waste of time. Nature has the ability to clear a person’s thoughts and soothe a troubled mind. Climbing a mountain or taking a walk in the woods gives us clarity again on what’s important and helps us to feel connected with the universe. , Schedule a massage to improve circulation, muscle tone and remove harmful toxins. Take a yoga class - there are so many different classes and teachers available, so there is definitely a style and a teacher out there for you. You may have to take a few classes that you’re not crazy about, but that's okay; because when you find the one for you, it could be well worth it.

, Hands-down, these are harmful crutches and some of these vices can seriously cloud your judgment and decisions. The money you save and the health you gain by stopping one or more of these habits can be put into something more rewarding such as joining a hiking club or buying a spa-pass for a week. Like the period you just went through, there are those times where everything seems out-of-control. Now that the dust has settled this is the time to focus on your body temple again.

, Take a common problem - the magazines that have been lying around for months on end. You say you have to do something about them, so you rush off to the store to buy a dozen magazine holders. It’s probably best to sit down, though, and figure out which ones you actually should keep and the ones you should toss. Remember, sometimes less is more., Sometimes you can find real gems in sales like this. Many items that sellers give away for next to nothing are because they had to move and can’t make use of what was in their home before. The bookshelf racks that were just right in their previous living area are now too wide in their new space. So their loss is your find in getting more organized at a fraction of the cost. Reach out to the community and earn something for yourself!, The simplest thing you can do to stay organized is to put whatever hairbrush, bag, article of clothing, tool, or item away right after using it. Basically, you want to know where everything is so that you never have to waste time looking for it. Ask yourself this question: Could you tell a stranger where to find anything where you live? If not, you probably need to get more organized., Organizing things you don’t need is simply a waste of precious time. It is incredible how much more in control you will feel by ridding yourself of outdated articles you’re going to read “someday” or pages of notes from which pertinent action items have already been taken care of. For many of us, the reason we accumulated things is because we just don’t want to take a look at it. This is a cultivated habit, however, and can be changed.


What you will find with many of these items is that you can now just throw them away. So try not to be afraid of your accumulated stuff. You will feel a lot more empowered and be much more organized as a result.

, On your paper, you write your “to do” list for today. Keep that with you throughout the day. By the end, whatever you can’t get done, gets moved to the calendar. The white board is kept for you to make scribbly notes on at any given moment., It’s easy to get overwhelmed with everything we think we have to do. However, take a look at your essential and non-essential tasks -- not everything is essential. Sometimes we can think that because we are racing around like whirling dervishes that we are actually being productive. But it’s usually quite the opposite.


When you focus on just the top three most important tasks, the path becomes a lot more clear and achievable.

, Note that you can make money and build career skills (video editing, photo editing, charisma, character, etc). Also note that you can be yourself and gain confidence by having a YouTube channel. If you have a family member or a really close friend (whose family knows your family) who cab show their face or post videos online, mention them. Make sure they'll give proof and can explain why their parents let them if needed.

If your parents think you'll be bullied, make sure they know that comments can be set for ""under approval"" or disabled completely. Also makes sure they know that you're stronger than them and will ignore them.

, If you're open with your patents, you can show them all your videos before you post them, but if your more shy with them, you can give them your channel name and let them watch.

, If you think a rule is unreasonable, stop them and explain why you think it's a bad rule. Don't overreact or get mad - be as mature possible.

Be objective and pinpoint places where you can improve.
When you stop making up excuses, you take responsibility and control of your life. That means that your choices, thoughts, and actions are in your control, not someone else's. This means you move forward. You have the control.
When something happens, don't get mad and blame someone. Don't make excuses for why you messed up. Accept that it happened. Don't dwell on it. Instead, move past it and try to change your behavior so you don't do it again.;
, There are certain things that happen to us that are out of our control. Since you can't change or fix this, let it go. Push it out of your head and stop thinking about them. Focus only on things you can change in your life. This will make you happier.Things in our past are beyond our control. Learn from past mistakes, but don't dwell on them. You can't successfully move forward if you keep looking backward.
You can't change other people, only yourself. Don't obsess over what other people do. Talk to people if they hurt you, but if you have done everything you can, let it go. You can only control yourself.

, Understanding what makes you happy and content can be the hardest question to answer. If you are unhappy and feel your life is out of control, start by asking yourself, ""What will make me happy?"" Answer truthfully. Figuring this out can help you focus on the positive aspects of life and start to get your life together.


Answer realistically. Travelling around Europe for 6 months or becoming a millionaire are probably out of your reach. However, visiting Italy, increasing your savings account, or getting a job promotion are things that you can work on achieving.
Figure out what your core values are. Are they honesty, compassion, love, acceptance, dedication, or hard work? Whatever they are, figure them out and write them down. Then look at your life. Are you living up to your core values? Are the people in your life living up to them? Knowing what you value can help you be a better person and help you surround yourself with better people., There are things in our lives that we can't change. We have to work, we have to go to school, and we have to pay bills. You have responsibilities. But you can change certain aspects about your responsibilities so they don't always feel like such a burden.


Are there better days for you to perform certain responsibilities? Can you buy groceries on a Thursday night instead of spending your Saturday in the grocery store? Find ways to adjust your life so you get everything done but still have time for yourself.
Does your job make you happy? If not, decide how you feel about that. Do you want a different career or a promotion? Or are you happy with your job despite not being passionate for your work because it has flexible hours or great pay?
You don't have to be passionate about everything in life. Instead, decide if you are okay with the aspects of your life and accept what role they play., There is so much pressure on us to juggle everything, and to do it perfectly. You are only one human being. There are only 24 hours in a day. You can't possibly do everything. You have a job, a family, friends, and other obligations. Sometimes, work requires more of our time while other times our family does. Don't feel like a failure if you can't do it all. Do what you can, and let the rest go.


Prioritize your time and commitments. This is especially important if you are busy and pressed for time. Decide what has to be done, what things can slide, and what needs your attention.
Make a to do list. This can help you not forget anything. It also will give you a sense of accomplishment once you finally cross things off the list. Just remember, don't be discouraged if you don't finish everything. Instead, focus on what you have finished., Things happen in our lives. We grow older, we go through break ups and divorces, people die, we lose jobs, and tragedy happens. These things can cause us to be depressed, sad, and hopeless. Once we finally start moving forward again, a lot of times we expect to be the same exact person we were before. This isn't always the case. Every experience we have changes us. Sometimes it's minor, but sometimes we are drastically different. This isn't always a bad thing. Don't get upset because you are different than you were 1, 5, or 10 years ago. Instead, embrace the new you as you move forward and put your life back on track.


This doesn't mean that if you are sad you will never be the happy person you were before. If you are depressed or feeling hopeless, you definitely want to move forward and find a way back to your happiness. The point is that the things used to make you happy may not make you happy anymore. You may not have the same opinions or views as before. You may not even like the same things. That's okay. Life is about change and adapting., Think about how many times you say ""I'm not"" in a day. What have you convinced yourself that you can't do? Things around us tell us we can't do stuff all the time. We don't have enough money to do something. We're too old or too young to do something. We're not attractive enough to do something. These subliminal messages make us believe there are certain things we aren't allowed to do. Stop thinking like that. Instead of thinking ""I can't do that"" or ""I'm not that kind of person,"" change your thinking to ""I can do it"" or ""I am that kind of person."" Then go out and do it!


For example, if you've ever thought ""I'm not a runner,"" ask yourself why. Is it because you physically can't run due to an injury, because you're not a marathon runner with an 8 minute mile stride, or because you've never tried? Instead of accepting that, go out and do it. If you want to be a runner, sign up for a 5k, do a couch-to-5k training program, and start running. Even if your best pace is ever a 13 minute mile, you're still running.Try new things. Do something that scares you and that you think you can't do. Sometimes you will fail or feel like an idiot. But sometimes you will succeed, improve your life, and even make friends.

, Sometimes, the best way to get your life together is to put yourself first. That may mean cutting out negative, unhealthy people from your life instead of keeping them around out of obligation. It may mean making a decision people don't agree with because it's best for you. Most of all, it means staying true to what is best for you.


Of course you don't want to hurt the people you love, but if you are doing what's right for you, they should understand and support you. The people you love shouldn't bring you down. If they do, talk to them.
Learn to say no. You don't always have to do everything for everyone else. Sometimes, you don't have time to commit to something or don't have the energy to do something. That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person. Saying no doesn't make you a bad person., One way to get your life together is to move forward and move on. Getting your life together includes making a life for yourself. This may include joining new organizations, finding new friends, or trying a new hobby. It might mean just getting out of your house on a weekend. Whatever it is, go ahead and get out of the house.


Join a community organization to meet people and get involved. Put a profile on an online dating site. Join a meetup group and go to an event.Give yourself time to heal. Don't move on or put yourself out there before you are ready. There is no timeline for when you should be healed. Some people heal faster than others. There's nothing wrong with that. However, you may need to push yourself out of your rut. Start small. Call up a friend. Go to a community event. Go somewhere you've never been. See how you feel when you do it. If it's too much, take some more time. If you feel okay, then maybe you're ready to get out there more.

, One reason why people are unhappy is that they put their entire worth on the outside. They think money will make them happy, or a prestigious job, or even looking the best. There is nothing wrong with wanting a good job, to have enough money, or to look your best, but making your entire existence about this is unhealthy and damaging.


Focus instead on internal factors. Don't compare yourself others. Be the best you that you can be. Enjoy what your financial circumstances allows you, even if that just going on day trips instead of month long voyages to the Caribbean.
Live your life to your core values. Be a good, honest, loyal, hardworking person. Value your individual work and what you offer the world above being the best at everything."
"
Get moving.,
Eat healthy.,
Give up unhealthy vices.,
Make small changes.",How to Get Your Life Together2," Exercise is a great way to make a positive change for yourself. Not only does exercise make you look and feel good, but it also increases your overall health. Exercise reduces stress and anxiety and helps you relax. Plus, exercise releases endorphins, which boost your mood.Start by getting out of the house and walking for 30 minutes 3 times a week.
Go for a hike in a state park you've never been to.
Join a gym and go to a spin, weightlifting, zumba, or crossfit class.
Sign up for that 5k you've always wanted to and start training to run it.

, Another way to take control of your life is to change your eating habits. By adopting a healthy lifestyle, you will lose weight, feel better, and improve your health. Start small and add new things every week or two. Even making small changes can yield huge benefits on your body and mind.


Cut out processed food. That includes boxed meals, take out, and prepackaged snacks. These things are not good for your body.
Replace processed, artificial foods with natural foods. Eat fruits and vegetables. Eat usable carbs, like quinoa and oatmeal. Eat lean meats, such as fish and chicken. Eating healthy doesn't mean starving yourself. Simply make better choices for meals and snacks.For breakfast, try an omelette with tomato, spinach, ham, and avocado. Or try oatmeal with fruit, like strawberries, pineapple, or banana, nuts, and dark chocolate chips.
For lunch, eat a kale bowl with sauteed vegetables such as kale, asparagus, carrots, or broccoli, avocado, tomato, chickpeas, beans such as cannellini or black beans, protein such as chicken, tilapia, or salmon, and feta cheese.
For dinner, cook a lean protein and an array of vegetables.

, Another way to get your life together is to try to get rid of unhealthy and harmful vices. Try to cut back on alcohol if you drink too much. Quit smoking. Look at your unhealthy, damaging habits and start trying to change them.Remember to start slow, and don't try to do everything at once. Some unhealthy habits, like smoking, can be extremely hard to break.

, When making positive changes in the way you eat and exercise, start slowly. Don't try to do everything at once - that is a recipe for failure. Think about it as a layered process. Each time you adopt one new habit, you build on that to change another habit. Each small success is one step towards a better you, and eventually, these small changes will add up to a big change.


Start by writing down what you want to change. Then, think about how you can change it. Look at the list. What is something you feel you can accomplish this week? Maybe you're not ready to give up sugar, but you can eat a healthier breakfast. Start there. Leave the harder habits - giving up sugar, carbs, or sodas, or weightlifting - for another week. Once you gain some momentum and feel successful in what you've accomplished so far, the other habits will not seem so impossible.
Make a point to cook all your meals at home this week. If you eat out almost every day, start by saying you will cook your dinners at home, or you will not eat out 4-5 days a week.
Promise yourself that you will do something active every day. Look at your schedule and decide how it will fit in. Remember, ""I don't have time"" is not an excuse! Instead, find days when you can go running at the park. On days when you are too busy to go to the gym or the park, load up a 30 minute exercise routine on Youtube."
"
Set aside 10 minutes a day to clean.,
Focus on one thing at a time.,
Have ""Get Things Done"" days.,
Use technology to your advantage.",How to Get Your Life Together3," This doesn't sound like a lot of time, but when you're busy and feel your life is out of control, you may not be able to find 10 minutes to spare. Take 10 minutes every day to clean something in your home. You can't clean everything in 10 minutes, but that's okay. You are taking small steps at improving your living space, which in turn will make you feel better.


Set an alarm for 10 minutes and turn on some music. Spend that time making your bed, putting away laundry, loading the dishwasher, vacuuming - whatever chore needs to be done.Assign a room for each day of the week. Mondays you clean your bedroom, while Tuesdays is your bathroom, and Wednesdays is your kitchen. This way you tidy up your entire home throughout the week.

, Our lives are chaotic. We have multiple commitments and only 24 hours in a day. Now with technology at our fingertips, we spend a lot of the day multitasking. While this can be effective, it also can be counterproductive and make us feel even more disorganized and spread thin. Try taking your tasks and focusing on them one at a time.Instead of working on 5 different incomplete projects and making a small amount of progress in each one, choose one project to devote your time to until you have finished it. That's one less thing on your to do list.
Don't try to clean your entire house at the same time. Focus on one room and refrain from moving to another room until that room is clean.

, Because things pile up and make us feel like failures, schedule ""Get Things Done"" days. During these days, focus on getting caught up on tasks that get pushed to the side during your normally hectic schedule.


Sort through your mail, do your laundry, or take the recycling to the nearest center.
These days can be used for things that aren't chores. Respond to e-mails, call your parents, or have lunch with a friend., Smartphones are convenient devices, and they can help you get your life together. There are apps for just about everything. This means you can set up reminders for yourself, plug everything into a calendar, and have everything in one place so it's convenient for you.


Try a list app. Use this to make to do lists of what you need to do every day, for that week, or just in general. Use the app to make a list of things you want to do, like what movies you want to see and activities you want to complete.
Use fitness apps. There are apps that will lead you through workouts and race training programs. Other apps will count your calories and give you recipe suggestions for weight loss. There are even apps that will remind you to drink water. These apps can help you stay on track, keep you motivated, and remind you to stay healthy."

Take a break and make it meaningful.",How to Get Out of Your Own Way," Ask yourself what preconceived ideas and thought patterns stop you from getting things done. Be completely honest with yourself about the patterns that are helpful and those that are destructive.


For example, maybe you position yourself in front of a particular window when you intend to work. You might think that the scenery inspires you, but if you find your eyes wandering away from your work and lingering on the activity you see through the window, this could actually be a negative pattern.;
, Even if a habit doesn't necessarily seem bad on the surface, getting yourself in a rut can stop you from taking the steps you need to reach your goals. Mix things up and change your routine.


Even small changes can alter the way you approach the world around you. Instead of starting your morning with a cup of coffee, try a cup of tea or a sports drink. Rather than hopping on your smart phone and playing a game during your break, go for a quick walk or pick up a paperback book.
As you accustom yourself to the idea of change by making small alterations to your daily routine, you gradually make it easier to introduce bigger, more significant changes to your life.

, Figure out why you feel that way. After you've identified the negative emotion, press on with your plans in spite of it.


Getting rid of your negative emotions can be a daunting task, and if you wait for those feelings to be gone, you may never move forward with your life.
Acknowledge your unfounded worries and fears. Accept that they exist, but also tell yourself that you aren't going to let them control how you act.
As you continue to move forward, you can foster more positive feelings that can help drown out the negative ones.

, Comparing yourself to other people will inevitably make you feel worse about your own accomplishments. Your self-confidence takes a hit, and you might find it more difficult to work up the nerve to pursue your present or future ambitions.


Since everyone has his or her own unique circumstances, though, it isn't fair to assume that you should be at the same place in your life as someone else is in theirs.

, Perfection is a literal impossibility. You will fail and you will fall. The key is learning to accept your mistakes and move past them. Once you can accept your failings, the fear of failing will stop getting in your way.

, Don't break your neck trying to appease every person in your life and stop apologizing for things that aren't your fault.


Learn to say ""no"" to people, especially when the requests they make are unfair.
If there are problems, speak up. They probably won't fix themselves, and if you don't say something, there's no guarantee that anyone else will.
Stop apologizing every time someone gets upset or inconvenienced. Apologize when you know you're at fault, but don't needlessly make yourself into the villain.

, Instead of making excuses, make progress. It's far too easy to think of a reason why you can afford to postpone a task until a later date, but postponing something prevents you from achieving a goal or step that lies just beyond the task you're avoiding.

, Work that seems pointless is naturally harder to get done.


If you're struggling through a task or decision, ask yourself why it is important for you to complete it. Consider what good thing might be lost if you don't see things through, or what bad thing might happen if you slack off. Identifying some reason for doing the work may make the work seem worth doing.

, Think about the goal you're trying to accomplish. When the work you need to do to reach that goal gets tough or mundane, return your thoughts to the goal itself. Fixating on something you want can make it easier to take the steps needed to attain it.


If the anticipated outcome doesn't motivate or excite you, you may need to reevaluate the path you are presently on. Ask yourself if the goal is really worth pursuing. You may realize you should change the goal and not the steps you need to reach it.

, Inch forward little by little. Doing so is both practical and emotionally beneficial.


For example, if your goal is to find “the one” and enter into a healthy romantic relationship, you might take a small step by asking a few trusted friends to set you up or by starting an online dating profile at a trustworthy website. Neither option requires much commitment, so if it doesn't work out, you haven't lost much.

, Watch the outcome of each step you make and take notes. Regardless of whether you experience success or failure, you can use your observations to figure out what your next step should be.


Maybe your online dating profile hasn't attracted anyone good, or maybe the date your friend set you up on ended in disaster. Evaluate what went wrong. You may need to try a different website or a different friend. Alternatively, you may realize that you need to try something else in your quest for romance—like attending a local singles' group or visiting a popular hangout.

, Good self-discipline is essential. When you set a goal, you need to keep it. Doing otherwise will probably make you feel worse about yourself, and that negative self-image will only drag you down.


Think about how great you feel after a productive day. Then, think about how frustrated you feel after you've spent the day slacking off.
When you routinely break your own deadlines and slack off on your own goals, you start losing faith in your ability to get things done. Staying focused now will help you remain focused in the future.

, Pause long enough to acknowledge each successful move you complete. Your mind may naturally fixate on your failings, but oftentimes, you will need to make a dedicated effort to acknowledge your wins.


Tallying up your successes can give your sense of self-confidence a tremendous boost. As your confidence grows, your desire to push yourself along typically grows, too.

, Make sure that the music sets the right tone and actually inspires you to get things done, though.


Try a few different types of music until you find one that naturally motivates you.
Start off with the same set of songs for a while. When you hear these songs, your brain will eventually come to associate them with staying focused.
If the music becomes a distraction, though, you should change your selection or try working in silence again.

, The sense of smell is often neglected, but odors can sway your thoughts and feelings in a very subtle way. Designate a certain scent as your motivational scent. Train yourself to associate that scent with productivity.


Pick a scent that makes you feel focused. Popular choices include cinnamon, mint, lemon, orange, and rosemary.Find candles, incense, or essential oils in that scent, and keep them stationed around your workspace or home.
When you start working on things, make sure that you do so in the presence of your signature scent. Continue to do so as often as possible.
Ideally, you'll eventually reach a point at which you associate that scent with productivity and focus. Once you reach that point, you can carry your scent in portable form (an unlit candle, a dab of essential oil on a handkerchief) and give it a whiff when you need to focus in an unfamiliar setting.

, If you feel stiff or fatigued after working for long periods of time, get up and move around. Take a walk, perform jumping-jacks, or just stretch.


Activities that get your heart pumping are best. The increased blood flow can actually reinvigorate you, making it easier to focus as a result.
Take a break even if it has to be a short one. A few minutes of physical activity are better than none.

, Give yourself all the tools and supplies you need to get your work done. When you're missing something significant, you're likely to use that as an excuse to procrastinate. Staying organized will prevent those excuses from piling up, thereby allowing you to get things done more effectively.


Take a few minutes to figure out exactly what you'll need before you start working. If you'll be somewhere noisy and distracting, bring headphones and music that can drown out the noise. If you'll be working on your computer, make sure that the laptop battery is charged and bring your laptop charger just in case.

, Negative people will discourage you from moving forward, even if they don't necessarily mean to do so. Positive people, on the other hand, have a “can do” attitude and may actively or inactively encourage you to push forward with your own life.


You don't need to completely cut ties with every pessimist in your life, but as a general guideline, try to make sure that your five closest companions have attitudes that lean more on the positive side.When a negative person in your life actively works at tearing you apart, the relationship between you has grown toxic. You can try to fix it, but if nothing changes, your best option might be to cut ties.

, Take the time to help the people around you. In doing so, you can view various aspects of life from an objective perspective. Looking at things objectively can make it easier to find solutions to problems that you've been struggling with in your own life.


Lending a helping hand to someone else can also make you feel positive about yourself overall. When you make a difference in someone else's life, you feel important, capable, and needed.

, Your life needs balance, so you do need time to relax and calm down. Don't settle for distractions you'll regret later, though. Weave meaningful activities into your life that can refresh you in a more constructive manner.


When you commit to relaxation, you need to stick with that commitment. Don't guilt yourself into working through it.
When you need to unwind, do it thoroughly by taking a bubble bath, doing yoga, or meditating. Choose an activity that truly calms you down instead of one that momentarily makes you feel better.
Likewise, make time for activities that involve your family and friends instead of aimlessly killing time alone.

"
First, remember that you are not the only person who has ever felt this way.,
Devote a few days to figuring out what exactly is getting you down.,
Understand that thinking about the past can can really demotivate you.,
Start small.,
Keep track of your progress.,
Read articles or books about others who have done what you are trying to do.,
Don't give up.,
Don't be too hard on yourself.,
Get right back into your new routine.,
Practice mindfulness, or living in the present.",How to Get out of a Rut," When you are down and demotivated, it can sometimes feel like everyone except you is progressing and doing great things while you wait on the sidelines. It is human nature to get demotivated sometimes; we are not robots. Some common ruts that people get into include:


Feeling bored or stagnant at work. A lot of jobs, particularly if you've been working there for a while, can start to feel tedious.
Losing the spark in a relationship. Long-term relationships in particular can be prone to falling into a routine that drains the relationship of excitement. This also applies to platonic friendships; sometimes your friends can keep you in a pattern of monotony.
Developing poor eating habits. If you have a busy schedule or just love food, it's not difficult to make lousy choices at mealtime. Once you get into the habit of unhealthy eating, it can seem almost impossible to break!
All of the above. Frequently, there are a number of factors that will keep you in a rut. All of these things seem to culminate at once, creating a stress situation that you don't even know how to begin to fix.;
, Chances are, you already have an idea of what's bugging you. Be honest with yourself. Once you identify the source of your discontent, you are free to commit to changing it.


If you can't seem to put your finger on what's making you unhappy, consider keeping a journal. It doesn't have to be very elaborate or time consuming. At the end of each day, write down a few reflections about what happened and how you're feeling. After a while, it won't be difficult to identify the negative patterns. Keeping a journal has been proven to help people track their bad habits and quit them altogether., Instead of beating yourself up about the way things are, grant yourself the power to make a positive change. It sounds cheesy, but imagining a positive future can really motivate you to make it happen!

, If you are in a rut, chances are you've been doing things the same way for quite a while. Trying to change every aspect of your life overnight is just unrealistic, not to mention incredibly daunting. You'll find that success comes much more easily if you set an achievable goal to begin with.


If you have decided to make huge changes in your life, break them up into a series of goals. You are much more likely to succeed if you manage your expectations.For instance, if you want to go back to college, make it your first goal to research schools that offer the program you want to do. This is an easily accomplished, yet vital step in your journey!

, There are a number of ways you can do this, especially if you have a smartphone. Take a few minutes to download a helpful app, or stop by the office supply store for a calendar and some sparkly star stickers. Looking back at your progress can really give you a boost!


It sounds counter intuitive, but try not to brag about your big plans before you have actually achieved anything. According to research, talking about your intention to do something makes you less likely to really do it.With that in mind, don't forget to congratulate yourself when you reach a milestone. If your main goal is to lose fifteen pounds, pat yourself on the back when you've lost five.

, Whether you are trying to make huge changes or just need a little pick-me-up, somebody somewhere has probably been through it too. Learning about the experiences of others can really give you some perspective and motivation.


Depending on your situation, it might be helpful to join some type of community with other people who are in the same boat as you. This could be a traditional ""support group"" or even an online forum. Having a strong support system can be crucial to avoiding stress. , Changing your routine, especially if you've been doing it for a while, is hard. Give yourself credit for trying in the first place. Remind yourself how far you've come, and don't let one little setback stop you.

, It's pretty unlikely that you'll reach your goal immediately; focus on making progress. Most positive things just take time and feeling grief can cause you to move backwards on everything you've accomplished. Look at what you have already finished and compliment yourself on it. After all, you are that many steps closer to completing your mission.

, It is completely normal to fall back into old, comfortable habits, even if those habits make you unhappy. The important thing is to identify when you have fallen off track, and then immediately get back on! Don't let one imperfect day throw off your whole plan.


Sometimes you might fall off track for a longer period of time. Maybe something unexpected happened or you just lost your motivation. Try to remember the first time you decided to make a change, and remind yourself that if you were able to do it once, you can do it an infinite number of times. Starting over is not a failure, but giving up is.

, Sometimes we are more vulnerable to setbacks after we've already made quite a bit of progress. Don't let any progress you might have made be your excuse to go back to square one. Always be conscious of your goal and where you are on your road to achieving it.


This is another scenario in which keeping a journal might come in handy. Keeping track of your thoughts is useful for maintaining awareness, especially if you feel like you are losing your motivation. Mindfulness is a great technique for reducing the stress you might feel due to a lot of changes happening in your life.On the other side of the coin, be aware of situations that cause you to dwell on the past, and focus your energy on moving forward. If you bomb a presentation at work, make a list of all the things you want to remember for next time.
Remember that staying out of a rut is a continuous process. An actor who makes one bad film isn't necessarily a bad actor, just like a person who has one bad week doesn't necessarily have a bad life.

Ask yourself, “What is the most important thing I can be doing right now?” In the classic time management book, How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life, by Alan Lakein, he asks his readers this very important question.",How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life," So, a lot of people’s lives look something like this: you work a lot so you can make a decent amount of money, and then you use that money to buy a whole bunch of stuff. You buy the stuff, the money runs out, and back to work you go to rinse and repeat. If you’re having a hard time getting control of your life and your time, then chances are, one of the things you’re doing is working too much. Now, if you cut down on the spending, then you might feel less pressure to keep working so hard or for so many hours, and you’d have more of that free time you want so badly. Here are some tips for minimizing your spending while still having a great life:Do you really need a car? Is all the time you spend running maintenance on the car, giving rides to people, and trying to find a parking spot everywhere you go really worth it? Wouldn’t your life be easier if you were more dependent on your own two feet and the bus schedule? If so, then it may be time to let go of your favorite vehicle.
Do you really need five new outfits every month? Instead of just indiscriminately buying a bunch of new outfits every time you go shopping, focus on quality over quantity. Buy a high quality sweater, a well-fitting pair of pants, and a sturdy scarf that will go with everything so that you leave with a few key items that are made to last. Sure, they may not cost that much less than piles of cheaper new clothes, but they will keep you from having to shop as often as you do.
Going out to eat is one of the biggest wastes of money. Try not to go out to eat or order takeout more than once or twice a week and spend more money on high-quality ingredients that can make home cooking more fun and delicious.;
, You may think that multi-tasking is a great way to get your work done faster and to make the most of your time, but the truth is that multi-tasking will actually make all of your work take longer. Additionally, if you’re multi-tasking, then the quality of your work will go down because you won’t be able to be fully immersed in any one task. Think about it: are you really doing that great of a job if you’re Skyping your boss about your plan to improve the company while you’re on the phone with your mother to plan your cousin’s bridal shower? Instead, focus on your work one task at a time and see how much more quickly you get everything done – and how much more you’re able to fully focus on one task.This is where making a to-do list comes in handy. Tackle the items one task a time instead of trying to do three at once and ending up getting nothing done.

, You may feel like you’re struggling to gain control of your time and your life because you’ve committed yourself to way too many tasks: working on a new project for your job, having a “girls’ night” once a week, teaching a yoga class every morning, or spending time helping your neighbor redecorate her home. Think about the things that really matter to you and which you’re doing for yourself, not out of obligation. Sure, you can’t just drop everything because you don’t really feel like doing it, but see what you can cut out of your schedule and see how much of a relief you’ll feel.


You may be in denial, telling yourself that you really want to do every little task on your social calendar. Before you do something, ask yourself, “How would I feel if this were suddenly cancelled?” If the answer is “incredibly relieved,” then why do it?

, Getting organized can help you feel much more in control of how you spend your hours. Having a planner, a calendar, working pens, and a clean notebook where you can make your to-do lists can help you feel less overwhelmed. You may think that you work better on the fly and that you can always find something when you need it, but having an organized desk, bag, or purse can help you relieve stress because you won’t waste time looking for a receipt, phone number, or memo since you’ll know exactly where everything is.


You may think that you don’t have the time to go through everything in your desk or to organize the contents of your drawers, closet, or trunk, but in the long run, this will save you hours and hours of time.

, Sure, grabbing a few drinks with your guy friends or girlfriends once or twice a week can help you relieve stress, relax, and just get silly after a long day of work or school. But if you get in the habit of working, working, working, and then drinking, drinking, drinking so you don’t have to think about all the stress you’re dealing with, then you’ll only make yourself even more stressed out. You may go out with your girlfriends on a Friday night, drink way too much, and spend half of Saturday in bed, instead of waking up early to go to yoga, visit the farmer’s market, or to work on your poetry collection. That’s how alcohol can make you lose even more control of your time – and your life.


As a rule, you should only drink when you’re already in a good mood, not when you’re stressed and thinking that drinking will make the problem go away. Alcohol is a depressant and it will only make you feel worse, even if it offers temporary relief.

, Here’s another quick time saver: instead of spending over an hour each evening on cooking and cleanup, cook on just two or three nights a week, making enough food for the next few days. For example, on Monday, you can make a delicious lasagna that lasts until Thursday, and you can spice it up with a home-made salad or another simple dish instead of cooking something completely new every day.


You can also save time by buying almost everything you need for the week at the grocery store. Make a schedule of what you’ll cook and when you’ll eat it and make sure to use everything you’ve bought before dipping back into the well.

, Ah, procrastination. How can something that feels so right be so wrong? Because it’ll keep you from doing what you have to do, that’s why. You may think that you really are working because you’re spending time on ordering your BFFs birthday present online (who cares that it’s three months away?) or responding to those important Facebook messages, but let’s get real: aren’t there twenty things that you have to do right now that are much more important? If the answer is yes, then get to the task that you’ve been avoiding all day and see how much better you’ll feel once it’s done.


You know how you’re going to do four “easier” things before you get to the last thing on your list? Well, try mixing it up: do the last thing first, when you have the energy for it, and then enjoy winding-down and doing easier tasks when you’re done instead of saving the worst for last.

, One of the reasons you may not feel like you’re in control of your life is because you’re always rushing around to move from one task to the next. This will make you feel stressed out and frazzled and it can lead you to make a bad impression on the people who are waiting for you. Even if you’ve shown up ten minutes early with nothing to do, that’s better than running like a madman to get somewhere exactly on time and then waiting for your heart to stop racing. Pretend every meeting is 15 minutes earlier than it really is and aim to get there accordingly. Sure, this may not help you get more work done, but it will improve your attitude about it, and that’s the most important thing.


Part of the reason you may be running late everywhere is because you’re so overbooked that you haven’t given yourself enough time to move from one task to the next. If that’s the case, make sure you space your commitments far enough apart.

, Every morning when you wake up – or every night, if you’re feeling ambitious – wake up and make a game plan for the day. Write down the tasks you will accomplish, whether they are work or school related, and work in the time you will spend eating lunch, exercising, hanging out with friends, or doing whatever else you want to do. You can even make a plan for the week, but having an hour-by-hour account of what you’ll do can be a little more challenging.


Make a to-do list and check off every item and see how good it feels to accomplish every task.
Plan a reward for yourself for the end of the day, or after you get a few tasks done, so you have more to look forward to.

, You may think that alone time should be the first to go when you set out to plan your day or your week. However, that alone time should be just as precious to you as your time with your dear friends, your family, or your significant other. Alone time will help your reboot your system, get some perspective, and give you the energy you need to jump into your next social interactions or work obligation. Make sure you get to spend at least a few hours all alone each week, and wake up earlier to get that alone time if you need to; don’t let a friend’s last-minute plans keep you from having that date with yourself.


Take a look at your entire week. See where you can carve out time for yourself; maybe you can walk to work one morning instead of carpooling; maybe you can set aside time to read instead of seeing that movie you didn’t really want to see with your friend anyway.
Don’t let a friend make you feel guilty about not going out with friends if you need some time to yourself. Develop your ability to recognize what you really want to do. What’s the point of hanging out with friends if they’ll instantly be able to tell that you’d rather be hanging solo?

, Get good at recognizing when you’re the most productive. Most people get the most done in the morning, after they wake up feeling refreshed. Some people do better in the evenings, when they wind down after their long day. Others get a burst of energy after their afternoon coffee. After you figure out when you’re the most productive, plan to do the hardest, most demanding tasks then so you get the most out of your efforts. Additionally, you can schedule the easiest tasks for the hours when you know you’ll be more sluggish, like the hour after lunch or the last hour you spend at work, watching the clock.


This will not only make it easier for you to achieve your goals, but it’ll make the act of achieving them much more pleasant.

, When people are busy, sleep is often the first thing to get sacrificed. However, if you really want to feel like you have control of your life and your time, then you can’t go around feeling like a zombie as you try to get through your day. Make sure to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep a day and to go to bed around the same time every night and to wake up around the same time every morning so that your body gets used to your sleep patterns.


Work on having a solid winding-down routine before bed by turning off all visual stimuli, like your phone and computer, at least half an hour before bed so you have an easier time drifting off.
Avoid caffeine after noon or you’ll be more likely to feel jittery and to have a harder time falling asleep and staying asleep. Remember that quality of sleep is just as important quantity.

, Make time to have a hearty breakfast, an energizing lunch, and a nutritious dinner if you want to make the most of your day. You may be too busy to eat a full meal, or think that you are, but you have to make eating a priority. Don’t just slam down a muffin on the way to work; instead, have a bowl of oatmeal while you read the paper, even if that means you have to wake up fifteen minutes earlier. Don’t eat lunch at your desk to be more efficient; take a break to enjoy the sandwich or salad you’re eating at lunch. Eat a dinner that is filling enough to keep you from waking up hungry, but that isn’t so greasy or heavy that it makes you feel lethargic and gives you indigestion.


Plan your meals at the beginning of the week. This will make you more likely to stick to your healthy-eating routine.

, Planning fun into your weekly schedule is a must. You won’t feel at all in control of your life and your time if you don’t have a moment to rest from all of the hard work you’re doing. You may think that fun is a superfluous part of your week and that it should be viewed as luxury, but it should be viewed as an important part of your routine instead. Plan a mini-golfing date with your best friends, a trip to the movies with your significant other, or bake a pie with your mother on Sunday afternoon.


Do whatever you want during your fun time, as long as it helps you relax and keeps you from feeling completely overwhelmed.

, The human mind isn’t meant to focus non-stop for eight or ten hour stretches. In fact, almost anyone will need a break after working for 90 minutes straight, so you should not see the need to take a break as showing weakness. Every 90 minutes, have a snack, eat lunch, call up a good friend, take a 20 minute walk, or just rest your eyes for fifteen minutes. Do whatever you have to do to regroup and to be able to throw yourself back into your work. Taking breaks will actually help you accomplish your tasks faster because you’ll be tackling them with more enthusiasm.Exercising for 10-15 minutes can be a great way to take a break while giving yourself even more energy to get your work done.
Take a 15-20 minute power nap if you need to. Napping for this short amount of time is better for helping you regain your energy than napping for 1-2 hours, which will only make you feel groggy.

, Stop looking at your commute as time that you’ve completely wasted. Instead, listen to an audiobook while you’re driving to work, or get a headset and call a close friend or family member to catch up after work. Or just turn off the radio and use the time to reflect on your life and to see what changes you can make to improve its quality. If you want to shorten that commute, try waking up a little early to miss the worst of the traffic or leaving work a little early or late to do the same.


Commutes are often a time when people feel angry, out of control, and stressed-out. Listening to a great book you love is a way to make this time of your day be something you look forward to, instead of something you face with dread.

, If you really want to make the most of your time, then put away your phone, stop g-chatting your friends at work, and set aside a specific time for personal communication. Get away from Facebook; if you’re really addicted, then set aside a 15-minute period each day when you can check your Facebook, post updates, and see what your friends are up to. You may think that having ten browser windows open isn’t really slowing you down, but it is.


Set aside “email time”. Instead of checking your email every fifteen minutes and responding to emails sporadically throughout the day, set aside “email time” each day, which will be time for you to go through your email every day and to send back those emails. You can do this two or three times a day, or more often if your job requires it, but don’t keep that email window open so you can read every new email the second you see it.

, It’s easy to sacrifice exercise – and sleep – when you’re in the middle of a busy week. However, exercising is great for your mind and body and it will give you energy and make you feel more capable of doing everything you need to do. Drop the temptation to say you’re “too busy” to work out this week and see what you can cut out instead of exercise. Do you really have to watch two hours of TV today, or can you make time for a thirty-minute run instead? See how much room you can make for improving your body and mind.


If the hour-and-a-half yoga class is too time-consuming, see if you can take an hour-long barre class or go for a quick walk instead. Even if you don’t have time for a longer workout like you’re used to, you can still find something that works for you.

, If you’re really feeling overwhelmed and feeling like there just aren’t enough hours in a day for you to get everything done, then consider getting a job where you can work from home or have more flexible hours. Though you will have to work just as hard at home, you will have the luxury of avoiding a long commute and you may be able to find more flexible hours that fit your schedule.


Working from home isn’t for everybody. You have to be hardworking and self-motivated to be able to take the work seriously.

, Maybe working a 70-hour-a-week job just isn’t the thing you want. Maybe you want to switch career paths all together. Maybe your relationship isn’t bringing you satisfaction anymore but it’s sucking up all of your time. Maybe you love your job, but the 2-hour commute a day is killing you and you may need to move. Take a look at the big picture and see if there are any major changes you can make that can help you feel in control.

, That’s right. Stop doing things because your mother/best friend/co-worker/neighbor really need you to do them. Do them because it’s what you want to do to make your life feel meaningful and manageable. Commit to yourself before you commit to anyone else and make sure you don’t overbook yourself just to fit someone else’s needs.It’s important to learn to say no to people and to stop feeling guilty about it. If you say yes to everyone else, you’ll always be saying no to yourself.

, Do you really love photography, writing, interior decorating, or cooking? It’s a pretty radical step, but see if you can actually make money doing it, if not making a full living out of it. It may seem like a stretch, but if you have the talent and are willing to put in more time to pursue your dreams, then imagine how rewarded you’ll feel when you get to spend more time doing what you love and to make money from doing it.You may be feeling overwhelmed because you’re trying to make time to succeed in a career you don’t really care about as well as make time for pursuing your passion. This is a great way to change that.

, At the beginning of your week, start tracking how you spend every hour of your life. Be honest: if you spent half an hour texting your BFF or deciding what to wear, write it down. If you wasted forty-five minutes gossiping over gchat, write it down. At the end of the week, take a look at what you’ve done with your time and see where you can be more efficient, which things you can cut out, and what you’d like to do more. Then, create a “dream week” for yourself and try to follow it the following week.You may find that you spent a total of two hours emailing people. Can you cut that down to one hour and make an extra hour for exercise?
If you see that you’ve spent sixty hours doing work, it may be time to think about taking down your hours.

, It’s a simple question, but it’s very effective in making you see what you should really be doing – instead of what someone else thinks you should be doing – to get the most done and to feel the most in control of your day.The next time you feel overwhelmed, take a minute to breathe and ask yourself this question, and you may be surprised by what you discover.

Keep a journal.,
Start a video diary.,
Take pictures.",How to Figure out Your Life1," Document your journey to fulfillment in a journal. Journals provide you with a space to process your thoughts, evaluate your fears, and dream your dreams. Writing regularly in a paper journal or maintaining a daily blog will allow you to track your progression to happiness. Writing about your day and your emotions forces you to become more self aware. Note what brought you joy that day and jot down what made you anxious. Document an interaction with someone that is doing exactly what you want to do. As you move through your journey, periodically flip back through your journal to see how far you have come., Instead of writing about your journey to happiness, keep a video diary. Use your phone, computer, or camcorder to record your thoughts, aspirations, and realizations. Unlike journaling, keeping a video diary allows you to verbalize your thoughts—it forces you to get out of your own head. You also don’t have the added stress of starring at a blank page! Maintaining a video record will allow you to assess your growth. Rewatch the short films to see how you have changed—have your goals shifted significantly, are you more aware of what makes you unhappy, or do you have an idea of what might make you happy? Allow your realizations to influence your understanding of happiness and fulfillment., Documenting your life through pictures is an excellent way to capture memories! Snap pictures of people, places, and things that make you feel happy—take pictures of your 91 year-old grandma, a tree changing colors, a successful project. Take pictures of scenes that move you to action—snap a picture of a riot, a policeman standing guard, or a lost dog. As you collect these images, analyze their significance to you. What do they make you feel and why? Do they reveal something about your life? Are there any images missing from your collection? Apply what you discover about yourself to identify what makes you happy!"

Making a conscious, willful declaration to yourself that you will stick it out and pursue your desired outcome can help keep you motivated and push you to achieve that goal. In this case, you should be committing to living a more consistent, stable life.Think about the reasons why you want a more consistent life. Are you seeking consistency for yourself, your family, or for some entirely different reason?
Whatever your reason for seeking consistency, use it to help keep you motivated. Any time you start to doubt yourself or question your efforts, think about how much better your life (or your family's life) will be.
Reassure yourself that you can do it, and that the results will be worth your efforts.;
, Some people become addicted to chaos, which can be just as damaging as addictions to drugs or alcohol. These individuals crave what some call the reliably unpredictable - meaning that inconsistency is the only constant in that person's life.While it's good to pull yourself out of ruts by spicing things up in your life once in a while, chaos in any form is very unstable and is not very sustainable for long periods of time.


Chaos can take many forms. It may involve erratic behavior, mood swings, or being absorbed in other people's problems (often as a way of avoiding your own).
If you find yourself experiencing a lot of chaos in your life, step back and think about the ways in which you might be inviting or even pursuing that chaos.
Try to step away from other people's chaos. That doesn't necessarily mean cutting those individuals out of your life, it simply means resisting the urge to get involved in the turmoil and drama around you.
It's impossible to have real consistency in your life if you keep courting chaos. Just as you resolved to find consistency, you must also resolve to resist chaos going forward.

, Having a purpose does not necessarily mean having goals. People with purposeful lives often have clearly-defined goals that they work towards, but having goals does not inherently make a life purposeful. Developing realistic goals based on your interests and your values/beliefs may help you figure out your life's purpose and get you started in transforming your life.Part of finding your purpose may require you to define your own values, interests, and goals in life.
Having a purpose in life usually helps an individual develop consistent patterns of behavior in his day-to-day life.
Pushing yourself out of your comfort zone to explore things that interest you is a good way to find your purpose.Let your values and beliefs guide you as you figure out what your life can become and what you can accomplish.
You don't necessarily need to have everything figured out. All it takes is an interest in what your purpose is and a single act of exploration to get you started., Consistency in life extends to your daily habits and routines. Living an unhealthy lifestyle is an invitation for inconsistency and chaos. One of the best ways to make your life more stable and consistent is to start with how you actually live your live on a day-to-day basis.Make physical activity a part of your everyday life.
Eat at regular intervals, and follow a balanced diet.
Avoid smoking, or quit if you're currently a smoker.
Resist extreme binges, both in eating habits and with alcohol.
Make sure you get enough rest each night.

, Some of the biggest challenges to consistency involve anxiety and mental/emotional turmoil. Meditation has been shown to help calm an anxious mind and restore a sense of balance to your inner self. With practice, meditation can also help you become more aware of yourself, your thoughts/feelings, and your environment.Most types of meditation focus on relaxed breathing, and should be practiced on a regular (perhaps daily) schedule.Find a peaceful, quiet place.
Sit down in a comfortable position. If you prefer, you can also meditate while lying flat on your back.
Reduce distractions. Silence your cellphone or turn it off altogether.
Close your eyes (if you're comfortable doing so). If you're worried you'll fall asleep, you can simply focus your gaze at a spot on the floor just in front of you.
Breathe slowly and deeply through your nostrils, feeling the sensation of air passing through your nose.
Make sure you are breathing deep into your diaphragm (below your rib cage, in your belly area). If you're only breathing into your chest, your breath is too shallow.
Any time a thought enters your mind or something distracts you, simply return your focus to the repetition of your breath. Keep breathing slowly and deeply, in and out through the nostrils.

, Mindfulness is a type of meditation. It can help you be more conscious of your thoughts, feelings, and actions. When you live a more mindful life, it's easier to be consistent in your habits of thought and action.Pay attention to the tiny details all around you. This may start with your own actions (the way you reach for your toothbrush in the morning, the thoughts that cross your mind during your commute) and extend outward.
Try to see everything in a new light, with ""fresh"" eyes. Look for details in your everyday world that have previously gone unnoticed.
Immerse yourself in your senses. Pay attention to what you see, smell, hear, taste, feel, and think.
When you eat something, take the time to notice the way your food smells, the way it looks (color, texture, shape, etc), and as you take each bite, chew slowly to savor the complex tastes.
As you eat food, think about how much went into that food item's production. It started with sunlight and water to make it grow, a farmer's labor in harvesting it, and a truck driver and grocer's efforts to bring that food to your neighborhood.

, Sleep is how your body heals and rejuvenates itself. It's very important to get enough sleep and to ensure that the sleep you get is quality rest. The best way to ensure a good night's rest is to get into a consistent sleep pattern and stick with it day after day.Follow the same sleep schedule, even on weekends. Go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning.
Develop a bedtime ritual that helps you relax. It may involve meditation, reading, or even exercise (though some people find it hard to sleep after working out).
Keep your room at a consistently cool temperature. Somewhere between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 to 19.4 degrees Celsius) is the optimal range for sleeping.
Make sure you're getting enough sleep. Most adults need between 7 to 9 hours of sleep at night, though some may need as much as 10 hours each night., It may go without saying that you need consistency in order to be consistent. However, the fact of the matter is that you simply won't be able to find consistency in your life without commitment and without habit formation. These things can take time, so don't be frustrated if you're still forcing yourself to do these things without it feeling natural yet. Be patient, and don't give up.Some research suggests that it takes 21 days to cement a new habit into your routine. Other researchers suggest it can take up to 66 days for a new habit to become consistent in your life.
In order for you to change your life and make it more consistent, you need to maintain a constant drive to pursue consistency.
Don't give up. Finding consistency can give your life more stability, more satisfaction, and ultimately more happiness.

, Healthy relationships tend to bring stability to your life. A healthy relationship is important for your sense of wellbeing and your sense of identity, whether it's a friendship or a romantic relationship. Finding ways to make your relationships more stable and healthy can bring an overall sense of satisfaction and consistency to your life.Be respectful of one another at all times. You can joke and tease, but your teasing shouldn't be hurtful or serious.
Show respect in the way you treat one another, including the way you speak to one another.
Try to trust one another. If you have a hard time with trust, remind yourself that this person is not someone who has hurt you in the past, and it's unfair to treat him/her as such.
Support one another in all of your endeavors.
Be honest at all times. Never lie, cheat, or deceive one another, or you'll have no foundation for trust.
Share responsibility for the relationship or friendship. Be accountable for your own actions, and make sure both people contribute equally to making time together.
Be willing to compromise or negotiate in order to resolve disputes.

, Rituals are the little habits of familiarity you share with another person. These may seem like minor things, but they can be quite helpful in building a stronger relationship between you and your romantic partner or your friends.Rituals are very important, as they can help you bond with your friends or your partner on an emotional level.
Rituals can help you build a stronger connection based on familiarity and intimacy.
You don't have to have grand, sweeping gestures to turn into rituals. The best and most intimate rituals between partners or friends are the little things - the way you greet one another, the inside jokes you tell, and so on.
A ritual doesn't have to be forced. There are probably little things you do all the time without recognizing them as a sort of ritual between you, and being more aware of it as a ritual can help strengthen your bond.

, Communication is key if you want to develop stability and consistency in your relationships with others. It's important to make time to have one-on-one communication with one another, but it's also important to always be open and honest, even if your interactions are brief at times (like when you're leaving for work, for example).Strong communication is the foundation of any healthy friendship or romantic relationship.
Communication can help build consistency and stability. When you're able to talk to one another about your fears, insecurities, hopes, and dreams, you develop a strong bond, and those conversations become routine.
Speak up about things that upset you or make you feel insecure as they arise (when the time is right). Don't bottle things up, or you'll grow to resent one another.
You should be able to talk to one another about anything. Try to help one another feel comfortable enough to communicate openly and honestly at all times.

, It's important to maintain friendships that are important to you. If an otherwise meaningful friendship/relationship is strained by something petty or easy to solve, then it may be worth setting aside your differences and focusing on the friendship/relationship.If you and a friend tend to fight about something petty, try just avoiding the fight by siding with your friend. If you have fundamentally incompatible beliefs, it may be more complicated than that, but if you fight over something like whose turn it is to do the dishes, offer to just do them.
If you and a friend stopped talking over a meaningless dispute, call or text that friend and apologize. Ask if he or she would be willing to get coffee together and catch up.
Recognize that not all friendships/relationships are healthy and worth keeping. The ones that are, though, may need to be nurtured a bit more.
If you and a friend or partner do not have the measures of a healthy relationship outlined above, it may be an abusive relationship. If that is the case, you would be better off without that individual in your life at this time.

, Separating your work life and your home/personal life can be challenging. However, if you don't work to keep these facets of your life separate, there's a risk that you may become overworked and needlessly stressed. That kind of complication can dramatically affect your ability to have a stable, satisfying life in either realm, at home or at work.Don't obsess over work. It's important to be driven and career-focused, but don't spend all your waking hours at home planning for or stressing about the next work day.
Try to adjust the way you spend your time. If work is emotionally or physically draining, find something you enjoy that you can do everyday after work (or even before work).
Choose healthy and productive ways to spend your downtime outside of work. Instead of drinking alcohol, for example, try going jogging or riding a bicycle to relieve stress.
Develop a hobby or take up a cause in your free time that will give your life a greater sense of purpose.
Make sure you live a healthy life at home. That includes regular exercise, healthy eating, and adequate sleep.

, If you want to have a consistent work life, you need to be consistent from the moment you arrive until the time you head home after your shift. This begins with arriving to work prepared and on time, which is important for productivity and for ensuring that you do not risk losing your job.Identify the factors that might make you late. Is it fluctuations in traffic, finding parking, or dealing with problems at home?
If problems at home are affecting your work life, you may need to make the decision to avoid dealing with domestic issues until after work.
If traffic or parking make you late, leave early to account for those factors. You might try checking a traffic map (like Google Maps or Waze) to see where traffic is worst, and try to find an alternate route that would bypass that area and save you time.
Add up the time it takes you to get to work on a normal day and the amount of time you're occasionally late by due to factors like traffic. Then simply leave that much earlier, perhaps with an extra 10 minutes to spare in case things get really delayed.
Reward yourself for your consistency. Perhaps you can find a way to treat yourself, like holding off on eating the other half of your muffin until you get to work (but only if you make it on time or early).

, You might experience days where you're so overwhelmed with everything you need to do that you don't know where to begin. But if every day is like that, you're going to have a very hard time getting anything done, and it will be impossible to stick to any kind of schedule or routine in the workplace.Try keeping a dry-erase board or a chalk board at your workplace, and use it to list the things you need to get done that day.
Sort things out into what you can (and should) get done today, what needs to get done by the end of the day tomorrow, and what needs to be finished by the end of the week.
You can check things off the list or erase them as you accomplish them. This can help you see what you've accomplished while also reminding you what needs to be done.
Organizing and arranging your work tasks in this way can help you feel more stable and productive at work, which can lead to a greater sense of order in your life.

, If you're struggling with having a stable work life, it may be helpful to work on it with someone else. If you have a coworker you get along well with or someone you've noticed is also having trouble getting into a productive routine, you may want to approach that individual about working together to motivate and support one another. This can help you both develop consistent, productive work habits by keeping one another on track.Having someone else at work who pushes you to be consistent and productive can be mutually beneficial for both of you.
You might want to develop ways of tracking each other's progress and motivating one another to be more productive and more consistent in your work habits.
Find ways to celebrate together and reward one another. For example, you might go out for ice cream or have a drink together after work at the end of the week if you met all your goals.

Ask yourself what you really want.,
Push your response to the next level.,
Embrace your answer.",How to Figure out Your Life2," There is no incorrect reply. Your response may be silence, a shrug, or “I don’t know.” You may reply with a vague, hazy answer or a toned-down version of what it is that you really want. Sit with the answer, mull it over for awhile. Consider why you don’t know. Identify the glimpses of your honest response in your hazy reply. Capture the essence of your toned-down answer.If your answer is silence, a shrug, or “I don’t know,” overcome the fear that you may never find happiness or that you don’t deserve to feel content. Respond again with a fresh perspective!Let go of any guilt and recognize that your hopes and dreams have evolved. What used to make you happy no longer satisfies you and that is perfectly normal! Your happiness does not need to be defined by what your friends, family, or coworkers think brings you joy., Elevate your response by expanding upon those glimpses of honesty in your hazy answer or extrapolating the essence of your toned-down reply. For example, if your original reply was “I want to be happier with my career” you would elevate your answer by identifying people, places, or things that make you feel happy. Continue to push your answer further until it is specific enough to be attained. For example, if animals make you happy, consider pursuing a career as a vet or volunteering at a shelter in your spare time. If working with kids brings you joy, consider becoming an elementary school teacher. If helping others creates feelings of fulfillment, search for a job in the service industry.This process may take awhile. Remain patient, allow yourself to feel frustrated, but never dwell on the impossibility of your answer.

, Allow your answer to guide you to happiness. Don’t worry about the when, where, or why. You can’t control those factors. You can only control how you pursue your happiness. Make an effort to pursue your happiness every day. This will require you to step outside of your comfort zone. The risks, however, will force you to grow into a brazen, driven, and happy individual."

Identify your gifts.,
Recognize your passions.,
Examine your values.,
Find your calling.",How to Figure out Your Life3," Your gifts are your strengths, they are what you are good at doing. Compile a list of your strongest skills. Your list will include practical skills, like filing taxes, social skills, such as listening, and interpersonal skills, like evaluating a situation or having a high level of self-awareness. In addition to self-reporting your strengths, take a gift or skill inventory test. The results may reveal new gifts or affirm your evaluation of your strengths., Your passions reveal what you care about. You may be passionate about the environment, animals, social justice, education, or children. Your passions move you to action. What moves you to pick up a sign in protest? Do you regularly donate to an organization? If you struggle to readily identify your passions, take time to explore different issues. Educate yourself on global warming, familiarize yourself with immigration reform, dedicate yourself to social justice. Over time, you will discover your passions., Values are a set a principles you live your life by. Often, our values are derived from our religion, family, and society. Your values guide your decisions and actions. If you value integrity and honesty, you strive to tell the truth and appreciate when others are open with you. You may value equality, freedom, or family, generosity or dedication. When you work or live in an environment that does not respect your values conflict and tension naturally arises.Identify your core values by completing a series of easy exercises. Consider which characteristics are present in the people you respect—how do your parents, mentors, and teachers live their lives? Evaluate which issues inspire you to take action and why these issues excite you. Assess your community and determine 1 thing you would change. Review your answers and search for common themes. The themes and principles that emerge will resemble your values and beliefs., The key to finding your calling requires you to meld your gifts, passions, and your values. Find a way to lend your strengths to a cause you are passionate about while maintaining your values. When you reach the perfect balance of all three, you will experience a feeling of satisfaction—you will have figured out your life!Finding the perfect balance between your gifts, passions, and values may take awhile. Don’t expect to perfect the formula on your first try!

Put spacers between multiple stone monuments.,
Repair broken white stones using Portland White Cement.,
Mind the rules of cemetery washing:


Do not drive off of the access roads.,
When working with older stones it is common to have to straighten the markers.,
Wash marble stones.,
Washing granite with the following method: Use a chemical solution of 1 part Citra-Solv to four parts water.",How to Restore Cemetary Stones," Many monuments consist of two or more stones that are placed on top of each other. Once these stones should have spacers between the layers to prevent water and ice damage. Soft metal spacers are placed about ¼"" in from the edges at each corner. Old timers recommend copper pennies.;
, The broken surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned and wet when the cement is applied. The cement should be mixed with water to a heavy paste-like consistency. Apply the cement to the lower section of the stone and then place the upper section onto the lower. Brace the stone on the front and the back making sure everything is straight. Remove any excess cement with a putty knife. Gently wipe the repaired joint with a wet sponge to clean off cement from the surface and to smooth the joint. Don't wash repaired stones until the cement has had plenty of time to harden.

,
Don't let your hoses damage flowers.
If there is a funeral, do not work until it's over.
Do not let people sneak up on you.
Because of splash back, clothes fit to resist rain is usually a good idea.
Be sure to have permission from the proper authorities before you start.
Don't spend too much time reading the stones.

, It is especially common in climates where the frost goes deeply into the ground and causes the stones to shift. A shovel and pry bars are the only tools needed for most smaller markers. First dig around the stone until you can get the pry bar underneath it. With the stone pried up, fill underneath with gravel. Continue around the stone until it is leveled, and then replace the dirt and sod. Bigger monuments can require cranes and jacks to straighten. Fortunately larger monuments usually have a more extensive foundation and don't need straightening as often.

, Mix a marble cleaning solution of one gallon of bleach, one half gallon of Citra-Solv, and three and one half gallons of water. Direct spray this solution on the stone. Allow dwelling time of twenty minutes, no less. Mist the surface with water just enough to prevent drying if necessary. Pressure-wash the surface. Pay attention to the effect of the pressure on the stone. Never apply so much pressure that you cause surface damage. Most stones can be pressure washed quite hard without any damage, but some stones are softer and require a gentler touch. If the stone is soft and a shadow of the removed mildew remains, choose to leave the stain and not to damage the stone. The shadows of removed mildew lighten for a few days after washing the stone, so they get whiter with time. An extra step that you can take for difficult stones is to apply a bleach mixture a few days after washing. The mixture should be one part bleach to four parts water direct sprayed onto the stone and left there. Do not wash it off. It will help fade any remaining stains. Cold water washing works well when washing stones.

, Direct spray this solution on the stone and allow a dwell time of fifteen minutes, and then pressure wash off. Mist the stone with water during the dwell time to prevent the chemical from drying. On rough granite surfaces, lichen grows and it can be hard to totally remove evidence of where it was when you remove it. Soak the lichen with the chemical solution and don't cut the dwell time short for easiest removal. Cold water washing works well when washing stones.

Start now.,
Surround yourself with positive people.,
Measure your progress.,
Keep going.",How to Fix Your Life," Find a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed for at least 30 minutes. You will need a blank sheet of paper and pencil. If you are at home with other people, ask them politely not to disturb you as you work. Switch off any music, television or devices that might distract you. Keep your phone on silent.;
, When your life is fixed, what will that look like? How will achieving this goal affect your life? Who will be the first person to notice when your life is fixed? Consider all these things as you think about what aspect of your life needs a change.


It's okay to start fairly broad. Just work toward an idea of what you want out of your life.For example, you could consider questions such as ""What do I want to offer the world?"" or ""How do I want to grow?"", Vague goals such as, ‘I want to be happy,’ or ‘I want to lose weight,’ are difficult to achieve. Your goal needs to be SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-based.Such a goal will help you gauge your progress and let you know if you’re on track. So, instead of, ‘I want to lose weight,’ you can write, ‘I want to lose one pound every week until I weigh x pounds.’ You decide what fixing your life means to you.
It’s okay if you need to write your goal a few times before you reach a clear, concise one. Write your thoughts if it helps you process them better. Writing as you think can give you distance from your thoughts and more objectivity., Break your goal into smaller, more manageable steps that can be targeted one at a time or simultaneously, if need be. Remember to write specific, time-based, measurable goals. For example, if your goal is ‘to get a job that pays x money within one month,’ you can break that down into:


Research job listings on company websites and LinkedIn (Day 1, 2 hours)
Write resume (Day 2, 1 hour)
Have a friend proofread it (Day 3-4)
Send resume (Day 5)
Follow up on application one week after sending it. (Day 12)

, Keeping your goal(s) and plan in plain view will help keep you motivated.Stick them to your mirror/on your fridge/take a picture of them and save them as your lock screen; anywhere you know you will see them regularly.


Read your goal(s) every morning. This will renew your purpose and your desire to achieve them.Don't just glance at them: make sure you read through your them properly. Start your mornings with a sense of purpose and renewed intention. This is an integral part of achieving your goals., Acknowledge the role that you have played in reaching where you are now, whether consciously or unconsciously. Taking responsibility doesn’t mean assuming the blame for something, it means being accountable for yourself. As you see that you play a part in creating the quality of your life, so you’ll see that you can fix your life.Remember that you only have control over yourself: you can affect your actions and you can affect others, but you can not control them or the outcomes of what you do., Having a clearer idea of how you arrived in an unfavorable situation can help you avoid making the same choices later.Think of the lessons you’ve learned from the mistakes you’ve made in the past. Consider your social circle, your family circumstance, things you’ve said, things you’ve done. Consider the way you feel about things or if there is anything you’re trying to avoid. These will help with your next step.

, Make a list of all the obstacles that might be or are keeping you from achieving your goal(s). Think about your own behavior, other people you might have to talk to, amends you might have to make, things you might have to buy or things you might have to throw away. Think about the sort of people you hang around and the things you do together. Your obstacles will vary depending on your situation., For each obstacle, make a list of solutions. What will be the best way to approach this? Will you have to change your schedule? Will you have to ask people for help? Think of different ways that you can overcome the obstacle, if you come across it. Consider the pros and cons of each solution.

, Knowing these can help you identify and adopt alternative behaviors that will help you achieve your goal(s). The things you do will be key to fixing your life.On another sheet of paper, list down all the things you do that keep you from realizing your goal(s) and fixing your life. These can be big or small habits and routines. Perhaps you stay up too late watching television and this makes you late for work. Or perhaps you eat three helpings of dessert after every meal and it’s affecting your diabetes.

, Identify when and where you're more likely to engage in these behaviors. Beware of these situations and places. For example, if your goal is ‘to lose x pounds in x weeks until I weigh x pounds’ but you eat donuts when you're stressed, then stress is a trigger to look out for.Think about what leads you to behave in certain ways or find yourself in situations that you don’t like? If you have a habit of spending too much money and acquiring debt, is there a particular thought, emotion, or occasion that motivates you to shop? Sometimes the root of these issues are deeply hidden and sometimes they are right in front of our faces. Give yourself time for gentle introspection. Ask yourself when a particular problem or behavior started— you might find answers there. Is there a feeling or thought that you are trying to avoid? When you were growing up, did you see someone displaying a similar pattern?, Now that you understand which behavior is keeping your life the way it is, think of things you can do that will help you achieve your goal(s) and fix your life. The next time you are stressed, you can perhaps do breathing exercises or engage in other relaxation techniques. Or instead of spending two hours on Facebook or Tumblr before going to bed, you can spend half an hour doing that, and spend an hour and a half doing an activity that will directly help you achieve your goal(s), such as draft a resume.


Your alternative behavior does not necessarily have to be a completely different behavior. You could reduce the amount of time you spend doing one thing and instead allocate that to another.

, The next time you feel like doing something that you know is detrimental to your life, choose to do something that will help you achieve your goal instead. This will require actively choosing one behavior over another. You will need to be disciplined.


Consider asking a friend to help you change your behaviors.
Remember that you do not have to dislike something in order to stop doing it. You only have to want something else more.

, It can be tempting to think to yourself that you’ll do it tomorrow or you’ll do it after x thing happens. Procrastination stems from a fear of failure.The longer you put off changing yourself, the longer it will take to fix your life.

, The people you hang around will have a significant effect on you achieving your goals.Look for friends who will encourage you and help you to better yourself. Tell someone you trust about your plans and ask them to help you fix your life. Such people might give you valuable advice and resources that you would not have thought of on your own., The plan you laid out earlier will let you know if you are on track. As your goal(s) are time based, you have a schedule to follow. Sometimes, things happen that you didn’t account for and your plans may get delayed. This doesn’t mean that you aren’t making progress. It just means there’s an obstacle that you didn’t foresee. Don’t take this as an excuse to give up. Think of a solution, factor it in. Remind yourself why you wanted to fix your life in the first place.

, Fixing your life won’t happen overnight. It takes time to break old habits and practice new behaviors and it takes time for results to happen. You might find yourself berating yourself and being critical. Remind yourself that negative thinking leads to negative behavior.If you fall back into an old habit, that doesn’t mean you’ve failed and are back at square one. Remind yourself of your goals and why you wanted to fix your life in the first place.

Take precautions for preventing zoonosis.,
Macerate the skull.,
Remove the grease.,
Dry the skull.,
Soak in hydrogen peroxide.,
Place teeth back into their sockets.,
Use cotton on carnivorous teeth.,
Dry the skull.,
Preserve with polyurethane.",How to Preserve a Skull," Many diseases that animals carry, such as rabies, can be transmitted to humans. These are called zoonotic diseases. These diseases may remain intact even after the death of the animal. Take precautions with this in mind.Wear gloves and thoroughly wash your hands, arms or any other body part that comes into contact with the carcass.
You may also want a surgical mask during the flesh removal process.;
, Maceration refers to the removal of flesh from a dead animal. You’ll need to remove flesh from both inside and outside the skill by placing it in a bucket or large plastic bin with an enzyme-based laundry detergent. There are several methods available.


Cold water maceration is a long process that involves letting the skull soak in room temperature water with a small amount of cold-water laundry detergent. These detergents have enzymes that will break down organic matter. This is the safest way to clean the skull and leave it intact. This can take from a few days to a few weeks to complete, depending on the size of the skull.Hot water maceration, also known as ""cooking"" the skull, involves placing the skull in hot water with the enzyme detergent and simmering (not boiling) it. You can use a stove top or hot plate. The animal skull needs to be watched carefully, since simmering it for too long or boiling it will damage the skull by cooking the grease into it.Another method of removing flesh from bone is to put the skull on top of an anthill be sure to put it in a small cage or otherwise protect it from being damaged or taken by animals. The ants will clean every bit of flesh from the skull without damaging the structural integrity of it., Take the grease off of the skull by letting it soak for a few days in a mix of water and a little bit of dish detergent that cuts through grease. This process is important because if grease is left in the bone it may start to smell or get a gross build-up of grease on the surfaces of it.Use latex gloves when working with the raw material.
Change the water every day or when it gets cloudy.
This step is done when the water is clear after a day.

, Make sure that the skull is thoroughly dried out before you begin the bleaching process. Let it air dry for several days.


Leave the skull on a towel and several sheets of paper towels. Keep it inside so it doesn’t attract scavenging animals or bugs.

, Submerge the skull in a large container full of water. Include only 10-15 ounces of 35 percent hydrogen peroxide per approximately 5 liters (1.3 US gal) of water.Do not use chlorine bleach, because this can damage bone and teeth.
This turns the skull a bright white. Skulls are naturally an off-white to yellowish color.
Leave the skull in the water for at least 24 hours.

, If you use one of the water methods for cleaning an animal skull, the teeth will drop out of the tooth sockets. Save the teeth and replace them using a small amount of super glue., Most animals whose skulls are used in preservation are carnivores and have a set of canine teeth. These teeth have a tendency to be much smaller than the actual socket they fit in.Use some cotton balls soaked in glue. Wrap a bit of the cotton around the tooth and insert it into the socket.

, Leave the skull outside for 24 hours to let it dry in the sun and to let the glue set. Because the skull will have no more organic matter attached to it, you don’t have to worry about animals or bugs.

, Spray the skull with several coats of polyurethane letting each coat dry before applying the next. This leaves a smooth and shiny finish."

It may be uncomfortable to sit in your chair the entire time; you can occasionally walk around for a few minutes. If you about an hour for one task, make sure that you are working most of the time.;
, Getting started is the most difficult step, and once you get started, you are much more likely to finish.

, Do the most important things first to ensure that they will get done, even if you know that you will not have time to do everything.

, Start out by giving yourself plenty of time in the morning to get ready. If this means getting up half an hour earlier than normal, accommodate this - simply go to bed half an hour earlier to make up for it. You may want to read the paper, exercise or just listen to music. Whatever it is, make this time special and uninterrupted.

, Do not skip this important meal that provides your with morning energy.

, It can be a written list to begin with, and as you familiarize yourself with it, you will form a mental checklist. Before heading to or from work, school, activities, etc., use this checklist to make sure you have everything, such as your briefcase, backpack, purse, wallet, swimming gear, sports equipment, and notes.

, Some people like to work on a project until they finish; others need many breaks. Some prefer long sessions; others prefer short, concentrated sessions.

, If you concentrate too much on one thing, one project, or one person, time may start to disappear on you. You may have more fun if you have several projects that you are working on at once. You probably have several tasks to tackle each day, so spend some time on one and then spend some time another. This is especially important if you become stuck and do not know what to do next for that task. If you take a break and come back later, you may be able to see something that you missed before. Spread your talents, your time and your interests more widely and it will also seem as if time stretches a little to accommodate these things. Remember not to overdo commitments, however. This is just about making your focus wider.

, Do not rush into household chores, but relax for about an hour. Sit down over a cup of coffee or a snack and then start to attend to other things once your relaxation time has settled you back in comfortably. Work, chores, laundry, dinner, homework, etc. will all benefit from a rest and your rejuvenation.

, When you have finally finished your chores and activities for the day, start to get ready for bed. If you have children, put them to bed and make a little ""me"" time at night. You will want to be well rested for the next day.

, A reward can be something as simple as a small snack or a walk around the neighborhood.

If your spouse has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and no further treatments are being done, talk with your doctor or healthcare providers about options through hospice and palliative care. Often the hospital's social work department is most helpful in this situation.


Consider contacting hospice agencies directly about what they may offer. Hospice is a Medicare benefit that will generally pay 100% of medical expenses related to your spouse's primary diagnosis. Hospice benefits are often offered through private insurance too.;
, During the final weeks, your spouse may seek to make amends, and want to feel that it is ""okay to go."" Provide a loving hand, and a soothing voice, to your spouse. Let them know that that they have permission to go, as it may provide them a sense of peace and comfort. Consider doing the following in the final weeks and days:


First, ask the person what they need to be comfortable. They may want items from home, etc. They may want more jolly music or to look through old photos, etc. Respect what they do or do not want to do — if you think they might like something, and they say no, then respect their wishes and don't force it on them.
Create a peaceful atmosphere with soft lighting and soothing music. Reduce noise where possible.
Read a poem, book, or spiritual passage to your loved one.
If appropriate, engage in prayer for your loved one in this time of need.
Allow them to reminisce and reflect on their life .
Gently massage a hand or foot, or simply hold hands.

, Saying goodbye to a loved one is heart-breaking, but can be a great comfort for the loved one who is dying. While you may have many feelings of sadness, fear, or loneliness, avoid burdening your loved one with these feelings in their final moments. Allow family and friends to be share their good-byes, and give them an opportunity to visit or say a few words.


Often the ability to hear is the last of the five senses to go, so while your loved one may seem unaware, they may be listening.Check in with your spouse regularly to see if they need some quiet time.

, Your healthcare providers may help provide education about signs and symptoms for a person's end-of-life care, depending on the diagnosis. In general, a person who is at end-of-life will often sleep more, eat and drink less, become more withdrawn, and communicate less during the final one to three months before death. In the final weeks, the loved one will likely become bed-bound and may experience the following:Continued loss of appetite and thirst, with difficulty in swallowing
Increased pain, that can be treated, and fatigue
Changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing
Congested breathing due to secretions that build up in the throat, which sound like gurgling
Changes in body temperature and skin
Possible disorientation or hallucinations such as talking to people who aren't there
Slowing of urine and bowel output
Changes in sleeping patterns

, By having an open and honest conversation early, this may reduce stress in the long run. In terms of medical care and treatment, work with your spouse and family on completing an advanced directive and medical treatment preferences regarding their care. Often you want to have this conversation, then break for a while to let everyone process and think about it. This helps you and your family not be ruled by your emotions when making decisions. Reconnect later to hash out the official decisions. These can include the following: Appointing a ""health care agent"" or Medical Power of Attorney. You are the default decision-maker regarding your spouse's care, unless another family member is appointed via the advance directive; or if you are unable to mentally or physically assist with decisions.
Determining medical treatment preferences, such as Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Status if no heart rate, or unable to breathe independently.
Deciding if you wish to donate your organs or body for medical purposes.

, Talk with a lawyer about estate planning, and how to address any financial assets that may change ownership if your spouse passes. Obtain current information about your spouse's financial holdings, debts, and assets, in order to avoid headaches and surprises after your loved one passes. If seeking legal advice is too costly, look into lower cost options through your state's legal aid program, or if you or your spouse are over 60, there may be a senior legal aid hotline through your state.

, Depending on your family's spiritual background, there may be specific wishes, such as burial versus cremation. There may also be preferences about location of the burial, or where to scatter the ashes.


By understanding your loved one's specific wishes, you can honor their choices. You or other family members may have differences of opinion about how to memorialize a loved one, but the best way is to respect those choices made by your spouse.
Consider calling various funeral homes, before your loved one is near death, in order to understand the varying costs and options available. By understanding your budget for funeral expenses, you can be better prepared when the time comes, and not face additional financial burdens.

, In our modern age, your spouse may have many online accounts for email, banking, retirement, insurance, and bill paying. Collect the passwords and account details of all these accounts that need to be monitored, paid, and closed. As the spouse, you will likely become the primary person responsible for handling the bills, and closing accounts, in your loved one's name.


Consider making a ""lifebox"" folder with all the various details of the spouse's medical, financial, and personal contacts. In an emergency, it will be easier to reference this folder, than to rummage through files, or piles of paper.

, Discuss with your spouse and family if there are ways to honor your spouse after he or she has passed. Depending on what your spouse loved most, these actions could be big or small: Plant a tree
Dedicate something in your spouse's name
Give or donate personal possessions, or your time, to the community
Create a scrapbook of happy memories
Set up a charitable fund in your spouse's name

, If your spouse has a terminal illness, you may be overwhelmed by the level of care needed. Reach out to healthcare professionals such as doctors, nurses, and social workers to identify ways to reduce your physical and emotional stressors. Respite options may be available through in-home care, or care at a facility. Ask friends or family to sit with your loved one, so that you can run errands, or have a short break.
You appetite may be down, but try to eat something a few times per day. Also, nap when you feel like you could sleep, even if that's not during the night.
Find other ways for family to be useful in helping with your spouse's care. If someone offers to help, say yes. Most of the time our instinct is to say thank you, I'm fine. Then later we regret it when we are overwhelmed with things to do. Challenge yourself to find something they can do to lighten your load. Saying yes along the way can keep things from snowballing out of control.

, Be open with people who you trust about your feelings. It is natural to be sad, upset, anxious, afraid, and lonely when your spouse is near death or has passed away. This is one of the most difficult transitions you may ever experience. Here are some ways to get help:Talk one-on-one with trusted family and friends about what you're feeling.
If appropriate, talk with a chaplain or other religious support system about your feelings of loss.
Engage in activities that help you cope effectively and positively with your emotions. Avoid alcohol and other substances as a means to cope.
Join a grief and loss support group, and share with those who have had similar experiences.
Talk one-on-one with a grief counselor.

, If your spouse was the primary breadwinner, you may face financial turmoil about how to manage bills, or possibly taking on the care of children or family members without your spouse's support. This can be a shock. It is important to discuss with friends and family about the options available, and if adjustments to living situations need to be made.See if your spouse has life insurance to help with bills in the short term. You may even be able to withdraw your spouse's life insurance policy earlier without penalty, when a terminal illness has been diagnosed. Life insurance policies may also have a cash value component, but this may be less than if used upon death. If you or your spouse are over retirement age, you may have access to spousal benefits via Social Security.
A reduction in income may change your standard of living, or you may need to find work. Put the word out that you need help finding employment. You will generally have an army of people looking for some way to help.

, Each person's experience with grief and loss is his or hers alone, and cannot be determined by family or social pressures. Family and friends often want to help, but may not always know how. Be mindful that their hearts are often in the right place. Be open to accepting hope, love, and peace for the future.


Family and friends may encourage you to ""move on"" before you are ready, so kindly ask them to support you and respect your time frame. They will often say these things out of their own discomfort because they don't know what to do when you are grieving. Remember that is about them, not you.
Forgive yourself, and don't let regrets about what should have been, or what you could have done, stand in the way of remembering the good things that you and your spouse share.
Your spouse will someday pass away, but you can still continue to honor his or her memories — past, present, and future.
Remember that it is never too early to talk about the above-mentioned arrangements — even if all parties are healthy. Take action now to avoid having to deal with that stress while trying to grieve.

, Explain to them what is soon going to happen. Speak to children with clarity and respect for their dignity. There is sometimes a tendency to gloss over the realities of the situation, yet children are more understanding and can cope better with the realities of life than many adults give them credit for. Indeed, it is often the child who has the insights that calm or soothe the adult. Things to bear in mind include:


Don't tell a child that the loved one has gone away/is only sleeping. This white lie can make a child/children afraid of going to bed or they may believe that the person has gone away for a walk/holiday when they haven't. Sugarcoating the reality can make your child/children resent and distrust you.
Be honest with your child/children but use answers in an age-appropriate way. For example, your child is very young and asks ""How did grandad die?"" You could say grandad had a naughty boo-boo in his head, he was very poorly, he didn't get better, his body stopped working, he died and rests in a very special place. When the child is old enough to understand you can say that boo-boo in his head was a brain tumor and the special place he rests at is called (you can tell your child/children where the grave/stone is) and grandad loved you very much.
Children are not morbid––they are naturally curious. Respond with facts rather than emotions (it is most unhelpful to accuse a child of being morbid). If a child asks what happens after a person dies, be honest and say if the body is buried it goes through a stage called decomposing, the body rots and then body becomes just a skeleton. If they ask what cremation is, say the body is burned in a special way with very high heat and becomes ashes. Encourage children to talk about any aspect of the loss as sometimes children can find themselves misguided by other children and less helpful adults. Setting to rights any misunderstandings can help them feel better also.

, Communicate through e-mail, telephone, text or a social networking site. Times of loss can put great strain on family relationships and often, you may not want to talk about it. But remember that the loss will effect everyone and you need to stay connected or you might find family members drifting away.

, If you have regrets, or need to let him/her know something that you've kept in for years, use this time to let them know. Consider the effect what you have to say may have on your loved one and , if it is something you think will upset them more than it will matter to you to tell them, then it might be best to keep it under your hat. You don't want to stress him/her out more than they already are. They may want to know about what you, or your children's plans for the future are and telling them this could provide comfort.

, Although this may seem insensitive, you could if he or she is scared. You may be at peace once they're gone, knowing that they weren't scared to go. And if your loved one is scared, help him or her come to terms with their fears. If there's something they really want to do, and they're able- then get out there and do it! Live for today, so that you can remember it tomorrow.

, Say it like you mean it and remember how they respond. Nothing is more important than those three words and it's something you can hang onto in the future.

, They may just tell you some things that ease your mind, and will help with this process a little.

, Some may want to talk about death, funeral plans, etc., while others do not. Don't presume that you know what they want or need - ask. This is no time to play guessing games!


If a loved one pretends he or she isn't dying, and everything is going to be okay, realize that this is a defense mechanism and is misplaced hope. While it is important to be receptive to the loved one's approach to death, do not let this fantasy cause tension and problems for you and other family members. This may be the one time where it is important to not play along but to make it clear in as kind and caring a way as possible, that the loved one has a terminal illness which impacts other people too. Things are not going to be all right and much time can be wasted pretending otherwise, when sharing memories, dealing with the loved one's wishes and spending quality time together should be occurring instead.

, Everyone will have that memory of their loved one smiling and being content, or listening, remembering all of those moments. It will be a peaceful memory to look back on as well: He or she was surrounded by family, that all loved this person very much, and what could be better than having your family there, when they needed you the most?

, When they're gone, they're gone and you can't bring them back.

, Ask the loved one who is undergoing the dying process which alternative would be most appealing to him or her, and do your best to accommodate wishes. Bear in mind that costs and level of care differentiate with each option, and should be explored in greater detail before making a final decision.

, However, unless your loved one asks about it, do not tell them. They may think that you are ""doing them in.""

, Some emotions may occur once, some may revisit time and time again. Typical thoughts and emotions will include anger, fear, worry, a sense of unfairness, resentment, exhaustion, hope, joy at shared memories, wishful thinking, relief, sadness, despair and more. There is no right or wrong way to feel or think and you may find that some emotions cloud your ability to think clearly.

, Many charities offer helplines specialising in grief or distress or are linked to a specific illness. To find these for your county, try an internet search, or use the ones which are provided to you on leaflet/ guides which may be given to you at the hospital/ hospice or around for you to take. Know that there are always options and that, in the end, many of these feelings will fade. You will get through this!

, Crying is normal and it is better to let it out than keep things bottled up. When the tears come, let them out.


Do cry with your child/children and do talk about the dead person. It shows your child/children that you never forget about that person and that it is okay to cry, show anger, and express feelings and grief. Remember people grieve in different ways.

, Years from now, it may be the little things that matter, like their favorite color, their favorite dessert, etc. Hold onto these memories in ways that are meaningful to you. You might like to ask your loved one to write down a favorite recipe or two, to share his or her favorite photos, to recall a vacation spent together as a story on a recorded device for you, etc.


If you feel that other people are insisting on remembering your loved ones using rituals, approaches and concrete actions that don't align with how you wish to remember your loved one, thank them for their suggestions kindly but remind them that everyone has their own way of remembering others and that you'll be keeping to yours.
You may find it easiest to put things away that will be too hard to see, right after your loved one's death. A pair of slippers, a tie, even his/her favorite pen. Take them out when you feel as though you can handle it, but keep their memory alive with you.

, You need your energy and focus to stay on track. Occasionally this means you need to get away from what is all too real and what is happening. Give yourself short breaks to take some time out from the emotional depths that which bereavement brings. Accept that, for a while, you may feel distracted and out of focus. That's normal because your mind is still busy focusing on more important things. Give yourself time...


Voice your worries, sadness and feelings to a pet or a close friend. Anyone or anything which will listen could help release your feelings, but don't expect them to take them away. If you don't feel you can talk to family/ friends then try a work college or anybody else. Many people can be very understanding.
Go to a park or a dinner or just out with a couple of friends and relatives, and relax for a while. Continue leisure activities and sports when you are comfortable and re-establish your old routine. Don't feel guilty for doing it.

, Going to counseling before the loved one dies can help to prepare you. It is also an important bridge from this person's presence to absence in your life. If necessary, continue seeing the counselor after the loved one dies. Talking freely and openly to them will help you let feelings out; they won't judge you, as their job is to help you.

You might include things that you’ve seen done at other funerals that you though worked well.As you are sketching out ideas, pay attention to the intangibles as well. For example, what kinds of emotions do you want your funeral to create in others? Do you want your funeral to feel like a celebration or be a bit more somber in tone?;
, You will need to choose between a burial or cremation. With a burial your body is interred in the ground either with or without embalming. With a cremation your body is cremated to ash and the remains are placed in a container of your choice.You also have the option of a green burial, which is an environmentally conscious way of handling your deceased body. Go to the Green Burial Council website for additional information., It is your choice whether to have a gathering before or after your funeral or none at all. You can have a service in the funeral home or a graveyard service at the cemetery. You can have a body viewing or wake before your funeral as well.


This decision should be based, at least in part, on how comfortable you are with others viewing your body after death. You can always opt for a closed casket service as well.

, Go and interview a number of funeral directors. Read online reviews. Ask friends and relatives who have attended funerals if they have any recommendations. All funeral providers are required to provide you with a price list upon request.It is sometimes hard to differentiate between a locally-owned home and a franchise or corporation. Make sure to ask about the funeral home’s history as you shop around.
You will also want to decide if you’d like to use one facility for the entire reception and funeral process or if you would like to only purchase part of a funeral package, a direct burial without a reception for example. Many people choose to have their funeral receptions held at a church or even at their home.

, If you plan to follow religious conventions, you’ll want to reach out to your minister, priest, or rabbi to discuss the details. Some churches or individuals charge fees for their services and you’ll want to ask about these now. You may also want to discuss using the church facility for part of the reception as well.

, A eulogy is a short speech delivered at a funeral in which the speaker discussed the life of the deceased. It is not required to have eulogists and, if you choose to include speakers in your funeral, you will want to carefully select people who know you well. Ask them in advance if they would be comfortable saying a few words when the time comes., You can select a poem that is particularly meaningful to you. Or, perhaps a few sentences from your favorite author. Maybe even a few lines that you’ve written. Spoken song lyrics also often work well. Select the readings that you would like to include and consider who you would like to read them as well.You might say, “I’ve started thinking about my funeral plans and, when the time comes, I would really like for you to read a passage from Poe, if you are okay with that.”

, Think about the type of atmosphere that you would like during your funeral. Would you prefer violins or flutes? Do you want music at the graveside or just at the church reception afterwards? Be aware that you can also opt for a combination of live and recorded music as well. Makes notes regarding your wishes and discuss them with the funeral director.

, Consider keeping a file on your computer containing possible memorial images to be used solely or as part of a general video during your funeral. You can also put these images on a zip drive and give it to a relative.


With technology now you can get even more creative if you like and request that your tweets or blog entries are also incorporated in your funeral. They could be added on to the program or projected alongside photos of you.
It is also a good idea to put a close friend in charge of alerting the online community (Facebook, Twitter) regarding your passing. You can script a message for them to send along or leave it up to them., All of the personal touches that you add may have associated fees. And, regardless of whether you choose cremation or burial, your funeral home will likely add a set of standard fees onto your final bill. These fees can include the cost of obtaining death certificates or even housing your body. Keeping in mind how much you can reasonably spend will help you to make realistic choices.For example, you can sometimes opt out of embalming and choose refrigeration instead, which can cut the cost., Many funeral homes will accept payment for your service in advance. Ask the funeral directors about their policies in this area. Some states require that these monies go into a trust of some sort for security, whereas other locations offer very little in the way of security."
"
Choose a casket.,
Select a vault or liner.,
Purchase a burial plot.,
Arrange for a headstone or grave marker.",How to Plan Your Own Funeral2," Ask to see a written casket price list at each funeral home. Then, ask to see the actual caskets on display. Compare the list to the display models. If you don’t see the particular model that you are interested in, request a visual of some sort. Caskets can vary widely in terms of materials and cost, so it is best to shop around a bit.Some caskets are made of wood while others are constructed from fiberglass, plastic, fiberboard, cardboard, or metal. The interiors vary widely as well. Some caskets have basic fabric patterns while others display a velvet or silk.
A standard casket will cost you upwards of $2,000 with some specialty ones selling for over $10,000.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guarantees that your funeral home will allow you to use any previously purchased casket for your funeral. So, don’t feel pressured to purchase everything at one time in one place.

, Most cemeteries make you purchase a liner of some sort. A quality liner will keep the grave from sinking and caving in. You can often buy a liner at the funeral home, but you should feel free to shop around as well for the best price. Be aware that the liners are often not customizable., Consider whether you would like a single-depth space (to fit one person) or a double-depth space (designed for two). You can also investigate getting a spot within a family plot or starting a family plot yourself. Expect to pay somewhere between $200-$5,000 for a single-depth plot.You will also want to ask the funeral home about the cost of grave digging and cemetery care as well. Many cemeteries will keep an account in place for long-term care.

, Most cemeteries will have regulations regarding the types of markers they allow. Ask about these restrictions and then start to shop around. A traditional granite headstone can cost you upwards of $1,000. Expect to pay a premium for additional customized options or expensive stone types."
"
Know your cremation options.,
Select an urn.,
Investigate regulations regarding the scattering of ashes.",How to Plan Your Own Funeral3," A cremation can cost in the hundreds or thousands of dollars depending on the choices that you make. You will want to decide whether or not to have a viewing of your body beforehand and what type of ceremony to have for the interment process. Do you want your cremated remains to be buried, kept in an urn, or scattered?Direct cremation refers to the process of cremating the body without a viewing or gathering beforehand.
If you would like a viewing beforehand, you may want to look into the option of renting a casket for your body. If you opt for a cremation your funeral director will provide a container that will hold the body secure during the cremation process itself., You will want to designate a container to hold your ashes post-cremation. You can shop around or use a family item as an urn. Or, you can look for another container or box that suits your personality. The container itself can be placed in a cemetery or taken home by a relative or someone else of your choice., Many people like the idea of having their ashes scattered but you will want to leave very specific instructions behind discussing how to go about it. You will want to receive advance permission to have your ashes scattered on private or government-owned property. You will also want to make absolutely sure that this is your final choice as it is irrevocable once completed.Some cemeteries set aside a particular area where mourners can scatter ashes as they so choose. Ask the funeral directors that you meet with if they provide such a service.
Note that if you decide to scatter ashes in the ocean you must be a minimum of three nautical miles offshore. For more information contact your funeral director or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Write your own obituary.,
Compose personal letters to family and friends.,
Make a packet for your relatives.",How to Plan Your Own Funeral4," This can be a difficult task even for those people close to you, so it is helpful to at least start the process off. You can create an outline stating the major points that you would like covered. Or, you can write out an entire draft and provide a list of the places that you would like it sent to., It is always a nice gesture to write a few, quick words (or even a more lengthy note) to those people closest to you. These letters can be designed to be opened right after your death, as opposed to the weeks it may take to process your will and related effects. Be honest and sincere in these letters and use them as an opportunity to say an extended good-bye.


It is a good idea to update these letters every so often. You can ask your lawyer to hold onto them for you or you can give this task to someone you trust.

, Go through all of your documents and notes and make copies. Give one copy to your attorney and a few others to family members who you trust. This will allow them to act on your preferences without delay. Many funeral homes will also file your plans away for you, usually free-of-charge.Avoid putting your only plan copy into a safe deposit box as it could be difficult for your family members to access it quickly. The same goes for a will, which can be read days after a funeral.The Funeral Consumers Alliance has a funeral planner available for purchase ($15) as well. You can use this binder to contain and carry all of your assorted paperwork too. Some companies also offer funeral planning via a website subscription, such as My Wonderful Life.

Understand the cost.,
Consider pre-planning your funeral needs.,
Receive full disclosure on estimated costs.,
Pay in advance.,
Investigate death benefits.,
Establish a Totten Trust.,
Avoid purchasing plans from funeral directors.",How to Pay for Funeral Expenses1," The average funeral costs $7,755 according to The National Funeral Directors Association. For some this is not much but for others it is a number they cannot hope to reach. This number is also a pay upfront proposition, as funeral homes will no longer accept payment plans. So when you are thinking about planning ahead, know that this is the number you need to target.You should be able to get a very simple, basic funeral done for approximately $3,000 in many parts of the United States. So the less frills, the more affordable it is.
Consider cremation as a basic direct cremation costs approximately $1,000.;
, Making funeral decision arrangements while not in a time of emotional distress will allow you to make more level-headed choices in regards to necessary funeral items such as caskets, outer burial chambers, and more.

, This includes an itemized breakdown of every line item for both funeral home costs as well as outside vendor expenses that are being billed through the funeral home establishment. These can include flowers, music, clergy honorarium, and newspaper notifications. Review all of these expenses to approve them before signing any contracts with the funeral home facility.


Keep this itemized list so that you and your loved ones can be sure to receive all that you have paid for.

, Preplanned funerals can often take advantage of this option and, generally, do so via installment payments. These can usually be made in any payment format, such as cash, money order, credit card or check.


Keep track of all receipts so the funeral isn’t paid for twice either by you, if you will be handling the end of life arrangements for another, or your family after you have passed on.
Be aware that funeral homes are a business. They may try to up-sell you on additional goods and services that are not strictly necessary. It’s best if your insurance company is one that takes care of and approves any additional expenses, as this cuts out the ‘’middle man’’ and eliminate these worries.There will, invariably, also be additional last-minute charges tacked on so put aside an extra $1,000-2,000 in savings just in case.

, These will be part of the life insurance policy so you will need to speak to the insurance agent handling the policy on a regular basis to ensure that you have selected enough insurance to cover, or at least help to cover, the funeral expenses. This is applicable to both yourself and any family members for which you are responsible.When you meet with the agent you can also discuss the payout procedure as well as the timing of it. This way you will have a better understanding of when life insurance policy money will be available to you of your family in order to make funeral payments.
At the time of passing, the funeral director will need to be provided the life insurance policy details and who to contact so that he/she can call the insurance company and confirm the policy’s active status, the total benefits, etc. Be certain not to sign away the entirety of the benefit but rather only the agreed upon good-faith estimate. The rest should go to you. This way you remain in control of the money and can approve or disapprove any additional costs.
Never disclose the total value of the life insurance policy to the funeral director or anyone at the funeral home. It’s none of their business.

, This you can do at your bank and guarantees that 100% of the money you put in remains in the trust earning interest for you. If you decide later to be cremated instead, you can withdraw all of your money without penalty. Should you or your loved one pass away, the deceased’s family controls the money in the trust, including any left over after funeral expenses are paid.Be aware that the funeral director will attempt to lure you into purchasing their trust by offering a higher percentage yield on your money, perhaps several points more. The Totten Trust, however, will yield you more money in interest due to the myriad of rules associated with the funeral director’s trust AND will keep the money in your control at all times.

, While sold as peace-of-mind options to make end of life decisions easier for you, these are often filled with arcane rules that take advantage of every bit of leverage for the funeral director and the company he/she works for, not you.Insurance policies purchased from a funeral director include restrictive fine print. They also add their own fees and premiums to the total, and in most cases they are turning around and purchasing a plan from another provider at a deep discount.
Don’t put your money in their trust-based prepayment plans. Most states only regulate a portion to be put in an interest-bearing account for you; the rest is put in an account to work for the funeral director. Add in exorbitant fees for canceling or cashing out the trust, administrative fees, and continuing payments that, if not made in strict adherence to the policy, can lock up the trust and result in more administrative fees for the funeral director, and you can see the litany of reasons why you need to avoid this type of account.

Using the deceased’s estate.,
Split the costs among family.,
Throw a fundraiser.,
Call the deceased’s employer.,
Look into accident or victim compensation.",How to Pay for Funeral Expenses2," Many funeral homes, while not accepting payment terms, will negotiate in good faith for deferred payment if you can provide enough information to show them that they will undoubtedly get paid after probate proceedings conclude., If a surprise passing leaves little to no money left for funeral expenses in the deceased’s estate, splitting the bills amongst family helps defray the costs so that no one person is left paying for the whole thing. Get together and plan the funeral so that the overall budget fits into each person’s share.Since not everyone makes the same amount of money, you can weight the shares contributed so that those family members who can afford more pay more.

, Oftentimes people belong to organizations or groups that provide support for one another in different ways. Artists, churches, businesses, and others will lend a hand to help raise money to defray the costs for things such as medical bills and funerals. With websites like Indiegogo and Kickstarter, there are easy ways to set up pages for those to donate what they can to help.These usually take some time to set up and generate donations so you will have to rely on the deceased’s family, friends, and connections to spread the word quickly in order to raise the amount of money you need in a short period of time.

, The HR department will have all the information for benefits that were part of the deceased’s benefits package. If he/she was a member of a union they too may have benefits to help cover or defray funeral costs.

, If the deceased was killed in an accident or a victim of a crime, you may be able to procure assistance."

Reach out to the United Burial Fund.",How to Pay for Funeral Expenses3," There is a one-time payment of $255 from the Social Security Administration if you are an eligible surviving spouse of someone receiving certain Social Security benefits that is meant to help pay for funeral costs. If there is no surviving spouse, the payment can made to a child who is eligible for benefits.


You will need the Social Security Administration notified as soon as possible when a person dies. Usually, your funeral director will report the death, but in order to do so, you will need to furnish the decedent's Social Security number to that director so the report can be made.

, This site will offer you tips and vital information on what NOT to do when planning and/or committing to a funeral.

Relay a fond memory.,
Offer your help.,
Don’t take up too much of their time.,
Send a card.",How to Pay Your Respects when Someone You Know Dies2," Typically, after the service, mourners may line up to express their condolences to close family and friends of the deceased. When it’s your turn, keep it simple and straightforward. Go for something like “I am so sorry for your loss.”If you are attending a wake or viewing, you will typically greet and console the person's family before viewing the body.

, In an attempt to comfort the bereaved, some people communicate phrases like “Everything happens for a reason” or “God makes no mistakes.” Even if they are well-intended, such platitudes may offend close family, especially if they do not share the same religious or spiritual beliefs.Avoid phrases that minimize the person's experience, like ""I know how you feel."" Even if you have lost someone, too, this day is not about your own loss. Focus on the person who has died only instead of comparing their death to someone else's.
If you know the person is religious, it may be appropriate to communicate sincere words, like ""I am praying for you and your family.""

, If you want to say more, it can be thoughtful to communicate a fond memory you have of the bereaved. This reminds them of the good times the person had, or of their kindness or compassion.For example, you might say, “Ms. Henry, I am truly sorry for your loss. Mr. Henry was such a caring man. I’ll never forget that time he pulled over in the rain to help me with a flat tire. He was one of a kind.”

, You can show your sympathy in a practical way by offering to help the family. When people are grieving, basic chores like cooking, cleaning, or picking up groceries may be left undone. Offer to come by the family home and help out as needed, if you are close to the family.Make your intentions to help clear, such as saying, ""I'll come by on Tuesday to help with cleaning or cooking.""
In addition, you might drop off prepared foods like casseroles or sandwiches to ensure the family has food to eat.

Understand the rules in your state.,
Find out who the executor, administrator, or personal representative is.,
Find out how much money is in the estate.,
Check to see if the funeral has been prepaid by the decedent.,
Pay for the funeral yourself and have the estate reimburse you.,
Sign over any life insurance policies to the funeral home.,
Ask the funeral home to file a claim against the estate.",How to Pay for a Funeral from an Estate," The probate process is simply the process of gathering a decedent's assets, paying bills, and distributing remaining assets among heirs under the supervision of the court. In some states you will need to file paperwork to verify the death, prove that you have notified all creditors and inheritors, and validate the will. In other states you may need to attend a court hearing.Many states in the United States have adopted the Uniform Probate Code (UPC), which greatly simplifies the probate process in most cases. Other states have not accepted the UPC, so the probate process may be slightly different.
If the decedent did not have a will, the court will decide how the estate should be divided in accordance with state law.;
, The terms will vary depending on your state and on whether court proceedings are required or not, but regardless of the term, this is the person who is responsible for paying the decedent's bills and distributing any remaining funds in accordance with the decedent's will.


An executor is named in the will, an administrator is appointed by the court in situations where no executor has been named, and a personal representative can refer to either situation.
If you are the executor, you will be responsible for gathering information about the decedent's assets and debts, paying bills (including those for the funeral), and distributing the remaining funds to the heirs., Knowing exactly how much is available will allow you to plan an appropriate service without having to worry about how to pay for it.


Joint bank accounts held by the deceased and others may be accessible through and provide money for funeral expenses.
If you are not the executor of the estate, you will need to work with this person to establish a budget for the funeral based on the funds available in the estate and the other bills that need to be paid.
Keep in mind that if there is not enough money in the estate to cover funeral expenses, the person who signed the funeral contract will be responsible for paying the balance.If there are limited funds in the estate to pay for the funeral, keep costs low by shopping around at different funeral homes, declining costly upgrades proposed by the funeral directors, or considering cremation instead of burial. If the decedent has other close living relatives, make sure to include them in your decisions., When a party prepays for a funeral, the funds are held by the funeral home in a trust account until the party’s family needs them to pay the funeral expenses.Search the decedent’s estate planning documents, and check with his or her estate-planning attorney. If the funeral has been prepaid, there will be documentation regarding the prepayment and the trust account.
Check the decedent’s federal tax return records for any 1099 forms reporting interest earned from a trust account. This may be a clue that a prepaid funeral trust exists. The 1099 should contain the name of the funeral home holding the account.
Call all of the funeral homes in the area and ask if the funeral expenses have been prepaid. The funds may not be refundable if not located before the funeral has been held elsewhere.
The decedent may have also set up a Totten Trust, which is a special bank account set up for the purpose of paying funeral and burial expenses. Check with all banks that your loved one used to see if such an account exists.Even if the decedent did not prepay for the funeral, he or she may have pre-planned with a funeral home, which basically entails selecting the desired services without making a financial commitment. Be sure to check for any evidence that the decedent planned the funeral so you can stay in line with his or her wishes.
Note: be aware of unscrupulous funeral directors that may try and upset services for either financial or personal reasons.

, Oftentimes, the funeral home requires payment long before an estate can be opened and expenses paid from the estate account. Because of this, the most common way of paying for a funeral from an estate is for the executor to pay the bill and then be reimbursed when the probate proceedings are finished.Submit a receipt to the personal representative of the estate, which clearly shows that you paid for the funeral, and the amount paid. Include a request for payment.
If it appears at any point that you will not be reimbursed, file a claim against the estate. In all states, your time to file a claim is limited, and you should act quickly in order to ensure that you receive payment from an estate. To file a claim, check with the County Clerk’s office. They should be able to provide you with the proper form and assistance in filling it out and filing it with the Court.
If you are a joint owner on the decedent’s bank account, pay the funeral expenses from the joint account. As long as you keep a receipt, the payment will be considered an estate expense and not an inheritance.

, Most states and funeral homes allow a personal representative to assign a life insurance policy made payable to the estate to the funeral home for payment of funeral expenses.Try to avoid signing over more than the good faith estimate provided by the funeral home. Funeral directors are supposed to refund the over-payment to the estate, but it is extremely easy for them to inflate the charges and leave the estate with nothing left over.Talk to your funeral director for information on how to assign a policy to the home for payment of the funeral expenses.
Note that the return of any remaining money by the funeral home may be a complicated and lengthy process and in the worst case may require legal action.

, After a decedent’s death, creditors may collect payment from the estate by filing a claim with the court. Claims for funeral expenses are considered priority claims and are paid first, along with final medical expenses and estate administration fees. Talk to the funeral director and see if he or she is willing to collect payment of the funeral expenses from the estate in this manner.

Put everything together.",How to Pick Music for a Funeral," If the memorial service is going to take place at a funeral home, you will be able to play almost any music that you like. However, if the service will be held at a religious establishment like a church, then you may be held to the traditions and restrictions of that religion. Be sure to consult with a clergy member to discuss any possible rules in regards to music.Even if you can’t play particular songs during a service, you may be able to play them while people are entering/exiting.;
, Though recorded music is both cheaper and easier to find, live musicians can add a more intimate touch to a service. If the funeral is taking place in a religious organization, you may also be able to utilize whatever musicians participate in regular services. For example, many churches employ choirs and guitarists.If you are going through a funeral home, check with the service director for what music they have on hand. Many funeral homes have a large collection of music from varying genres.

, Though it can be difficult and emotional, asking a family member or close friend of the departed to sing can add a deeper sense of intimacy to a funeral. However, be sure to double-check with whoever you ask, as this can be quite a sensitive undertaking. You don’t want them to be unable to perform or feel overly pressured because you asked.


Try something like, “Hey Sarah, I was wondering if you would want to sing at Mary’s service? I know this is a difficult time, so please don’t feel pressured to say yes. I just know the two of you were close and she always appreciated your voice.”

, A funeral is both a memorial and a celebration of the life of someone who has passed. As such, it’s important to choose music that reflects who they are. For example, if they had a favorite song or artist, try considering these options first. Also, if there is a particular song connected to an important event or memory of this person, it can be a heartfelt way to pay tribute to their life.

, Not only will these people have a good idea of what the departed listened to and enjoyed, they will also be able to contribute ideas. For example, they can tell you about special songs that reflect moments of the deceased’s life. Perhaps a song linked to a shared childhood memory, or a significant family moment.


Try approaching them in a private moment and saying, “Hey, I’m trying to put together some meaningful songs for Mary’s service. Is there anything special you know she wanted or that you would like?”

, If you are still having trouble after speaking to family and friends, try searching online for typical funeral songs. There are a multitude of sites that offer song ideas from every genre, like the Funeral Celebrants Association. Try browsing through lists for things like “the top 10 funeral songs,” or “common songs for funerals.” These lists should give you a good general idea, which you can then build from and tweak to meet your own needs., Once you have a good idea of what kind of music you want, it’s important to decide what songs will be played when. For example, when people are arriving and being seated, while people are waiting for the funeral to start, and between readings or eulogies. During times of procession or waiting, playing some of the deceased's favorite songs can be a good idea. You can also try sticking to instrumentals between readings.Ask other family members or close friends of the deceased for their opinion. They can help you put together a list to try and narrow things down.
You can also ask the funeral home or a clergy member for what is typically played and when. They should also give you a good idea of how many songs you need for the service.

, Before you pick a song, make sure to thoroughly go over every piece of it. For example, listen to it a few times and make sure the lyrics are appropriate in context. Certain songs, even if a favorite of the deceased, are not acceptable for a funeral service. Songs with copious swearing or dark lyrics are likely to make guests uncomfortable.


Some standard funeral songs with good lyrics are Louis Armstrong’s “What a Wonderful World,” or Michael Crawford’s “One Eagle Wings.”

, After you’ve chosen your songs and decided on a setlist, try to get all of the music together. If you are going to use music directly from the funeral home, make sure you pick up the CDs as soon as you can. If you are using your own music, then burning a CD of your own, transferring songs to a USB drive, or putting songs into a playlist on a music player like iTunes is a good idea. You don’t want to get to the service and realize you’ve forgotten something. Having everything altogether will also make playing the music much easier.

Talk to the family.,
Discuss plans for the service.,
Take notes.,
Get family addresses and contact info.,
Write a eulogy, using your notes.,
Arrive early for the service.,
Conduct the service.,
Stay afterwards.",How to Officiate at a Nondenominational Funeral Service," Call the family and arrange to meet them, preferably in their home. Meeting them in public is OK in a bind, but if that's the arrangement, try not to meet more than two to three people. If a funeral home is taking care of other arrangements, the funeral directors may have space at the funeral home where you could meet. Invite the family to have other family members and close friends present if they wish, but be sensitive to their needs and to the space considerations.;
, When you meet the family, let them know what you have in mind for the service. If they have their own ideas about what they want to see done or not done, make every effort to incorporate those ideas. However, don't leave them with a lot of open-ended questions about decisions that they need to make. You are there to help guide them, not to further complicate the process.

, Bring a notebook and be prepared to take many notes about the loved one that has passed away. Get as much information as you can so that you can present a story of the person's life from birth to death. Be sure to obtain the particulars such as birthday, school information, marriage, work history, children and grandchildren, and accomplishments. Pay special attention to the anecdotal memories that the family shares, especially stories that bring smiles. Ask them if there is music or any special readings that they would like to have incorporated into the service. Encourage them not to pick more than two or three songs, since those can be an emotional overload. Also let them know that you are available to read poems or letters that they've written in case they find that they can't share on the day of the service.

, Thank the family and make arrangements to send a copy of your eulogy so that they can review it and make sure it is accurate. Obviously, sending a eulogy by e-mail is the easiest way to accomplish this, but delivering it in person or faxing it are other possibilities. Ask them if there's a gathering afterwards that they would like you to announce.

, Make it positive in tone, but don't be afraid to mention less-than-happy things if they contributed to the person's life. Be sure that you read the eulogy aloud to measure the amount of time that it takes to deliver it and to make sure that you establish your rhythm. Two to three pages of written text should be sufficient.

, On the day of the service, arrive at least half an hour early with the final draft of the eulogy. Be available for any last minute words or arrangements that the family may have, but give them space to grieve. This can be a very trying day for them.

, You may want to open with one of the pieces of music that they've chosen. Then, welcome the family and open with a word of prayer or remembrance. After the prayer, read the obituary as a way to acknowledge the family members that are included in it. Deliver the eulogy. After the eulogy, invite the friends and family to come forward and share their own thoughts. This is a perfect place to insert a song to give them time to think. If, after about half a minute, no one comes forward, then make some light comment about how difficult it can be to speak at a funeral, and finish by closing the service with prayer.

, Make yourself available to the family and friends afterward, but unless you know the family personally, you may want to gracefully excuse yourself shortly after and give them space.

Recognize that death-related fears are normal.,
Focus on what you can control.,
Accept loss.,
Think positively about the world.",How to Overcome the Fear of Losing a Loved One1," Most people fear the death of a loved one at some point in their lives.Additionally, most people experience loss of loved ones in their lifetime.According to terror management theory, thinking about death or a loved one dying can produce paralyzing fear.Thinking about another person dying also highlights our own mortality.


Know that you are not alone. Other people can empathize with your situation because they have probably dealt with a similar issue. If you feel comfortable, you can share you feelings with others that have dealt with loss and this can help you have a sense that you are supported and validated in your feelings.
Validate your own fears and feelings. Say to yourself, “It is okay to be fearful or sad. These are normal responses to the situation.”;
, If you are caring for an ill loved one, this can create additional anxiety, distress, burden, and loss of independence.While you can definitely do your best to help your loved one, you may not be able to control how long your loved one lives. Focus instead, on what you can do today such as spend time with him or cope healthfully with your fear and sadness.


Think of everything you can control about the situation. For example, you can control your own behaviors – what you chose to do about the situation. You can focus on doing your best to comfort and care for your loved one. You can also focus on soothing yourself and expressing your own emotions with loved ones in order to process your grief.
Let go of what you cannot control. Visualization and imagery can help use gain perspective on what we can and cannot control. Imagine placing your fears on leaves that are floating down a river. Watch them as they drift away.
Set your limits. If you are caring for a loved one who is ill, this can cause a variety of extra challenges including stretched limits, anxiety, and depressed mood.Only do what you can do, and set aside time to take care of yourself. You may need to set boundaries with others in order to preserve this time alone.
Use mindfulness to pay attention to the present moment. We fear because we are thinking about the future and what might happen instead of focusing on the here-and-now and what you can do with this moment. Take charge of what is happening right now (as you are doing by reading this)!

, Studies show that when people have more acceptance surrounding death in general, they have an easier time dealing with loss and show more resilience overall.You can begin to practice acceptance by making a list of all of the difficult emotions and thoughts that coincide with the fear of losing your loved one. Write down your most intimate thoughts and fears and accept each one. You can say to yourself, ""I accept my fear and pain. I accept that I might lose this person some day. It will be hard, but I accept that loss is a part of life.""
Remind yourself that death is a part of life. Unfortunately, loss is also something that almost everyone deals with in their lifetime.

, When individuals believe that the world is just and fair, they are more resilient and have a less difficult time coping with the loss of loved ones.One way to think positively about the world is to recognize the circle of life and that both life and death are natural. In order for there to be life, there must be death. Try to see the beauty in both life and death. The life cycle is an amazing thing that we can learn to appreciate and be thankful for. When one person dies, another can live.
Practice gratitude. Say something to yourself like, ""I may lose my loved one, but at least right now I have the time to spend with him. I will focus on this and be grateful for this time that I have. I am so thankful for each moment I get to spend with him."" We can also choose to be grateful that we all, including our loved ones, have the chance to experience life.
If your loved one is in pain, you can focus on the idea that after he passes there will be no more suffering. You could focus on the fact that regardless of his (and your) beliefs, he will be resting in peace.

Use your coping resources.,
Take deep breaths.,
Bolster your self-esteem and independence.,
Create meaning and purpose.,
Get in touch with a higher power.",How to Overcome the Fear of Losing a Loved One2," Having inadequate coping resources pre-loss is associated with higher difficulties and chronic grief after the loss of a loved one.Thus, it is crucial to employ coping mechanisms when you are fearful of losing a loved one.


People typically have ways to cope with certain emotions such as fear, loss, grief and depressed mood. Some examples of positive ways of coping with fear of losing a loved one include exercise, writing, art, nature activities, spiritual/religious behaviors (such as prayer) and music.
Deal with your feelings appropriately; allow yourself to feel them and let them out if you need to. Higher depression levels (prior to the death of a loved one) may indicate a better adjustment to loss once the loss occurs.Crying can be a healthy and normal release of pent up sadness and fear.
Keep a fear journal. Write down your thoughts and feelings about losing your loved one.

, If you find yourself in a panic or having extreme anxiety about the thought of losing a loved one, deep breathing exercises can help to reduce physiological reactions (heavy breathing, rapid heart-beat, etc) and help you feel calm.


Sit or lie down in a comfortable place and position. Breathe deeply and slowly in through your nose and exhale out through your mouth. Concentrate solely on your breathing pattern. Pay attention to your stomach/diaphragm as it moves in and out as you breathe.

, High self-esteem is a protective factor against difficulties dealing with issues related to death.However, relationship issues such as conflict and excessive dependency on others may result in individuals becoming more vulnerable to chronic grief after the passing of a loved one.Be more independent and plan for a life of independence. Trust that it will get easier and you will be able to cope with it.

, Believing that the world has meaning (a point) helps people deal with the reality of death and can help reduce the fear of losing a loved one.Having a purpose in life means living for specific reasons (such as for family, an occupation, to help the world, give back to the community, etc.) rather than just existing or surviving. If you have a purpose or multiple purposes in life you can focus on what you will accomplish and carry on if your loved one passes away. This gives you reassurance that you will continue to have something to live for if you loved one is no longer with you.


Remember that you are a valuable member of society. Focus on what you do that contributes to the world. Do you help others? Are you kind to strangers? Do you donate to a charity or volunteer your time? Acknowledging these attributes can help you realize that you have a purpose, and can continue that purpose despite losing your loved one. You can even dedicate certain activities or projects to your loved one in the future.
Try to create meaning in death. An example of creating meaning out of passing away is that death is necessary for life, or that death is simply a gateway to another dimension or reality (such as belief in an afterlife). What does death mean to you? Will your loved one live on in an afterlife? Will you loved one live on in the memories of his loved ones? Or, will his contribution to society live on?

, A higher power can be anything that is greater and more powerful that yourself. Having a connection or thinking about your religious, spiritual beliefs, or worldviews helps individuals cope with death-related themes.If you aren't religious or do not believe in a divine creator, you can focus on a higher power such as nature (the moon and ocean are very powerful). A higher power can also be a group of people (since groups can be more powerful than one person).
Write a letter to your higher power expressing your fears about losing your loved one.
Pray to your higher power about your feelings and thoughts. Ask for the outcome that you desire (for your loved one to make it through, or for your loved one to not suffer, etc).

These end-of-life conversations can be very difficult, but you want to make sure you get what you want to convey across so that you don't have regrets. You can try writing down what you what to convey to your loved one before you tell him.

, Families who stick together in continuity and support during times of loss are better at enduring difficult emotions associated with loss.If you feel the need to talk to a family member or friend, consider asking them. Chances are, you aren't the only person who needs comforting.Surround yourself with family members and create unity through talking about shared memories or engaging in activities together.

, Not only do family interactions assist in lessening the fear of losing a loved one, but relationships outside the family are also useful in increasing ones ability to positively cope with the anticipation of loss.It is helpful to discuss your feelings and thoughts with others in order to reduce fear and anxiety.If you are religious or spiritual, try talking to your service leaders to comfort you and help find some appropriate prayers.

, Not only do we need social support when we are worried about someone dying, but giving social support to others is a great way to feel better.Talk to Your Children About Death. If you have children, make sure to spend some special time talking about the subject of passing on.

, One of the biggest fears people have when considering the death of a loved one is the ending of that relationship.However, a relationship with someone lives on past death, in your memories, your prayers, your feelings and thoughts about the person.

Once you arrive, give her a healing hug, and to anyone else who needs one. Some hugs call for a longer duration. Hug the person for as long as she needs.
If you live far away from your mother or friend, contact her by telephone to determine if your presence is needed. Rely upon your intuition or the suggestion of a family member whether you should make arrangements to be by her side.
If you are an acquaintance, contact the bereaved within a reasonable amount of time, which may be within the first 24-48 hours and two weeks. Make sure you acknowledge the passing to avoid being thought of as forgetting to do so, or being insensitive.;
, There are comments that might be perceived as offensive or that minimize the person’s profound loss.The last thing you want to do is upset the grieving person more than she already is. She is not ready to hear certain types of information. It is too early in her journey.


Stay away from comments such as: “I know exactly what you are feeling”; “This is all God’s plan”; “Your husband is in a better place”; “I know he’s gone, but look at all the things you can be thankful for”; “You should be feeling better in no time.” You can never feel someone’s feelings, assume anyone is religious or believes in a “God’s plan,” imply she should be grateful, or that you have any idea about how long she will be grieving.
Many times you might not know what to say to someone in this situation.Let her lead the conversation. Be comfortable with silence as this might be just what she needs.

, These are extremely sensitive times, so limit what you say to supportive phrases that acknowledge the situation, express your concern, and don’t hide your feelings.


For example you can say, “I heard that ______died today and I am so sorry to hear this. I never know what to say when things like this happen. Please just know that I care about you and will help in any way that I can.”
When a person is upset they may not think clearly and might not be able to tell you how you can help. Make suggestions such as, “Let me pick up the kids from school this week, or go grocery shopping, or baby sit your dog. I’m here for you in whatever way you need.”

, When a person has lost a spouse, it is difficult to even say the words, “_________ died today.” Although it might be a struggle to be the bearer of bad new, offer to call family, friends or work colleagues to let them know of the passing.This task can be separated between relatives, friends and work associates. This will unburden her and allow her a little peace during the crisis.


Make a list of contacts that she approves of and ask her what she is comfortable sharing with them. If she says she doesn’t know say the following, “I will share that he passed at ______ from a ______ and arrangements are pending. I will tell them that you wanted them to know and I am helping notify everyone. Does that sound good?”
After the initial crisis, make calls to those people who were not informed of the passing.
Keep track of any special messages that people tell you so you can convey the words of love and support to your mom or friend. Healing words are needed from any and all sources. People will also send letters, flowers or notifications of donations made in honor of the deceased. With the widow's consent, you can help by sending “thank you” notes to those people.

, Most families have certain people who assume roles in times of crisis. The same holds true for close friends, and leaders at the person’s workplace. Some people are more comfortable dealing with intense situations and others are not. There is a lot to be done so find the courage to step up and take care of what is needed.


First and foremost is the comfort of your mother, friend and colleague. Some bereaved may find it comforting to keep themselves busy with some responsibilities. Some will not be able to handle a lot of responsibility. When a person is in the throes of an extreme loss it is difficult to think clearly, make decisions or communicate. You must use your best judgment to ensure she is not taking on more than she should.
Accept responsibility for the things you can do and delegate the items that need to be done to reliable family members, friends and work associates.
If you cannot handle the intense situations, there are plenty of less intense things you can still do to contribute. For example, relatives might be coming into town so offer to pick people up at the airport. Or, if you work with the person, offer to perform some of her work duties while she is gone from work.

, There are situations that are extremely difficult in life, and making funeral arrangements for a loved one is one of them. These tasks are usually the responsibility of the family or a close intimate friend. Acquaintances and work colleagues usually offer to help with other related tasks as needed.


Some people will not be comfortable going to a mortuary to make funeral arrangements. Do not force anyone to go. Approach the situation as something that must be done. Find the courage to do it by saying to yourself, “Okay, you’ve got to be strong for mom right now. That’s what needs to done. She needs my help.”
Go with your mom or friend to the funeral home to make all the arrangements. She may need your help to making decisions about the service and the location of the final resting place.
Some people have pre-arranged for their own funeral, which will lessen the burden on the family. Locate any important papers that may be helpful.Help make a guest list and contact everyone to let them know about the service. You can craft an e-mail to let everyone know, or the funeral home may build a website for the departed family member where people can get information on the service.
Determine who she would like to talk at the service. The service may be religious or secular and may or may not include people sharing their thoughts and feelings about the departed. Organize it in whatever way feels appropriate.
Be mindful that funeral expenses can be excessive.Take all financial obligations into consideration when making decisions on the various options the funeral home offers. If you are concerned about your mom’s financial future, consider keeping funeral expenses within a reasonable yet respectable range. Also, be wary of funeral directors who may want to take advantage and up-sell various services.

, Many ceremonies are held to acknowledge the ending of a journey. Funerals serve a purpose for those who have passed away, but also for those still living. A celebration of life is healing in many ways. You will be there to support your mother, friend or colleague, but you will also be experiencing your own healing.


Make sure you have a supply of tissue. This is an emotional time and tears will fall.
Ask her if there is anything she would like to say or have someone say about her spouse.
Monitor your mom’s behaviors to ensure she doesn’t get too overwhelmed. If there is a reception after the funeral she will be facing a lot of well-wishers. Take a break when necessary by removing her from the crowd for a short period of time. Some women are very strong in these instances, but you need to keep an eye on her either way.

, Once the funeral and reception are over and the relatives have returned home, reality sets in. The grieving has already started and this is the first step in dealing with the transition of living without the spouse being around. It is a sensitive time that may require a lot of hand holding, listening and consoling.


Monitor closely for a period of time. Daily calls or visits might be needed. If you have concerns you can say, “Mom, I’m concerned about you and I want to make sure you’ve got what you need. I want to give you some space to heal, but I’m still here to help.”
A person might refuse your help, but that doesn’t mean you have to stop monitoring.
The stress of being widowed can cause depression, anxiety and substance dependence.If you sense this is a problem seek appropriate help.

, Life has understandably become difficult to live. A lot of energy is expended during difficult times. It is essential that the basics of survival are achieved. When all the focus is upon the departed, a person can lose sight of her own needs.


Ensure that she is eating. Grief is a different experience for everyone.Some people lose their appetite or even forget to eat. Make sure she is getting enough food during this emotionally demanding time. For example you can say, “I’m here to help you so if that means bringing you dinner every night for a while, then that’s what I’ll do. I’m going to keep an eye on you. So tell me, what are some of your favorite foods?”
Personal hygiene is one of the first signs of depression. If you notice she is not bathing or is wearing soiled clothing, you can gently ask her, “Mom, do you need some help with laundry? I noticed you’ve got a few spots on your clothes that we could get out if we washed them. Are you taking a shower every day?” Due to the sensitivity of this subject, a close relative or friend is likely the best person to have this type of discussion.
Sleep deprivation can negatively affect such things as attention, memory, and decision making.Thus, look for any signs of this. For example, a person might repeat the same questions within a short amount of time; or she might get frustrated with simple decisions such as when to take a shower or what to eat.
After a loved one passes there are a lot of decisions to make; therefore sleep is essential. If she is not getting a healthy amount of sleep she needs, you can suggest she investigate relaxation techniques that have shown to help with insomnia.She should not be sleeping too short or too long of a period.

, Many people are taught how to acquire things, but few are taught how to lose. After the loss of a loved one, a person is likely ill-equipped to understand and to manage the pain associated with grief. There are stages to grief, loss and bereavement that once understood, can help a person grieve and complete their relationship with the pain.Various studies have recognized that grief can include the following stages: numbness and blunting; pining and yearning; disorganization and despair; reorganization and recovery.Respect her process. Not everyone experiences all the stages of grief, and the duration of each stage varies from person to person. If you think she should be over the loss, step back and remember that it is her loss. Support her in any way you can. If it goes on for years you can ask, “_____, I’m concerned that you cry every day about losing _____ and it’s been over a year. Maybe there’s a way to help.”
Remind her that relationships have three components: physical, emotional and spiritual. Her relationship with the departed has changed in the physical sense, but will emotionally and spiritually continue.

, This portion is likely to be exclusive to the role and function of a relative, but it is important for anyone to know. This would also be governed by the woman’s request to get involved. You probably weren’t privileged to know the details of your relative’s financial situation. When a death occurs, you will likely find out quickly if things were handled well or not. Bills come due and wait for no one. You need to determine a strategy to meet the immediate needs and long range necessities.Did she manage the payments for the household or did her spouse? If she managed them, she can continue. If her spouse managed the payments, you may have to teach her how to do it herself. You may have to take over this duty if she is elderly and doesn’t have the capacity to do it.
Help her contact all financial sources where accounts are held. Do not close accounts that have both spouses’ names on them until at least a year after the death of the loved one. Many transactions are anticipated and an open account is crucial to obtain funds.
Someone will need to evaluate if there are funds to support her for the duration of her life. Investments and other sources will need to be reviewed and adjusted to ensure all funds are now directed to the surviving spouse.
If there is a will or trust that was established, everyone can rely upon what is written in the trust. There will be an executor assigned who will direct the proceedings. If a trust was not in place, consult with an attorney for reliable and trustworthy direction on what action to take.

, People who go through a traumatic experience continue to heal with the help of others. Whether you a relative, friend or colleague, she will need your support as life moves forward. Be kind and willing to help her in normal and difficult situations. It will make you feel better.If you are a close relative, make it a habit to call her every day or every few days just to see how she is doing. It will take 10-20 minutes out of your day, which is less than the average daily visit to Facebook.Drop by her house with her favorite dessert just to make her smile. This will let her know that you care about her enough to take the time to show her you care.
If there are house repairs that never got taken care of by the parent who passed away, make arrangements to have them fixed or do it yourself if you are a relative or close friend.

, Experiencing the first birthday, anniversary, and holiday season without a loved one can be problematic and depressing.Some people will always have difficulty during holidays. Manage the situation by keeping expectations low and peace plentiful.


Whether she is a relative, friend or co-worker, ask her if she feels up to exchanging gifts during holidays. You can say, “I know you’re probably having a hard time this year. Do you want to exchange gifts or should we just enjoy each other’s company this year? I’m sure we would all be okay with whatever you want to do.” Give her the opportunity to take a pass on the year’s activities.
If you are a relative or friend and she wants to go to the grave where her spouse is buried, take her. Help her to pick out flowers before you go. Bring a clipper and stone polish to clean the grave marker if necessary.
If she cries on the person’s birthday or the anniversary of the passing acknowledge it and say something like, “I know it’s hard for your and I can’t believe he is gone either.” Hand her a tissue and give her a hug.

, You can’t be there 100% of the time so talk to others and see when they can visit. They might need reminding and prompting, but do what you can to continue to support her. No one handles abandonment well and when people stop visiting, people feel abandoned.


If she is a church-goer, contact the lady’s group at her church and see how they can be involved. Perhaps they can take turns bringing a meal to her once a week.
Determine which relatives, friends and colleagues will involve themselves in helping her. Ask each of them what if anything would they like to contribute.
Pick a reliable routine to visit her and stick to it. She will appreciate your commitment, dedication and gestures of love.

, There will be a time when she shows signs of recovery and allows goodness to come back into her life. She may smile more or become interested in various activities. Once you observe this, take the initiative and invite her to do fun activities. If she loves music, go to a concert or musical. Let her be the director of her fun while you help her make it happen.


This may involve helping her sift through and donate old clothes and belongings. Help her to focus on the fact that giving away clothing will allow someone else to enjoy it.
Help her to remember the good times. Spend a Sunday going to the departed loved one’s favorite beach or fishing spot. Have a dinner and eat all the loved one’s favorite items. This will help her feel closer to the person.
Create a hard copy or video-based memorial of pictures with or for her. It would be therapeutic for her to participate; and would be a great gift as well.
Do not pressure her to find a new love interest. This is such an individual choice that you must allow her the time she needs to decide if she will ever seek companionship. There are plenty of women leading full and meaningful lives on their own. You must respect her wishes.
At work, ask her to join a group in charge of organizing a fun event. This will help her feel like she is contributing to a meaningful project, which is healing.

, It takes bravery and courage to ask for help. If either of you are struggling with loss or caretaker fatigue, contact a trusted source to talk about getting help. There are resources available to you from a private provider such as a counselor or doctor. Talking with someone will help you sort out your struggles and develop an effective approach to handle anything.If she cannot stop crying for most of the day, encourage her to call a counselor or a doctor to seek help. If you have suffered a great loss, this can be considered normal for a period of time. Grief counseling will help.Art therapy is one of many types of therapy that is also available and can be extremely beneficial.Cognitive-behavioral therapy is also an effective therapy for depression, and anxiety disorders.Group therapy is also effective when coupled with a problem solving approach.Groups may be focuses specifically on grieving, or can be formed to help with coping skills.

Decide if you will be present for the exhumation.,
Confirm the grave has been moved.,
Have a service for the deceased at the new plot.",How to Move a Gravesite," There are numerous costs associated with moving the gravesite. You will need to first pay for the exhumation of the grave and then pay for the re-burial of the casket or coffin. You should make sure you are able to cover the costs of both processes before you commit to them.The costs for exhuming the grave may cost $3,000-$5,000 for the exhumation itself as well as the presence of a funeral director at the exhumation, which can cost $1,000 or more.
You may need a state permit for the exhumation, the cost of which varies from state to state. You will also need to pay for the disposal of the previous casket if you are keeping the biological remains and not the casket.
You will then need to pay the fees for re-burial of the casket. You will need to pay for transportation of the casket by hearse or a container truck. You may also need to buy a new plot, a new headstone, and possibly a new casket. You may need to have the funeral director present for the burial at the new plot.;
, You will need to get an exhumation license and/or a disinterment order from the probate court to be authorized to exhume the grave. You should ask the cemetery where the deceased is buried about applying for an exhumation license in that state or area.To apply for the license, you will need to be authorized to act in the interests of the deceased, usually given to a next of kin. This authorization may be in the form of signatures of living, close relatives of the deceased. You may also need to get the signatures of the owner of the grave plot and the burial authority.
The cost of the exhumation license can vary from state to state and country to country. You can apply for the exhumation license online through your government’s death and bereavements department or in person., You may need a written agreement by a religious official from an affiliated church in the area of the grave or the church of the deceased.

, You are not required to be present for the exhumation, as you only need to have the license approved and ready to show the necessary officials. The exhumation can be unpleasant to watch and may end up being a lengthy process. You may decide to skip the exhumation if you do not want to be present for the gruesome moments of the procedure.You do not need to be present for the exhumation but you do need to make sure the proper officials are present. Moving a grave is a potential public health hazard, so you should make sure there is an environmental health officer present during the exhumation. You may also want the funeral director to be present during the exhumation to make sure the process goes smoothly.

, You should follow up with the funeral director at the cemetery to confirm the grave has been moved to the new plot.

Recognize and understand you may be angry.",How to Move On when a Loved One Dies1," You may be angry with the person who died. Remember that they didn't choose to die, but, however unfair it is, it was there time to move on, and they won't come back. Don't be angry with what ever you believe takes people out of the world (if you are religious). Remember that it is the same person that also brings people into the world, and it's the same person that gave you all the amazing memories you shared. If your loved one died in an accident, don't be angry at the person who caused the accident. If whatever they tell themselves, it wasn't their fault, but, even if it doesn't seem like it, they will be having a hard enough time trying to forgive them self, without having to convince you to forgive them as well, even if it really was there fault and they don't deserve to be forgiven. Think how you would feel in their situation and you'll understand.;
"
"
Recognize and understand denial is normal.",How to Move On when a Loved One Dies2," It's perfectly normal to feel, for a while, like if you don't say that this person is dead, it won't be true. It will always be true and, until you can truly understand through your entire soul that that person is dead, but that death is not the end and that, someday, you will see them again.

Understand that you may find that you see the loved one who died in a lot of parts of your every day life.",How to Move On when a Loved One Dies3," For example, a TV Program they liked, a person with the same scarf, a book they wanted to read may remind you of them. Try pointing out things that represent the person who died to other people as well. When you walk past a cafe, don't just think something like ""....... would have ordered a latte,"" think ""....... would have ordered a latte and ..... would want a coke, and ........ would definitely buy fruit juice..."" and so on. Soon you'll be so tired of pointing everything out that you'll just stop completely.

Talk to your child about the funeral.",How to Make Preparations for a Funeral," If you're trying to make arrangements for someone's funeral, you're probably feeling a little overwhelmed. One of the first things you'll need to do is decide on a funeral provider to organize the service. In most states, there is no law requiring you to use a funeral home for your service. However, some states do require this. Search online to find out whether you're legally required to work with a funeral home. Even if you're not required to by law, it can often make arrangements much easier and less emotionally painful.Some factors to consider in choosing a funeral provider include location (ideally close to home), cost, and reputation or recommendation from other friends and relatives. You can call around to several providers and compare prices if the cost is a limiting factor.
Ask the funeral provider for an itemized general price list (GPL), which lays out the items and services available and how much they cost. Under federal law in the United States, you have the right to choose or refuse any goods or services you want.
You should also ask the funeral provider if they offer any packages, which can often reduce the cost when compared to purchasing items and services individually.;
, Once you've chosen a funeral provider, you'll need to give the director some basic information. This will help him or her make arrangements, acquire the necessary permits and paperwork, and put together a meaningful tribute to your loved one.Some information that the funeral director may require will include:


the deceased's full name
the place and date of birth of the deceased, as well as his or her place and date of death
the deceased's next of kin
your name, contact information, and relationship with the deceased
the name of the deceased's doctor
whether or not an autopsy will be performed
how soon the service needs to be

, If you are planning your own funeral, you can choose whatever fits your budget or whichever plan meets your needs. If you're making arrangements for someone else's funeral, check that individual's will for any instructions on how he or she wanted the funeral to be planned. If it's not specified, you can also ask that individual's spouse, significant other, or next of kin. There are three main types of funeral, and each type can range significantly in cost, depending on how simple or elaborate you want it to be.


Traditional (also known as full-service) funeral - this plan usually involves a viewing/visitation, a formal funeral service with an officiant, a hearse rental, and the burial, entombment, or cremation of the body. This is usually the most expensive plan.
Direct burial funeral - this plan skips the viewing/visitation, and generally skips the embalming since the body will not be viewed before the burial. The body is laid to rest in a simple casket, with the option of having a graveside memorial service.
Direct cremation - in this plan, the body is not embalmed or put out for viewing. The remains are cremated shortly after the individual has died, and his or her ashes are transferred in an urn, with the option of a memorial service at a pre-planned location (usually someplace outside a cemetery).

, The actual cost of a funeral will depend on how simple or how elaborate you choose to make the ceremony and burial (if you choose to bury the deceased). For example, if you choose to have an open viewing/visitation, you may be required to pay for embalming. If you bury or cremate the body shortly after death, though, you won't need to pay for embalming services. The average casket costs around $2,000, though elaborate caskets can cost well over $10,000. What type of service you arrange will determine the financial responsibilities that fall to you and your loved ones.If the deceased has pre-payed for the funeral, making arrangements will be somewhat easier. If not, you'll have to work out how to pay for the goods and services you need.
You may be charged additional service fees, depending on the services you agree to. You may also have to provide a cash advance if the funeral service providers need to purchase any goods or services from outside vendors.
Most funeral service providers do not allow deferred payment plans. You'll most likely have to arrange the payment before the service.
You can usually pay for a funeral with cash, credit cards, a loan, or the proceeds from the deceased's life insurance policy.

, Getting a death certificate is an important part of funeral planning. You will need this important document to finalize the deceased's affairs, including canceling credit cards and filing a life insurance claim. How you acquire the death certificate will vary, depending on where you live. In an open-record state, anyone can request a copy of someone's death certificate.In other states, you'll need to be either a relative of the deceased or be able to prove that you have some financial interest in that person's death.The death certificate will detail the deceased's name, social security number, parents' names, marital status, date and location of death, and cause of death.
Death certificates are typically issued by the Bureau of Vital Records in the state that individual died in, which may not necessarily be that individual's place of residence.
You can usually request a death certificate in person, over the phone, online, or through the mail.

, Posting a death notice/obituary is a good way to let people know about the deceased's passing. It is also a nice way to pay tribute to that individual. Most newspapers will run the death notice for one day, with the option of running it multiple days for an added price. Many newspapers also post the obituary online, which will be accessible indefinitely.Be aware of the cost. Some newspapers charge over $100 to print a death notice/obituary, and they can be even more expensive if you include a photograph.
Some newspapers restrict the size of a death notice. For example, the Chicago Tribute has a minimum of the deceased's name and three lines of text, with a maximum of 70 lines of text.
There is usually a deadline on how quickly a newspaper can print the death notice. For example, some newspapers require notice by a certain time the day before the notice is to be printed, while other publications may require even more time.
You'll need to provide the deceased's full name, age, date and place of birth, date and residence at death, the names of the deceased's immediate family, any surviving relatives' names, any hobbies or accomplishments of the deceased, and any funeral or memorial service information you have.

, It's up to you and your family to decide how many people to notify and invite to the funeral. You may wish to have a small, private ceremony, or you may want a lot of people there, depending on how big the deceased's circle of family and friends are.Some important people to notify of the deceased's passing, if not invite to the service, include:


any relatives, friends, and close neighbors
the employer of the deceased (if he or she was still working at the time of death)
a religious officiant, if the deceased was an active member of some religious community

, Most funeral ceremonies and casket viewings involve a floral display. You have many choices, both in terms of what type or types of flower you would like on display, as well as any arrangements or patterns that you may want. These may be offered through the funeral provider, or you may have to supply your own flowers, depending on your preferences and which provider you choose.Sometimes flowers can be arranged into decorative shapes, like a cross or a splay.
You may want to choose flowers that you know the deceased liked, if you have such knowledge.

, Another important factor to consider when making funeral preparations is transportation. Many people arrange for a car or limousine to transport the immediate family of the deceased. This has many advantages, such as allowing everyone to be close together for comfort, as well as ensuring that the most emotionally-impacted relatives will not have to concentrate on driving while grieving.


Some funeral service providers may offer a car or limo for an additional price.
If the service provider does not offer this, you can make arrangements on your own by calling a transportation service and hiring a driver. Check online or search through your phone book for drivers and/or transportation services in your area.

, It's considered common practice to wear black at a funeral. However, there's no hard and fast rule about what color you have to wear at a funeral service. The general consensus, however, is that you should avoid wearing bright colors or ""wild"" patterns out of respect for the deceased and those who have come to mourn.It's usually recommended that women dress modestly. This means wearing a long skirt or pants and avoiding any tops that expose the chest area.
For men, it's common to wear suits. However, if you don't have a suit, make sure you dress appropriately and modestly by avoiding shorts, t-shirts, and sandals.

, If you have other close relatives at the funeral, you may feel some obligation to ""stay strong"" for other people. However, you should not take on this responsibility, as you may end up having more difficulties down the line if you don't properly grieve at the time of death. Remember that no matter how close or distant you were with the deceased, you're allowed to grieve, too.If you feel like crying, you're free to cry. If you don't feel like crying, that's okay as well.
You don't have to say or do anything that doesn't feel natural or comfortable to you at a funeral. Everyone there is going through the same sense of loss and grief.

, It's okay to need the help and support of others, whether it's before, during, or after a funeral. Grieving for a close friend or loved one can be very difficult, and you may require some outside assistance to get through this trying period. Talk to your close friends and relatives about what you're going through, how you're feeling, and how you can all help one another through the mourning period., If you have a child, he or she may have a lot of questions about death and grieving during this difficult time. It may be difficult to have these types of conversation with your child, but it's important that he or she understands what's happening so as to avoid confusion and grief later.Let your child ask as many questions as he or she needs to. Try to answer every question as honestly and completely as you can.Frame your answers in a way that a child can understand. Think about your child's age and previous experience with death (pets or plants, for example), and consider referring to these losses in your conversation.
If your family is religious, you may want to talk about death through the lens of faith with your child. This may help your child process things, and it could provide him or her with some additional comfort.

You may think that talking about other topics will be a good distraction, but your grieving friend won't find it easy to laugh at jokes or talk about random subjects. Ignoring the biggest issue in your friend's life is not the way to support him or her, so be brave enough to bring up the topic instead of awkwardly acting like it didn't happen.


Don't be afraid to say the word ""died."" Don't say ""I heard what happened."" Say ""I heard the news that your grandmother died."" When you say what's true, even if it's painful, you're showing your friend that you're willing to talk about the hard things in life. Your friend needs someone who gets it and is capable of going there.
Name the person who died. Saying the person's name might cause tears to come, but it will help your friend to know the person who died still matters to other people.;
, Tell your friend how sorry you are about the fact that his or her relative died. Telling your friend that you're sorry and you love him or her will help your friend feel comforted. Giving your friend a hug or touching him or her on the shoulder can also help communicate your sorrow for what your friend is going through. Say the words ""I'm sorry.""


If you knew the person who has passed away, share memories of that person with your friend, and list the good qualities of that person. Remembering the good of that person can help your friend feel a bit better about the loss they're enduring.
If you and your friend are religious, offer to pray for him/her and his/her family. If they are not religious, say that you are thinking of them and are deeply sorry for their loss.

, Since death is so hard to talk about, it can be difficult to express your true feelings to your friend. But using one of the dozens of cliches people say to make talking about death easier isn't actually going to be very helpful. If you tell your friend your honest feelings, you'll sound more sincere, and your friend will be more likely to turn to you when he or she needs someone to listen.


Avoid saying things like ""She's in a better place,"" or ""She'd want you to be happy right now."" You don't actually know that, do you? Hearing these empty statements isn't very helpful.
If you're having trouble putting your feelings into words, it's ok to say something along the lines of ""I just don't know what to say. I can't express how sorry I am.""

, You might assume this would be a common question, but many people are a little afraid to ask or just don't want to deal with the answer. When your friend is at work or with acquaintances, he or she probably has to pretend like everything's ok. That's why as the person's friend, giving him or her the space to talk can be really helpful. You'll need to be ready to accept your friend's answer, even if it's difficult to hear.


Some people might not want to be asked how they're feeling. If your friend doesn't seem to want to talk about it, don't push him or her to say more.
If your friend does decide to open up, encourage him or her to talk for as long as it helps. Don't try to change the subject, or inject cheer into the conversation; just let the person be expressive and release all the emotions he or she normally has to hold back.

, Let the person be himself, no matter what that means. Everyone has different responses to losing a relative, and there's really no right or wrong way to feel. Even if your friend is having a reaction you don't think you would have, it's important to allow the person to express his or her feelings without your judgement.


Be prepared to get to know your friend in a deeper way, and see him or her act in ways you may not be used to. Despair and grief can erupt in many different ways. Your friend might feel denial, anger, numbness, and a million other emotions in response to his or her grief.

, Time might take away the initial sting, but when a close relative dies, life will never be the same. The idea that time heals makes it seem like there's a deadline after which people should feel ""normal"" again, but for many people that will never happen. Instead of focusing on helping the person ""get over"" his or her grief, focus on being a source of support and joy in that person's life. Never pressure your friend to mourn more quickly.Forget the ""five stages of grief."" There is no actual timeline for grief, and everyone handles it differently. While thinking about grief as a series of stages might be helpful to some, for many people it simply doesn't apply. Don't hold your friend to any kind of timeline.

, This common sentiment sounds caring, but it can make people who are grieving feel worse. That's because calling someone brave makes it seem as though you expect them to stand tall even while they're suffering. When someone has lost a relative, they may have times when they stumble and fall. A good friend like yourself shouldn't expect someone to act courageous all the time when his or her world has just been turned upside down."

Handle tears with grace.,
Answer your messages.,
Help out.,
Find little ways to be thoughtful.,
Be patient and understanding.,
Be a steady presence.",How to Help Someone Overcome the Loss of a Relative2," People are very vulnerable when they cry. Your reaction when your friend breaks down in tears can either be really helpful or extremely harmful. The best way to handle tears is with acceptance and love, rather than awkwardness or disgust. Know that your friend is going to cry from time to time, and be prepared to handle his or her tears in a positive, helpful way instead of making him or her feel worse.


Think ahead about how you'll react if your friend cries when you're together. Prepare to give him or her a hug, continue making eye contact, and stay for as long as necessary.
Leaving the room, looking away, making a joke or somehow cutting off the conversation can leave the person feeling embarrassed that he or she cried.

, Being reliable is more important than ever when your friend is going through the loss of a relative. Answering or returning phone calls is a big deal. Make sure to return texts and respond to messages of any kind when your friend is going through a period of mourning. If you tend to be on the flaky side in this arena, make an extra effort to be present for your friend.

, Ask your friend how you can help make things easier during the first few months after his or her relative died. Don't just say ""Let me know if there's anything I can do to help""; many people will say those words, and they usually don't really intend to get involved. If you really want to make a difference, ask for concrete things you can start doing to make life a little easier for your friend and his or her family. Here are a few things you could do:


Make food or bring food to your friend and his/her family. Or, if you're challenged by the kitchen, you could bring them nice carry-out.
Give people rides
Do household chores
Take care of the person's pets
Get the person's homework assignments
Make phone calls to inform people about the person's loss

, A good way to express your support for your friend is to show your friend you're thinking about him or her. Go above and beyond to be thoughtful more often than you normally would. The small ways in which you show your friend you care can be as meaningful as having a big heart-to-heart conversation. Try doing the following:


Make cookies or bake a cake

Take the person out to the movies or go for a walk in the park
Send a thoughtful card in the mail
Email the person more often
Include the person in more social activities
Give the person gifts every once in a while

, Your friend might not be the same for a long time. He or she might seem sad, distracted or a little less energetic for months or even years after a close relative passes away. Being a good friend means staying in the friendship even when someone goes through big changes, and if you love your friend, you won't expect him or her to ""bounce back"" - you'll go along for the ride.


Don't pressure your friend to do activities he or she no longer finds fun.
Understand that your friend might go through serious problems after the loss of a relative. Sometimes people turn to addictive behaviors or experience major depression as a result of grief and trauma. If you're worried that your friend might harm him or herself, help your friend get help., After a few months, most people will get wrapped up in their own busy lives and stop thinking about your friend's loss. But your friend will need support for more than just a few months after losing a close relative. Be there for your friend for as long as he or she needs a little extra help and care.


Check in on the anniversary of your friend's relative's death. Ask your friend how he or she is doing.
The best thing you can do for your friend is just to be there. If they call, talk or set up plans. If they don't, send a card saying you're thinking of them. It's best to let them grieve while you offer your embrace and your love.

Learn more about the five stages of grief.,
Offer your condolences.,
Decide what assistance you can offer and when.,
State your offer in specific terms.,
Find a time when they are alone.,
Phrase your offer positively.,
Repeat your offer.,
Get other people involved.",How to Help when Someone Dies1," There are five distinct stages in the grieving process that people go through when they experience a loss. By learning more about these stages, you might find it easier to help someone who has just lost a loved one. The five stages include:Denial. In this stage, the person might withdraw from family and friends or be unwilling to discuss the loss.

Anger. During this stage, the person might express their feelings about the loss through anger that is directed at family, friends, or even inanimate objects.

Bargaining. Next, the person might start to look for ways to regain control of the situation, such as by reflecting on the person’s death and considering how it might have been prevented.

Depression. This stage may be characterized by sadness, regret, and worry.

Acceptance. During this stage, one may finally accept what has happened, but the sadness they feel about the loss may linger.;
, Make contact with the bereaved person as soon as you find out about the death. It may sound trite, but saying “I’m so sorry” or “I’m here for you,” is useful as it validates their feelings and provides a support system. If you don’t know them personally, introduce yourself and let them know how you heard about their loss.Keep this initial conversation brief, especially if it occurs shortly after the death. They are most likely swamped with calls and this can very easily overwhelm the most social of persons. Also, if they are ‘short’ with you, don’t take it personally.
Use caution when offering words of optimism. People in mourning are often not ready to hear about moving on. Instead of offering advice, focus on the gravity of the loss by saying, “This must be a most painful time for you.”, Much of this will depend on your schedule. If you constantly have really busy days, and you still want to help, then find at least one or two hours that you can spare in your week, and use that time

, Instead of saying, “Is there anything I can do to help?” think about what you are good at and offer to assist with that activity. For example, if you excel at cooking, consider making and freezing a few casseroles., Approach them when they have time to talk and are in a space that is comfortable for them. People are often sensitive about receiving help or gifts, even in times of grief, and this will increase the odds that you receive a positive response.

, Framing the conversation this way makes them feel like less of a burden. End your sentences with a questioning tone to open up conversation and give-and-take.


Say, for instance,""For the next three months I can pick up your children once a week after school, take them bowling, and drop them home, if you would like?"" Or, ""Can I come around one night next week and bring you dinner?"", Give the person a chance to refuse, but don't be afraid to make the offer again in a week or so. It can be a difficult time. Don't be pushy, but make it clear your offer is genuine.

, Let others know what you are doing and if there is any way for them to help as well. Make a few phone calls to other acquaintances or send out an email to solicit ideas and arrange scheduling. Larger tasks often require a group effort and this can also increase the range of help that you can initially offer.

Sit down with the bereaved person and make a to-do list.,
Co-organize the funeral services.,
Act as an intermediary with officials.,
Make meals.,
Clean and organize the house.,
Provide childcare.,
Launch a fundraising drive.",How to Help when Someone Dies2," Deaths create personal and practical chaos and you can help by providing some sense of order and forward direction. Pull out a pen and paper and write a list of everything that needs to be done from the minutia (such as sorting through the mail) to the complex (such as looking into the existence of probate documents or the lack thereof).Thinking about the thematic grouping of activities may help as you compose the list. For example, if you focus on money then you will include closing out all bank accounts, arranging for the payment of funeral contractors, and paying any outstanding bills.

, If you are skilled at writing, offer to compose and arrange for the publication of the death announcement. Get a phone list from the bereaved person and make calls to spread the word about the service date and time. Arrange for transportation to and from the service, including serving as a driver, if needed.


Continue helping after the services conclude by collecting and donating any flowers. (Hospitals often welcome floral donations). Or, by writing thank you notes for any gifts received.

, Offer to sit-in on the meetings with a funeral director or go to meet with insurance agents. Your role is to provide support to the mourning person, so if you say less than more, that is okay.


If asked for your opinion, it is perfectly okay to turn the question back around and say, “Is that what you want?” Or, “How do you feel about this?”
Ensure that the proper paperwork is filed. Get the death certificate and look over it to make sure that it is filled out correctly.

, Prepare food that is frozen and easy to defrost or that comes ready-made. Lasagna and other noodle-based casseroles are a good idea as they are calorically dense and retain flavor when frozen. Try to be consistent and provide a set number of meals on a schedule.


Cook their favorite foods, such as macaroni and cheese, in order to provide additional temptation. Loss of appetite is a common side-effect of mourning, therefore, it is helpful to have many food options available., Washing the dishes and sweeping may be the last thing on a person’s mind following a death in the family. Offer to do these chores in a concrete way, “I can come by twice a week to do the dusting.” You can also organize any items laying around, such as loose papers.


Watch what you throw away and ask before taking out the trash. That random crumpled list on the couch could have been the last thing written by their loved one and, therefore, worth keeping to them even if it appears worthless to you., A child's need for attention and care does not cease due to a death. If the bereaved has children, offer to babysit for one evening a week. Take the kids out for dinner and a movie or to the local arcade. Keep the conversation light and positive, look at this as an opportunity for you to have fun as well.

, Create a website listing asking for funding or spread the word in person. Detail the circumstances, in a tactful way, surrounding the death and describe the reason for the financial need. These funds, for example, could be used to pay for funeral expenses or to support the children of the deceased person. The average funeral costs over $7,000.The amount of money that you raise is not necessarily the most important thing. The effort that you go through to set-up and monitor these funds shows that you care. Make sure to carefully keep track of all raised monies.
The funds could also be used to help others, such as a memorial scholarship fund."
"
Call frequently.,
Encourage them to use the name of the deceased.,
Stay the night.,
Organize an event of remembrance.,
Attend a bereavement group.",How to Help when Someone Dies3," Set a calling schedule, whether it be phoning twice a week or more. Mark down a specific day and time to make these calls. For example, call them Tuesdays and Thursday at 7:30 p.m. This will ensure that you make the time and they will also most likely look forward to speaking with you.


Make a point to reach out as particular dates occur, such as the birthday of the deceased person. Events such as graduations or weddings may also result in additional mourning and will require support on your part., Set an example by saying, “Michael really liked going to the movies,” as opposed to, “You must really miss going to the movies.” This acknowledges that the deceased person is still a part of their emotional life and should not be forgotten., If the person lost a spouse, or someone they lived with, the nights may be particularly difficult and lonely. Offer to sleep over once or twice a week when you can or lounge on the couch and watch a movie with them until night falls., Plan a tree planting, candle lighting, or even an ash-scattering ceremony. Provide a safe and positive space for the bereaved person to remember their loved one. These events do not cost a great deal of money and can be organized with a few days’ notice., Many of these groups are organized via hospitals or hospice organizations, although you can also find them online. They are often organized according to a “peer” system i.e. the same age brackets, type of death, etc. Find a suitable group and offer to attend the sessions as a companion for the bereaved person.Support groups also provide a great opportunity for information regarding the stages of the grieving process, thus decreasing feelings of isolation.

Ask her how you can win her back.,
Address any changes in your own behavior since you got married.,
Get help with issues you're struggling to address alone.,
Enjoy yourself.,
Respect yourself and your wife by not speaking negatively about her.,
Be patient.",How to Win Your Wife Back1," This may seem too simple or too direct, but it may actually be the most important step to take. Ask her how she feels about what needs to change about your relationship together. Simply by asking, you'll indicate that you care about what she's thinking and that you're ready and willing to put effort into your marriage.Be specific with your questions, and ask for specific answers.
Start with something like, ""I know it's been rough lately. What can I do to prove how much this relationship still means to me?""
Listen carefully to her response and take her perspective seriously, even if it angers or saddens you at first.
Know that speaking honestly with one another will likely be the first step in getting your relationship back on track.;
, When you got married, you commit to spending your lives together. You also both married the person you wanted to spend your life with. If you’ve become a different person than the one your wife married (or vice versa), these changes may need to be addressed.For instance, there could simply have been tangible changes. If you have become less active or are eating unhealthily and your body reflects that, work to get back in shape.
If you’ve become more stressed (from work or whatever else) – and maybe harder to be around – acknowledge that this likely a reason that distance may have developed between the two of you.
Schedule specific time to work on whatever you might need to change. If it's simply spending more time with you wife, commit to spending certain blocks of time together each week and take these commitments seriously.
If you frequently find yourself yelling or having fits of anger or other emotional surges, see a therapist soon.

, While living a more physically active lifestyle and making yourself available are steps you can take on your own, more significant adjustments of your behavior may require professional help. If you're struggling with addiction or cannot control your emotions, get help. See a doctor or therapist to help identify specific issues that you may be struggling, and follow their advice on steps you can take to address these issues.If you're suffering from addiction of any sort - to alcohol, drugs, the internet, or anything else - see a medical professional as soon as possible.
Recognize that physical abuse of any type is not only illegal, it is a sign that you need professional help.
In short, address any and all problems that are external to your relationship so that they do not continue to have a negative effect on your marriage.
Tell your wife about the effort your putting in to address serious issues. Not only will she be happy to hear it, you'll motivate yourself to take your own efforts seriously.

, Though it sounds a bit selfish on the first read, maintaining a healthy consistency in the rest of your life - including doing the things that you enjoy - indicates that you’re confident that your marriage can be saved. Don't neglect being available to your wife, but take care of yourself be doing things you enjoy to make sure you stay in a healthy frame of mind.By indicating you’re able to go on with your own life, you’re also indicating that you’re capable of a mature and level-headed conversation.
Don’t play to her sympathy or try to guilt her by acting dramatically or emphasizing how much it hurts to be without her – it’s immature, and it won’t work in the long term.

, Most importantly, if you have children together, it is entirely inappropriate to speak poorly about your wife to them. This will have negative effects on everyone involved, especially your children, and will certainly not help improve your relationship with you wife.If you do have kids, simply tell them that both you and your wife love them and that everything will work out.
Take a similar approach with shared friends. Simply articulate that you hope to work things out, and that you love and respect your wife.
If you do get back together, your relationship will only be complicated by anything negative you’ve said about your wife.
If you’re still in love with her, act like it!

, Remember that your marriage didn’t happen all of the sudden. Neither will winning your wife back. Focus on the process of identifying specific issues with your relationship, addressing them one at a time, and re-establishing a healthy bond with your wife. Understand that this will likely take time.Do not overreact to tumultuous periods. A rough conversation, a night apart, even a string of cold-shoulders does not mean your marriage is doomed.
Rough patches do indicate the need for some improved communication – but that may be enough to rekindle your marriage!

Commit to open, honest, and heartfelt dialogue.,
List specific strengths and things to work on in your relationship together.,
Forgive, apologize, and try to forget.,
Be honest with yourself, too.",How to Win Your Wife Back2," Many sources of relationship tension can be addressed by better communication. Improved communication starts with honesty. When the opportunity to speak with your wife presents itself, be ready to share the things you feel strongly about, both good and bad.Be particularly honest about the things you believe were detrimental to your marriage before the distance grew between you.
Be sure to include both the reasons you want to win her back, and the reasons you believe your relationship can be a source of healthy, shared happiness for both of you.
Don’t avoid any conversations that need to happen. Don’t deny or ignore any past detrimental behavior – either your own or your wife’s.

, It may initially seem silly, but it can be incredibly helpful to literally make a list of the good, the bad – and even the ugly.Organize your own thoughts, and prepare yourself to clearly share them with your wife by getting them out on paper.
Make specific lists of the things you love about your wife and your relationship with her.
Also list the things that frustrated you about your previous lives together.
If you’re still speaking, and she may be willing to do so, ask her to do the same and share the lists with one another. This will likely lead to some serious, but important conversations.

, If you actually want to win your wife back and have a healthy relationship together, you’ll both need for forgive one another for those aspects of your past that led to the distance between you.Improved communication – and the honesty it leads to – will necessitate that you both accept responsibility for ways you may have hurt each other in the past.
Whether your wife has done and said things that have hurt you, or has been holding onto things you’ve done that hurt her – work to reconcile past wrongs by speaking about them together.
In the event your wife has consistently mistreated you, you need to strongly consider why you want to get back together.

, Your current separation might indicate a good reason for some distance between you and your wife. If the separation has been longstanding, or if your divorce has already been completed, this is all the more indication that there were serious issues with your relationship.


It is incredibly hard to deal with separation, particularly when you aren’t ready to let go. However, you may simply need to do so.
Speak with close friends and family members about how you’re feeling. They will remind you that you are loved (likely without even saying it), and help you work through the emotional turmoil of separation.

"
"
Avoid desperate behavior.,
Do not call or text incessantly.,
Give her space.",How to Win Your Wife Back3," You don’t want to risk pushing your wife further away by being too aggressive or desperate while trying to win back her love.Similarly, you don’t want to let yourself become overly vulnerable, constantly complain, or let yourself go – none of these developments will help you win your wife back.


Remind yourself that her attitude towards you depends on your current behavior.
Calmness is both more mature and more attractive than any behavior that might qualify as craziness.
Remove yourself from a conversation or location when you feel yourself begin to slip emotionally.

, If your wife won’t answer your calls, it’s easy to become worried – even frantic – especially when your marriage is struggling. It’s very hard to acclimate to a spouse actively keeping you at a distance, but remind yourself that you can’t control your wife’s behavior.After you’ve called once or twice and she hasn’t returned your calls, leave her a voicemail or text saying you’re hoping to hear back from her soon.
Quit calling and texting.
Try not to worry about what she is doing. Don’t allow yourself to imagine worst-case scenarios. Recognize that she may simply need some space.

, It may seem counterintuitive – and it may be hard to do – but giving your wife some space will give you both the time opportunity to think things over. Verbalize your intent by saying something like, “We both need time to think, and I respect that.”Demonstrate your confidence and independence by acknowledging the current distance between the two of you, and stepping back before doing anything that might make things worse.

Understand the importance of trust.,
Talk to him about your concerns.,
Listen to him.,
Respect his privacy.,
Be open about your expectations.,
Clearly explain to him how he has betrayed your trust.,
Give him opportunities to re-earn trust after losing it.,
Seek counseling.,
Consider ending the relationship if you can't trust him.",How to Trust Your Husband," Trust is so important to happy relationships because it's basically impossible to be truly happy with your partner if you don't have it. Consider the following:


Without trust, you'll have reason to worry whenever your husband isn't around. Is he doing what he says he is or has he lied to you?
Without trust, you can't be 100% sure that your husband is committed to you. Is he in this relationship for the long haul or is he just waiting until something better comes along?
Without trust, you can't be positive that your husband will do his best to respect and care for you. Will he embarrass or demean you in front of other people?;
, Communication is key for trust to develop in a relationship. You must be open about your feelings. If there's something that your husband is doing to shake your trust, tell him! He can't read your mind, so if you want him to make changes, you'll need to talk to him.


Try to voice your concerns in a non-accusatory way. You don't want to put your husband on the defensive if you don't have to. Try taking an open, friendly tone. For example, you might open by saying, ""Hey, I was wondering if we could talk about us for a few minutes."" As you make your points, say how his actions make you feel rather than criticizing him personally.
You don't just have to communicate only negative things to him — feel free to open up about how great he makes you feel as well.

, Good communication is a two-way street. Listen to what your husband has to say and try your best to understand him. You don't always have to agree with him, but he does deserve your attention and respect, especially when you're discussing difficult topics.


It's also important to show your husband that you're listening. Maintain good eye contact and nod your head every once in a while. Occasionally, repeat back a point he's just made.

, Let the new trust in your relationship begin with you. A basic way to establish trust is to give him plenty of personal privacy (and expect that he gives you the same). This means not looking through his phone, mail, email or social media accounts. It also means not constantly calling him when he's out to see what he's doing or demanding explanations of what he's done. These kinds of actions feed your own insecurity and won't do anything to change what he is doing.


However, this doesn't mean that you should turn a blind eye to evidence of bad behavior. Obvious warning signs — mysterious texts that cause him to cancel your dinner plans with no explanation, for instance — warrant investigation.

, It's important to lay down reasonable expectations for each spouse as early in the relationship as possible. This way, if someone behaves badly, you can clearly point out exactly how your trust has been betrayed. This is especially important if your expectations of your partner differ significantly from the ""norm"" (i.e., he should not cheat on you, flirt with other people, and so on). It is crucial if you have shared responsibilities (like child care).


If you haven't already, have an honest discussion with your partner that outlines your expectations for each other. Be prepared to speak up about things in your relationship that aren't working, but make the conversation about what you feel, rather than what you suspect he is doing. For example, you might say, ""When you're always late home, I feel as though I'm not important to you."" Approaching it this way gives him the opportunity to see how you're affected without being accused, which may lead to confrontation.

, Your first objective after a betrayal is to think about how you will communicate to your husband that he has shaken your trust. Here, as above, you'll want to focus on how his actions made you feel rather than making personal attacks. However, since in this case he has deliberately done something to hurt you, you don't need to stay perfectly calm. It's only reasonable to get emotional — especially if he has done something truly disrespectful.


For example, you might start the conversation by saying something like this: ""We need to talk. I don't like that you've been lying about where you've been. If I can't trust you, we're going to have problems."" You're making it clear that you're upset, but you're not completely allowing your emotions to run wild.

, Betrayals of trust can range from relatively minor (lying so he can hang out with friends, forgetting romantic commitments, etc.) to major (infidelity, humiliating you in front of others, etc.) It's up to you to judge how badly your husband's trust-destroying behavior has damaged your relationship. However, as long as you stay together after the problem behavior, you should give your husband a reasonable chance to earn your trust again.


Try to make the punishment fit the crime here. For instance, if you catch your husband sending flirty texts to a co-worker but he swears he hasn't done anything else (and you believe him), it's reasonable to avoid intimacy (sex, cuddling, affection, etc.) until you're sure that he's not interested in anyone else.

, If you can't figure things out on your own but preserving your marriage is important to you, don't be afraid to seek the assistance of a professional. A counselor or couples therapist can help you repair the root issues that are affecting your ability to trust each other as spouses.


Seeing these sorts of professionals isn't something to be ashamed of. Many couples get professional help for a wide variety of marital issues. The fact that you're willing to get help when it's needed is something to be proud of, even if it's not the sort of thing you'd volunteer as casual dinner conversation.

, As mentioned at the beginning of this article, having a happy relationship is more or less impossible without trust. If your husband has done something to prevent you from ever trusting him again or if he has refused to change after repeated betrayals, it may be time to reconsider your relationship. Breaking up is hard to do — especially when you're married — but the alternative of living with a spouse you don't trust is never a good idea

, Small things matter a lot in a relationship, and 'care' and 'love' matter a great deal. Make your beloved feel special.

It is the small things that you do in times of need that makes him/her feel that you are the one who is going to be there forever.


Girls love security, compassion and want someone who would be able to protect them and stand up for them in need.
On the other hand, boys want a partner who is a reflection of their self, would understand them, stand by them and care for him and the family. The love that you feel needs to be shown as this is a very crucial factor in turning a relationship into a marriage.

Prioritize your time.,

Find an activity.,
Get creative.,
Get feedback.",How to Entertain Siblings," Set up a time to play with them. Setting up a priority and a plan will help you actually get to action and not just think about spending time with your siblings.;
, Get in the mood to play! Even if you were busy and tired, now is the time to show your siblings that you are really ready to have fun with them.


Pay attention to your facial expressions, your voice and your body language in general. Your sibling know when you are or are not willing to spend time with them, and it's important that they know you are.

,



Play a sport. Finding a sport is good way to be active and have fun. If there aren't any sports that both you and your siblings can play, teach them a new one, or learn a new one together.

Go outside and explore the world. You could take them out for ice cream, to the movies, an arcade or even plan a picnic at the park. For something more educational, you can arrange a trip to the museum, the aquarium or the zoo.

Make things. Many kids love doing hands-on, arts-and-crafts work. Even if you yourself are not a huge fan of this kind of activity, you can comment on your siblings' work and make them feel happy.

Make food and share it together. Even if you mess up, it's all part of the fun.



, Finding activities and doing them are fine, but your siblings will appreciate your efforts more and be happier if you add a little spin on the activities you are doing with them. Here are things you can do:


If you are playing sports, try adding, deleting, or changing rules.
If you are venturing outside, set up a fun mission to complete together. For example, hide an object and make them search for it. At the end, whoever wins gets a prize!
If you are making things, try to make things that you usually wouldn't think of making.
If these little twists are not good enough, think entirely outside the box and create new games and activities yourself!

, Ask your siblings how they liked the activities and how much they enjoyed their time with you. Doing so is a good way of ensuring you've successfully entertained your siblings--and also a fantastic way of letting your siblings know you care about them! You can ask them:


What did you like about what we did?
How could have things been more fun?
How do you feel now?
Do you want to do this again next time?

All of the experiences in the past are your great teachers. Each lesson in life is to teach you to become the person you are today.;
, Trust that everything happens for a reason. Life is about loving, living, learning, growing, and becoming who you are here to be—the best you can be. No matter how many challenges you are facing, trust yourself that you can overcome it. Lessons come to you because you need them. Trust in your own abilities to face challenge and solve problems that come. You have that power to create the world you want. When you don't trust life, you live in fears, doubts, and worries. As a result, you limit yourself to receive blessings that come your way. When you trust life, you know that you can survive in any difficult situation. Suffering does not last. Some relationships don't last either. Material things don't last. Your job you have today might not last. What would last forever? It is trust in life and trust in yourself that whatever comes your way, you are able to face it with love, strength, and courage.

, Give yourself a chance to trust her again. You can start doing it by asking her to do something for you in a small way. For example, ask her to call you or text you when you want her to.

, If you want to rebuild trust with your wife, it is important to be willing to be open and embrace life.

, Acknowledge that you have taken important steps to become a greater husband.

Be observant.,
Ask your child.,
Reach out for others’ opinions.,
Consider your own behavior.,
Identify if your child needs outlets for stress and strong emotions.,
Decide if they need more autonomy.,
Be sure you are setting age-appropriate rules.,
Deliberate on whether misbehavior is a plea for attention.,
Check for physical or mental illness.,
Develop a parenting plan.,
Strive for consistency.,
Resist power struggles.,
Offer a fresh start.",How to Figure Out Why Your Child Misbehaves," The first thing to do when trying to determine the root of your child’s misbehavior is to watch him or her closely. To make it easier on you, select one problem behavior and observe what the child does as well as when and how. Getting all the details about this undesirable behavior can eventually help you answer the “why.”For instance, maybe your daughter starts yelling at the dinner table each night. Each time you notice that she does this right after the adults have been discussing their jobs. Maybe she does not like serious talk during dinner. Or, maybe she simply wants the adults’ attention.
Make sure to keep a running log of these kinds of incidents and write down as many details as you can about each situation. This will help you to identify patterns in the behavior over time.;
, In some situations, your child may be old enough or have enough self-awareness to explain acting out behavior. This may seem like common sense, but many parents overlook the possibility of getting information from the actual source: your child.Pull your child aside for some private, one-on-one time. It may be helpful to have this conversation while engaging in another activity (e.g. washing dishes or baking cookies) to avoid intimidating your child. Join your child in the activity and say “I’ve noticed you keep missing the bus each morning. Do you want to talk to me about that?”
Opening the floor for some dialogue may help you learn that your child is getting picked on while riding the bus. He or she is missing the bus consistently to avoid getting bullied.

, Getting another perspective on misbehavior can also be helpful in understanding its causes. This is because people often get so used to something that they may no longer notice it, but someone outside of your family might notice it with ease. When you notice your child acting out, take the opportunity to speak with other adults. Ask your child’s teacher, school counselor, coach, babysitter, and other relatives whether they have noticed any misbehavior.Figuring out the context in which misbehavior is most likely to happen can be informative. For instance, if your child acts out only during soccer practice, it may help you narrow down why the misconduct is happening.

, Most parents have their share of stories of how their daughters pretended to put on makeup or swaddled baby dolls. Or, how their sons built imaginary structures or drove monster trucks. Children learn by imitating the adults around them. Unfortunately, this learning is not selective.There’s a chance that misbehavior on the part of your child was learned in the home by watching his or her parents and older siblings. Behaviors are also picked up vicariously through television and movies.
Be mindful of the behaviors you model at home. Recognize that young children are more likely to copy your actions, no matter if your words say otherwise.

, Children may experience upsetting events and strong feelings that they do not know how to handle. Powerful emotions can feel overwhelming to a small child who doesn’t understand them. If this is the case with your child, acting out behavior is like his or her very own personal SOS message.If your child is overcome by big emotions like fear or anxiety, it can help to ensure safety first. Once your child feels safe, he or she may be more capable of talking about the problem.
After your child talks about the problem, it is your job to help them develop a solution to the problem and to cope with the situation in a healthy way.

, A strong need for independence could be driving misbehavior in your child. If you continue to make your child conform to guidelines set when he or she was younger, they may act out as a form of rebellion.


For instance, your seven year old is perfectly capable of tying his shoes, but you still attempt to do it for him. He may kick or throw his shoes around because you are taking away his opportunity to display newly developed skills.
Watch him or her carefully and check out the skillsets being demonstrated. Look for ways you can let your child be more autonomous. This may include helping you choose outfits, cleaning up toys from the playroom, or bathing., You have a really young child, but you tried to be proactive by setting guidelines that are a little above his or her age range. If your child has not yet reached certain developmental milestones, putting certain rules into place will only lead to them disobeying.


Don’t assume that your child automatically knows how to do anything, unless you have explicitly taught them. If your child is very young, the best solution may simply be to remove temptations for misbehavior or childproof your home.Consider this example: you are upset because your three-year-old goes into your cabinets and helps herself to a snack all throughout the day. Rather than telling her “Wait until after dinner,” you can prevent this by moving all snacks to higher cabinets or using childproof guards so that she can’t open them.
Check out some books on age-appropriate activities and chores to ensure that you are setting realistic expectations for your child. Also, keep in mind that all children are different, so do not use what other people’s children do as a way to decide what your child should do.

, If your child lives in a household where the adults and older siblings are often preoccupied with chores, work, or TV, he or she may act out to get noticed. Perhaps your child does not often get positive attention, such as affection or praise, so he or she has learned to misbehave in order to receive negative attention.If you are regularly preoccupied and unable to allot much attention to your child, you may need to spend some time reconfiguring your priorities in order to resolve misbehavior. Just giving each of your children a few minutes of your undivided attention each day is a great start.
Other ways to minimize attention-seeking behavior is by praising your child for doing good and ignoring acting out behavior. Instead of scolding or punishing, refrain from talking about the misbehavior and simply send the child to time-out. When time’s up, invite him or her to return to the common area and encourage positive behaviors., In some instances of misbehavior, the problem is too big for the parents to fix on their own. Examples include medical conditions, psychiatric disorders, or behavioral issues that require professional treatment. However, it is helpful to still be observant of this sort of misbehavior since it can inform a doctor or other provider on how to care for your child.


If you are unable to find a likely cause for problem behavior, you may need to talk with your child’s pediatrician about exploring other options.Be aware that not getting enough sleep can also be a reason why your child may misbehave.
If your child is being abused, bullied, or neglected, then this may also result in misbehavior.
Drastic differences in the rules between two environments may also be a cause of misbehavior, especially if your child does not understand the rules.

, Not having a parenting plan is like a coach hitting the field with no clear guidelines for how his players should play the game. When the rules aren’t clear, the players are bound to disappoint.


Sit down with your co-parent if you have one and devise a tentative set of rules to enforce in your family. These should include specific no-nos like “No running in the house” and “No jumping on the furniture.” However, you should also include your expectations for character traits and attitudes that you would like your children to strive for, such as sharing and honesty.
Once you have created a game plan, have a family meeting and share these guidelines with your children. Furthermore, as a defense against bad behavior, you may want to include a rewards and consequences system so that your children understand the outcome for following or breaking your family rules.Make sure to post the rules somewhere that your child will see them every day, such as on the refrigerator on the wall of your family room.
Also, keep in mind that it may take your child some time to adjust to the new rules. Make sure you allow them an adjustment period.

, Inconsistency is an important aspect of raising well-behaved children. Whether it's positive or negative, do what you say you will. Children are very good at remembering promises of rewards or consequences. They are prompted to act out when you fail to deliver on either.This sets the tone that doing well doesn’t result in anything and neither does doing poorly. Therefore, your child acts out and is disrespectful because you haven’t been consistent with your parenting plan.
If you promise to provide a treat, follow through. If you say there will be consequences to misconduct, apply them. Avoid empty threats, or promises. Make sure that you coordinate with the other parent, grandparents, and anyone else who will be watching the child to ensure that they will be consistent with the rules as well.

, Similar to any other relationship, in parenting, you have to carefully pick your battles. You need to decide for yourself which issues require a lecture or consequence and which don’t. Otherwise, you will set yourself up for a power struggle in which your strong-willed child is constantly challenging your authority.Choose your battles by thinking about how important an issue is in the grand scheme of things. Ask yourself: will this matter in a month? A year? Will their behavior be worse in a month or in a year if I do not intervene? If not, let it go.

, As a parent of a misbehaving child, your goal should not only be to eliminate an undesirable behavior, but to also make sure it is isolated. In other words, you don’t want one bad behavior leading to another and another. A fresh start at appropriate behavior minimizes the chances of negative behaviors increasing because you have set expectations that they won’t. You can do this by reminding your child of the alternative behaviors you have discussed when they get an opportunity to do better.


Instead of labeling your child as “bad” or telling him or her “You always…,” present the opportunity for your child to improve. After consequences have been implemented say to your child, “Everyone makes mistakes. I know that you can do better now.”"

Remember your wedding vows, 'for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer'.,
Remember that as with everything in life, it will turn around again.,
Don't rush to blame others.,
Stick together.,
Laughter.,
Find a solution.,
Control.,
Remember.",How to Survive Financial Hardship in a Marriage," When we make these vows to each other it probably doesn't enter our minds what could happen down the road, but nonetheless we made a promise that we had the best intentions of keeping. During difficult financial times those vows become far more prominent and necessary. Stick with it not because of the promise you made but because of the person you made it to.;
, Bad luck turns into good luck, poor can turn into rich (or at least stable again). Always keep in your mind that things will bounce back, it will be tough, maybe even really tough, for a while but eventually it will change.

, It is so easy, especially when we are frustrated and suffering under stress, to start pointing the finger. It's human nature and for some reason we think it makes us feel better, in the end it doesn't do anyone any good, including yourself. From your partners point of view, you have to think that blaming them is the last thing in the world that they would want to hear. We all blame ourselves on the inside anyway, even if we know that it's not true so before you start to speak out of turn just take a second to think, ""how would I feel if they said that to me right now?"".

, One of the greatest pieces of advice for any marriage it to stick everything out together, there is nothing that you cannot beat as long as it is together. Now it may sound trite and perhaps that's why we don't all go around saying it out loud but it is true nonetheless. The basic idea of a marriage is you become one unit, two people that are stronger as one unit together then they are on their own. If you have used the tip above and are not blaming each other for your financial circumstances then logically you already sticking together through it.

, Whenever we face hard times in any area of our lives it's easy to fall into a slump or worse. Using laughter between you will lighten the mood, bring you together and will show each other that there is more to life then just worrying about the finances. Make jokes, be silly, pull faces, anything that will help to ease the tension that you will be feeling.

, Although it may not be possible to find an overall solution to your money problems, take smaller steps and talk things through with your spouse to try to combat the lesser issues. So instead of sitting with your head in your hands concerned with ""How will we ever get through this?"", start smaller with questions like ""How can we arrange to pay the next bill?"". By not attempting to fathom a way to solve the big picture it will elevate heightened frustration and you will feel as if you are both more in control of your situation and able to slowly get back on your feet.

, In every relationship there is always a more dominant and more submissive character. When times get hard, try not to take control or have control taken completely out of your hands. It is sometimes easier to bury your head in the sand or to unleash your inner control-freak but in the essence of getting through the tough times with your marriage still in tact, try to balance the control as equally as possible between you.

, Always keep in mind that no matter what has happened or even what is still to come as long as you have each other(and your health) then that is what counts. And if you can get through this in one piece still with each other at the end then there is no doubt that you can get through anything.

, There is no law against looking.

, It's human nature to look at beautiful things. That's probably one of the reasons you married her, so you've got to accept the consequences.

, She'll likely be flattered and enjoy the attention, but if not, the two of you can discuss a plan of action if it continues to happen.

, Remind yourself that she chose to marry you because she loves you. The stares of other men are a compliment to her beauty, and should also make you realize how fortunate you are. If this woman is so good-looking that guys keep looking at her, and YOU'RE the one taking her home tonight, stand tall, look the other guys in the face, and smirk. Flaunt it.

See a therapist, if necessary.",How to Settle an Argument with Your Wife," Arguments are often the result of underlying tensions in a relationship. If you want to settle an argument effectively you must be willing to communicate with your wife. This means staying in the present moment and avoiding discussing past conflicts.


In an argument, you might be tempted to bring something up from the past. You might be trying to prove a point or convey how a certain behavior is part of a pattern. This is bad form in an argument, however, as it distracts from the issue at hand and can make your wife feel attacked or judged.
If you're inclined to bring up issues from the past, it might be because these issues were never resolved to begin with. Keep in mind that moving forward means addressing present issues and letting go of the past.;
, The way you phrase things during an argument matters. ""I"" statements focus on how you feel about a given subject. This keeps the frame of reference subjective and de-emphasizes blame.


An ""I"" statement addresses how you feel when something happens. It does not focus on an objective judgment of the situation but rather a personal reaction.For example, instead of saying ""It's very disrespectful when you make us late for family events"" try saying something like ""I feel disrespected when you're not ready for family events on time."", Language is important in an argument. Even if you're upset and frustrated, try to stay respectful. You cannot settle an argument if you're making someone feel disrespected.


No name calling. Calling your wife names or using profanity can sting. Even if you're extremely upset, refrain from name calling and cursing during an argument.
Yelling is also a bad idea during an argument. Yelling can be subjective. You might not think you're not yelling or raising your voice but it could easily come off that way to your spouse. If your wife asks you to keep your voice down, take a deep breath and proceed calmly with the conversation., Practicing active listening is vital to effective communication. When smoothing over an argument with your wife, make sure you pay attention to what she's saying and convey that you are listening.


Use verbal and non-verbal cues to show you are listening. Nod, say things like ""uh-huh"" and ""mmhmm."" Try to understand more than you're trying to be understood. Ask for clarification after your wife finishes talking if you don't understand anything. Summarize what was said after she finishes speaking.Be non-judgmental. Give your wife the space to feel what she's feeling, even if you disagree with the sentiment. Allow her to express her feelings without needing to justify them., When frustrated, people often fall into passive aggressive behaviors. This is toxic to communication and will only make the argument worse. Speak openly and honestly but use respect.


Passive aggressive behavior is often used as a way to avoid expressing anger. People think of anger as a negative and instead of directly saying, ""I'm mad at you"" or ""You're upsetting me,"" they may lash out in silence, sarcasm, sulking, or gossiping.There's a way to express anger in a healthy fashion. Explain that you are angry and why, using ""I"" statements to emphasize your feelings over objective facts. Yelling, cursing, or using derogatory language is not a healthy way to express anger. Try to stay calm while still explaining how you feel., If an argument is getting heated, you won't be able to settle it. If you find yourself struggling to keep composure, take a break. Walk away for a few minutes and take a few deep breaths. Make sure you explain to your wife that you need a minute to cool down. Then, return to the argument when you feel ready to talk effectively. While many people throw around the phrase, ""Never go to bed angry,"" keep in mind it's okay to go to sleep and talk things over in the morning if you're both extremely tired., Oftentimes, arguments are about more than surface issues. Try to understand your wife's perspective during the fight by considering her values.


While most successful couples share many core values, you'll inevitably clash in some areas. Arguments are sometimes necessary if they're in relation to certain differences in values. It's an opportunity for clarification and discussion. Try to think deeper during an argument. What are you really fighting about?
For example, say your wife is slightly more religious than you is and is upset you want to take a romantic vacation over Easter Weekend. It might not really be about the vacation itself but your differing religious beliefs. Your wife might be the type of person who cringes at the idea of missing a service, especially on a major holiday. She might feel you're being disrespectful of her wants and needs regarding her faith., An argument can be an opportunity to regroup and refocus. If there are certain values you're never going to share, what can you do about these values? How can you move forward as a couple?


Try to see an argument as a chance for growth. If there's an underlying issue at play, try to focus on smoothing over that issue. You might have to adjust your expectations of your wife and your marriage.
Return to the above example for a moment. Maybe your wife does not feel her religion is enough of a priority. You might have to accept your wife will never want to take a vacation during a religious holiday or sleep in on a Sunday. Even if this frustrates you, you might have to reconsider what you expect and accept your wife for who she is., Oftentimes, laughter can help in a heated situation. Couples tend to bond over shared humorous moments. Humor can help remind you both of your shared passion and love. When the argument begins settling down, try making a joke or bringing up a funny memory. This can help return a sense of normalcy to the situation., An important aspect of a marriage is understanding one another's wants. After an argument, work on learning about these wants. This can help prevent arguments in the future.


Talk about your personal and professional goals. What does your wife want career wise? Family wise? What do you want? Why? Have these kinds of conversations on a fairly regular basis. Wants are dynamic and might change with time and circumstance. Stay up to date on how one another change.Understanding one another's wants can help in future arguments. You're more likely to understand each other, which can help you listen better, stay focused, and come to a mutually satisfying resolution., Support is important in a relationship. In a healthy marriage, you will want what's best for your wife. Try to positive and encouraging of one another's pursuits. This can prevent argument in the future., Arguments often recur because people operate under different assumptions and standards. Being clear about what you mean and what you want can help prevent arguments from happening again.


Let's return to the lateness example. Say in your wife's family the start time of an event is taken as a light suggestion. Showing up exactly on time may come off as showing up too early, before others have arrived. In your family, it might be considered extremely rude to be even 5 or 10 minutes late.
To resolve this, say something like, ""It makes me uncomfortable when we don't show up early or at the start time of an invitation. Can we make an effort to get to events a little earlier?"" This way, you're emphasizing your feelings over an objective definition of lateness. This makes it clear to your wife what you mean by ""on time.""

, If arguments are a frequent occurrence in your home, you might not be communicating effectively. Seeing a couple's therapist can help you smooth over issues and learn how to talk to each other respectfully and productively. You can find a couple's therapist by going through your insurance or asking for a referral of your family physician."

Take trips to places you've never been.,
Embrace each other's hobbies.,
Talk about new subjects.,
Change up your hair and clothes sometimes.",How to Spice up a Marriage1," Do you tend to stay in on the weekends, turning to the same favorite shows and take-out places over and over? The comfort marriage provides is nice, but it's important to add some variety, too. Taking vacations, weekend trips or even short day trips to places you've never been is a great way to spark interesting conversations and find new reasons to laugh together.



Plan a trip with activities you think both of you will enjoy. If you both love wine, go wine tasting at a new winery, and buy a few bottles to take home so you'll remember what a nice time you had.
If you and your spouse are adventurous types, plan a trip that takes you far from your comfort zone. For example, you could visit a country where people speak another language and have fun finding your way around a foreign city together. Or for a weekend or day trip, instead of driving to the next town over, try riding your bikes instead, or taking a rafting trip. Do something that will help you feel like a team again.;
, It's fun and sexy to see your spouse trying out your hobby for the sake of love and adventure. If your spouse is a French film buff but you like to spend your free time playing sports, give up a game night to go see a film that you can talk about together afterward. In exchange, ask your spouse to join in for a pick-up game or play a singles tennis match with you sometime. You'll get to see each other feeling happy and in your respective elements, and that's definitely a recipe for spicing up a marriage.


You don't have to completely adopt your partner's hobby; maybe you hate subtitles, or you really dislike having tennis balls flying at your head. Just giving it an honest try will make your partner feel good. And no complaining!
Take pleasure in watching your partner enjoy his or her hobby. People only choose hobbies that make them happy. Your partner's happiness should make you happy, too!

, Do work, school, your kids' needs, and finances tend to be the subject of most of your conversations? Falling into the rut of never talking about things are fun and exciting can spell doom for a marriage over time. Make a point of having at least one conversation a day about something not related to everyday life. You'll find that both of you enjoy talking with each other a lot more when you aren't spouting worries every time you open your mouth.


Reading books and news articles is one way to get new conversation fodder. Talk about what's going on in the world outside your marriage. Politics, current events, scientific advancements, and pop culture are good conversation topics. Watch movies and shows together and analyze them together afterward. Make plans together and talk them out leading up to the events.
Try talking about something fun, new or interesting first thing in the morning. The first conversation you have will set the tone for the day. Rather than asking ""Did you remember to pay the gas bill?"" Start a pleasant conversation about what you're looking forward that day.

, This goes for woman and men! Sometimes adding spice is as easy as switching out the same old jacket for something bright and new, or wearing your hair in a different style every once in a while. Your partner will love seeing you trying something new. Wear a new shade of lipstick, get bangs, shave your beard, buy new shoes, put away that old t-shirt you wear every weekend - the possibilities are endless.


For added fun, dress completely differently for a day, and act totally charming. For example, if you're a jeans kind of guy, put on dress pants and a button-down shirt with some cologne. Kiss your spouse on the neck and tell her how much you love her.
You could also agree as a couple to dress as strangers - lots of couples do it! Plan on wearing interesting, sexy clothes and go separately to the same bar or hotel. When you see each other, pretend like you're meeting each other for the first time.

Surprise your spouse every once in a while.,
Take good care of each other.,
Compliment each other more.,
Don't keep score.",How to Spice up a Marriage2," When was the last time you gave your husband or wife a sweet, surprising gift? Maybe you both have everything you need, but it's nice to get a thoughtful gift every once in a while. It doesn't have to be expensive; just a little something to show your spouse you've been thinking of him or her and you're thankful to be married. Here are a few ideas for thoughtful gifts:


Cook your spouse's favorite dinner, and serve it with a nice bottle of wine.
Buy your spouse something you've seen him or her eyeing online for awhile, or something he or she admired in a shop window.
Flowers and chocolate are classic thoughtful gifts that everyone can appreciate.
Surprise your spouse by doing his or her regular chores sometime.
Clean up the bedroom, buy a few new throw pillows, and light some candles one evening when you're both staying in.

Plant your spouse's favorite flowers in front of the house.
Throw a dinner party and invite your spouse's family and friends.

, Are you taking your spouse for granted in any way? Do you know what worries he or she has, or what needs aren't always being met? Go out of your way to ease your spouse's mind and make life a little easier for him or her. Try to get more in tune with how you can be a better husband or wife. This will strengthen your marriage and help it feel more satisfying.


Divide the household chores evenly. Don't be lazy and let your spouse do all the work. Are you doing your fair share?
Take care of your spouse when he or she is sick or tired. Help him or her feel better in any way you can.
Spend time discussing your spouse's worries. Is there any way you can help to solve the problems? You'll feel closer to one another if you can find a solution together.

, A few compliments can go a long way toward spicing up a marriage. Just make sure they're genuine! What do you truly appreciate about your spouse? Do you ever make a point of telling him or her? Now's the time to start expressing your appreciation and letting your spouse know you think he or she is the most wonderful person in the world.


The number of compliments and positive things you say to your spouse should greatly exceed the number of negative things you say. You don't have the right to cut your spouse down, and you should never insult him or her. Be accepting, and if it's necessary to say something negative, be gentle.
Compliment your spouse in front of other people. Your spouse will feel great, and others will be impressed at how happy and sweet your marriage is. Never, ever criticize your spouse in front of other people; this can cause long-term damage.

, Tallying up how many times you took the kids to school this week, made dinner, did the dishes, and so on is a recipe for resentment. You and your spouse aren't opponents - you're a team! You're in this together, and you need to remind yourself of that sometimes. Don't get bogged down in keeping track of who does what chore.


Perform your responsibilities with a spirit of cheerfulness and generosity, rather than frowning and complaining all the time. Encourage your spouse to do the same. You'll find your days together become more fun that way.
If the division of chores and other responsibilities in your marriage is truly unequal, that's a different story. If your spouse isn't doing any work at all, and you feel like you're running the household on your own, you might need marriage counseling.

Get in the mood.,
Try new things in bed.,
Schedule a date night.,
Keep up your body confidence.",How to Spice up a Marriage3," After several years of marriage, maybe you find yourself saying ""I'm not in the mood"" more often than not. Next time, stop yourself before you say that, and think about why you aren't. Is it because you're tired? Then get more rest so you'll be in the mood! Are you kids asleep in the next room? You're going to have to get over it for the sake of your marriage. Find ways to get in the mood, because having regular sex is important in a marriage, and it certainly spices things up.


Think of sex as a form of stress relief. A lot of people don't feel like having sex because they have too many things to worry about. Having sex with your partner is one of the best ways to free your mind of worries for a little while. You'll feel closer and happier afterward, and you'll start turning to your partner for relief more often!
Fatigue is another big reason why people aren't in the mood to have sex on any given night. Have sex anyway. It can be calm, slow, sleepy sex, but you should still do it.

, You've probably heard this one before, but that's because it works for so many people. Spicing up your sex life can be as easy as trying a different sexual position, wearing sexy lingerie when you normally don't, having sex in a different place (not always in your bed), or changing things in your bedroom to make it feel more sexy.


Try tantric sex, a sensual, slow form of sex that encourages deep intimacy.

Role-playing in the bedroom can be an exciting way to change things up.

Talking dirty is an easy way to inject lots of spice into your sex life.

, It's great when sex can be spontaneous, but sometimes life gets in the way. If you have an extremely busy schedule and spend a lot of time meeting your kids' needs, you might let sex fall by the wayside. The solution is to set at least one night a week aside for a date night that involves sex. Spend time alone together doing something you enjoy and do your very best to be in the mood that night. Having regular sex will definitely make you feel closer to your partner and put the spark back in your marriage.

, Sometimes married couples have less sex because they lose confidence in their bodies over the years. Having kids and dealing with stress can take a toll. It's important to keep exercising, eating healthy, and dressing well so that you enjoy your own body and want to share it with your partner.


Eat lots of fruits and vegetables, and avoid takeout and fast food.
Go easy on the alcohol and choose water instead.
Have a workout routine that involves both cardio and weightlifting.
Have good hygiene habits and adjust to your changing body.

Be accepting of your spouse's aging.,
Be thankful for your life together.,
Don't dwell on the past too much.",How to Spice up a Marriage4," Your spouse's body, personality, goals and dreams are going to change over the years, just like you are changing. Married couples need to accept each other as they change and mature, rather than struggling to hold on to youth that is no longer there.


Don't see your spouse's changing body as being full of flaws. Our culture views aging as something to resist, but this is a backwards view. Changing skin and hair can be beautiful in their own right. Be glad you and your spouse get to grow old together!
Be flexible enough to accept your spouse's changing personality, too. People tend to get a little harder as they age, but they also get wiser. Help your spouse mature into a happy, whole, fulfilled person by being flexible and accepting.

, Remember when you took your marriage vows? You never could have imagined all you'd go through together as a couple. Look how far you've come, and how much you've accomplished, and be grateful for it. Expressing your gratefulness to your partner will re-energize your marriage and help you look forward to a long future together.

, Don't compare your spouse to his or her former self, and don't compare your marriage to its early stages. Life is full of changes, and that's a good thing. Wishing things were as they used to be isn't going to help your marriage to grow. And would you really want it to remain stunted forever, anyway? You can enjoy talking about memories and looking at old pictures, but try not to get overly wistful and nostalgic. Focus on the here and now, and planning for the future.

If he’s having a busy week at work or just a rough day, then making the effort to help him out during his daily life can really show him that you love him and that you care about him


While you don’t need to get into the habit of doing everything for him, just doing the right favor at the right time can really show him how much you care. Here are some ideas:
Bring him lunch to work if he forgot it.
Pick up fresh coffee and a pastry for him in the morning if he has a big day at work.
Pick up that book he’s been meaning to read at the store.
Help him with a simple chore, like doing laundry or walking the dog, when he’s having a crazy week.
Make that call to the maintenance man that he’s been putting off all week.

, Don’t just watch a movie at home with the kids or consider your date night the afternoon you’ve spent at your company picnic.


Make an effort to block off time on your calendar just for the two of you to reconnect and to be together. Though you may think you’re too busy for a traditional date night, this is an important way to show your husband you love him.
Date night doesn’t have to mean a romantic meal and a movie, either. Think about the kind of date night that may appeal most to your husband. Maybe you can mix things up and check out the new brewery in town or go to a night As game, for a change.
If you plan at least a few date nights per month on your calendar in advance, then this will show that you love him and want to make the effort.
Look nice on your date night and show him that you really care. Take time with your hair, clothes, and jewelry so he sees that you treat it as a special occasion.

, Sometimes, the best way you can show your love is through action. If your husband had a long day at work, or even if he just looks a little down, take the time to massage his neck, back, shoulders, or, if you’re really feeling loving, his feet.

, This can be a great way to show your love just because, or an amazing way to transition into some foreplay.


If you do this when he least expects it, it may get the best results. If he’s just sitting at his desk, looking over some paperwork, or reading a magazine on the couch, give him a sneak massage attack.
Just be gentle, especially with his feet, if you haven’t done this before. He may be more ticklish than you expected.

, If you really want to show your husband that you love him, then you have to make him see that you’re determined to have a positive relationship with his family, even if you don’t always get along.


Even if his mother is about as welcoming as an angry poodle, you have to do your best to try to at least be cordial with his family and avoid bad-mouthing them as much as you can so he sees that his love is more important to you than the fact that you have nothing in common with his sister.
Of course, sometimes, it can feel nearly impossible to get along with your in-laws. But if you at least make an effort, then your husband will see that he really does mean a lot to you.
Try reaching out to his family more, whether you call them, invite them to lunch, or send flowers on birthdays and important occasions.

, Another way to show your husband you love him is to go on new adventures together to keep your relationship fresh. This can mean trying to go scuba-diving, taking a biking trip along the California coast, or even taking a salsa class. It’s not really important what you do, as long as you make an effort to keep things feeling new and exciting.


The fact that you’re not resigned to doing the same old thing day after day will show your husband how much you love him.
Make sure to stick to some of your favorite traditions. If you want to show your husband that you really love him, then continue going to your favorite restaurant once a month, watching your favorite show together, and even seeing your old favorite band, even if you both agree it’s not as good as it used to be, if you think you can still make a fun night of it.
You don’t need to try too hard to try a million new things at once, or that will get overwhelming. Make an effort to do one or two completely new things together a month, whether you’re hiking or making pasta from scratch, and take it from there.

, Though making love isn’t the only way you can show how much you care, making an effort to have a passionate, exciting time in the bedroom can make your husband see that you really do care for him.


Make sure you’re in the mood and that you’re not just doing it to cross an item off your checklist, and take the time to explore your husband’s body in a sensual and exciting way.
It’s never too late to try a new position or to make love in a new place. As long as you’re comfortable with it, this can be a great way to show him how much you care.
If you don’t feel corny about it, wearing some sexy lingerie never hurt anyone.
You can even invest in some massage oils or body lotion that can make things feel more sensual.
Ask your husband what he really wants from you, and encourage him not to hold back. As long as you’re comfortable with it, this can help show him how much you love him—just make sure you’re getting something in return.

, You may think that the only way you can show your husband how much you love him is by getting closer to him, but sometimes, the best way to show how much you care is to give him the space he needs and deserves.


Let him have a night out with his buddies, encourage him to go camping with his brother, and don’t get annoyed when he’d rather spend the evening reading or working out than having dinner with you.
Though he should still make time for you, you don’t want to smother him, or he actually will end up feeling more suffocated than loved.Letting your husband have his own life and spend time with his own friends is perfectly healthy. In fact, spending more time apart will make you appreciate each other more when you’re together.
Don’t be jealous. If you have no reason to be jealous, then give your husband the respect he deserves by not calling him every two seconds when he’s out with his friends or giving him the stink eye any time he talks to another woman.

, Though you don’t need to be obsessed with his favorite baseball team or band all the time, if you want to show him you love him, you should show an interest in the things he cares about and do them with him, if that would suit him.


If he’s been trying to get you to go to a Knicks game for years, get him tickets to one on his birthday. If he’s been wanting you to try brewing your own beer with him, spend a Sunday having fun in the kitchen with him instead of rolling your eyes.
Though you don’t have to be one of those couples who does everything together, if you want to show him you love him, then you should make an effort to appreciate the things he loves, at least once in a while.
Your relationship can grow stronger if you introduce him to more of the things you love, too. Though you shouldn’t force him to go to yoga with you, you may be able to find something that he would actually like, like the new Thai place you’ve been hitting up with your friends.

, Sometimes, the best way you can make your husband see how much you love him is to encourage him through your words. Make him feel good about the new project he’s been working on, his new job interview, or about patching things up with his father.


Be there to make him feel good about himself instead of cutting him down for no reason. Let him see that you think he’s an amazing man with endless potential; sometimes, your words can make him feel better about himself than anything else.
Simply saying something like, “You’re so good with people. I’m sure you have nothing to be nervous about. I think you’ll love working on this new project,” can make him feel more confident in his actions.
You can also say, “You’re so determined that I have no doubt you’ll be able to run this marathon. I don’t know anyone who works as hard as you.”

, Saying “I love you” can often do the trick best of all. Make an effort to tell your husband you love him at least once a day and to look him in the eyes when you say it so he knows you mean it.


Make eye contact and stop everything to get this message across instead of saying “Love ya!” like you’re just required to say it.
Put your heart into him and let him know how loved he truly is.
Though telling him you love him in person is most effective, saying these words over the phone or over email can also make him feel more loved.
Don’t just say “I love you” when you’re on a date or going through a hard time. Sometimes, saying it just because will yield the best results.

, Taking the time to compliment your husband can also make him feel loved. Tell him how handsome he looks in his new shirt, say that he always knows how to make you laugh, and tell him that he’s incredibly good with new people.


Find a way to make him see that you truly think he’s special, and do your best to make sure that your compliments are genuine and that you’re not just saying them to butter him up
If you have kids, make sure they hear you praising their father so they know how amazing he is. Here are some other examples of things you can say to show how much you love him:
“You were the best looking man at that party. I’m always so proud to be by your side.”
“You’re so good with kids. I don’t know how you do it.”
“You always know what to say to make me feel better. You have a talent for it.”
“I’m so thankful to be with someone who is always reading so much. It’s refreshing to be with someone who is so excited about the world.”

, Just making an effort to show that you want to know how your husband’s day went can show him how much you love him.


When you’re both home from work, or if you’ve spent a weekend day apart, check in when you see him to make sure that he had a good day and show interest in what he did.
Though you don’t need to interrogate him or ask about every little thing, taking the time to see how his day went will show that you really love him.
If you know that he had an important day, such as a big presentation at work or a tense reunion with a friend he hadn’t seen in a long time, make sure you follow up about him so he knows you care.
When you ask how his day went, don’t just ask in passing, but stop what you’re doing to make him see that it really matters to you.

, Another way to show your husband that you love him is to send him a sweet text message to show how much you care. As long as it is sincere and makes him smile, you’ll be on your way to making him feel more loved.


Simply telling him how much you love him, that you had a great time in bed last night, or that you’re looking forward to your date night, can make him feel that he really matters to you.
If you’re not big on texting, sending him a sweet message at an unexpected time can really make an impact.
Though you shouldn’t only express how much you care about him through texting, it can be a nice supplement.

, If you want your husband to see that you love him, then you should show him that you’re willing to talk to him about anything and that you’re happy to have an honest and open conversation with him.


If he wants to bring up something important, put away all of your distractions, take the time to really listen to what he’s saying, and respond to him when it’s your turn to talk, making sure that he sees your side of the situation as respectfully as possible.
Making an effort to really talk to him instead of being passive aggressive or short with him will really show him how much you love him.
Listening is a big part of communicating. Just hearing what he has to say without interrupting him or disagreeing with him can make a huge impact on your relationship.
Be as honest as you can. Though the occasional white lie won’t hurt him, make sure you don’t keep secrets from him or make him feel like he’s shut out from your life.

, Another way to show your husband that you really love him is to be able to compromise about the things that matter to you both.


Be willing to see that being happy is often more important than being right and that it’s not important for you to get your way every single time.
Find a way to sometimes get what you want, sometimes give him what he wants, and to compromise on situations where there’s something possible for both of you.

,


Strong communication is important because it will let you see what things really matter to your husband, and what he is willing to let go.
Work on striking a balance. You can pick the movie for date night, and he can pick the dinner spot.
When you give him what he wants, don’t resent him for it the whole time. For example, if you agree to go to his brother’s barbecue instead of your friend’s birthday party, don’t sulk the whole time you’re there, or he’ll see that you’re not really willing to compromise after all.

, To show your husband that you love him, it’s important to swallow your pride and to say you’re sorry when you’ve made a mistake. Stop everything you’re doing, look him in the eye, and tell him that you truly apologize for what you did and that you’re filled with regret and promise not to do it again


Let him see that hurting or upsetting him really did have an impact on you, and that you love him so much that you’re deeply sorry about whatever happened. He’ll see how much you love him because he’ll be impressed that you’re able to humble yourself and fess up.
Just remember that while saying you’re sorry is important, it can be even more important to stick to your word. If you apologize for being snappy with his friends, you should really make an effort not to do it again.

, While your husband is taking a hot shower, sneak into the bathroom and write “I love you” on the steamy mirror. He’ll have a pleasant surprise waiting for him when he gets out of the shower.


As long as you don’t freak him out when you sneak in the bathroom, he’ll be touched by this sweet and creative gesture.If you don’t think the steam approach will work, write him a sweet post-it before you leave for the day and stick it on the bathroom mirror, so it’s one of the first things he sees when he gets up.

, Everyone deserves to be spoiled with some breakfast in bed every once in a while. Whether it’s his birthday, Valentine’s Day, your anniversary, or just a random day when you want to show him how much he means to you, you should get up early and make him a fun, love-themed breakfast that shows him how much he means to you.


Make sure he’s not busy and in the mood to enjoy your delicious treats, and you’ll be showing him how much you love him. If you have kids, they can help you serve him.
Heart shaped pancakes with some halved strawberries can be a cute way to show him how much he means to you.
If he’s more into bacon and eggs, you can make him a smiley face out of egg eyes and a bacon mouth, and have him laughing over how hard you tried.
If you really want to hammer home the point that you’re being romantic, then make some chocolate-covered strawberries and serve them as a side dish or place them over his Belgian waffle.
If you want to be funny, make him Eggs Benedict with some hollandaise-sauce shaped hearts over them.

, Getting a love letter from his wife will be much more romantic for your husband than dealing with the usual junk mail and bills.


Take the time to write him a long, sweet letter that explains just how much he means to you and try to time it so he gets it before your date night or another important occasion. He should be the one who checks the mail that day, and you should make sure not to give your secret away.

This will be a great way to show him you love him in a new and creative way.Have you ever written your husband a love letter before? If you haven’t, then this can be an original and exciting way to take your relationship to a new level.

, Another way to show your husband that you love him is to try to have a change of scenery for the weekend.


Though you don’t have to spend a lot of money or go very far, just taking a weekend trip to go hiking, check out wine country, or spend some time relaxing on the beach can help you show your husband how much you love him in a new context.
Though you can’t always get away, this can be a great change of pace and can let him see how much he really means to you.
If you’re stumped about where to go, try to think of something that would appeal more to him than to what your idea of a romantic getaway will be. Sure, you may think hiking is romantic, but if he’s more into city life, then you should plan an urban adventure instead.

, You may not have the time or energy for a full-on camping trip, or you may just not feel like exploring the wilderness. Well, camping in your own backyard can be a fun and silly way to show your husband how much you love him—and a great way to get the kids involved, if you have any. Just set the tent up in the backyard together, roast some hot dogs over the campfire, and have S’mores for dessert and you’ll be on the way to getting your groove back.


Your husband may be reluctant, at first, but you can convince him that this can be an easy and fun way to have an adventure together. If you bring games, like ring toss or even a Frisbee, that can make it feel even more like a getaway.

,


Though you don’t need to always dress to the nines to show your husband how much you love him, you can really kick your romance up a notch and show him how much you love him if you make an effort to dress up for each other when you go out on certain occasions.
Have dinner at a fancy restaurant, go to the opera, or even go to your favorite local bar and get dressed up ironically for a fun night out.
How often do you get to wear your formal clothes? Though this may not be something you do all the time, bringing out your favorite dress and heels and having your husband wear a suit can make you feel more loving and romantic and will make him see how much you love him.

,


You don't have to, for example, gush enthusiastically about the new iron board cover he bought you on the spur of the moment, but if he remembered to get one in your favourite colour, show him some love by acknowledging that fact at least.
If you can't imagine your husband ever doing anything in these steps for you it's ok to not feel obligated to make so much effort. Marriages are partnerships, both people have to work at it, there needs to be give and take from both sides.

Learn what changes and experiences are common and how other people deal with them.Once you realize that your partner’s behavior is normal, you may feel reassured to realize it has nothing to do with you.


Do some research online or at your doctor’s office about menopause.
Educating yourself about menopause can show your partner that you care and want to understand her experience.;
, A woman may feel sadness or loss as her reproductive days are officially over. Her weight may change despite maintaining a healthy lifestyle. These sudden changes can leave a woman feeling like she is less desirable or less of a woman. Remind her that you love her and find her attractive.Suggest a date night for both of you to dress up for and enjoy.

, Insomnia is common during menopause. If you often snore loudly, find a way to sleep that allows her to sleep as well. Perhaps you can offer to sleep in the guest bedroom or to get a sleep study to improve sleep apnea. The more quality sleep she gets, the better her mood will be.Practice good sleep habits together. Have a nightly routine you do together, such as sipping tea, reading a book, then falling asleep at the same time each night. A routine can help induce better sleep., Even if you cannot wrap your mind around her experience, validate the experience for her.Empathize with her experience as best as you can, even if you feel frustrated, angry, or confused. Reassure her by saying, “I can tell this is hard for you.”


For example, if your significant other is moody, say, “It seems like you’re having a hard day. I’m sorry you’re upset, and I’m here to help you however I can.”
Do things to make her life easier. If she finds a bath soothing, offer to draw her a bath to help her relax.

, Many women experience sexual changes as a result of menopause. Relearn ways to show intimacy and affection with your partner.Hold hands, kiss, cuddle, and focus on emotional intimacy. Show that you want to be close to your significant other through your affection.


Express your desire toward your partner by initiating affection and closeness.

, Acknowledge that menopause is difficult and that you want to support your partner. Offer your help and support, and ask her, “How can I be most helpful during this time?”Even if your partner doesn’t know how you can help, you can communicate that you’re on her side and care about how she’s feeling.


Say, “I’ve noticed things are harder for you since you’ve been going through menopause. I care about you and want to offer any help I can give.”

, You may feel frustrated and irritated, yet believe your significant other when she says she’s doing the best she can. Even if it doesn’t seem like she’s trying, know that it’s a difficult time for her and that she may feel fragile or exhausted.Recognize that you do not understand her experience and therefore, cannot judge it.


When she says, “I’m doing the best I can,” believe her, even if it frustrates you.

, While some women do not experience menopausal symptoms, most women experience changes to their moods. Remind yourself that her ups and downs have nothing to do with you. If she’s feeling weepy, offer a shoulder to cry on. If she’s angry or upset, give her some space to cool down.


Don’t take her moods personally. Listen and be supportive without thinking her upset has to be your upset., The bodily changes that result from menopause can affect sex. For example, a woman may experience vaginal dryness or a drop in libido.If you’re feeling frustrated that you’re not having sex (again), remind yourself to be patient. Most women’s sex drives return post-menopausally.


You may want to introduce lubricant into your sexual activities. This can help ease pain during sex.If using or discussing lubricant feels uncomfortable, surprise her with a luxurious lubricant that both of you can enjoy.

, Some women experience depression as a result of going through menopause. She might isolate herself or retreat from you, stop enjoying her favorite activities, feel hopeless or helpless, or feel guilty and worthless.If you’re concerned that your significant other is suffering from depression, offer to take her to see a therapist.Therapy can help with symptoms of depression. A therapist can also help your significant other talk about what it’s like to go through menopause and how this experience affects her.

, Maintain a sense of humor and playfulness in your relationship. Gently playing and laughing together will help you to continue feeling intimate. It can also lower any tension the experience may cause. However, don’t use humor to be disapproving or sarcasm to make a point. Use humor to keep her on your side.For example, if she’s having an intense mood she can’t seem to get out of, say, “I saw a new cat video I thought you’d like, and I’d love to watch it with you since I know how much you like funny cat videos.”

, If your partner’s menopause causes you stress, anxiety, and overwhelm, you may benefit from seeing a therapist.A therapist can help support you and help you approach the menopause more compassionately and with more understanding.

, View menopause as a challenging and new situation that you’ve never faced before. See this time as an experience to help you cope with a new situation from a positive viewpoint. Tell yourself that you can grow from this experience and become a better person and a better partner as a result of this time.For example, practice patience, compassion, and goodwill toward your partner in ways that you never have before.

, Your partner’s menopause can be a stressful time for her and for you. Find outlets for stress through relaxation practices. Practice relaxation 30 minutes each day to combat stress and stabilize moods.If you can do activities together, this can help both of you relax. Go to yoga classes together and meditate together.

, While menopause may seem like an unending nightmare, take comfort in the fact that it does end. Menopause won’t last forever. While the transition may take several years, most symptoms do not last beyond two years.Keep offering your support and she will notice and appreciate your gestures.

Determine what expenses qualify as shared.Sometimes it is easy to identify a shared expense.,
Split expenses evenly.By splitting every expense evenly, you and your partner have a form of equality in the relationship.,
Split your expenses according to income.This expense-splitting technique calls for the person with the higher income paying for a larger share of the household expenses.,
Share expenses unevenly.,
Be willing to trade time and money.If you work and your partner doesn’t or if your partner works but you do not, there are other ways you can come to a fair arrangement by thinking about the work (as well as the money) it takes to run a household.",How to Split Expenses As a Couple1," For instance, heating, water, and electricity are house-wide expenses and you will both, presumably, enjoy their use in approximately equal amounts. But it might be harder to justify sharing other expenses. If you have TV service at your home, for instance, but only one of you watches TV, it makes little sense to split that particular expense.


Talk to your partner about which expenditures they believe should be considered shared and which should be considered individual expenses.;
, This is probably the most logical way to split expenses for couples who have equal or roughly equal incomes.


There are many ways to split expenses 50/50. You might choose to split each expense as it comes in. Alternately, you might reconcile receipts at the end of each month and pay your partner whatever is “owed.” Talk to your partner about which method works best for you.
You don’t need to split everything perfectly evenly. Creating a spreadsheet to track expenses, or otherwise accounting for every penny spent between you can reduce your relationship to a purely economic exchange that takes the romance out of it. Even if you split household bills, it’s still okay to treat your significant other to dinner or a date when you go out.
For instance, you might take turns paying for dinner. Even if your dinners don’t total the exact same amount each time you go out to eat, over time, you’ll each probably end paying about the same amount. This qualifies as a form of splitting costs evenly.

, In other words, equality is achieved through each person in the relationship paying expenses according to their ability.


For example, suppose you earn $3,000 per month and your partner earns $2,000 each month. In this case, you should pay for 60% of the expenses, since your income is 60% of the total household income (the figure you get when you combine the incomes of you and your partner).
Talk carefully with your partner to make sure that there are no hidden issues before going forward with this method. In some cases, your partner may feel as though they are contributing too much or too little if this method is used.

, In this method, one person will pay for the majority of household expenses.This is the natural choice to make when one person in the relationship has way more income than the other person. However, if both you and your partner make a lot of money, either of you could choose to take on an expense-splitting arrangement like this.


A fair arrangement doesn’t necessarily need to divide all expenses perfectly. For instance, one of you could take the internet bill while the other takes the power bill. Divide things up according to whichever scheme suits your situation.

, Domestic work – cleaning, cooking, and doing the laundry – is crucial to keeping a household going. It makes little sense for one person to both complete all these tasks and also provide financial stability for you as a couple.


Think about splitting the total amount of work that each of you do as a couple rather than thinking of splitting expenses along purely financial lines.

Communicate during intimacy.",How to Prevent Past Sexual Trauma from Ruining Your Marriage," Realize that survivors of sexual trauma will reflect a wide range of effects. While some people may have coped well and have few mental health concerns, others may continue to struggle and have many mental health concerns. The effects of sexual trauma can include a variation of factors, such as: how much trauma you were exposed to, the severity of the trauma, the type of relationship you had with the person who abused you and how close you were to them, how long the sexual trauma lasted, how others you trusted reacted to the sexual abuse (if you told them, did they believe you?). Some signs of how sexual trauma can negatively impact your overall well-being include:

Inability to trust others. Sexual trauma could impair your view of the world, and decrease your ability to trust and feel safe with others. Even if the person you may be with is a reliable and trustworthy individual.
Having a low self-esteem or low self-worth. This can be because you feel ashamed and blame yourself for the abuse, even though it was not your fault. Or maybe you are having feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, because no matter what you do or how hard you try, you just can’t seem to feel good about yourself or have any hope for a positive future.
Decreased healthy coping skills because of a lack of hope and feelings of low self-worth. Negative feelings from past sexual trauma can make it difficult to deal with normal daily stressors. You may have increased irritability or agitation, along with the inability to properly control your anger. Some sexual trauma victims may react to situations impulsively without thinking through the consequences, leading to risky behaviors.
Dissociation (in more severe situations). This is when the survivor's mind will “separate” from the painful events as a way of protection. You feel like the world you're in is not real, as if you are having an out of body experience. Sometimes this might happen if the trauma survivor is triggered by something, and disassociations may happen as a reaction to the pain and fear. If you recognize any of these reactions to prior trauma, it is imperative that you seek help.;
, Recognize that the way you’re feeling right now is normal. Don’t deny your experience or try to ignore it. Addressing the past is a necessary first step towards healing in the present.Remind yourself that the traumatic event was not your fault. After the fact, it’s easy to think of ways you could have prevented the event from happening, but remember that you didn’t have that information at the time.

, Even if your trauma was not recent, emotions from the event may still be affecting you today. Make time to reflect on your feelings non-judgmentally, and think about how they could be affecting your marriage and other aspects of your life now.Sexual assault and similar traumas can bring out a range of strong emotions, such as anger, shame, and regret.
Explore your feelings by journaling or writing yourself a letter. You can also talk through the issue with someone you trust, such as your spouse or a close friend.

, If you still feel powerless and scared after the trauma, take action to reclaim your agency. Join a support group where you can talk to other survivors about your experiences, and reach out to help others by volunteering or supporting a friend in need.


When you no longer feel helpless, you will be able to heal more quickly., The deep-seated trauma of sexual abuse or assault is often difficult to overcome alone. Make an appointment with a therapist who specializes in helping survivors of abuse. They can help you recover from the trauma itself, as well as any other mental health problems that may have developed afterwards as a result.While individual therapy is always a good idea, consider seeking out couples therapy, too. Couples therapy can teach you and your spouse to communicate better, and it may help you feel closer as you work together to overcome your past trauma.

, Let your spouse know what you are going through emotionally on a day-to-day basis. Don’t assume they know how you’re doing – they probably don’t, and this can make them feel frustrated and shut out.For instance, you could say, “I’ve been having a hard time letting people touch me lately, but I still love you and want to be close to you. Can we just sit and talk for a while?”
Don’t feel like you’re nagging or burdening your spouse when you tell them about your feelings. Communication is essential for keeping your marriage healthy.
Connecting with your spouse, and even including your spouse in your therapy as soon as possible. This is an effective protective measure you can take to prevent the negative impact of sexual trauma and to properly heal.

, Your spouse may feel hurt or confused when you turn down sex or get caught up in bad memories of the past. Let them know that your trauma doesn’t have anything to do with them, and that you’re grateful for their emotional support.For instance, you might say gently, ""Honey, I want you to know how much I want to connect with you. I'm just having a hard time right now. I know this must be frustrating for you, but please be patient with me.""
Many people who haven’t experienced sexual trauma don’t understand how far-reaching its effects can be. Don’t be offended if your spouse can’t fully empathize with what you’re going through – it doesn’t mean they don’t care about you.

, Couples therapy can help your spouse gain a better understanding of how you feel. Individual and couples therapy combined will help with the following:

Overcoming persistent negative thoughts and feelings, such as self-blaming, feeling shame, guilt or low self-esteem and self-worth.
Overcoming unhealthy coping skills you may have developed like self-harming, substance abuse, eating disorders, or other compulsive and impulsive behaviors.
Identifying, developing, and utilizing healthy positive coping skills to help you build your trust, and setting healthy boundaries within your relationship.
Addressing any other mental health problems that may have developed as a result of the sexual trauma like depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, etc.

, Your spouse plays an important role in your recovery, so help them know how to help you. Let them know what they can do to make you feel safe and loved.For instance, you might need to talk through your feelings, or you might want to work on non-sexual touch like hugging and massage. Say something like, ""I really need to be held right now. Can we cuddle?""
Involving your spouse in your recovery can help them feel less helpless and frustrated about the situation.

, Focusing on the present moment can help you feel more comfortable and centered during sex with your spouse. You can establish the habit of mindfulness by meditating every day.Mindfulness can help prevent both flashbacks and dissociation.

, If you’re not ready to have sex yet, use non-sexual touch to rebuild intimacy with your spouse. Work on getting comfortable with cuddling, hugging, and giving each other massages.Discuss what you’re comfortable with ahead of time, to make sure your spouse understands what you can handle.

, If you don’t feel comfortable engaging in a particular sexual activity, let your spouse know. As you become more comfortable with intimacy, you can slowly re-introduce these activities, if you and your spouse both want to.Have this discussion beforehand. For instance, you two might sit down and check in regularly about your sexual intimacy. However, it's also a good idea to remind your spouse of your boundary in the moment. You might gently say, ""Honey, remember I told you I don't feel comfortable with that.""

, It may be a good idea to come up with a safe word (e.g. ""Red"" or ""Too hot"") for when you become uncomfortable during physical intimacy. Agree with your partner on how and when you can use the safe word.Use the safe word if any sexual act triggers flashbacks from your sexual trauma. You can use this so your partner knows that you need time to regroup and cope with any anxiety that may occur.

, If you dissociate or start to feel anxious during sex, let your spouse know. If you need to stop or do something different, tell them so. Don’t just wait and hope your spouse realizes what you need–good communication is a big part of feeling safe during intimacy.Despite being clear about what you do and don't want outside the heat of the moment, it can still be helpful to talk with your spouse during intimacy.
For instance, you might say things like ""Yes, that feels good"" to express your pleasure.

While the relationship may appear stable on the surface, you may be distancing yourselves, which affects your ability to relate to one another.Stay involved with one another. Ask about each other’s day, friends, work, and life. Don’t become strangers to each other, but keep that daily connection, however small.;
, Don’t just get lost in the daily ho-hum of life, work, children, and running the house; make sure you are connecting on an emotionally intimate level.Make time to talk about your intimacy, goals, dreams, feelings, thoughts desires. Talk about your failures, letdowns, and disappointments. Talk about you, your partner, and your marriage.


Intimacy occurs when you are able to be vulnerable with your partner. Create an atmosphere of trust and safety, letting your partner know that you love and support him or her.

, If your partner has a passion, don’t squash it, even if it’s uninteresting to you. Instead, support your partner by supporting what is important to your partner. And similarly, make sure you communicate to your partner what is important to you.Showing your support of your partner can go a long way.


Make compromises based on what is important to each of you.
If your partner loves to play Bridge, show up at his or her Bridge tournaments. If your partner is a dancer, show up to his or her performances.

, Your partner’s cues may differ from your own. For instance, you may want to come home from a stressful day and receive a massage from your partner, while your partner may want to come home from a stressful day and throw himself into cooking dinner to let off steam. Be sensitive to the information your partner gives you, both verbal and nonverbal.Learn to understand your spouse’s cues and respond to them.


You may respond to conflict verbally, while your spouse may respond nonverbally. Learn to read his or her cues and respond to them in a meaningful way for your spouse so that you better meet the needs and wants.

, It’s easy to tell your partner how annoying you find him or her, or how upset you are with the lack of help you receive with kids. But when was the last time you expressed your heartfelt gratitude? Let your spouse know that you appreciate the ways he or she makes your life better.Write a note or a card for your spouse to see expressing why you are thankful.
Remark on how thankful you are for the little ways your spouse contributes to making you (and your family) happy each day.
Tell your spouse the reasons you are happy you married him or her.

, Don’t come at your partner in anger or hostility. Keep your judgments to yourself. Instead of putting blame on your partner, express your needs and how you feel (not how he or she “made you feel”).And when you don’t interact kindly, apologize.
If you’re trying to avoid blaming your partner, instead of saying, “You never talk about your feelings”, say, “I want us to be open and honest in our relationship, and to do this, it would really help me if you told me how you are feeling.”

, Connect physically with your spouse by holding hands, putting your arm around each other, resting a hand on his or her leg, and embracing. Focus on connecting your bodies in a way that feels safe and intimate, yet nonsexual. Connecting with skin contact can be beneficial for your own health as well as for the relationship.Often affection can be playful and fun. Steal a kiss while your spouse doesn’t expect it, or playfully pat his or her butt while people aren’t looking.

, Sensual touch is one step up from affectionate touch. Sensual touch can include giving a luxurious massage, caressing, passionate kissing, and gentle or slow sexual touch.You don’t have to have a sexual expectation with sensual touch. You can just focus on exploring and enjoying touching your spouse’s body and enjoying having your body touched and explored.

, Be clear in your desires, dislikes, and expectations. Couples that talk about sex have more and better sex!Make sure you understand your partner’s wishes and expectations, too. The more understanding there is around sex, the more fulfilling it can be.


Don’t avoid discussing sex because of embarrassment, guilt, or shame. It’s important for you to feel sexually fulfilled with your spouse.

, Yup, dive right in, even if it’s been awhile since you’ve had sex.You can start slow and then try new and more interesting things. Even if you feel fearful or embarrassed, create an atmosphere of safety and trust that you can enjoy with your spouse.


If you want adventure, consider trying new positions. Research different sex positions online or get creative and create your own!
If you feel anxious or fearful to return to sex, try a Bottom-up approach: practice nourishing the friendship first (spending time together, enjoying each other’s company), add physical affection then sensual affection, and when you feel comfortable, engage in sex.Take each stage as you feel comfortable, remembering that this is your life partner, whom you trust and love.

, Find a babysitter and spend an entire evening focused on your physical and romantic connection. Let your spouse know that this evening is just for the two of you two enjoy your physical and sexual connection.


Take turns giving massages or take a bath together.
Spend a whole evening together naked.
Engage in sensate focus by being blindfolded or blindfolding your partner. Focus on the sensation of being touched, then touching your partner.

, Commit to doing something together regularly. Making an activity a ritual means that you can regularly look forward to spending time together doing something that is special to you both. Engage the activity regularly and know that this is time set aside for you to be together.


You may choose to watch a tv show together weekly, share coffee in the mornings, take a daily walk together, or regularly engage in an activity together, such as camping or a dance class., Relive the day you told your spouse you loved her, or the day you became engaged. Go to the same restaurants, see the same movie, and go back to the places that are special for you. Reliving a memory can ignite the feelings of those moments when they first happened. Reliving the memories can help you reconnect to what brought you two together.Recreate the day as best as you can. Remember any important people or events that made the day especially memorable. Recapture the joy and excitement and have it again for a second time.

, Trying something new together is a fun way to connect and share a new experience as a couple.Trying something new can be as easy as trying a new restaurant or exploring a new activity, like going to a hot spring. The more interesting the new experience, the more vivid the memories.


Try something exciting together, perhaps even a little scary, like bungee jumping or skydiving. The adrenaline of the sport with the excitement will make it an unforgettable experience for both of you!

, Bring home a special dinner for your spouse, or go an a surprise adventure together. Take a surprise vacation together or even a surprise weekend trip together. Surprises are fun ways to add excitement to a relationship while having fun together.You can also surprise your spouse with gifts “just because” like flowers or something meaningful to your hobbies.

, The more laughter there is in a marriage, the more fun you allow yourself to have together. Approach even difficult situations with a light side.Even in the bleakest times, find something lighthearted to share with your spouse.


Make a habit of laughing together often. Perhaps you can set a time each week to devote 10 minutes to enjoying funny things. Maybe you make silly art together or watch funny video clips.

Figure out your food budget.Your food budget is the total you spend on food over a given period.,
Analyze the budget.Once you’ve figured out your food budget, evaluate the information with your partner.,
Decide how to split the food expenditures.You can use an income-based method to choose how to split the food expenses, or split the food expenses according to consumption patterns.",How to Split Expenses As a Couple2," To get an accurate picture of how much you spend on food, track your expenses over a certain period of time. Tracking over a month is a good unit of time, since depending on how much you and your partner eat, you might not spend much on food.


Use a shared spreadsheet in Google Doc or another program to track your expenditures.Your document should indicate each item you bought and how much it cost.
Alternatively, try a low-tech route like writing your grocery and dining-out expenses on a piece of lined paper.
Keep your receipts while tracking your food budget.

, Are you spending too much, too little, or just the right amount? Look for areas where you can cut expenses.


For instance, instead of spending so much on junk food and snacks, try to find healthy alternatives like fruit or veggies and hummus.
Instead of eating out so much, try eating at home more often. Make cooking together a couple's activity.
Eliminate or reduce your alcohol consumption for more savings.

, Whatever method you choose, ensure you and your partner agree on how much money you should be spending on food, and ensure you both set aside money each month for your grocery budget.


Let go of small differences in food consumption. Even if your partner eats more than you, constantly analyzing how much money each person owes for food can put a strain on the relationship.

Plan for emergencies.Both you and your partner should have money saved in the event that one or both of you needs to pay for surgery, a new vehicle, or another large expense.,
Have regular financial checkups.Every month or two, you and your partner should have a conversation about where you’re both at financially.,
Do not move in with your significant other for financial reasons.Living with someone else and sharing expenses does save money, but if you make the decision to shack up based on the potential economic benefit, your relationship will be on an unstable foundation.,
Avoid borrowing money.Not only is it annoying for your partner, but it might make them suspicious of your financial health and question your intentions.,
Avoid sharing debts.Cosigning a loan for your partner is never a good idea.,
Do not share assets.Assets are valuable possessions or investments.",How to Split Expenses As a Couple3," Try to set aside at least 25% of your monthly income for savings.


You should have at least six months’ worth of income saved to cover periods of potential unemployment.
Be sure to set beneficiaries on your retirement and insurance plans, too.
If you separate from your partner, don’t forget to change your beneficiary list.

, Are you still both increasing your savings? Do you have enough saved to cover an emergency? Are you both still comfortable with the way expenses are being shared? Talk to your partner about these and other related issues.


Make budgeting and financial planning an activity you do together. This can be more successful or even exciting if you are both working towards a common goal, such as a vacation or purchasing a home.
Always be honest about your finances. If you are struggling financially, you should admit to your partner that you’re having money problems. That way they can help you out by either loaning you money, helping you find another job, or taking other action that can help.
Encourage your partner to be honest with you about their spending habits and their happiness with your current financial arrangement. If your partner lies about money matters, you should seriously consider ending the relationship.
Don’t let your partner push you into a purchase you can’t really afford.For instance, if you can’t afford a new car but your partner really wants you to have one, stand firm and insist that you will not make such a purchase. If they love you, they will respect your decision.

, Only move in together if you’re truly in love with the person and ready to be in close proximity to them night and day. This will make splitting finances just one part of your relationship, and not its entire basis.

, It’s okay to borrow money in an emergency situation, but don’t make a regular habit of it.


If your partner regularly asks to borrow money, you should inquire as to why they constantly need money. They may have lost their job or have unpaid debts you don’t know about.

, The last thing you want to do is end up saddled with debt that you did not personally incur. Only make a large investment with your partner like a house or car if you are in a stable, long-term relationship.You should ask your partner about any debts or liabilities that they may hold. Be honest about your own debt as well. Keeping these secret can ruin a relationship when the debt is discovered by the other partner.
Always put both your names on the lease, mortgage, or loan. This will allow you some degree of protection in the event you and your partner separate.
For mortgages, consult a real-estate attorney to help you figure out the best way to negotiate your local real estate laws as they relate to your relationship. A married couple has different options for taking out a home loan than an unmarried couple.
For auto loans, too, you (and your partner) should talk to a financial officer at your local bank or credit union. There are many variables that could impact whether you and your partner decide to take out an individual loan or cosign the loan. Seek advice relevant to your living situation in order to get the lowest interest rates and avoid shared debt.

, Common assets include bank accounts as well as big-ticket items. Typical material assets include houses, cars, and boats. These items should never be purchased using both your names. Otherwise, you might end up wrangling over ownership in the event you separate.


Bank accounts, likewise, should never be shared between you and your partner. These accounts can be a source of tension should one partner decide to use the money for themselves.
If you want to set up a shared account with your partner – for instance, an account either of you can use to pay bills – keep it completely separate from your personal account. Put a small amount of money in it each month along with your partner, and use it only to pay the bills you intended it for.

Have a positive mindset.,
Be sure of what you expect from a married life.,
Ask your intended spouse where you two can go for the honeymoon after marriage.,
Ask her what she thinks about marriage and what it means to her.,
Talk to your intended spouse about your preferences with respect to having children.,
Be alert to any exertion of influence on your intended from her family members.,
Test the patience levels of your intended.",How to Prepare for an Arranged Marriage (Men)," While you don't know your intended fiancée when you first meet her, since it is an arranged marriage, use the first meeting opportunities to assess your compatibility. To your eyes, she may be fair or unfair in appearance, but this is of little consequence. What truly matters is whether her behavioral pattern matches yours or not. A behavioral pattern refers to whether her temperament matches yours or not. If it does, you will be able to get along well once you get to know one another; if not, realize it is going to be harder but not necessarily impossible.


Ask her questions, if possible, to try to elicit some of the more important things before arranging the marriage. Base the questions on things that matter to you, such as behavioral patterns, preferred activities, goals, studies, career, etc.;
, Marriage is a partnership of two people who want to live comfortably together, running a household together and perhaps raising children (although not all couples wish for the latter). You might even end up working together or running a business together, making decisions as a team. Marriage is a team of two, in which you both share everything and support one another through thick and thin. On the other hand, it is unrealistic to expect marriage to solve your own personal problems or to provide you with free labor. Marriage is about mutual support, not oppression.

, Don't get influenced by your parents or her parents. Be strict about going ahead with your choice, since you are going to marry her and nobody else. If you get an answer that's not a good choice, you may wish to consider what or who is influencing your bride-to-be and work out whether this is going to create ongoing issues for you or not. If you feel that she is unduly swayed by her family or has unrealistic expectations, then she may not be the right choice for you.

, This can elicit a lot of information for you to understand her way of thinking. It may help to ask her about what she thinks are the probable causes of divorce and what causes unhappiness in married life. You can use her answers to help you to assess how willing and able she is to recognize problems and deal with them effectively, and how well she is able to communicate with you.

, Tell her what you think about having children after marriage or not having them, whatever your preference may be. If you don't want children now, but wish to delay growing your family, explain this to her.


Be sure that she agrees to take contraceptives after marriage or that she is happy with you taking them, in the case you do not want children now. If she is not happy with this, and appears to be overly influenced by the desires of her parents to produce offspring, then discuss this with her to ascertain whether or not she has the will to deny their wishes or is likely to comply with them, rather than with your preferences. If it seems that she is keen to have children before you're willing to do so, she may not be a good match for you.

, These family members may keep trying to influence her choices after marriage, meddling and making things unpleasant for the two of you. If you can work out whether this is the case and pinpoint who is the likely source, talk to this person about their intentions post your marriage. State clearly what your plans are for the marriage and how you expect that both of you will be treated with respect as individuals and that you will both make your own decisions about your future together, unimpeded by family manipulation. Do not compromise your wants for the preferences of persons who do not form part of the marriage contract.


This also includes your own family. What influences are they exerting on you to be a certain way or to do certain things according to their preferences and timeline? Keep in mind that family influence is a powerful force.

, Ask her some irritating questions. Follow through how she answers these questions to help you determine her ability to cope with challenging situations.

"
Give her a silly nickname.,
Mimic your wife.,
Mock your wife.,
Point out something embarrassingly obvious.,
Playfully disagree with her.,
Mispronounce words on purpose.,
Ask ridiculous questions.",How to Playfully Annoy Your Wife1," Playfully calling your wife by something other than her name is nice because is both affectionate and annoying. You can choose a name that reflects one of your wife’s characteristics (“Pancake Snatcher,” if she always steals your breakfast), or one that is just plain silly (“Pudding Toes”). Just make sure that the nickname doesn’t poke at a flaw or something else she is sensitive about., Children love to play the game where they repeat back everything that someone says. This is also a great technique to pull out when trying to get on your wife’s nerves in a lighthearted way. Try a dialogue like this (just don’t let it go on too long!)Her: “So what are we going to do tomorrow?”
You: “So what are we going to do tomorrow?”
Her: “That’s what I just asked!”
You: “That’s what I just asked!”
Her: “Why are you repeating everything I say?”
You: “Why are you repeating everything I say?”
Her: “Would you just stop?!”
You: “Would you just stop?!”
Her: “I mean it!”
You: “Ok.”

, A variation of mimicking someone is to repeat what they say in a slightly different or exaggerated way. For instance, if your wife says something like “I just can’t find shoes to match this dress,” try repeating it back in an over-the-top imitation of her voice. You can also exaggerate what she says a bit, by saying something like “Oh, I just can’t find the right shoes! Life is so hard! What am I going to do?”, When your wife does something silly or harmlessly embarrassing, you can playfully annoy her by saying something about it. For instance, if she accidentally spills salad dressing all over her shirt, you could say something like “Hey, uh, I think you got a little something there on your shirt. It’s just right there. That little spot.”You may not want to try this technique when out in public, since it might really embarrass your wife. Instead, focus on helping her.

, When having a conversation with your wife, start disagreeing with her about something that she obviously knows you don’t actually disagree with her about. This will be sure to annoy her, but since it is something obvious, she will know that you are kidding. For example, if you saw a cat:You: “Do you see that dog over there?”
Her: “It’s a cat!”
You: “No, it’s a dog.”
Her: “It’s not a dog! It’s a cat!”
You: “Oh wait, actually I think it’s a raccoon.”
Her: “It’s a cat!”

, When talking with your wife, try saying a few words the wrong way, such as “ahh-may-zing” for “amazing,” or by saying things like “That’s totes fabs” instead of “That’s totally fabulous,” or just “That’s great.” She’ll find this annoying, and a little embarrassing if you try it around other people. You can also turn this into a running gag if you consistently pronounce a certain word the wrong way., An easy way to have a little light-hearted fun with your wife is to ask her questions that she knows you don’t really want an answer to, and that are just plain silly. Ask her the question with a very serious expression on your face. If she says you are being ridiculous, say something like “No, I really want to know!” Example questions include:“If ran for president, do you think he’d pick me as his vice president?”
""If the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus got in a fight, who do you think would win?""

"
"
Bump into her “accidentally.” Walk toward your wife and intentionally run into her.,
Flirt harmlessly.,
Act exaggeratedly.,
Fool her with gifts.,
Challenge her to a game.",How to Playfully Annoy Your Wife2," Then say something like “Oh, I didn’t see you there.”#Move her things out of reach. If you are taller than your wife, you can have fun placing her things up on high shelves or in cabinet’s that she can’t reach. She’ll be annoyed if she has to ask you to get them down for her, especially if you do it over and over again. Grab the thing she needs and hand it to her, saying something like “Well, I wonder how that got up there? Glad I was around to help you.”, There’s not real harm in innocently flirting with someone, and it might just get on your wife’s nerves in a playful way. For instance, you could offer a waitress a compliment, or joke around with a stranger—anything to get your wife’s attention. You may not want to try this technique, however, if your wife is very jealous or if you have had commitment issues., Especially when you are out in public, you can annoy your wife if you move or talk very expressively. Try speaking dramatically, placing your hands on your cheeks to indicate “shock,” placing a hand on your forehead to indicate that you are overcome with emotion, etc., Take a big box and put a tag with your wife’s name on it. You could even put a brick in it to make it seem heavy. She’ll think it’s a large, heavy gift. Inside the box, place TONS of crinkled paper and just a tiny box with a piece of jewelry in it. She'll be so surprised, and a little annoyed at being fooled.

, A little competition can actually be a great way of showing your wife you are thinking about her. The sillier the game, the more likely she is to be both annoyed and happy. You can challenge your wife to a variety of games, or just start one up and see if she participates:A snowball fight
Thumb wrestling
A dance-off
A water gun battle
A tickling match
Wrestling

Don’t annoy your wife at the wrong time.,
Avoid certain topics.,
Use non-verbal cues.,
Don’t use humor to mask a problem.,
Stop when asked.",How to Playfully Annoy Your Wife3," If you tease your wife when she’s in a good mood, she might find it playful. However, if she is tired, stressed, trying to be serious, etc., then you should back off. In those cases, it’s better to be supportive and caring., You should only annoy your wife with harmless activities, and by saying things that aren’t hurtful. You should stay away from teasing her about things she really values, or about sensitive issues (such as weight)., You can’t always tell the difference between when a person is being annoying in order to be playful, and when the teasing is meant to really get on someone’s nerves. You can communicate that your intentions are good by smiling when you tease your wife, changing your tone of voice, hugging her, give her flowers afterwards, etc., If you and your wife are having real relationship issues, it may not be the best idea to try and correct them by joking around or teasing. Instead, consider talking about the problem or issue, or even consulting a counselor., You should never go to far when annoying your wife, especially when it comes to physical teasing. If she says “stop,” then you absolutely must stop. Remember that you want to preserve happiness in your marriage, and that you don’t want your wife to feel hurt or bothered."

Think about timing.,
Learn the prison rules.,
Obtain counseling.,
Complete any paperwork required by the prison.,
Set a date.,
Get a license.,
Locate an officiant.,
Arrange for guests.,
Be aware of the clothing restrictions.,
Leave contraband at home.,
Follow the prison’s guidelines.",How to Marry Someone in Prison," There are a variety of factors that go into choosing when to get married. Some of them involve children or financial benefits. When marrying a prisoner, you must also consider the potential release date.If the release date is soon, you and your spouse will be dealing with the challenges of two major transitions at the same time
If the release date is far off, you and your spouse can adjust to being married and then to the release
Regardless of the release date, think about whether it may be best to wait until after you and your potential spouse adjust to release before getting married;
, Each prison has its own rules concerning marriage. Talk with the prison chaplain, warden or other appropriate official to learn the rules and policies of your finance’s particular prison. Some policies include:Not all prisons allow inmates to marry
Some particular inmates are not allowed to marry
Some require the prison chaplain officiate
Many prisons do not allow conjugal or extended visits after the ceremony

, You and your fiancé should seek counseling regarding your marriage, both separately and together. Some prisons require this prior to allowing an inmate to marry. Further, counseling will likely be beneficial after the prisoner’s release. Keep in mind that prison marriages have an even higher failure rate than marriages in which incarceration is not a factor., Many prisons require a packet of paperwork to be completed by both potential spouses before granting permission for the wedding to take place. Check with the warden or other appropriate prison official to learn how to submit your application, if necessary. Some common paperwork requirements include:Proof that both potential spouses are of legal age to marry
Statements that the marriage is entered into willingly
Statements regarding the reason the wedding is requested while one potential spouse is incarcerated

, Unlike in a traditional wedding setting, the prison likely sets strict guidelines about when weddings can and cannot occur. You will need to consider these guidelines when setting your date.Some facilities only allow group weddings on certain days of each year.
Some facilities do not allow weddings on weekends.

, Every state requires potential spouses to obtain a marriage license prior to becoming legally married. This requirement is not waived because one potential spouse is in prison. Contact the warden or other appropriate official of the prison in which the inmate is housed to learn the process for obtaining this license. Often, the non-incarcerated potential spouse will be tasked with this., In many prisons, you will not have a choice of officiant because the prison will only allow the prison chaplain to officiate weddings. If you can and want to use your own officiant, some things to consider are:


The cost the officiant will charge, including any additional costs for travel to and from the prison
Whether the officiant is willing to undergo the security measures required by the prison
Some prisons maintain a roster of approved officiants
Whether the officiant will be allowed to wear any ceremonial garb, such as robes

, Not all prisons allow guests to attend weddings. For witnesses, they require you to use prison officials or other inmates. If your prison allows guests, you want to consider:Any limits the prison may set on the number of guests
Any requirements the prison has for approving the individual guests (such as background checks, etc)
Any clothing restrictions that will apply to guests when entering the prison

, As with guests and the officiant, there will likely be clothing restrictions for the marrying couple. The inmate will likely be required to wear a prison jumpsuit. The spouse coming in should be aware of any restrictions on clothing. This may require that you forego a tuxedo or formal gown. Some clothing restrictions include:Many prisons restrict revealing clothing, such as low-cut necklines, spaghetti (or no) straps, exposed waistlines, etc.
Many prisons restrict clothing with multiple places for storing contraband, such as cummerbunds and multipaneled, train-length and/or flowing skirts
Many clothing decorations are likely to set off the metal detector, such as metallic sequins or beads, jewelry, and certain inserts in high-heeled shoes

, Talk with the warden or other appropriate prison official for a list of what items may not be brought into the prison for the ceremony. Frequently, items that cannot enter the prison include:Cameras
Cell phones
Pagers
Outside food (such as a wedding cake)

, Prison officials will likely be standing by during your ceremony to ensure that no rules are broken, but it is best to talk to the officials to know what is and is not allowed. For instance, prior to the ceremony, you should determine whether there are restrictions on physical contact that will impact whether and how you can kiss once the officiant pronounces you married.

Compliment her.,
Pamper her.,
Write a love letter.,
Plan a romantic date.,
Take a trip down memory lane.,
Focus on the quality of sex.,
Keep yourself clean.",How to Make your Wife Fall in Love With You Again1," Make your wife feel good by giving her compliments or praise. Think of the compliments you gave her when you first started dating. Tell her those same compliments and how they still make you love her even more.Start the day by giving your wife a compliment. Let her know at the start of the day how beautiful she is and how lucky you are to have her.
Be persistent. If she refuses your compliment or she undercut’s your compliment because she doesn’t think you are sincere, be persistent. Tell her again and look into to her eyes, then give her a hug to let her know that you are serious.
An indirect way to compliment your wife is to stop ogling other women. A harmless glance never hurt anybody, but if you stare or make a comment it will hurt your wife’s feelings. Keep your focus on your wife; she will appreciate it.
Brag about her to other people. If she hears you she will adore you. Or somebody will eventually tell her what you said and she will appreciate it.;
, This does not mean you need to go out and buy expensive jewelry, clothes, or a hand bag; rather, something thoughtful like a surprise back rub, a hot bath with rose petals, or a bouquet of flowers sent to her work.Buy her a cozy robe she can wrap herself up in after a hot bath or shower.
Give her some time alone to relax and do what she wants to do around the house.
Cook her favorite dinner. All she has to do is show up and sit at the table. You do the rest.
Get her some plush slippers to wear around the house.
Prepare a picnic all by yourself and pick a scenic location.
Good smelling toiletries are always a hit. Give her some bath goodies and prepare a hot bath with rose petals. Then, have her cozy robe and plush slippers ready when she gets out.
Chocolate, of course, always works.

, Women love to receive original love letters from the person they care most about and, in today’s world, a love letter is very rare indeed. Sending “I am thinking about you” texts, tweets, or emails are nice, but putting something down on paper and placing it in an envelope with her name on it is something special. She will certainly consider this a thoughtful gift.Write down your most romantic thoughts and memories on nice letter paper. Make it smell good by spraying a small amount of her favorite scent on it. Be romantic and write a letter for every week of the year.
Don’t copy something you found on the internet. Make sure your letter is original and sincere by expressing your appreciation and clearly describing your feelings as you write down your thoughts. This will personalize your letter.
Try poetry. Even if you never wrote a poem before, she will certainly appreciate your effort.

, This does not mean the typical, and perhaps boring, dinner and a movie. Instead, try something novel, inspirational, or adventurous that provides a lasting and romantic memory for life.Try something spontaneous and adventurous like arriving at the airport with no bags or destination and jump on a plane to somewhere you never been before.
Do something inspirational, like participating in a new activity together. Try making pottery, go ice skating, or take a class on how to give a sensual massage.
Seek out something novel, like a hot air balloon ride, horseback riding, or rock climbing.

, The nice thing about long marriages is that you create a lot of good memories. Don’t let those memories get stuck in a photo album or in reminiscing – relive them. Treat your wife like she is your girlfriend all over again.Take a trip back to where you first met. Kiss her and compliment her like you did when you were trying to win her over. Visit the restaurant where you had your first date or go to the movie theater where you watched your first movie together.
Sit down and watch your wedding video again. Tell her how beautiful she was on that special day and how she is still beautiful to this day.

, People often get caught up on how many times a week they have sex or become so busy with their job, kids, and other responsibilities that sex becomes more of an act that an intimate encounter. Try to take one day a week to slow things down and become deeply intimate with your wife by spending quality time in the bedroom together. Show her that making love to her is still something that is important.There is no actual “right amount of sex” for a married couple to have. Focus on quality rather than quantity if you are trying to get your wife to love you again. Concentrate on all the special actions that demonstrate to your wife that you are “making love” rather than “having sex.”
Although it’s nice to have candles lit after a hot bath with soft music playing in the background for a romantic encounter, quality does not necessarily mean romantic. Quality sex should be intimate and a desire to show your wife that you truly love her.

, Practice good health and hygiene. Your wife will be proud to be at your side if you dress and smile nice. She will probably appreciate it if you stay in good shape. Take a shower every day, wear clean clothes, and brush your teeth and hair.This also means to clean up after yourself. Throw dirty clothes in the hamper and clean up the sink when you are finished shaving.
Mind your manners. Living with somebody for a long time gives comfort and security that should not be taken advantage of. Use manners when you have a bodily function, such as saying, ""Excuse me"" when you burp or pass gas.

Remember and celebrate big events.",How to Nurture the Friendship Between You and Your Spouse," It's easy to take your spouse for granted. If you see someone every day, you may forget to keep them informed on what's going on with you. However, sharing small things about your day-to-day life can help foster feelings of friendship.Keep your spouse involved in your day-to-day life. They should know what's going on with you, emotionally and otherwise. Make a habit of checking in. Ask things like, ""How was your day?"" after work.
Share your own emotions as well. Let your spouse know about the interesting thing that happened at work, how you're feeling about an upcoming event, and your daily emotions. For example, share an anecdote about a funny thing a co-worker said at lunch.;
, In the business of day-to-day life, it can be hard to remember to simply spend time together. Small things, like watching a movie or going on dates, are important. They can help keep your friendship with your spouse strong long term.Look for gaps in your schedule. Are you both free Saturdays? Are Thursday nights less work intensive? See where you can find time for one another.
Do things together. Whether it's a regular Friday night date night, or simply agreeing to watch half an hour of television together each night, small interactions are important for a strong relationship.

, Eating is an easy way to foster friendship. As you need to eat each day to maintain the energy for work and other events, why not eat with your spouse? Regular meals together can help foster feelings of friendship, love, and togetherness.If possible, find one meal you can share together no matter what. For example, you could both agree to get up an hour earlier each morning to eat breakfast together.
If you're both too busy to eat a meal together each day, find one day a week where it's plausible to eat together. For example, you could agree on having lunch with your spouse every Thursday.

, Play is as important to adults as it is to children. It can foster feelings of love and friendship. Incorporate play into your daily interactions. Identify activities you both enjoy and try to do them together.Play can mean different things to different people. Think about what you enjoy doing. Do you both like long walks? You could try taking a walk together each weekend.
Create a plan if necessary. For example, you both enjoy eating out and seeing movies. For a full evening, this may end up costing you around $100 if you go to a nice restaurant and then see a film, purchasing refreshments in the process. Make a point of putting away about $20 a week to save up for a movie and dinner at the end of the month.

, Technology can be a wonderful way to foster friendship. If you have a cell phone or a laptop, use this to talk to your spouse throughout the day. You can send your spouse quick texts about how your day is going and ask them what's going on with them.If you and your spouse have to maintain a long distance relationship for a period of time, technology can help with this as well. Use your laptop or smart phone to video chat with your spouse, for example.

, Communication is important in a marriage. You should talk to your spouse regularly to maintain your friendship, especially if there is something bothering you. Look for a time to talk when your spouse will be free and relaxed.For example, you do not want to demand your spouse's full attention while they're on their way to bowling night with their friends. This is unlikely to go over well. Wait for a better time to talk.
Instead, let your spouse know you want to talk on a Saturday afternoon when neither of you have other obligations.

, During communication, you should listen as much as you talk. If you want to nurture a friendship between you and your spouse, listen with the goal of understanding your spouse better and fostering empathy.Do not interrupt when your spouse is expressing themselves. Do things like maintain eye contact and nod on occasion to show you're listening.
Repeat what your spouse said when they finish talking and ask questions to make sure you understood. For example, say something like ""I'm hearing you're stressed out at work"" or ""Is all this stress because of your boss or other factors?""

, Honesty is the most important part of any relationship, and dishonesty will eventually lead to problems and may even end a relationship. If you notice dishonesty, address it right away. Talk to a mental health professional for help. When talking to your spouse, be honest about how you're feeling. Do not hold back, especially if something is bothering you. It's best to address problems head on.The truth can hurt, but it's important in a healthy relationship. If your spouse did something that hurt you, say so. For example, ""I know maybe you didn't mean anything by it, but it hurt my feelings that you went to see that movie without asking if I wanted to go with you.""
In turn, be willing to admit when you're wrong and offer an honest apology. For example, ""I'm sorry. I didn't realize you wanted to join us for the movie. I will try to remember to ask you next time.""

, Conflicts will arise and you can damage your relationship with your spouse by attacking or blaming them. Use statements that begin with ""I"" rather than ""you"" when addressing something that's bothering you. This way, you're focusing on your own feelings rather than objective judgment.For example, do not say, ""You get really distant when you're busy with work and it shuts me out."" This can sound accusatory.
Instead, say, ""I feel shut out when you're busy with work because you're a little distant.""

, Good friends do not keep score. Friends have confidence things will balance out in the end. They do not keep track of gestures to make sure everything is perfectly equal. Do not do this with your spouse.For example, try not to keep track of who initiated the last date night or who got the better birthday present. Such things are not important.
Remember, you and your spouse both have unique strengths and weaknesses. Keep these in mind. Maybe you usually plan date nights, but your spouse simply isn't great at planning. Maybe your spouse does certain things better than you, like buying more sentimental gifts.

, Appreciation can help to solidify a positive relationship.Friends need to feel appreciated in a longterm relationship. If you want to maintain a friendship with your spouse, show them you appreciate them. Express the things you like about them each day. It can be easy to take someone for granted in a longterm romance. Appreciation is key to avoiding this.For example, say something to your spouse like, ""I always appreciate how you remember to turn the coffee pot on in the morning when you get up before me. Even though you don't drink coffee, you remember how much I like it.""

, Make sure you appreciate and care for your spouse as much as they care for you. Try to listen as much as you talk and make an equal effort to spend time with your spouse. If things start to feel one sided, talk it out. Think of concrete ways you can find the balance again.For example, maybe your spouse feels you've been busy with work lately and haven't been communicating as much. The two of you can agree to find a time to go out together and talk regularly.

, Good friends root for one another. Be your spouse's personal cheerleader. Encourage them to pursue their dreams and celebrate their achievements.For example, your spouse is a budding writer. Encourage them to submit to literary journals. Give them the time they need to write.
If they get accepted into a journal, do something to celebrate. Buy them a nice dinner or have a small get together with friends.

, Things like birthdays, anniversaries, and other big events should be celebrated in a strong friendship. Make a point of doing something for big events, even something small. If your spouse does not love big birthday parties, for example, at least make them a nice breakfast in the morning.Make a point of surprising your spouse once in a while too. This will help to keep things interesting and exciting, while also letting them know that you appreciate them. For example, you may want to surprise them with concert tickets, breakfast in bed, or a small gift.

Learn to recognize the triggers and behaviors associated with the diagnosis.For example, if your spouse suffers from depression, they might appear hopeless, helpless, have a depressed mood, socially isolate, feel agitated, or have changes in sleeping or eating habits.For example, you might feel frustrated that your spouse is appearing lazy, distracted, moody, or irritable. These, in fact, may be symptoms of mental illness.Learn more about how to interact with someone with anxiety, depression, OCD, and bipolar.
Talk with your spouse about their specific struggles as well. Your spouse’s experience with a mental illness might be quite different from what other people have experienced.;
, This can lead to slowly backing away from taking a caretaker role or can result in angry outbursts.If you notice these signs in yourself, re-evaluate your situation.


Set time aside every day to take care of yourself. Do things that are important to you and that help you feel good. This might include meditation, doing the laundry, or keeping a garden.

, It’s not your role to be your partner’s therapist or to tell them what is best for them. Stay away from making excuses for your spouse or enabling your spouse. It can be difficult to stand back while your spouse refuses to get help, but it’s not your job to make decisions for your partner or to control their outcome. Take a role that is supportive, but not controlling. It’s up to your spouse to manage their mental illness.
If your partner refuses to see a therapist but causes lots of problems with friends and family, you may want to gently encourage them to see a therapist. It’s not your role to repair relationships in the family or with friends that your spouse hurts.
Likewise, you don’t have to make excuses for their behavior or lie on their behalf. Say, “My spouse has a drinking problem” or, “My partner is working on balancing their moods.”
However, in some situations you may need to take some responsibility for helping to keep your spouse and yourself safe, such as by ensuring that your spouse takes their medications, taking your spouse to doctor and therapist appointments, and having an emergency plan if your spouse becomes suicidal.

, Ask a mental health professional and your spouse about the best ways to contribute.You may want to take over treatment, but your therapist may suggest you let your spouse tell you what would be most helpful. There may be times you may need to be more responsible for home chores or childcare so that your spouse can handle their mental illness. Be willing to give a little and help out as needed and remember that it’s not permanent.


Have a discussion with your spouse. You can say, “When you start to feel anxious, what can I do to help you? Are there things you’d like me to do or say?”

, You might feel offended or put off by your spouse’s behaviors, but take a step back and ask yourself whether your partner is behaving this way on purpose or whether they are experiencing symptoms of mental illness. For example, your spouse may suddenly start spending more time sleeping and less time with you. While you may feel hurt or that your spouse is being distant, recognize that this can be a sign of depression and that treatment may be needed.Begin to recognize the signs and symptoms of your spouse’s mental illness and find ways to address the problems right away. For example, if your spouse begins to have OCD symptoms, say, “ I’ve noticed your OCD has started up again. I’m here to help. Should we call your therapist?”

, Don’t hide your struggles with mental illness in your marriage.You might fear feeling stigmatized by your spouse or ashamed to express your struggles. Be truthful about your challenges and don’t feel the need to hide yourself.


Speak truthfully about what’s difficult for you and how it affects your life. For example, you can say, “There are times I feel stressed and overwhelmed and begin to experience OCD. It starts to take over my life in big ways, and I struggle to feel in control.”

, Therapy is an important part of treating mental illness.While medications can be helpful, they do not treat the main cause of mental illness and often have side-effects. Engage in regular therapy with a therapist you trust and feel comfortable talking to. Talk to your therapist about how your mental illness affects your marriage and what you can do to improve it.


Even if you’re coping well with your mental illness, have a therapist you know you can reach out to in times of trouble. For more information, check out How to Find a Good Psychologist.

, If you have a need related to your mental illness, share it with your spouse. For example, if you’re feeling depressed, ask your spouse to encourage you to engage socially or go exercise.


Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed about. It’s likely your spouse wants to help you, and telling them how to help you can make them feel better.
For example, if you struggle with mood swings, say, “When you notice my moods changing, please give me space. I don’t want to say something I don’t mean and I need time to sort things out on my own. It’s not personal.”
If you’re feeling anxious, tell your spouse, “This situation makes me feel anxious. I know you’re trying to help, but I don’t want to talk about it right now. I need a moment to cope with my feelings first.”

, Mental health problems can affect sex, especially if you take medications. If medications are interfering with sex, talk to your partner and your physician. Do not take yourself off medications without your prescriber’s knowledge, as this can lead to severe withdrawal symptoms.Be honest with your spouse. Say, “I love you, but medications make sex difficult right now. I want to be affectionate and loving toward you. I want to sort this out and will talk to my doctor about adjusting my medication.”

, If one spouse is burnt out from caretaking or the other spouse feels guilty or ashamed of needing caretaking, it can take a toll on the relationship. Often, this leads to partners becoming distant, avoiding one another, or resorting to surface-level interactions.If you notice these dynamics occurring in your marriage, figure out how you can break this pattern.


Say to your spouse, “I’ve noticed us becoming distant, and I don’t ever want to feel far from you. Let’s find a way to work through this together and not put any more holes in our marriage.”

, You may need to find strategies that help each of you function better in the marriage. Both of you may need to improve communicating your needs, thoughts, and feelings. Family therapy can help each of you function better.


Family therapists are trained to work on improving relationships. Work with someone who specializes in mental illness in relationships and how to relate better together.

, Maintain your marriage just like any other marriage: check in with each other, say “I love you” regularly, and go on dates together regularly. There’s no reason for mental illness to run your marriage.Maintain a normal marriage as much as possible and do things that other couples do in healthy marriages.


Set aside one night each month to enjoy a date together. Go to a concert, enjoy a movie, or try out a new restaurant. Focus on spending quality time together and avoid sticky topics like finances.

, Find some healthy outlets for stress and do them together. Healthy coping strategies can help both partners manage stress and deal with problems before they get out of hand. Do relaxation exercises each day for 30 minutes to help you stabilize your moods and address daily stress.Find relaxation methods that appeal to both of you and that you see yourselves doing daily. Try daily yoga, qi gong, or meditation. You can also walk the dog together, enjoy tea each morning, or read together.

, Many couples who experience peak marital stress turn to alcohol or drugs.You may try to numb your pain or escape your emotions, however, substances often make this worse and can quickly dissolve your marriage. If you’ve struggled with substance use or abuse in the past, stay clear of substances if your marriage is experiencing stress.


If you’re having a hard time coping, try new coping skills such as deep breathing, going for a walk, or journaling.

Appreciate her.,
Tell her you love her.,
Buy her a gift.,
Say thank you.,
Give her space.,
Let her decide.,
Write her love letters.",How to Make Your Wife Happy1," Married couples can get comfortable with each other. This makes them lose some of the intense connection that made them get married in the first place. To prevent this from happening to you, tell you wife everyday how much you appreciate her. When she walks into a room, let her know that you know she is there. Give her a passionate kiss when you both wake up in the morning or she comes home from work. Let her know that you know she is there and still feel the connection between the two of you.


Try to hug her as well. Hugging is a simple physical connection that conveys how much you love her and that you appreciate her being around.;
, Something as simple as telling your wife you love her can make her happy. Everyday life can get crazy and small things like this can get lost in the shuffle. You may say it everyday out of habit, but say it like you mean it. Look her in the eyes before you leave the house and tell her you love her. Let her know that you are saying it because you feel it and not out of habit. She knows deep down you love her but hearing you say it with conviction will make her feel it too.


Pair this with an affectionate gesture, such as a hug, a kiss, or a caress. Keep it romantic but not sexual. You want her to feel that you still want to court her every day, just like you did before you were married., Surprise your wife every so often with a gift. It doesn't have to be elaborate or expensive. You can give her a small present that lets her know you were thinking about her. Show up at home with a box of chocolates. Pick her a bouquet of flowers on your way home from work. Buy her that book she has in her online wishlist. Notice what she says she'd like to have and surprise her by buying it for her. Not only will she love the gift you give her, she will be happy that you thought enough about her to get it.The gifts don't have to be bought. Anything you do for her that is unexpected will work. Surprise her by cooking her favorite meal. Do all the laundry because you know she hates doing it. You can even take the kids out of the house so she can have some time with her friends., A marriage can sometimes suffer from conversations that go something like ""I did this, so you have to do that."" Don't let your actions towards one another feel like they are payback for some other action. Instead, find time everyday to tell your wife thank you for the things she does. Say it in the morning when she puts on the pot of coffee. Tell her thank you when she picks up the dry cleaning after work when you have a meeting. No matter what the occasion, let her know that you see what she does for you.


Try to say it even when it's something simple. Tell her ""Thank you for being you."" or ""Thank you for being the best wife a man could have."" This lets her know it isn't just what she does for you that you are thankful for., You were both single people before you got married. Just because you now share a life doesn't mean that you have to share every interest you both have with each other. Give her time to write all day in the den if she wants. Let her go to the gym by herself. Give her the space she needs to work on the interests that she has that are separate from you. She will appreciate the time to recharge and be happier for it.


Don't take it personally when she wants to do something without you. Just because she wants to go to the bookstore alone doesn't mean that she doesn't love you. Encourage her to do the things she wants to do and do the same yourself. If you have happy as individuals, you will be happier as a couple., There are many small decisions in a marriage everyday. It can be something small like choosing what you have for dinner. Ask her what she wants to have for dinner. Let her choose what movie you see on date night. Give her the remote when you sit down to watch TV at night. Play her favorite game on game night. Letting her know that her opinion matters and that you care enough about her to let her decide will make her happy.


Don't grumble or act upset about what she chooses. That will just make her angry and make you seem like a spoiled sport., Writing love letters may seem scary, but it is a simple and effective way to make her happy. You don't have to be a gifted writer, just tell her how you feel. Let her know the things about her that you love and how she makes you feel. Tell her that you can't imagine your life without her in it. Explain how you don't work right without her in your life. Keep it simple by telling her how her laugh is the best sound in the world or how much you love the way her hair tickles you at night when you sleep.


Hide them around the house in locations she is likely to find them. Put one in her makeup bag or under her pillow before you both go to sleep. They will be a nice surprise for her and will make her happy all day long."

Assist with household chores.,
Take notice of her work.,
Notice the little things.",How to Make your Wife Fall in Love With You Again2," If you live in a relationship where your wife is the primary house cleaner, take some time and pitch in. The extra time you save her that day will allow her to do something else she enjoys. She will also appreciate your consideration in taking an active role in keeping your house clean.Household chores could also mean taking care of small children. Brushing teeth, going to the toilet, combing hair, getting dressed, and eating breakfast is a time-consuming process. If you can pitch in or take the responsibility away from your wife a couple days of a week, she will appreciate both the time you save her and your interest in the kids.
If feeding, grooming, and taking the dog for a walk is not usually your responsibility, go ahead and take care of the dog or other pets once in a while. It will make both your wife and the pooch happy.
A few nights a week, wash the dishes and silverware or even better, polish them. Try doing the same with the laundry, washing and ironing so she doesn't have to.

, Let your wife know how much you appreciate all the work she does around the house. There is little enjoyment in household chores, running the children all over town, and going grocery shopping, often while working another job as well. If you do not participate in any of these responsibilities, then let your wife know how impressed you are with her abilities to multitask.Acknowledging your wife’s hard work is important because there are few, if any, awards, salary increases, or promotions for the jobs she does around the house. She deserves the credit for keeping the family moving forward.
Recognize your wife’s contributions by telling her she is the reason why you call this a “home” and not a ""house.” This will prove to her that you appreciate how she puts her heart, love, and skill into making this your home.

, Little things can make big things happen. Take notice if your wife gets a haircut, wears new jewelry, or changes a routine meal with new ingredients. She will be happy that you care enough to notice when she does something different.Other little things you can do is hold your wife’s hand if you are out taking a walk or put your arm around her when you are sitting together in front of the television. These little “love messages” let your wife know you still care and that you are happy that she is with you.
Don’t forget to say “Thank you!” Remember, just because you are married does not mean that she is still not a woman, or human being. Saying thank you shows appreciation for all the hard work.

Listen to her.,
Show loyalty.,
Establish mutual goals.,
Provide a sense of security.,
Be morally strong.,
Give her space.,
Seek love and happiness through therapy.",How to Make your Wife Fall in Love With You Again3," Communication is absolutely essential to a long and prosperous marriage. Listening is one of the most important tools for understanding your wife’s ideas, decisions, and interests. Be an active listener the next time she wants to talk about her favorite things and really listen to her; she will appreciate it. Besides, listening shows her that you are serious about what she has to say and not taking her for granted.During a general conversation make eye contact, give her your undivided attention, and acknowledge what she is talking about.
Listening demonstrates that you are trying to understand her on a deeper level. Remember when you first dated and how you were so interested in everything she had to say? Try to rekindle that and get her excited about you again. Be empathetic to what she has to say.
Show you're really focusing on her with body language and verbal confirmations, such as leaning in slightly when she's speaking, maintaining eye contact, nodding, holding hands, saying, ""Yes,"" or, ""I agree,"" and asking questions when she pauses.

, Loyalty is similar to trust in that they are the foundations to any happy and long-lasting marriage. Betray either and it will be nearly impossible to regain them. Be faithful to your wife emotionally and physically; she needs both.Being loyal is important in proving that you will be there for your wife both emotionally and physically whenever she needs you. When a crisis occurs, she knows that you will be there to support her with kind words and helpful actions.
Loyalty means that you keep your promises. Don’t do anything that will discredit your words or disappoint your wife.
Respect your wife’s weaknesses and discretely compensate for those weaknesses, as she likely compensates for yours. Loyalty is not shaming or getting angry at her because of them.
Say only kind things about your wife to others. It is okay to share frustrations with a trusted friend, but never shame your wife. A loyal spouse does not badmouth his or her wife behind her back.

, Setting long-term goals are an important part of planning for a long-term relationship. As long as you and your wife are consistently working towards achieving goals together, there is a good possibility that you will stay together for the long-term. Do you want to move to a larger house or build an addition onto your current home? Do you want to take a vacation somewhere exotic? Sometimes those goals get lost when times get busy. Sit down with your wife and reestablish the goals you want to achieve over both the short and long haul.Try thinking about and then writing down your goals separately. Once you are finished get together with your wife and compare notes. Are there any that are the same or similar? Make them your “together goals.”
Redefining goals with your wife will establish the direction you take in the upcoming years. This demonstrates to her that you care about your marriage’s success and proves to her that you are planning for a long life together.
When you share serious long-term goals with your wife, you will give a sense of maturity and security. Something that will make her care deeply about you.
Celebrate success. As you accomplish your goals over time – celebrate them. This is something you achieved together as a couple and a milestone should be rewarded and celebrated.

, Security can mean many things: physical, financial, and emotional. This does not mean getting a gym pass to gain muscle to protect your wife at the bar; rather, it means to reaffirm your love for her by supporting and being there for her when she needs you.Invest time and interest in your wife and children. This will make your wife feel more secure about your relationship and provides good family teamwork in all that you do.
Provide security for your wife by being assertive. Communicating with your wife assertively will make both of you feel more satisfied and fulfilled by enhancing your emotional honesty, expressing your feelings clearly, seeking your wife’s opinion, and telling her you needs in non-threatening way.

, Show your wife that you will be there for both good times and bad. Being a pillar of strength will go a long ways in securing a long future with your wife. Protect her and don’t allow other people to say derogatory things about her. Instead, make her feel protected and safe.Be understanding when your wife goes through a rough patch at work or at home. Make sure you give her a big hug, tell her you love her, and let her know that everything will be alright. Taking the time to do this will help her to fall back in love with you.
Also, be kind to others. Women love to see their spouse be generous, patient, and understanding. When you do this to other people it will generate a warm spot in her heart for you.

, Everybody needs space, even your wife. She is probably taking on the dual roles of caring for the home and working a full-time job. Give her some space by taking the kids out all day and giving her the freedom to do whatever she wants, even if it is just lying around the house all day watching television. Encourage your wife to have a “ladies night out” with her friends to relax and have fun without the worries of everyday life.
Encourage her to pursue a hobby that will let her concentrate on something other than family all of the time.

, Whether you have serious issues to resolve or just need a third person to talk to about your daily marriage life, couples therapy, or marriage counseling, is a good way to recognize and resolve any type of conflict in your relationship. Therapy is a good way to communicate with your wife and to show her that you take even the smallest of issues seriously.Counseling is a proactive step to strengthen bonds and gain a better understanding of your spouse at any time, not just when you are in crisis.
Therapy can train you to use skills needed to solidify your marriage, such as open communication, problem-solving, and how to discuss differences of opinion.
Attending counseling sessions will help you to analyze both the good and bad of your relationship and identify the sources of conflict.

Take care of yourself.,
Offer help.,
Tell her news first.,
Listen to her.,
Show affection in public.,
Do things for her in the bedroom.,
Work on intimacy and passion outside the bedroom.,
Talk to her.",How to Make Your Wife Happy2," When you and your wife meet new people, introduce her in a complimentary way. Use phrases like, ""Let me introduce you to my beautiful wife."" or ""Here is my better half."" This lets her know how much she means to you. She will also realize that you want to tell others how much she means to you.You should do this when she isn't around as well. When you are having a coffee break at work, bring up how great of a cook your wife is or how she just got a huge promotion at work. She will be a star at your next office party and she will know how much you love and admire her. Plus, your coworkers and friends will see how great you two are as a couple and treat you both better because of it., Going out on dates often get lost in the daily shuffle of married life. Make it a point to have a standing date night with your wife every week. Do something that you both like to do. Try something new on each date night. Go to the movies. Go out for dinner and dancing. It can even be something as simple as a night in without the distractions of everyday life. Turn off your cell phones and make the whole night about the two of you and how much you mean to each other. She will be happy to get away from everything and have a night alone with you.


If you have kids, find a reliable babysitter so you won't have to worry about them for the night. This will allow you two to focus on each other completely.
It doesn't have to be every week if you are both too busy with work and family. Make sure there isn't too many weeks between the dates and make them frequent. Don't do it once or twice and then forget to have another one., When you have been married for awhile, you can let certain parts of yourself go because you get so comfortable with the other person. Show your wife how much she means to you by looking your best for her. Don't just dress up for a special occasion. Make an effort to look nice for her around the house. Wear a nice pair of jeans and a clean shirt to dinner at night instead of your holey sweatpants. It will make her feel special and make her happy., Ask your wife what you can help her with. Whether it is with the dishes at night or with the children after school, ask her what you can do to make it easier. Take the shopping cart back to the rack after you've gone grocery shopping. Offer to do carpool for the kids on a day she has a presentation at work. It can even be as simple as asking her if you can help take some of the weight off of her by letting her know you are there for her.


Don't wait for her to tell you when things need to be done. If you see a sink full of dishes, don't ask her to help. Just start washing them.
Make sure you do this on a normal basis. Doing it once is nice, but making a habit of it will make your wife happier everyday., When something big happens, tell your wife first. Let her know that she is the most important person in your life. If you get a promotion at work, don't call your buddy and tell him how awesome you are. Wait until you get home from work to tell your wife about it. Then you can tell everyone else. She will know that she matters to you and that will make her happy., When your wife comes to you with a problem, listen to what she has to say. Don't talk over her, expressing your ire at the situation or talk about how you want to fix it. If she tells you that she is having a problem with someone taking credit for her work at her job, don't start ranting about how unfair it is. You will stop listening to what she has to say and take away the opportunity for her to vent. Let her rage and complain to you, getting out her frustrations.


Let her know you are listening by nodding along as she complains. Having you there supporting her is what she wants and will make her happy.
Keep your replies simple and heartfelt. You can say something like, ""That sucks, sweetie. I'm really sorry."" This lets her know that you understand how bad the situation is., Some of the initial romance can go out of a relationship once you are married. Bring back some of the early simple forms of affection. Hold her hand as you are walking down the street together. Put your arm around her when you are out to dinner. Kiss her gently as you are waiting to cross the street. These little moments of affection will let her know how much she means to you. She will also know that you don't mind if other people know it.


Keep the affection simple and appropriate. You don't want to make out with her in full view of everyone in a restaurant. Make sure whatever you do is comfortable for both of you., Sexual connection is important in any strong marriage. Don't fall into a routine of having sex at the same time and place every week. Being married gives you time to explore and figure out exactly what she wants and needs from you to please her every desire. Ask her what she wants to do in the bedroom. Mix things up by trying something new and exciting to make her happy.


Tell her often how much you enjoy being sexually intimate with her. Let her know that you are having the best sex of your life with her., Although sexual intimacy is important, there are ways to show passion and intimacy outside of the bedroom.Something simple like seeking her advice about a problem you have at work will bring intimacy to your relationship. Show her how passionate you are about her by taking her in your arms and kissing her while she's doing laundry. Cuddle with her on the couch while you both read a book or listen to music. The closer the two of you are, the happier your wife will be.


Set aside time each day to connect with your wife. It can be having a cup of coffee or tea together first thing in the morning while you talk about what you have planned for the day. It can be time after dinner where you talk about anything that happened to you that day. Just try to make sure you check in with her every day to let her know you care.
Passion and intimacy is different for every couple. Find what works best for your wife. Look for times when you can connect with her. Talk to her about what she wants and needs from you to feel closer to you., Always being silent with your wife will make her feel disconnected from you. Talk to her about how you are feeling. Be open and honest about what you think and feel on a daily basis. Tell her when you feel insecure or upset about something. Let her know if she is hurting your feelings or making you happy. The more honest you are with her, the closer and happier you will be as a couple.If you have a hard time expressing her feelings, do the best you can. If she sees that you are making the effort, she will know how much you care.

Take advice but trust your instincts.,
Show you know her best.,
Speak her language.",How to Make Your Wife Feel Loved1," There are many thousands of web pages dedicated to telling you how to make the special woman in your life feel beautiful, appreciated, and loved — including this one, of course. Remember, however, that you are not trying to make a generic “woman” feel loved, but rather that one unique woman in the world, your wife.


Some women want to be showered with gifts, others get more pleasure out of the money you saved on the grocery bill. Some want to be treated like a princess, others like a true equal. Use the tips here as a guide, then, not a guarantee.
Please also note that, because this article is most likely to be consulted by husbands seeking to make their wives feel more loved, some generalizations on marriage roles and gender traits may appear within the steps. However, most of the advice should be more broadly applicable to your particular situation.;
, You’ll find lots of advice columns that say bring her bouquets of flowers, but you know she really prefers a big slice of good cheesecake. As her spouse, you (hopefully) know her better than anyone else in the world, and one of the best ways to make her feel loved is to prove this point.


Dr. John Gottman, a recognized authority in the field, speaks of ""enhancing your love map.""Essentially, what this means is getting to know each other's worlds (history, current concerns, hopes and dreams, etc.) even better and using this mutual knowledge to strengthen your bond. If your map of her world is a bit lacking in detail, work on becoming more open and interested in listening and learning. Other sections of this article should be of use in doing so.
Think about activities and experiences that have made your wife happiest. Take notes on them if necessary. If she loves a good adventure, make that a priority. If the simple pleasures of a quiet night together sitting on the couch makes the mark, go that route.
In some ways, you may know her better than she knows herself. So don’t always just do what she says she wants from you to make her feel loved. Listen, observe, learn, draw on your history together, and do what you know will make her feel loved.

, The concept of the ""five love languages"" has become well-known in regards to relationship problems and solutions.Often, it seems, the problem is not that you (the spouse) are not attempting to show love, but that manner in which you express it (your ""language"") is not being translated as such by your wife.


According to this concept, the five love languages are: words of affirmation; acts of service; receiving gifts; quality time; and physical touch. The theory is that each person receives love predominately in one of these five languages. For instance, a wife who ""speaks"" quality time feels more loved from a picnic in the park than from you cleaning out her car (acts of service) or buying her flowers (receiving gifts).
Here again, you need to draw upon your history, experiences, and unique bond with your wife. Think about what types of love expressions are most powerfully received by her, and rededicate yourself to offering your love according to her ""native tongue."" Even if you don't fully buy that we all fit into one of the five ""love language"" categories, it certainly can only help to more deeply analyze what types of love expressions are most effective with your wife.

Realize why financial matters are going to change.,
Talk about your finances.,
Get insurance coverage.,
Set common objectives.,
Avoid overspending.,
Avoid debts.,
Be smart about a shared bank account.",How to Manage Your Money as a Newly Married Couple," First of all, congratulations on this big step! Getting married is an exciting first stride into a new era of adulthood. What was one ‘you’ and ‘I’ now becomes ‘we’ and there is just so much to plan for the rest of your lives.


It’s essential to see your life together as a partnership where you and your spouse will work together to overcome obstacles and achieve happiness for the years to come. One of the most important factors most of newlywed couples will have to deal with is how to go about handling the finances after getting married.;
, If you haven’t yet discussed on how to manage your finances before the wedding, now is the best time to do so.


Don’t forget to make a list of all your incomes, debts and assets including loans and credit cards. This will help you out in comparing your spending habits and decide where you and your spouse’s priorities lie.

, There can’t be enough stress on the fact as to how important an insurance plan can be. They not only cover you financially, but also prove a savior at critical emergency situations. You may want life insurance to help repay the mortgage and take care of your children, should one of you die unexpectedly. Choose an insurance plan with low premiums for high coverage benefits.


What could be worse than any one of you suffering from critical health problem? Be sure you and your spouse are covered at all times with an insurance plan that takes care of your health especially if any one of you is working for hours that involves travelling for long durations.

, Whether its buying a car, renovating your home or even saving for your to-be child’s future, set the goals both of you would like to achieve together. Now try figuring out what you can realistically afford and start making disciplined savings. Also consider looking into making deposits in your savings account to keep you on track.

, Keep track of every penny you and your partner spends. It’s easy to believe that two people who live together can live on a low budget too. Combining all the household incomes and expenses can help you save lots of money for your necessary expenses.

, Nothing can be more damaging than living on an overburdened debt. Taking mandatory debt like car loans, etc. is one thing but compiling credit card debt or personal loans can turn problematic for both of you. Ensure you will be able to pay for all your unsecured debts without jeopardising your savings.

, Opening up a joint bank account would be ideal if you have common goals. But in a case where you would each one of you handle your own expenses, then it would be best to open up separate accounts. But be aware and honest as to where your money is being spent.

Do the little things.,
Surprise her.,
Make her feel beautiful.,
Prioritize her with your actions.",How to Make Your Wife Feel Loved2," Grand gestures — the surprise trip to Paris, the dream kitchen, the diamond necklace — certainly have their place in showing love. These are a bit like shots of “love adrenaline,” however. On a day-to-day basis, small gestures of affection and appreciation provide the steady energy needed to sustain love over the long haul.Can you make her feel loved by taking out the trash without being asked, volunteering to take the kids to soccer practice, or doing the dishes before she has a chance to get to them? You might be surprised how much power little daily activities like these can have to make her feel valued in your relationship.Show her you’re thinking of her. Leave her a little note in the morning. Send her a text with encouraging words before her big presentation at work. Don’t just remember her birthday — remember her mother’s birthday. Few things make someone feel more loved than being able to honestly believe that the person you love is thinking of you at that very moment., Yes indeed, that trip to Paris and diamond necklace do help to make her feel loved. But surprises don’t always have to be big to be pleasant and loving.


Take her, unannounced, on fancy date nights. Make reservations to a nice restaurant, get tickets to a show, line up a babysitter, even surprise her with a limo ride if you want. Leave new earrings on the bed that you know she’ll like. Woo her all over again, every once in a while.Especially if your wife responds most to ""quality time,"" just making an extra effort sometimes will pay dividends.Leave that paperwork behind every so often and come home a bit early just to be with her. Go for a walk, make dinner together, or do whatever else may come to mind with your unexpected free time together. Yes, there are a million tasks at work and home you could be doing, but be a little “irresponsible” in order to give her some one-on-one time., It is a safe bet that all women (and men, for that matter) like being made to feel attractive by the person they love. Never assume she knows you still find her as lovely as the day you married her — tell her. A lot.Don’t get caught looking at other women, as this can send a bad message. Just as importantly, get caught looking at her from time to time. Let her feel your eyes on her when she tries on that new dress, or even when she’s in sweats for that matter. It the timing is right (probably not in public) and you know she will appreciate it, go over-the-top and give her a catcall or wolf-whistle.
Never, ever, compare her negatively to the appearance of another woman, or even an old picture of herself. She knows that over the years, some parts of her have changed shape or shifted positions. Let her know that you find the beauty in her as she is now.

, “Women and children first” may be an outdated concept in some quarters, but prioritizing your wife’s needs is not. Do whatever is in your power to ease her burden. Nobody said love was easy, or came without work or sacrifice.While ""old-fashioned gentleman"" notions like holding open doors and pulling out chairs may or may not be appreciated, gestures clearly intended as signs of attention, respect, and affection likely will be. Much depends upon how you portray your efforts. Don’t carry in the groceries or pump the gas for her because you don’t think she can do it. Do them to make her day that tiny bit easier. Do them with a smile, not a grumble.
Especially if your wife speaks the ""love language"" of ""acts of service,"" making the effort to prioritize her needs and her comfort should be particularly effective.You are also likely to earn admiration, and it is easier to feel loved by someone you admire."
"
Listen to her, and really listen.,
Be strong enough to be vulnerable and be helped.,
Set an example for any children you have.,
Say “I love you” like you mean it, and mean it when you say it.",How to Make Your Wife Feel Loved3," No, not all women are the same, but it is probably safe to assume that your wife wants you to at least occasionally just sit down and listen to her vent, complain, brag, gossip, revel, question, or simply talk.Dr. John Gottman advises spouses to ""turn toward each other"" in a more figurative sense, but it is also a good first step for truly listening.Look at your wife when she wants to talk. Keep eye contact. Turn off the TV. Put away your phone. Listen more than you speak, unless she's seeking a response. It is always a good feeling to know that someone is truly interested in what you have to say, however mundane or ridiculous it may be.
Listen without trying to fix everything. Sometimes your wife, like everyone else, just wants a sounding board. She might want to vocalize and work through a problem with a co-worker, for instance, and what she needs is a supportive face to look at, not for you to call the office the next day to ""set things straight."" Being attentive is often the best way to be supportive, which is critical to solving problems that originate both inside and outside the marriage., The prevailing stereotype remains that of the stoic, closed-off husband and the wife who is eager to use her ""maternal instinct"" to care for him (if he would only ""let her in""). However accurate (or wildly inaccurate) this image may be in your situation, letting your guard down and letting your wife into your life more will almost certainly be interpreted as a sign of love.If she wants to baby you a little when you're sick, let her (without taking advantage); if she wants to know how you feel about your mother's death, talk to her about it. Let her be your rock, as you try to be hers. Never be afraid to cry; this is a sign of strength, not weakness.
Take it upon yourself to show the bravery to be open, honest, and vulnerable. She didn’t marry you because you were perfect. She doesn’t always want a knight in shining armor; most of the time at least, she wants you to strip away your armor. Give her the real you, and trust that this will make her feel loved., If you have any children together, they are probably now at the core of her sense of self and purpose, perhaps even in ways they are not for you as a father. Regardless of the shifting terrain about what it means to be a ""good"" mother or father, being a loving, caring, involved parent is always one of the best ways to show love to your spouse.


Think of your children as an extension of your wife, because in many ways they are. In fact, they are an extension of both of you, a new realm of ""shared meaning"" that binds you together.Make them feel loved, and she will feel it too. Try talking to a few widows and see just how many say something like “he was a good father” as one of their first compliments.
Show your children how much you value her, so they will also value her. Compliment your wife in front of the kids. Treat her with respect. Tell her she’s beautiful, and give her gifts in their presence, or let them help you do it., Those three little words, properly employed, invariably make anyone feel loved. If ""words of affirmation"" are your wife's primary ""love language,"" then the phrase becomes even more essential.The offhand “I love you” when you’re running out the door to work is good, and usually appreciated. However, don’t forget to stop, look her in the eye, and say “I love you” as well.
Say it when you’re happy, when you’re sad, when you’re frustrated, when times are good and when they’re not so good. Let her know that your love for her is one of the all-too-few constants in her life.

Take a good look at your life.,
Think about what's important to you.,
Make a list.,
Don't choose just one thing.,
Talk to people.,
Test the waters.,
Jump into something.,
Focus on the next few years, not the rest of your life.,
Try volunteering or joining a service organization.,
Remember that you can always change course.",How to Decide What to Do With Your Life," Consider the choices that you have in front of you. There are many paths through life, but not all of them are realistic or convenient--and not all of them are fulfilling. Think about what you can and can't do.


Consider your skills, and what you're willing to learn. Are you great at talking to people? Do you have a mathematical mind? Are you good at putting things together, or good at figuring things out? Are you willing and able to go to school in order to get onto a certain career track?






Consider your financial standing. Do you have money saved up? Are your parents paying for everything? Can you afford to take classes, or live on your own, or travel? Many of the good things in life may be free, but money can be an invaluable tool for getting where you want to go.
Consider your mobility. Are you willing and able to move across the planet for a job or an adventure, or are you tied to one specific place? Do you have the money to uproot yourself? Do you have obligations--taking care of family or pets, or staying with a significant other--that you don't feel comfortable leaving behind?;
, Do you want to live in a city, or in a small town? Do you want to have kids? Do you want to be famous? Do you want to dedicate your life to a cause, or do you just want to be happy? Figure out what's important to you, and let this purpose guide you--but be prepared for your priorities to change as you move through life, learn, and grow older.

, Write down 5-10 things that you can imagine doing with your life--anything that comes into your head. Pilot, firefighter, teacher, author, park ranger, carpenter, neuroscientist, anything. Read over your list and see which choices leap out at you. Separate the realistic options from the fantasies, and choose two or three ideas to explore further: say, firefighter and park ranger.


Move down your list and consider how realistic each option is. Be honest with yourself, and scratch off things that you know you'll never actually do.
If you like the sound of being a neuroscientist, but you know that you don't have the patience to work through a Ph.D program, then you probably aren't going to become a full-fledged neuroscientist. This does not mean, of course, that you can't read about neuroscience, volunteer for cognitive research studies, or think about neuroscience in your spare time.
If you like the sound of being a firefighter, and you can actually see yourself being a firefighter--you're strong and quick, you can stay calm under pressure, you're willing to brush with danger--then do some research and further investigate the job. Run a web search for ""how to become a firefighter"". Read online forums about what it's like to be a firefighter. Speak to firefighters in real life and ask them about their job.

, You can be a doctor and a poet; a mechanic and a dancer; a teacher and a writer. Try to imagine a combination that sounds exciting. If you're going to live in human society (i.e., if you aren't going to travel the country as a penniless vagabond, or get yourself interred in a prison or mental institution, or live off the land in a national forest) you will need to support yourself with money. However, this doesn't mean that money must be your sole purpose--just that you will need it to support yourself while you do other things.

, Draw inspiration from people who are living lives that seem interesting--people who seem happy and present. Talk to friends, family, teachers, strangers; people you meet on the bus or in the street; people that you meet on the internet. If you hear about a job or lifestyle that sounds interesting and worthwhile, consider trying it out.


Ask your friends and family what they can see you doing. They may not be able to give you all the answers, but they may have suggestions that point you in the right direction. You may be surprised at what they tell you.






Imagine yourself in someone else's shoes. If you think you might want to be, say, a teacher, think about what it means to be a teacher: you'll spend much of your time around kids and other teachers; you might not be a millionaire, but you'll get summers off; you'll need to spend evenings and weekends grading assignments and preparing lessons; you'll have a powerful hand in shaping the minds of tomorrow. Consider whether these are realities that you're willing to live with.







, If something seems interesting, take a closer look. Research any jobs and lifestyles that strike you as legitimate possibilities. Remember: you don't have to commit to doing anything forever.


Think of choosing a vocation as a process of asking questions and answering them.If you want to know more about something, explore it further. If you discover that you don't like it, then you can use that knowledge to move forward and try something different.
Visit workplaces and ask to shadow people. If you think you might be interested in working as a police officer, visit or email your local police department and ask to ride along with an officer for a day. If you think you might want to be an elementary school teacher, contact your local school board and ask to shadow a teacher--and consider registering as a substitute teacher to get classroom experience.
If you can afford it, consider taking unpaid internships or asking companies if you can work for them for free. Immerse yourself in a company culture and a way of thinking, and see how you like it.

, You can spend all day staring out at the horizon, but you won't get anywhere until you start swimming. Find a new job, set out on an adventure, start taking classes, or try out a new lifestyle. Throw all of your energy into something, and work at it until you find something else that's more appealing. Remember: you can always, at any moment, change directions and try something new.


It can be paralyzing to stare at a huge list of possibilities. Until you try things out, for better or worse, and make them real, everything will only ever be an abstract possibility. It may feel safe to live in a world where everything is theoretically possible, but eventually you will need to choose something--or choose nothing.You don't have to stick with this job, journey, or lifestyle for the rest of your life. The point of getting started is to figure out what you can and can't do with your life. Choose something that you enjoy; something that feels real; something that leads somewhere else, and makes you grow as a person.
You may find that the very act of working toward something--even if it isn't your be-all-end-all ""life goal""--gives you perspective on what you want to do with your life. At worst, you'll know what you don't want to do with your life, and you can scratch something else off the list.

, Forget about when you're 80: where do you see yourself in a year? In five years? The rest of your life will happen, whether you like it or not, but you can only ever act in the here-and-now. It can be paralyzing to try to plan everything out 30, 40, 60 years down the line--so try to stay grounded in the present. Your life will unfold as you live it., Consider Americorps, the Peace Corps, WWOOFing, volunteering at a nonprofit, or getting certified to teach English as a second language. These are great programs if you don't know what you want to do for the rest of your life, but you want to work and grow and feel productive in the present. Your experience might run anywhere from one week to two years, it will look great on a resume, and it will help you learn about your place in the world.



Apply for Americorps. You can sign up to work for anywhere from two months to a year; you must be 18-24 years old. Projects range from trail-building in state parks to working with disadvantaged inner-city children in urban elementary schools. Volunteers receive a small living stipend, usually several hundred dollars, each month, and alumni can receive scholarships for higher education.Join the Peace Corps. You will spend two years helping to stabilize an at-risk or underdeveloped community. Openings range all over the globe; you could serve in Brazil, South Africa, Vietnam, or Ukraine. You can work to teach English as a second language, or help small businesses grow in an underdeveloped economy, or help boost food security in a rural village. You will work with a community, use your time to make the world a better place, and maybe figure out how you want to spend the rest of your life.Volunteer on an organic farm with WWOOF: World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms. You work on an organic farm for anywhere from a week to forever; in return, the farmers feed you, give you a place to sleep, and teach you about farming. For a small registration fee, you can access a network of thousands of organic farmers who are looking for help--some are looking for seasonal workers to come and go, and some are looking for long-term commitments. You can contact a farm that sounds interesting and be volunteering there within a week., The choices that you make now will lead directly to the choices that you make in a month, a year, a decade--but that doesn't mean that you have to settle for a job or lifestyle that you hate. ""Stuck"" is a mindset. At any point, in any situation, you can either stay the course or break the course. The important thing is that you start swimming.

Stop making comparisons.,
Separate reality from fiction.,

Give yourself a daily reminder.",How to Feel Deserving," Be honest about the way you feel now. You may not be consciously aware of the way you cut yourself down, but if you're wondering how to feel more deserving, some part of you has been operating under the impression that you are undeserving.


Look in the mirror and state, “I am a worthwhile and deserving person.” If you can say that line with confidence and no trace of doubt, your current mindset is probably okay. If you feel hesitation or disbelief, however, you might be holding onto the belief that you are undeserving.;
, Once you admit to feeling undeserving, ask yourself what qualities or characteristics make you so unworthy. These qualities may not really make you undeserving—in fact, they very likely don't—but they should be what makes you feel as though you are.


Write your answers down and be as honest as possible. Some of your reasons might be obviously unhealthy—for instance, any dealing deal with your gender, race, or social class. Even so, if these are things that make you feel undeserving, you need to be honest about it.

, After identifying the traits that make you feel unworthy, ask yourself why you think those traits make you undeserving. This will require a little more investigation. Usually, you'll realize that incidents from the past are directly connected to the way you feel in the present.


Ask yourself how long your feelings of unworthiness have persisted. Once you realize how long you've felt the way you've felt, you can trace things back and start identifying the original source of those feelings.
Figure out where your guilt originated. Most of these issues will likely be connected to some external force. It may have been something someone in your personal life made you feel or it could be something your community or society pressed on you.

, Recognize that the past is in the past. Mistakes and missed opportunities are over and done with, so there is no reason for them to continually linger in your mind and prevent you from moving forward.Self-compassion is necessary if you want to view yourself as someone who is just as deserving as anyone else, but guilt makes self-compassion impossible.
Sometimes, letting go of past regrets will mean making amends for something you did wrong. Other times, there may be no way for you to make amends, and you may simply need to commit to the goal of being better in the present and future.

, Take a realistic look at the lives of people who have what you feel undeserving of. Ask yourself if they are truly innately more deserving of good things than you are. No one has any more value at the time of their birth than anyone else has.


In fact, a quick look at the news will reveal plenty of people who are materially successful even though they are well-known liars, cheaters, or thieves. If people who are clearly dishonorable can obtain happiness, there is no reason to think that you don't deserve your own happiness., Instead of being your own worst critic, become your own best friend. Imagine that you are speaking with a loved one whose personality is almost identical to yours. You may realize that you would treat that individual better than you're treating yourself.


Think of someone supportive in your life. Ask yourself what that individual would say or do to support you through your undeserving feelings, then say or do the same things for yourself.
Conversely, think of what you would say or do for someone you love if they were struggling with similar issues, then say or do the same for yourself.

, Everyone has different circumstances, so the accomplishments of one person cannot be fairly compared to the accomplishments of another. Your life is yours to live, and there is no reason to think that things someone else has achieved are things you should have achieved, too.


Instead of comparing yourself to others, compare yourself to yourself. Look at how far you've come, and focus on your accomplishment instead of your shortcomings as you reflect.

, Your expectations and the expectations others have of you may not be realistic. You'll never be perfect, so when you maintain a perfectionist attitude, you will always fall short of your goals. As a result, you will always feel as though you aren't good enough.


You may never be able to forgive yourself for the things you haven't accomplished until you learn to adjust your standards. This may also mean that you need to let go of the standards others have set for you.

,


Telling yourself that you deserve something does not imply that others don't deserve the same thing.
Feeling deserving has nothing to do with your view of others. Instead, it simply means that you honor your own needs and desires.
Additionally, when you feel deserving enough to take care of yourself, you'll naturally feel more energetic. That excess energy can then be used address the needs of others. In this sense, allowing yourself to feel deserving can actually make you a less selfish person.

, As soon as a destructive or demotivating thought sneaks into your head, tell yourself to stop. Correct the negative thought with a positive action and press on.Destructive thoughts are those that attack your worthiness as a human being. They include thoughts like, ""I'm so lazy,"" ""I have no talent,"" and ""I'm ugly.""
Verbalize the command to stop when these types of thoughts enter your mind. You can mentally shout ""STOP,"" or you could choose another word or phrase: ""calm down,"" ""don't go there,"" and so on.
As soon as you stop your inner critic, redirect your energy to some constructive activity to prevent your thoughts from sinking back down.

, When you aren't able to motivate yourself, you won't be able to take the necessary first steps forward. This lack of forward motion can make you feel even more undeserving and less motivated. Break the cycle by learning what makes you tick and how to take advantage of it.


Try reminding yourself of the benefits in completing certain tasks. If necessary, write these benefits down and post the note in a spot you will see daily.
Consider refocusing your energy on goals you really want or activities you really enjoy doing. These types of tasks can be naturally easier to pursue, even if you initially feel undeserving of the privilege to pursue them.

, Take a few minutes each day to write a list of two to four positive qualities you can be proud of. These characteristics do not need to be anything huge. In fact, a larger list of minor positives can have a greater impact than a short list of major positives.


For example, one positive can be the you were able to listen to a friend's problem for a few minutes earlier in the day. Another could be that you had the willpower to make a healthier food choice at lunch than you were tempted to do.

, No matter how hard it is to be honest about something, treat someone well, or otherwise do the right thing, you need to force yourself to do it. Behaving in a way you know to be wrong will cause your conscience to haunt you, and the resulting feelings of guilt will prevent you from feeling deserving.


Treating someone with respect is an especially important action to take. When you are able to recognize the innate worthiness in other people, you may gradually begin to see how that same sense of deserving can apply to your life, too.

, Try something new. Move in a direction that is positive yet foreign to you. You may experience a few failures, but you will probably have a few successes, too. Succeeding at something you never though you could do can serve as a strong confidence booster.


Try to keep your expectations down to a minimum when you pursue something new. Setting the bar too high can make you feel more undeserving if you fail to meet your goal, but lowering the bar too much can set your mind up to believe that you are incapable of accomplishing anything greater. Regardless of what you try, focus on the experience of doing it and seeing it through instead of dwelling on what may come of it.

, Gravitate toward people who support you and make you feel more deserving while distancing yourself from relationships that make you feel less worthy.


People who treat you with respect send the message that you deserve that respect. The more often you can put yourself in that sort of environment, the more thoroughly that message can sink in.
Similarly, unsupportive people will always send the message that you are incapable or undeserving. Spending too much time around these people will only cement your current feelings of unworthiness in place.

, You will probably need to take your first steps forward before you fully believe in yourself and your own worthiness. Continuing to act in a deserving manner can gradually influence your thought patterns, though, making it easier to eventually believe that you are as deserving as your actions suggest.


Start small by doing little things for yourself to encourage feelings of worthiness. Buy something nice for yourself or take the day off to visit someplace nearby you've been wanting to go to. Once you accustom yourself to the practice of self-kindness, you can gradually begin to do more significant acts of kindness for yourself

, Take a moment each day to specifically tell yourself, “I am deserving.” Get yourself used to this sentiment. Repetition can make you feel more comfortable, and as you become more comfortable with the practice of telling yourself that you deserve good things, you can become more comfortable with the practice of actually believing it.


Consider expressing this sentiment verbally and in front of a mirror. The exercise may seem silly at first, but with enough practice, it will eventually begin to feel normal.

How good is today going to be? How will you remember it? Will it be another tally under the ""Good Days"" column?


It also helps you separate out the days, eliminating stress that carries over from one day to the next. When today is the only day you're dealing with and it's never going to occur again, it helps you live like each day is a separate life.;
, Many people live in a land of ""ifs"" when it comes to their happiness. ""I could just relax if I got a raise,"" or, ""If I lost a bit of weight, I could be happy with myself."" But the thing is, most of the time these things don't happen and things that don't happen should have no effect on our happiness. If you stop waiting, you'll find that each day becomes more enjoyable.


Of course, that's not to say you shouldn't go after the things you want and become a bystander in your own life.Go after them, seize them, make them happen, just don't wait for them to come around to you.

, For those of us who have forgotten how to enjoy life, it's usually partly because we take for granted what we have. It's in front of us every day, so we begin to concentrate on the things we don't have. Unfortunately, this isn't very healthy and can lead to anxiety, stress, and depression. Instead, think of what you do have. Whether it's a nice car in the garage or a family at the dinner table, it all has value.


If this strikes a chord with you, make a list. Write down everything you're grateful for, and don't forget basic things like your health. When you're feeling down (or even just part of a daily routine), break out the list for an instant pick-me-up.
Taking pride in your life and in the things you do makes it easier to be grateful. Sure, you may be punching numbers, but you keep the wheels turning at your job. Maybe you don't have the nicest car, but you put food on the table for your family, and it's a pretty great family, too.

, Too often we write off the things we do and focus on the things others are doing. That's a surefire way to be on the browner side of the fence and to have each day slip by unhappily. Make it a point to pat yourself on the back every time you do something great. You have value and skill, along with the ability to make every day pretty wonderful.


It doesn't have to be anything big. If you met a deadline at work, be happy about it. Did you actually manage to go for that run? Excellent, look at you staying motivated! Make it a point to see that the little things you're capable are noteworthy and help focus today on the positive.

, As the gap between the rich and the poor widens, it's too easy to develop a frame of mind for material successes and not for simple peace of mind. We see the CEOs raking in the millions and are envious. In reality, those CEOs aren't enjoying those days any more than the rest of us. Why? Because plenty of life's simple pleasures are what it's about, like cuddling with your kids or a pet, a cup of hot cocoa on a rainy day, or mealtime with family or friends. These little things that seem like nothing? They're actually just about everything.


So the next time you're watching TV and curled up in a blanket, playing with your cat, or just hanging out with your friends, take a moment to realize that this moment is pretty darn good, and that it's moment like these that make life worth living.

, We've all met people that just aren't fun. They're not easily impressed, they put a negative spin on everything, and they just don't laugh. What's the point in living then? If you don't take anything too seriously, all of life lightens up and becomes more enjoyable. Try to find something every day to laugh at, like you're a four-year-old who can laugh at pink soap. Pink soap!And more importantly, laugh at yourself. When you do something silly or stupid, laugh. You'd laugh at your friends, right? If nothing is a big deal, you won't stress about it. It'll be smooth, enjoyable living from the day you decide to not take everything so seriously. After all, what's the point in worrying?

, You know the phrase, ""There's no use crying over spilled milk?"" It's a little cliché, sure, but it still gets at the truth: the little things in life that are seemingly out of our control aren't worth getting upset about and giving power. The traffic? Nope. The line at the counter? Nope. The spilled milk? Definitely not. Life is full of mostly small stuff, and letting them get to us keeps us from enjoying life. In short, it's just not worth it.


How do you do this, though? Well, it starts with Step 1 above. The more you realize that time is precious and it's just your one life you're living, it all becomes the best story you'll ever be a part of. And the bad stuff? That just happens. It makes your story interesting.

, Have you ever been just fine one day, and then the next you're super sick or you've broken your leg, or something went physically wrong? You didn't realize how easy life was until this unfortunate thing happened. Health is so important, and we don't realize how easy and enjoyable it makes life. So whether or not you have yours, take good care of yourself. Your body and mind will appreciate it.


The two not-so-surprising things you can do? Eat right and keep moving. You don't stop moving because you get old, you get old because you stop moving. And to keep yourself moving, fill your body with foods that make it feel good, like fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. When your body feels good, it's easier for your mind to follow suit.

, Humans are living in a time like any other. A time where we worry about money, clothes, the Jones', and things we never even dreamed of worrying about before. The way we're living now isn't necessarily natural, and it's definitely not necessarily for the best. Because of this, we all need to take time to just live simply and relax. In fact, it should be a priority. If you don't have time for, make time. Your health and happiness depend on it.


Even just 20 minutes or so a day of ""me time"" can get you back to firing on all cylinders. Whether it's meditation, napping, or watching TV, it's fine so long as you enjoy it and it recharges you.

, Completely overhauling the way you think at the press of a button isn't likely going to happen. You can read all the positive, life-affirming stuff out there, but that won't force a switch to flip in your head. Instead, resolve to be 1% better tomorrow. In just one instance today, you're going to laugh, or not sweat it, or be grateful. Tomorrow, you'll do it 1% more. You don't have to be perfect right now; you just have to be on the right path.You'll likely find that you want to go faster than just one moment per day. Those 5 minutes you spent being grateful or laughing at yourself will be a taste of what's to come, and you'll want more. Taking it slowly is good motivation to keep going.

, You've heard it in many forms: follow your passions, find your dreams, do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life. And while that's partly true, what's more true is that part of your day should be devoted to something that makes you feel good. It may not be your passion or your dream, but you love it. It'll fill your life with purpose, and a life with purpose is much easier to enjoy than a life without one.


For many of us, doing what we love for a living isn't an option, at least right now. And that's fine you don't have to do what you love from 9 to 5 every weekday. Fit it in where you can, and it'll keep you going. In fact, you'll want to keep going. Doing what you love will provide you with drive and ambition, and get you looking forward to each and every new day.

, The fact of the matter is that life is just easier when you get along with those around you. You don't have to have them over for dinner every night, but be friendly. You'll never know who can help you out and make your life better or who you can help out, too.


This isn't only about your coworkers, either. Make friends with your neighbors, your in-laws, whoever is in your circle that could be a little closer. Friends at work makes work more enjoyable, being friendly with your neighbors makes being at home more enjoyable, and having a large social network will help you feel loved and secure.

, It's easy to spend your days in a cubicle and your nights in front of a TV. Days like that, it's pretty hard to remember how beautiful the world is. Take a moment to find a piece of beauty in your life and acknowledge it. Let it sink in. Isn't this world pretty amazing?It could be anything from your significant other to a rose you passed on the street. It could even be an exchange of a person helping out another person. What strikes you as beautiful? What about yourself and your beauty?

, Life is too short to be surrounded by negativity, especially if we're looking at each day as a separate life (then life is far, far too short). Because of this, don't waste your time with negative people in your world. Surround yourself with people that make you feel good and give you inspiration to be better and happier. What's the reward in doing otherwise?



Ending a toxic friendship isn't fun, but it must be done. You can slowly start seeing this person or these people less and less, and hopefully they'll get the hint. If they don't, you may need to say something like, ""I'm working on being more positive and enjoying each day, and sometimes you keep me from being able to do that."" Who knows? Maybe you'll inspire them to become better themselves.

, The old adage ""It is better to give than to receive"" is true partly because it fills us with that warm, fuzzy feeling that we've just helped someone out and done a good deed. And the same goes with affection; if you are doling out the love to those around you, you're going to feel pretty dang good about yourself and about your days. What's more, the love will likely come back in return, making your days even better.


The next time you see someone you care about, say hello with a surprise hug. Make it last about 7 seconds, and both of your brains will start releasing endorphins, those little happy-maker chemicals in our brains cuing us to feel good.It doesn't have to be those you're close or intimate with, either. Simply asking a coworker how his day was and actually waiting for a legitimate answer can show you care, too. Take these small opportunities to spread the love and pay it forward, making the most out of every day.

Make sure you know when things get toxic.,
Look out for key toxic behaviors.",How to Cut Ties with Family Members Who Hurt You1," What is a toxic relationship? A relationship can be considered toxic when you are dealing with someone that always has to be right and never values your input. They do not respect your boundaries and often try to control you, because they feel a lack control in their own life.
, These include:Always being the victim: Anything bad that happens always happens to them. If you tell them of something unfortunate that happened to you, they always had an experience that was worse!
Toxic people seldom give, always take: Most family relationships are give and take. In a toxic relationship, your family member will take advantage of all that you are willing and able to give. It is rare that they will reciprocate!
A toxic person is always right. Along with never being wrong, they are blatantly dishonest. The last thing you would want to do is point this out, however. That makes them a victim of your perceived cruel words, and there is no way they will take responsibility.

Use natural daylight globes for darker days and night times.,
Use light window dressings.,
Make use of mirrors to bring reflection and brightness to the room.,
Use light colored furniture.,

Orange
Yellow
Gold
Apricot/peach
Rose
Blush;
, Large, open windows are ideal. Enable the light to spill through these windows at all times during the day.

, The glow from these globes is a lot more pleasant than normal globes.

, Avoid anything too heavy by way of drapes or blinds. Use sheer fabrics and light colored blinds. Or, consider not having window dressings at all.

, Mirrors reflect you, the light, the colors and make a room feel cheerier.

, Lighter woods and furnishings will make the room feel brighter and happier. Avoid dark furniture because it can tend to sap up energy and make the room feel darker as a whole.

, that have cheerful themes. For example, Tuscan meadows, yellow flowers such as daffodils or buttercups, animals such as ducks or lambs, etc.

Choose how to cut the ties.,
Keep in mind what triggered this step for you.,
Stop answering their calls, emails, social media posts and letters.,
Refuse to acknowledge go-between conversations.",How to Cut Ties with Family Members Who Hurt You2," Cutting ties can mean putting some distance between yourself and your negative trigger or cutting all ties completely.You have to decide how toxic the relationship with the family member is. Would reducing the frequency of your contact with them be enough to ease your feelings?
If you get uneasy and tense at the mere thought of them visiting, severing the ties completely may be what is best for you.

, Perhaps it is a phone call that presents itself as the final straw. Maybe it is a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach that has been building. Whatever the reason, you know when it is time.If you are with the relative(s) when this occurs, you are apt to say something like ""That's it, I'm done"", and end the relationship right then and there. Though this is mostly to assuage you, take the time to explain to them why you feel the way you do, and make it clear that you choose to end your relationship with them now.
You may find it easier to send them an email or letter. You can then take your time to make sure your wording is just right and that you are saying everything that you need or want to say. If you send an email, you will have a copy of what you send. If writing a letter, you may want to make a copy of it, just so that you can refer to it, should you need to down the road.
Realize that just because you have said ""enough"", that does not mean it will be the last you hear from them. As mentioned above, a toxic person does not respect personal boundaries and, in their mind, are always right. They will in all likelihood turn the tables on you, making you the bad guy in the situation.

Do not buy in to the sad story of how the abusive person suddenly feels bad for being mean. If they had actually felt bad, then they would not have treated you like better in the first place. Also, it is unlikely that their behavior will improve.



, When a relationship turns sour and you choose to let it go, you have to be strong. You made this decision because it is right for you. Just because this person is family, it does not mean they have the right to hurt you.

Technology has made it very easy for anyone to contact you through a variety of mediums. It has also provided us with the opportunity to screen or block such communications. Again, be strong. Delete messages without even reading or listening to them. It will be hard at first, but that feeling will pass.

, If the family member you have cut ties with tries to send you messages through others, stop it immediately. Explain that you are not interested in playing this game, and you hope that they can accept this. If they refuse to stop talking, just walk away. "
"
Do something good for yourself.,
Make the most of friendships.,
Do not be afraid to seek counseling.",How to Cut Ties with Family Members Who Hurt You3," Take the time to acknowledge your strength. Be proud at being able to stand up for yourself. Toxic and abusive people hold on to their victims like vices. By ending a toxic relationship once and for all, you are relieving yourself of the stress and paving a road to a happier and healthier outlook on life.Buy yourself flowers or some little thing that you have always wanted but never treated yourself to. Soak in a tub or go get a massage.
Toxic people tear others apart inside and make them feel terrible. Make a list about what you used to like doing before they hurt you, and start doing those things again.
Start a new hobby. Maybe you always meant to learn how to play the guitar that sitting in your closet or wanted to try your hand at painting landscapes. Think about giving yourself a makeover.
Maybe you could splurge and go on a vacation that you have always dreamed of. If that is not in the cards, think about a stay-cation. Go and check out the sites you have never gotten to, right in your own city; museums, parks. There are likely historical sites you can visit as well.

, Realize that you have friends that you are closer to than any of your family members.

Invite your closest friend over for coffee or lunch. Take the opportunity to talk to them about what has happened and get it all out for, hopefully, the last time. Based on history, they will already be aware of the problem, and will be glad to be there for you. You know you would be there for them.
Think about planning a get together, maybe a pot luck dinner together with a group of your friends. That will take your mind off things.

, You may not be able to rid yourself of the feeling of guilt associated with cutting ties with a family member on your own. This can be especially true if it is a parent or sibling. Deep down you may realize that you have made the right decision, but you need more positive reinforcement than you can get from friends. If this is how you are feeling, you should talk with a counselor, or perhaps look at joining a support group."
"
Do not dwell on what used to be.,
Enjoy the new you!",How to Cut Ties with Family Members Who Hurt You4," Doubting yourself or thinking that they might change later is natural. Do not allow yourself to sit around and feel guilty. Your self-esteem may be a little low right now, but remind yourself that it is only temporary.

Find a plaque or a symbol of your strength and take the time to look at it every day. Go onto the internet and look up inspiring quotes. Perhaps one will stick with you. Remind yourself that you are not a victim anymore. You stood up for yourself, and they cannot hurt you anymore.

, Cherish your family times with a new freedom and live your life to fullest."
"
Beware of ""The Relationship Triangle"": In most every family, there is one person who seems to overshadow a family get-together, creating a relationship triangle.,
Factor in your age.,
Go easy on yourself.",How to Cut Ties with Family Members Who Hurt You5," It looks like this: you + Difficult Person + every other member of your family., When you are a teen, it may be impossible to cut the toxic person from your life. When the time comes that you can cut the ties, you may not be able to without cutting out valued family members. For example, if your mother is the toxicity in your life, yet you have a very close relationship with your dad, you have a real dilemma.After you graduate, you could continue to bite your tongue, suppress the tension you feel in your back, and remind yourself that you plan to move away. You will only have to see your mother once or twice a year, and deal with the monthly (or weekly, ugh!) phone calls. It would make things a lot easier to maintain your relationship with your dad.
You could cut the ties to the toxicity the day you graduate. You can move and live the happy carefree life you have dreamed of. Remember, however, that you will likely be cutting off the ties to your dad as well.
There are also your grandparents to think about. If you cut ties with their daughter, will it affect your relationship with them? Will they feel obligated to take sides with their daughter?

, There is no right or wrong answer. Cutting toxicity from your life is very important to your happiness and emotional well being, but recognize that it does come with consequences. Only you can decide what is right for you."
"
Accept change in the workplace: Perhaps your company has new management, who plans to make some big changes.,
Accept changes at home: You and your husband have decided that it is important for you to stay home and raise your new baby, instead of returning to work.,
Accept changes in your marriage: According to Tanith Carey, in an article she wrote for the Daily Mail, from a woman's point of view, there are nine stages of marriage.,
Accept the changes in health: As we age, we can experience a change in our appearance, as well as physical and emotional changes.,
Accept the changes in you: You see changes in yourself throughout life.,
Look back at the changes in your life.",How to Embrace Change," The idea can be intimidating, but do not get your back up. Keep working as you have normally done, and patiently wait to see how any changes will affect you.Do not get wrapped up in water cooler gossip or the rumour mill. There may be many people who have heard this or that, but do not get stressed out or anxious over gossip.
If you have questions that need answering, go to a supervisor you trust, or your human resources department. They may be able to address your questions or assuage your concerns.
When changes start to occur, be flexible and make yourself part of the process. This will show you are a team player, and willing to embrace the changes.;
, You ran through the financial aspects together, and yes, it can be done, but you will have to make some changes. Change can be scary, but given some time, you will adjust.It is important to make a budget and stick to it. Cut your expenses when and where you can. This may involve lifestyle changes, like no longer going to dinner and a movie every Friday night. Think of the upside; being at home to see all of your baby's firsts.
Nowadays there are opportunities available on the internet to make some extra money online from the comfort of your own home. While you are checking that out, you can also explore online coupon sites, for added savings on household items you purchase regularly.
Sell things online that you are not using anymore. Nowadays people do not have to wait until they accumulate enough clutter to host a garage sale. The internet is a great place to sell extra furniture, kitchen appliances, all sorts of things. Check out E-bay, Kijiji, and Amazon.

, The steps start with the blushing bride, through the newlywed and child rearing stages and into the children's teen years. This is the time when the children are becoming more independent and about 15 years of marriage have passed. According to Ms. Carey, this marks the beginning of the fifth stage:Distance is the stage when a woman considers getting back into the work force. It is a vulnerable time for her; a time when she may consider having an affair. She is looking for the intimacy she used to have with her husband in the first years of their marriage. This makes it very important for she and her husband to spend quality time together, to recreate that bond.
After being married for 15 or 20 years, a woman may begin to consider a Mid-Life Divorce, being unsure of where her life is going. She looks at the lives of her single friends with a bit of longing, thinking that what they have looks pretty good. In this case, she should speak to a counselor before taking any life changing action.
Then again, she may look at Renegotiation, where she realizes that single life may not be what it seems. Her friends may be out enjoying the dating scene, but it does not seem that tempting. She realizes that she has many years and built long lasting memories with her husband, and chooses to work with him to rekindle the romance and love of years gone by.
As you reach the 30 to 40th year of marriage, the couple reaches the Balance stage. This is when she and her partner each become comfortable with each others' strengths and weaknesses. Together, they enjoy the arrival of grandchildren and become best friends.
As they approach 45 and 50 years of marriage, the couple enters the stage of Compassionate Love. This is a time to enjoy being mortgage free, yet still thrifty with their spending, so they can enjoy the freedom and benefits of retirement. Both enjoy the safety net of their marriage, while still following their individual interests.

, Some of these changes can be attributed to the normal aging process. Others can be the result of leading a less than healthy life in our earlier years.Appearance: Graying or whitening hair is one of the first things that comes to mind with aging. Our hair, as with our fingernails, becomes more coarse in texture. Skin becomes thinner and loses its elasticity. Bruising, as well as cuts or scrapes, take longer to heal. If spending much time in the sun, it is best to use sunscreen of at least 30 SPF.

Physical Changes: Along with the aforementioned skin issues, you should also be aware of the fact that your body does not adjust to heat or cold as easily. It is important to take care against heat stroke or getting too cold. Joint pain from previous injury can become stiff or painful. Bones become more brittle. Vision changes are common. Dental and digestion problems can become issues. As well, changes in brain and nervous system cells cause slower reactions to stimuli. It is important to maintain regular medical and dental visits.

Emotional Changes: As we approach retirement age, we can look forward to having leisure time and enjoying the fruits of your years of labour. For some, with retirement comes the question of what their purpose is now, creating a feeling of loss. If you combine this with the eventual passing of family and friends, potential downsizing of your home and living alone, it can become a time of sadness and depression. On top of typical health issues, problems may arise if proper attention is not paid to diet and exercise.

, When we are young, we have aspirations of the future. In the decades that follow, increased self confidence and self awareness become prevalent:Self esteem continues to grow through the adult years, peaking at around the age of 60. This is likely due to the achievements you have made in your career, as well as the comforts you have come to enjoy in your personal and leisure time.
The middle age years that you now enjoy differ largely from the middle age years of our parents. Today, the preconceived notions of what to expect in our 40's and 50's, even 60's has completely evolved. We are still planning for the future at this age, taking better care of our health, and even beginning new careers.
Today, having greater self awareness is allowing for emotional maturity at an earlier age. This can lead to self reflection of experiences you have had, which can influence your sense of purpose, integrity, and passions, all of which are a part of your core values. It also helps us focus on what is truly important in our lives.

, When change happens, people tend not to think too much about it, let alone how this change will affect them in the long run. Sit back for a moment. Take the time to think about what you have accomplished, no matter what stage of life you are in. Think about the changes that have occurred in your life, and get ready to embrace the changes that are in the years to come!"

Learn to say “No.” Saying “yes” to every person who asks for your help will fill your schedule up with activities that often have no place on your priority list.,
Turn off the tech.",How to Enjoy Time for Yourself," Movies are often a group activity, whether with your friends or your loved one, meaning you probably don’t always get to see the movie you want. Scheduling some alone time is a great chance to see that weird art film that no one else wanted to see with you.You can also catch up on a television show that you’ve fallen behind on. Netflix and other streaming services make finishing shows a breeze.
Catch a matinee! You can save a few dollars by watching a movie much earlier in the day than usual – an advantage to freeing up some time for yourself.;
, Art is divisive, so finding someone who is into the style of art that interests you is not always easy. Take the opportunity to travel to a museum that you haven’t been able to drum up interest for among your friends, or haven’t been able to visit during the week because of scheduling issues.


There are many museums hiding in plain sight that you might not have ever noticed. Search online to find the hidden gems in your area.Viewing art also provides inspiration, which can lead to new hobbies or passions that can have a strong impact on your life., Take advantage of the free time to hike a trail you’ve always wanted to visit. Not everyone likes particularly long or strenuous hikes, so the time alone is a great chance to make the trip.


Be careful when hiking alone. Let people know where you are going and carry enough water and supplies if you will be gone for a long period of time..
You can also get out in nature or take a long walk. Many studies link getting out in nature with a variety of health benefits. Among them include relief for depression and dementia, a reduction in stress and PTSD, and an overall improvement in physical health and wellbeing. Take a trip to the beach! Sit at the ocean to watch the waves and listen to the surf.

, Alone time is a great opportunity to catch up on some reading. Even if you don't have a full day of solitude, you can make significant progress in a book with just 30 minutes of silent time a day.

, Whether devouring an entire banana split by yourself, or blasting pop music as loud as you can, indulge in those activities that you try to keep hidden from others. Not all guilty pleasures are bad, after all.Just make sure you aren't actually doing something harmful!


A shopping trip for one of your other hobbies, such as woodworking or pipe collecting, is a great way to spend your alone time - particularly if the trip typically elicits groans from others typically forced to tag along.

, Go visit your old house or your favorite playground from your youth. Pull out your old stash of comic books or fire up some video games you enjoyed as a kid. You might even visit home and go through old photos of your family. Time alone is a great way to take stock of where you are, where you’ve been, and where you are going.Take some pictures or write down your thoughts about the old locations you visit. It's a great way to reflect, and you never know if they will still be there when you return next.
Going through your old things is a great way to figure out what you want to get rid of, or what you might want to pass down to your children or sibling's children.

, Meditation can be performed nearly anywhere and fits easily into most schedules. Ten minutes of meditation is enough to clear your mind and reduce your stress.


Meditate in silence to help focus on your feelings and thoughts.
Sit up straight and count your breath. This can help you settle down and fall into the moment., Massages feel great and help relieve stress while relaxing the body. Massage therapy also offers wider health benefits, including providing relief for anxiety, headaches, and digestive disorders., Music connects with our emotions and can help boost our mood. Other studies show that music can help with fatigue and focus, as well as reduce the stress we feel. Slower music in particular can help you relax.Faster music is excellent for when you are working out or are getting work done. Try out a variety of music during different activities to see what inspires you!, Relax with a coffee at an outdoor cafe, or have lunch at a new and inviting restaurant. If a local park has benches or hills, go lay down for a while. Get away from the hustle and bustle of others to reduce stress and improve your mood.

Be sure to choose a place that has a calm and low-noise atmosphere. Loud restaurants with fast turnover is rarely relaxing.
Bring a blanket or hammock to the park to open up a variety of relaxation areas without needing to lay directly on the ground.

, A nutritious meal can help improve your mood and boost your energy, particularly when you focus on nutritious regularly. Choose organic whole foods with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and grains to reap the benefits of healthy eating.


Other foods to work into your diet include certain meats and beans, milk and dairy, and foods high in oils and solid fats, such as nuts, olives and fish., Pamper yourself by adding bath salts or bubbles. Turn on some soft relaxing music, lie back and let your mind wander.


Put on some relaxing music or natural sounds while you lay back to really unwind. Just be careful not to fall asleep.

, Enjoying time for yourself will be difficult if you feel guilty every time you take some time for yourself. Place your happiness and wellbeing ahead of other lesser priorities.


Work on your self-confidence and sense of worth. If you find it difficult to make yourself a priority, you might need to reexamine how you feel about yourself versus those around you., Review your schedule and responsibilities. Figure out how much time you spend on each of your current obligations and ask whether the time you spend on each is appropriate. Does your current schedule reflect your priorities in life?A certain amount of time for certain activities such as work is required, but are you spending additional time beyond that which is necessary? Ask yourself if there is a way to reduce the extra time spent on work.

, Based on your list of priorities and responsibilities, restructure your schedule. Each priority should receive an amount of time consistent with where it ranks on your priority list. The higher on the list, the more time it should receive.


When creating time for yourself, get creative. You don’t necessarily need to block out an entire day to yourself each week. Blocking out a half-hour or hour each day for yourself is a great start to enjoying time for yourself.
Schedule small breaks such as sitting on the porch, taking a walk, or reading a book. Putting it in your schedule makes you less likely to forget to give yourself some free time., Once you’ve started including yourself in your schedule, expand the time you make for yourself. Set up appointments for yourself in particular that take up a day or more. Depending on your schedule, arranging a full day off might take some preparation. This may be why you found it difficult to spontaneously enjoy time for yourself.


Find a babysitter. A babysitter can take your children off your hands for a while to let you take that time you need. If you can’t find a babysitter that can work for the schedule you need, check with your family members to see if they can watch your kids for a spell.
Check the schedules of the other people in your household. If you plan on spending your time indoors, find a day where no one is home to make sure you get peace and quiet.

, These eat into the time you can spend on more important activities, including yourself.If you have trouble saying no directly, come up with a few easy-to-use excuses.
For example, you might say: “I’d love to, but it’s been a long day, and I really have to go home and get some rest.”
You might also say: “I have a few errands to take care of then. Maybe we could reschedule for another time?”

, There are fewer easier ways of removing distraction from your life than by turning off the tech. Stay away from the Internet, turn off your phone, and unplug the television to remove several big sources of distraction from your day.Let others know when you intend on unplugging. You don't want to worry anyone if you suddenly stop responding to text messages.

Ask in advance for a quiet venue.,
Choose off hours, days, or seasons.,
Invite a smaller group.,
Choose an outdoor venue, if appropriate.,
Let event staff, waiters, and DJs know you prefer quiet.",How to Cope with a Noisy Event1," If you're involved with the planning or organizing of the event, choose a place that's quiet.

Go for someplace with a separate room. Some restaurants and convention centers separate rooms for private events.
Choose a place that doesn't play music or television loudly.
Ask to visit a prospective venue at the same time of day or during a similar event, and observe the noise level.
Be aware of the acoustics in the room. A room with lots of hard surfaces can get full of echos when everyone tries to talk over everyone else.;
,

Restaurants will usually have the fewest visitors between 3 and 5pm.
Take advantage of shoulder seasons for travel destinations. During spring (except spring break) and autumn, most schools are in session, and the cooler, wetter weather may make some destinations less attractive to the biggest crowds.
Restaurants that have big rushes on Friday or Saturday nights might not be so busy on Tuesdays. Most will know when they're busiest, and many will be glad of the business at non-peak times, so ask in advance.

, Does it need to be 200 people, or would 40 suffice? Or, could the event be broken into two or three smaller sections, perhaps by room, by activity, or by date?

A smaller group also lets you use a smaller venue, which in turn gives you more options and often reduces costs.

, Assuming the weather is pleasant, your guests can enjoy the outdoors without loudspeakers and without echos., Most will gladly back off on the sound levels if they know your preference."

Use effective communication skills.,
Listen intently.,
Show appreciation for each other.,
Agree to disagree.,
Give and accept apologies.",How to Create Family Unity1," Each member of the family should feel important and valued. This includes you. In order for your family members to hear your needs, you have to express them. Be polite, but honest with your family during discussions.For example, if your family usually plans on watching a movie together on Wednesday nights and you can’t do it that night, then you might say, ""I know we said Wednesday night would be movie night, but I'm so stressed out about this test tomorrow. Can we move it to another night this week?"";
, Just as you want your family members to hear you, it is important that you hear their concerns. Your family members will feel loved and unified with the family if their point of view is heard and respected. Avoid talking over your family members, and instead, listen to what they are saying.Give your full attention to your family members when they are talking, such as by putting away all distractions (cellphone, computer, etc.) and looking them in the eye.
Ask questions to show that you are interested, such as “What happened next?” “How do you feel about that?” and “What do you plan to do about it?”
Show you are paying attention by nodding and making neutral statements, such as “yes,” “uh-huh” and “I see.”

, Taking family for granted is easily done. Most of them have been around most (or even all) of your life. Make it a point to tell each family member that you are thankful for them, and that you enjoy being a family.Traditions such as going around the table at Thanksgiving and saying what each person is thankful for are a good way to show this appreciation.

, All members of your family are not going to agree on every issue. As a family, you have to be flexible and accepting of each person’s point of view. Avoid arguing or bickering over trivial things such as who should take the trash out. Instead, make a conscious effort to divide responsibilities and privileges fairly (fairly does not necessarily mean equally).


When a conflict arises, use good communication skills and empathy to solve the problem. For example, instead of shouting at each other, allow everyone a chance to talk without being interrupted. While each person is talking, have the rest of the family listen closely and try to understand what the person is saying.

, When arguments do arise (and they will), you should work towards a resolution to the problem. Once the argument is over, apologies may be in order. If you have crossed any lines, you should extend an apology to family members to help smooth things over. The other important part of apologies is accepting them. Whenever a family member offers you an apology, accept the apology and move on in order reunify the family.


Remember to compromise to avoid arguments and resolve them. Also remember that perfect unity will not exist all the time in any family.

When going into a family situation, work on keeping your expectations in check. If you accept some conflict and difficulty is inevitable, you may be less frustrated by disagreement.Know your most difficult family members. Limit the amount of time you spend with these people. If your mother, for instance, tends to be the cause of drama, keep your distance.
Do not expect a dramatic change. Breaking free of a cycle of dysfunction is difficult. If it does happen, it will take time. Go into the event knowing it will likely be difficult — at the same time, do be open to the possibility that it might be okay. Don't foreshadow events by deciding that they will be terrible. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.;
, Having a buffer can help you cope. Ask a friend or romantic partner to accompany you to support you emotionally during family functions.Your family may be on better behavior in the presence of an outsider. Is there anyone you could invite? Maybe a friend of yours does not have Christmas plans. See if he or she wants to join your family's festivities.
Give your buffer a fair warning, however. Let him or her know your family can be difficult at times.

, Alcohol tends to fuel emotion. If your family is difficult by nature, too much alcohol could lead to an increase in conflict.There may be problem drinkers in your family. If this is the case, it's a good idea to call family members and request an alcohol free get together.
Try to provide other beverages, like sparkling cider, instead of alcohol.
Some family members may be uninterested in attending an event without alcohol. These people will likely not show up, or leave early. Limiting alcohol can be a great way to keep the more difficult family members away.

, If your family fights, you can take it upon yourself to limit argument. It's frustrating when it's up to you to make sure people get along, but sometimes it's inevitable. Listen to various conversations and work on changing the topic when necessary.By now, you likely know the topics that trigger drama in your family. For instance, maybe your Uncle John is chronically unemployed due to his drinking. He tends to become very sensitive when the topic is raised.
When you hear the problem topic arising, act fast. For example, your dad says something like, ""John, have you applied to any jobs lately? It's been, what, six months?""
Jump in right away and steer the conversation out of the danger zone. You can try to play a game, like 20 questions, or simply change the subject. For example, ""Dad, actually, Sarah just applied to a job at a bookstore. She's really excited about it.""
It can be helpful to go into the event with a list of ""safe"" topics that you think everyone will enjoy. Maybe jot these down in your phone in case you panic and forget.

, At times, it's appropriate to walk away. If someone is getting hostile or difficult, know an excuse you can use to dodge an interaction.Think of various ways to slip out for a minute. You could, for example, offer to help out in the kitchen or run to the store to get something.
If you want to leave early, think of an excuse. You could say you're watching a friend's pet and need to check in on it, for example. It can be helpful to lay the groundwork for this early. Say on the front end that you can only stay until whatever determined time, that way people are not offended when you leave.

, You do not have control over other people's lives and decisions. Even if you want a family member to change, you cannot do it for them. Try to avoid becoming emotionally invested in long standing conflicts over which you have little power.For instance, your mother is always very critical of you and your siblings. As a result, none of you have much contact with her. At family events, she continues to be critical and push people away.
You may wish your mother was different. You may want a better relationship with her; however, keep in mind it's her responsibility to change. If she continues to be resistant to altering her behavior, there is little you can do for her. Try your best to emotionally disengage.
Also remember that family events may just not be the right time to address these conflicts. Know that you can revisit these issues at a later time if you feel it's important. That way holidays are not ruined by fighting.

, You have a right to feel respected and safe in your relationships. No one should violate this right. The first step to asserting yourself is identifying what you need.Everyone deserves respect, and that includes you. You have a right to be around people who bring you up rather than down. In a dysfunctional family, your thoughts may be skewed. You may question whether you deserve respect. Remind yourself you do.
Think about what behaviors are and are not acceptable. For example, maybe your father continually criticizing your career choice is not acceptable to you. You're proud of what you do, regardless of what your father thinks. It's well within your rights to assert as much.

, In the moment, let someone know when they've crossed a line. You do not have to be aggressive or mean. You can be respectful while simultaneously making it clear where the line is.For example, shopping with your mother is always a headache. She's very critical of your appearance and tends to scrutinize the clothing you like. However, she continues to push you to go shopping with her.
Your mother has asked you repetitively to go shopping this weekend. After the third or fourth time she asks, state your boundaries clearly. Say something like, ""Mom, I love the time we spend together, but I think we stress each other out when we go shopping together. If you want to get lunch or see a movie some time, great, but I'm not interested in going shopping with you anymore.""
After establishing your boundaries, it can be helpful to change the subject. This signals to the other party that the boundaries are not up for debate and also suggests that you are not angry with them. Ask about a mutual friend or if they've seen any good movies recently.

, ""I""-statements are statements phrased in a way to reduce blame. Instead of placing an objective judgement on a situation, you emphasize your personal feelings. They have three parts. They begin with ""I feel..."" after which you immediately state your feelings. From there, you explain the behavior that led to that feeling. Lastly, you say why you felt the way you did.For example, you're frustrated that your father has again insulted your girlfriend in front of you. You may be inclined to say something like, ""It's incredibly rude to make comments on Noel's weight. That's completely disrespectful to me and to her.""
This can be rephrased using an ""I""-statement. Say something like, ""It makes me feel disrespected when you make comments on Noel's weight because that's an issue she's very sensitive to and I've explained this to you before.""

, Show genuine compassion and concern for your family. Check in with them regularly and invest in them as people. Do not let their bad behavior dictate your treatment of them — the two should exist separately from each other.

For instance, don't respond to a rude family member by being rude in return or by just writing them off. Try to respond to them with compassion and understanding. Going tit-for-tat isn't going to improve the situation.

, Despite your best efforts to assert your needs, some people are just very difficult. If your family is not responding to your attempt to assert yourself, it's okay to leave some situations.For example, your father is relentless when you tell him to stop disrespecting your girlfriend. Instead of apologizing, he responds, ""You're being hypersensitive. I just care about her health."" You can tell, from his tone, he's getting hostile.
It may not be worth it to push the issue at this point. Your father is getting angry. Even as you try to respectfully address the situation, he's trying to force an argument.
At this point, just walk away. Say something like, ""This isn't getting us anywhere. I'm going to go for a walk, okay?"" Then, give yourself some time to cool down.

, It's very hard to deal with the emotional toll of a dysfunctional family alone. A qualified therapist can help you deal with the damage done by familial dysfunction. Seek out a therapist in your area to work out your issues.You can ask your regular doctor for a referral to a therapist. You can also ask your insurance provider to help you find a therapist in your area.
If you are a student, you may be entitled to free counseling from your college or university.

, Many people feel they must forgive or let go of bad behavior. If your family has been unfair to you, it's okay to feel anger. It's actually healthy to allow yourself to experience anger when you've been disrespected or mistreated.Forgiveness can be the last step in recovery. However, it is rarely healthy to forgive first. You need to put the blame on those causing the problems. Do not expect yourself to fix problems via forgiveness.
Find productive ways to vent anger. Talk to close friends or go to support groups. You can also write a letter to difficult family members and then burn it.

, If you come from a dysfunctional family, you may have difficulty expressing your emotions. Work on ways to express yourself in a healthy and productive fashion. If you're seeing a therapist, it may be valuable to talk this over with him or her.Stop to identify your emotions several times a day. Growing up in a dysfunctional family, you may have learned to repress or ignore your emotions. Try to take time to notice what you are feeling. Also, what caused the feeling? What are you responding to? You can try keeping a journal in which you record your daily feelings.
You can cope with your emotions by sharing them with others. Work on finding people who are supportive. You should only share your emotions with people who respond with kindness and affirmation.

, This can be one of the hardest parts of coping with a dysfunctional family. It may be difficult to trust if you come from a difficult home life. Start by taking small risks, and then build from there.Practice seeking out the support of healthy people. Get to know people who are kind and positive. Building a ""family"" of quality friends is extremely important in maintaining self-esteem and helping someone cope with family dysfunction.
You may have difficulty telling others how you're feeling. Work on getting over this hurdle. Start to occasionally expressing small needs and wants to those around you. You can begin expressing greater needs and wants over time.

, You may neglect your own self care if you come from a dysfunctional home. If you spent a lot of time coping with conflict, you may put your own health and well being aside. Work on practicing basic self care. This alone can help you better regulate your emotions.You need to do things for yourself. Make sure you eat healthy meals, get exercise, and take care of basic hygiene.
You should also treat yourself on occasion. If you need to take a day off, take one. Indulge in small pleasures, like going to see a movie, having coffee with a friend, or ordering takeout after a long day.

Put your spouse first.",How to Make Your Spouse Happy," If you are unhappy, you will be in no place to make your spouse happy, so take some time to work on you. You may need to find an enjoyable hobby or a more gratifying line of work, make some more friends, or seek therapy to deal with past traumas. Do whatever you need to do to be the happiest you can be so that you can be the best possible spouse.No one can rely entirely on another person to make them happy. If you feel your spouse is unhappy for reasons that are not directly related to your marriage, encourage him or her to work on personal happiness as well.;
, Your attitude can have a huge effect on the health of your marriage. If you tend to be negative, make a conscious effort to be more positive, and your spouse will be much happier.Negative people tend to criticize and make lots of demands, both of which can lead to marital conflict. If you're not sure where to start in changing your attitude, make a conscious effort to avoid these two behaviors.

, Stress from a busy life can often cause people to lash out at their loved ones, even when they don't mean to. In order to avoid this unnecessary conflict, work on getting your own stress under control.You may want to try relaxation techniques such visualization, meditation, or yoga.
If you have a lot of stress, you may also benefit from counseling.

, It's important not to come to a marriage with unrealistic expectations of the relationship, as this will cause both partners to be unhappy. Take a moment to assess what you expect of your relationship and determine whether you are being overly idealistic.Watch for mind reading. Mind reading is a common unrealistic expectation in relationships. You may expect your partner to know what you want without having to say what you want. For example, you would be engaging in mind reading if you expect your partner to come and sit next to you on the sofa without asking him or her to do so.

Consider the importance you place on your feelings. Expecting your partner to change his or her behaviour for your benefit is also unrealistic. For example, if you get upset because your partner plays soccer with his friends on Saturday mornings, then you would be engaging in an unrealistic expectation if you think your partner should give up this hobby for your benefit and disregard his own feelings.Keep track of your expectations. To become more aware of any unrealistic expectations that you might be imposing on your partner, start writing them down. Then, take time to reflect on whether or not an expectation is reasonable and worthwhile. For example, you might ask yourself, does this expectation help or hurt my relationship? If the expectation is hurting your relationship, then you might simply say to yourself, “Having this expectation is not in my best interest.”, While you should not have to change who you are in order to make your spouse happy, you may want to consider making small changes or compromises to accommodate your partner. Pay attention to things that your spouse asks you to do (or not do), and try to make them more habitual.For example, if it drives your spouse crazy that you leave your dirty clothes on the floor, try to become a little neater and make a habit out of putting your clothes in the hamper every day.

, Happy couples make a habit of spending quality time together regularly. It will be much more enjoyable for you and your spouse to spend time together if you can find something to do that is interesting to both of you, so try to cultivate some common interests.It's a good idea to go out on dates together once a week.
Try to plan a few short getaways throughout the year as well.

, While time together is healthy, most couples also need their space. Work with your partner to figure out how much time together and apart works for both of you.Try to have at least one hobby that you pursue without your spouse, and encourage your spouse to do the same.
It's also healthy for you both to spend some time socializing with your own friends.

, Physical contact is a simple way to show affection to your spouse. Make this a priority, whether you're at home watching television together or out and about. Even the smallest touch of the hand can let your spouse know how much you care.Cuddle often.
Try to get in the habit of going to bed at the same time to encourage intimacy.
Hold hands while walking.
Hug each other every day.

, You and your spouse are bound to have some differences, and you will both be happier if you learn to accept, and even appreciate, those differences.Try to focus on how you and your spouse complement each other, instead of wishing that your spouse was exactly like you.
Don't try to change your spouse. This will lead to resentment and conflict.

, No matter how long you and your spouse have been together, it's important to stay in the habit of using words to show your love. Never assume that you don't have to say something because your partner already knows that you care.Say ""good morning"" and ""good night"" every day.
Always tell your spouse to have a good day.
Say ""I love you"" frequently.

, Happy marriages do not happen by accident. If you want to improve the health of your relationship and make your spouse really happy, you will need to consciously work on the relationship. Always look for areas of conflict and find ways to resolve those conflicts.Resolving conflicts as soon as possible will keep them from growing into bigger issues that could threaten the happiness of your marriage.
Keep in mind that no relationship is happy 100% of the time. You will face conflicts, and this is perfectly normal.

, Finances cause many disagreements and arguments in relationships, but they don't have to. Avoid this source of tension by having an open discussion about how you will manage your money as a couple.If money is tight, come up with a budget together that you can both agree upon.
Be sure that both you and your spouse are comfortable with how money is managed. If your spouse wants more control over the finances, find a way to make this work.

, Good communication is essential to any happy relationship, so never underestimate its importance. Be sure to share your feelings with your spouse, whether they are positive or negative.If you think there is a problem in the relationship, talk to your spouse about it right away. Encourage your spouse to bring problems up swiftly as well.
Check in with your spouse every day to find out how things are going.
Try to always be calm and respectful when talking to your spouse. Even if you do not agree, do your best to see things from your spouse's perspective.

, In order to build a strong relationship, you and your spouse must both work on forgiving each other for past offences and trusting each other to respect your marriage. This will help you deal with conflicts in your relationship in a much healthier way.Never hold a grudge, as this will only keep your relationship stuck in the past. Instead, focus on the future.
If necessary, go to couples counselling to work on these areas.

, If you really want your spouse to be happy in the marriage, you need to express your love and appreciation. This will let your spouse know that your marriage is a priority to you and that you do not take it for granted, no matter how many other things you have going on it life.Do little things to let your spouse know you care, like sending an ""I love you"" text in the middle of the day or surprising your spouse with breakfast in bed.
If you have children, make sure to spend some time alone. While your children are important, they should not be prioritized at the expense of your marriage.

Limit your time in the noisy location.,
Ask someone to help lower the noise level.,
Suggest a quiet venue, or suggest sitting outdoors.,
Look for a quiet place to retreat.",How to Cope with a Noisy Event2," This is the aspect over which you will have the most control. Arrive late, leave early, or take a break., Ask the host, the DJ, the waiter, or anyone else who might have control, if they can help limit the noise. If no one knows it's bothering you, no one is going to do anything about it., You won't have control over all events and venues, but if a group of colleagues is headed out to eat, see if you can steer them toward a quieter place. Often, the first person to suggest a restaurant can persuade a group.

Suggest an early or late lunch, if no time is set, at a time when the restaurant might not be so crowded.

, Is there an outdoor patio or balcony, a back room, a lobby, or even a restroom where you could take a break, or carry on a conversation?"

Make family routines.,
Assign each person chores.,
Share other household responsibilities evenly.",How to Create Family Unity2," Routines allow each member of the family to know when and where certain events will happen. Daily routines, such as a 6:00 dinner time, serve as touch points through the day to bring the family back together. The key to setting routines is to keep them predictable. If you must, write it down for each member of the family.You can also create longer running routines, such as a weekly grass mowing or a monthly road trip.

, For a family to be unified, each person has to pull their own weight. This means that you will have to assign tasks to each individual that everyone else can expect will be carried out. Each time the chores get done properly, it re-enforces trust and respect between family members. You may choose to give each person permanent chores, or rotate the chores every so often so that they are evenly dispersed.With children and teens, it can be helpful to rotate the chores. This way, everyone learns to cook, to do laundry, etc. This eliminates any feelings of unevenness in the chore disbursement, and teaches all children to be relatively self-sufficient.

, Some household responsibilities will come up that are not covered on the chore list. When this happens, they should be split between family members, or different family members should rotate doing them. This shows the kind of cooperation and respect that is vital for family unity.Once the responsibilities are finished, the whole family can reap the benefits and enjoy your time together.

Put the family first.,
Adopt family traditions.,
Take family adventures.,
Gather regularly as a family.,
Lean on each other.",How to Create Family Unity3," To have a sense of family unity, your family member will all have to learn to prioritize the family. This may mean making some sacrifices in other areas, but the sacrifices may lead to a stronger family unit. Some things you can do include:


Avoiding putting work before family plans. Don’t cancel family outings and other family plans if you can help it. This can be difficult, especially if you have a demanding job, but if you frequently cancel on your family to work late or pick up an extra shift, then this can affect your family’s sense of unity.
Making your family aware that they are your main priority. Your family might not know how much they matter to you. To ensure that they know, try mentioning it. For example, you might start a conversation about values over dinner one night and say something like, “I think the thing that I value the most is my family.”
Limiting individual outings. Having too many things going on outside of your home may also interfere with your ability to form a strong family unit. This means that you may have to be pickier about what sort of extracurricular activities or hobbies you and your family members engage in. For example, instead of having your kids do three or four different extracurriculars, have them just pick one or two that they really like.

, Family traditions create a sense of identity for the family as a whole. They also give individuals something to look forward to. These traditions should generate positive memories and facilitate enjoyable gatherings that bring the family together.An example of a tradition is cooking an Easter salmon every year at a family gathering.
You can also have weekly traditions, such as Taco Tuesday, family game night on Thursdays, or Saturday morning walks.

, An obvious example of family adventures is a vacation. Unfortunately, many of people can only take one vacation per year (or less). Fill in the gaps between vacations with family road trips, even if they are only day trips. You can also go camping or hiking to create a memorable adventure to bring your family together., The most important way to establish unity is to gather together whenever possible. Gathering as a family allows the time needed to have adventures, traditions, and conversations that will unify the family. Make gatherings pleasant by avoiding arguments and facilitating good conversations.For example, you could sit down to eat dinner and talk with your family on three or four nights of every week. Or, you could plan on playing board games together once per week, such as on a Friday or Saturday evening. Try to identify something that will fit into your regular routine and that will allow you to enjoy each other’s company.

, Every family experiences tough times. Whether it’s a death in the family, a job loss, or some other hard time, you should be comfortable leaning on your family members. Also, be sure to let them lean on you when they need it. This will strengthen the bonds of family and reinforce that you can trust each other no matter what the occasion.

Be romantic.,
Spice up your sex life.,
Set a date night.,
Send flirty text messages throughout the day.,
Get some new sexy outfits.,
Have an attractive and confident attitude.,
Exercise.",How to Make Your Husband Happy1," Romance can easily become a back-burner priority after years of marriage. Make sure to save time for romantic activities, like candle-lit dinners, beach walks at sunset, and cuddling up to watch a movie.;
, One of the main aspects of marriage where the excitement can quickly fade is the sexual aspect. You'll both have to work hard to keep your sex life interesting, but thankfully there are several things that you can do.


Don't get stuck in a boring routine. If you and your hubby are used to having sex without any foreplay or wooing beforehand, sex can become just another activity that happens when you get in bed. Take the time to woo each other at spontaneous times throughout the day to avoid feeling like you have simply scheduled time for being intimate. Scheduled sex is not sexy.
Listen to your hubby's wants and needs. Know what your hubby's preferences are and what he wants to try in the bedroom. His desires may change over time. Just ask him what he likes and wants. This question in itself can be a turn on!
Try the ""Forty Beads Method."" This method was developed by a wife who saw the need to change things up in her relationship with her husband. The method rests on the premise that each spouse has a bowl in which the other spouse drops a bead when they want to be intimate, and the other spouse has a certain amount of time to act on the request.

, Between you and your hubby's busy schedules, it can be very hard to find time to spend with each other. Make a commitment to go on a date or make a home-cooked meal together at least once a week. Here are some date night ideas:


Go to dinner and a movie. This classic never gets old if you switch up the restaurant and the movie genre each week.
Make dinner together. Try making a dish that requires more effort than one you would make on a random weeknight. Make pizza from scratch to have fun while cooking.
Go on a picnic in the spring and summer. A romantic picnic in a meadow or on a beach is a great way to get outdoors and spend some time together.
Go ice skating in winter. Hold hands with your hubby and glide on the ice.
Do something adventurous, like an extreme sport. You could go rock climbing, snowboarding, surfing, etc.

, Sometimes nothing is better than a spontaneous text or voice message from your lover. Call just to say ""I love you"" or send your hubby a flirty message that contains something for him to look forward to.


Send sexy snap chats to your hubby to remind him what's waiting for him after work. Make sure to warn him that you sent a sexy snap in advance, so that he doesn't open it in front of his friends, or worse, his colleagues.
Put a video or website link on his FaceBook page to something that has a special meaning to your relationship. This could be the music video to a love song, or a clip of your favorite comedy show, etc.

, If you're constantly wallowing around the house in sweatpants, it might be time to take a trip to the mall for some new clothes. There's nothing wrong with being comfortable in front of your hubby, but be sure to always take care of yourself as well.


Spice up a plain outfit with a sexy blouse or dress.
Put on a pair of stilettos to elongate your legs. Every man loves long, sexy legs. A pair of heels are a quick and easy way to make any outfit look sexier.
Get some new lingerie. Lingerie is a sexy way to spice up your bedroom life and make your hubby see you in a new light.

, Being attractive isn't all about looking sexy, it's about exuding a confident and compassionate attitude as well. Be sure to retain a kind disposition toward your husband and be considerate of his feelings always.


Exude happiness. As humans, we're all going to have good days and bad days. While you shouldn't try to mask your feelings if you are feeling sad or depressed, you should try to be a pleasant person to be around whenever possible.
Smile. Visual signals are just as important as words. Avoid walking around with a scowl on your face all day and try to smile as much as possible.

, This might sound like a plea to get you to work out for the sake of a sexy body, but exercise can provide you with so much more than a slim frame and ripped abs. When you exercise, your body releases endorphins, neurotransmitters that reduce stress and induce happiness.


Maintaining a steady exercise routine has also been shown to increase sexual desire as a result of the positive effects working out has on your body and mind.
Try stress-reducing exercises like yoga, or energy-inducing exercises like running.
Don't overlook the positive effect that simply feeling sexy can have one your love life. When you feel desirable, your confidence and sexuality shine through."

Avoid trying to convert your spouse.,
Look for common ground between your religious traditions.,
Educate yourself about your spouse’s religion.,
Participate in your spouse’s religious traditions.,
Help your spouse grow in faith along with you.,
Stay flexible.",How to Make an Interfaith Marriage Work1," Respect your spouse’s beliefs, however different they are from yours. Don’t try to make them adopt your religion, and don’t criticize or make fun of them for their faith. Remember that your spouse’s religion is just as important to them as yours is to you.For example, if your spouse is an atheist, it's unfair to try to force your religious views onto them. Allow them the freedom to decide what they believe, just as you do.
Accept your spouse the way they are, and assume they won’t change. If you hold out hope that your spouse will convert, it could strain your marriage.;
, Many religions have similar ideas at their core. Instead of focusing on all the ways you disagree with your spouse, find the issues that you do agree on.For instance, you and your spouse might have similar ideas about treating others well or raising a family.

, Show your spouse that you respect and care about their spiritual life by making an effort to understand their faith better. Ask them questions, read their holy texts, and seek out other educational resources about their religion. As you learn, try to understand how your spouse’s faith has shaped them as a person.For example, you might ask, ""What's a good book that can help me understand your faith?"" to show you are trying to understand them better.
Invite your spouse to learn more about your faith as well. Answer any questions they have, and help them find resources for learning more.

, Ask your spouse to bring you to their services, and meet some other people in their religious community. Help your spouse celebrate the holidays and traditions of their religion at home.For example, you might attend services with your spouse on Sundays and they might join you for mid-week services at your place of worship.
Make sure your spouse understands that you don’t intend to convert. Explain that you are secure in your own beliefs, but you want to support their faith because you love them.
Make your spouse feel welcome in your religious spaces and traditions, too.

, Encourage your spouse to make time for their religion and live according to their beliefs. Consider praying or studying your religious texts together.For instance, each of you could say a prayer from your faith before a meal.

, Sometimes, you and your spouse will probably have to compromise on things that matter to you both. You may never agree on certain issues, but do your best to find a solution that makes you both feel respected. Be prepared to put your marriage first, even if that means you don’t always get things your own way."

Give him something from nature.",How to Make Your Husband Happy3," A picture is truly worth a thousand words, and framing a picture of you and your husband is a great way to show him how much you care.

, Coupon books are a great (and inexpensive!) way to show someone that you love them. Get creative and give your hubby coupons for romantic activities that can be redeemed at any time. Some ideas include:


Massages.
Intimate activities.
His favorite home-cooked meal.
Control of the television.
A trip to his favorite restaurant.
Passes to get out of doing chores.

, Take the time to make a playlist of your hubby's favorite songs or find new songs that you think he will like. You can also make a playlist of love songs that you have listened to at one time or another during your relationship.


Give it to your hubby in cute wrapping paper with a little note explaining the significance of the playlist to you.
Alternately, stick it in his car CD player and set it so that it will play the next time he turns on his car. This sneaky addition will have your hubby smiling and soon as he buckles his seat belt.

, Collect something from a place in nature that is special to you. This can be a rock in the shape of a heart, a shell from the beach, or even a tree branch from your favorite hike. Let your hubby know that this token from nature reminds you of him.

Keep things clean.,
Greet him warmly.,
Cook meals together.,
Make DIY home improvements together.,
Invite his family over for dinner.,
Avoid becoming just roommates.",How to Make Your Husband Happy4," This doesn't mean you should do all the cleaning in the house all the time, but you should both share in the responsibilities of creating a comfortable home. Try not to take over your shared room by throwing your clothes and makeup everywhere.

, If you're at home when your man gets home, greet him with a smooch and a smile. Doing so immediately sets a positive tone for your subsequent interaction and reinforces the home as a comfortable, happy place., Share in the responsibility of creating dinners that you two can enjoy together.

Make time for yourself.,
Reserve time to hang out with friends individually.,
Don't lose sight of your interests.,
Be honest with each other.",How to Make Your Husband Happy5," The rather comical old saying, ""A happy wife means a happy life,"" actually holds a lot of weight in a marriage situation.


In order for your husband to be happy with you, you first have to be secure and happy in your own skin. Being happy stems from different behaviors, feelings, and experiences for each individual person, just make sure you are leaving time to take care of yourself in addition to your husband.

, It is important that both you and your husband take the time to nurture the relationships you have with other people in your life as well. Friends are an important part of any person's life and spending time alone with friends helps build balance in your life.


Make one night a week dedicated to hanging out separately with friends. By choosing the same night, neither spouse will feel neglected as the other hangs out with friends.
Don't talk about your spouse the entire time you hang out with your friends. Allow this time to be a sort of break from your busy, married life and re-engage with your friends and what is going on in their lives.

, It's wonderful if you and your spouse share the same interests, but make sure that you each retain your own hobbies too. If you love to read and he loves to golf, give each other space to do those things. You don't have to share everything all the time, and by giving each other space you can actually strengthen your relationship.

, Communication is key in any relationship. Be sure to tell each other how you are feeling, even if it is uncomfortable to do so. If you feel like you've been making a strong effort to make your husband happy and he isn't returning the love, tell him so! Often all you need to do to make an important change is communicate what is lacking.

Discuss your religion with your spouse.,
Discuss the future.,
Make a plan for dealing with your differences.,
Consider marital counseling.",How to Make an Interfaith Marriage Work2," Talk with your spouse about what faith means to each of you, where your faith came from, and what role it plays in your life. Stay open and non-judgmental. Work on understanding your spouse better, not turning the conversation into a debate.For example, you might say, ""As a Buddhist, I am driven towards finding peace in my everyday actions. My spirituality isn't just a set of rules but a way of living and being.""
It’s a good idea to have this conversation on a regular basis, since people’s religious beliefs and perspectives often shift throughout life.

, Talk with your spouse about where you want your life to take you, how you want to develop your faith, and where you see your marriage fitting into your plan. Ask your spouse to share their hopes and expectations, too. Together, develop a plan that works for both of you.You might ask, for example, ""How will we celebrate religious holidays since we have separate faiths?""

, If you and your spouse keep running into the same conflicts or incompatibilities, don’t ignore them – figure out how to fix them. Think about where you can give a little ground, and offer to compromise however you can. Don’t set your beliefs aside to keep the peace, though.Make sure your compromises are a joint effort. If not, you or your spouse will end up feeling resentful.
For example, you might go through the calendar and decide how you will celebrate different holidays or holy weeks. Some, you might celebrate together, while you might choose to celebrate others separately.

, For interfaith couples, marital counseling can be a good way to learn better communication and conflict resolution strategies. Consider seeing a counselor to keep your marriage strong, healthy, and mutually respectful.You don’t need to be having marriage problems to see a counselor. Counseling can help prevent major problems from occurring in the first place.

Talk openly with your kids about religion.,
Talk to your families.",How to Make an Interfaith Marriage Work3," Make a plan for celebrating holidays from both of your religious traditions.

, Most interfaith marriages get much more complicated once kids enter the picture. Talk with your spouse sooner rather than later about what religion your kids will be.This is a complicated and often touchy topic. Be sensitive about your spouse’s feelings as well as your own.
Some parents opt to raise children in both of their religious traditions. Others pick only one. Either approach can work, but both require tolerance and cooperation.

, If you have children, explain both your beliefs and your spouse’s beliefs to them. Take a positive tone towards both religions, and don’t try to convince your kids that yours is the right one.Regardless of the religion you’re raising your kids to be, it’s important for them to have a positive and respectful view of both parents’ beliefs.

, It’ll be easier to maintain marital harmony when both of your families are on board with your interfaith marriage. Explain your religion to your in-laws, and invite your spouse to do the same for your family. Make your extended family feel included by inviting them to participate in your holidays and traditions."

Be fun!",How to Make a Woman Happy," The most important thing, the thing you should always do even if you don't do anything else, is to respect her. Basically: treat her the way that you would expect to be treated. When you love someone, that's the most important thing for you to do. There cannot be true love without respect.


Value her opinions, give her the chance to speak her mind, never demean her or insult her, don't judge her, understand and appreciate her for who she is, be honest with her, etc.;
, A big part of respecting her is stepping back and empowering her to make decisions for herself. Make sure she knows, even if you have to tell her every day, that you love her no matter what choices she makes for herself. Her choices are what make her who she is. When a man makes his love conditional on the choices that a woman makes to please him, he's really just loving himself. And a good woman deserves more than that.


Don't make her feel like she has to choose between making you feel happy and taking a job that makes her feel fulfilled. Don't make her feel like she has to choose between you finding her attractive and the massive discomfort associated with pubic shaving or waxing. These are the kinds of decisions that she should know you're going to have her back on, no matter the outcome.

, Don't just be quiet when she's talking, actually listen to her. Active listening involves asking questions and really responding to what she's saying. This tells her that you're really paying attention, but it also helps you focus more and remember what she's saying.


Sometimes when you hear someone telling you about a problem (or anything really), you might feel the need to just jump right in and say something or offer solutions. This is probably not what that persons needs, though. When someone tells you about their feelings (regardless of their gender), what they need is to be heard, so just listen. When they're done, they might ask you for advice. If they don't ask, you can kindly offer. Just acknowledge how she feels, don't take control of the conversation.

, Take full responsibility for what comes out of your mouth, as well as how you choose to interpret what you hear. When you make a mistake, own up to it and work to make it better. Don't be selfish in your interactions or your relationship as a whole.


Avoid common non-apologies like ""I'm sorry that your feelings got hurt"". This is a common way to make women unhappy.
Even if you did something that you feel is normal, like looking at a pretty waitress, and your girl gets mad at you, you still have to realize that that action hurt her feelings. Whether you'd cheat on her or not, the burden of doubt is heavy and can kill a woman's ability to enjoy being with you.

, Appreciate everything she does for you and let her know that you appreciate everything that she does for you. Never assume that she's stuck with you, or think that just because she loves you you don't have to work to deserve her anymore. You can get away with letting yourself go physically, but you should never let yourself go emotionally. The second you start taking her for granted is the second she starts looking at other guys.

, This is the fastest way to make a woman lose interest in you. You don't want to be another ""child"" to take care of. You're her man, not her son. This means that you need to be an adult, be reliable, and be responsible. Take care of yourself financially, help out around the house, be there for her when she needs help, and make good on the promises you make.

, Women that you're with aren't impressed by you being smooth with other ladies, and planting the seeds of distrust in her mind will only make her worry that you're a jerk, even if you never cheat on her. Be loyal and don't give her any reason to doubt you.


Spend time with her more than any other woman, don't look at or comment on other women, and make her happiness your priority.
You should also stop putting on the show of attracting other women. Don't wear clothes that are designed to appeal to other women. Just wear what you know she likes. You have a woman already, so you shouldn't be worried about others wanting you, right?

, Notice what she says and does. Pay attention to when she says she ""wishes"" something or talks about wanting to do something. You should also pay attention to how she chooses to spend her time. This will help you understand what's important to her. Just like some things that are important to you are boring to her, you're going to have to at least understand some things that don't matter to you. Plus, you never know when you might miss something that's actually very important.

, This is what we're all looking for in a relationship: someone who will be there for us. Help her solve her problems if she wants help and you're able. Don't just solve them for her and take control of the situation. Instead give her the tools she needs to help herself.


This might mean taking on some extra chores around the house while she deal with bigger problems at work, for example.
Another example is taking one of her family members out to do something fun, if there's a stressful situation in their home. For example, taking her little sister to go shopping at the mall while she helps her parents deal with a family problem or taking her grandmother out to lunch if the grandmother is often lonely.

, Your woman wants to see you for who you really are. This makes her feel more connected to you. If she feels like you're just some stranger, she's never really going to be happy. So let her in. Let her see your vulnerabilities and the things you don't like about yourself. They will only make her love you more.

, When our woman does not want to have sex with us, we take it personally. Once you understand that a woman's ""warm-up time"" is much longer than a man's and that she needs to be forewarned so that she can anticipate it, things become much easier. It's not about you. Very often she just wants to be close to you, to snuggle and be cuddled. Of course, whenever that happens you think about sex. Hold your horses, not so fast! It DOES NOT mean that she wants sex. If you insist on it every time she comes close to you, she will start avoiding you. You scare her off. Take it easy; take your time. Once she gets into it, she WILL enjoy it as much, or maybe even more than you do, but patience is an operative word.

, A great way to show her how much you care is to make her a meal. Breakfast in bed, dinner after a long day at work, a surprise lunch at her office: do whatever makes sense for you two. Having to cook, especially after a tough day, can be really stressful. Taking that pressure off of her will bring a smile to her face.


WikiHow has tons of great cooking articles that you can use! These are easy recipes that even the worst of cooks can make without problems!

, Giving her a gift is, of course, a great way to make her happy. However, skip on the necklaces and rings. You might as well be giving those to just about any girl, right? Instead, give her something that says ""I get you"". This might mean tickets to her favorite concert or a giant plushy of her favorite animal.

, Compliments are a sure bet to making a woman happy, as they are with anyone, but you have to compliment correctly. Don't compliment her on things like her figure, because then she will stress about keeping it nice. You also shouldn't compliment her on things like her hair or eyes. Everyone has hair and eyes. Instead compliment her on things that she has control over: an excellent taste in clothes, a highly-trained skill or talent, a good sense of humor, etc.

, Your woman likes to spend time with you...that's why she's with you after all! If you're busy or you don't get to see her very often, it's important to spend quality time with her. Do things together that give you a chance to really talk, like having a dinner date or going on a walk to the park. She'll probably have ideas for things she'd like to do, so ask her too!

, Women need to be told that we love them. We erroneously think that our actions like working and providing for the family clearly communicates our love for her. We often think that the more we work, the stronger the message of our love is. Wrong again. Nothing can substitute looking in her eyes and telling her: ""I love you.""

, Becoming better in bed is a good goal for everyone. Even if you think you're a king, you probably have at least a little room for improvement. Study female anatomy and erogenous zones. Better yet, ask her for a refresher course on making her feel incredible. She'll love the chance to show you just how she likes it.

, Encourage her to pursue her dreams and goals in life. If she finds something that makes her happy, give her the space and tools she needs to do that thing. She would do the same for you happiness: this is how relationships work!

, Every woman had ideas about what she wanted to be when she was younger. Maybe she wanted to be a really good mom, or maybe she wanted to be a problem solver. No matter what her fundamental desires were, help her to feel like with you she meets those goals. This means giving her opportunities and compliments, and encouraging her to do the things that she wants to do.

, Everybody wants to be with someone who makes their life more interesting. We don't want a boring partner! Be the source of fun in her life by keeping your activities varied and unique. Sign the two of you up for dance lessons at the local community center. Take her on a hiking trip for the weekend. Anything that suits her personality and keeps you doing new things together!

Feel your wife's pain and illnesses and rejoice in her health and happiness as if it were your own life. A husband must see his wife's sexual desires and make supreme efforts to meet those needs too.

Also, respectfully and sensually tell her so. It will not help to criticize her or to be sarcastic. If you do this, it will probably result in her wanting to be less romantic with you less often. Think of how good she will feel when both you and her truly believe that you are enamored with every part of her!

,""(Hebrews 13:4) Jesus says that ""lustful looks are adultery.""(Matthew 5:28) This is similar to ""where your treasure is, there will your heart be also...""(Luke 12:34). Do not treasure such lust in any area of life. Deny it access to your heart. Keep your marriage pure by training your heart and eyes to be true to your wife. Your marriage will reap huge benefits if you do and will hopefully last for a lifetime!


Thank the Lord for beauty and appreciate it, but keep your eye, joy, mind and heart always and only on your wife.

,""(Proverbs 18:22) Just think of how lonely you would be without a wife. Adam was alone and it wasn't good for him to be alone, so God gave him a wife. You have a lifetime companion, a friend, and a lover to enjoy every day. What a blessing! Thank God and pray for her daily. She is a tremendous ""prize"" from God.

,""(Matthew 19:5) Enjoy life with her as if you want to be inseparable from her. Long to be with her, like you did when you first met. Rush home from work to see her. Think about her during the day. Call her every day and text her as much as you can. Learn as a couple to agree on everything and be like-minded. Enjoy intimacy and sex often. You should have sex as often as is necessary to meet the desires of whichever spouse has the stronger sex drive, and as schedules and health permit. Spend time just talking and sharing the day's events. Show a genuine interest and listen intently to your wife. Give her your full attention and eye contact anytime she is talking to you. Your wife is more important than anything or anyone alive but Jesus Christ. Be unified and one with your wife.

Have plans for when the enlisted spouse is away.",How to Make a Military Marriage Work," Commitment to military service is a 24/7 job. The spouse who is not enlisted needs to spend time and energy on their own passions, too. This might mean joining a club, taking a class, or carving out time each day for a creative pursuit.If you have young children, try to arrange childcare to provide you with time to pursue your interests without having to mind the kids.
Remember that your spouse fell in love with you for who you are. Don’t let your identity be subsumed by the fact that one of you is enlisted.;
, It might seem that you never have enough time to be alone together. However, it’s still important to make time for other relationships. These relationships will support both of you when the enlisted member is deployed.If one of you wants to go out with friends for the evening, remember that that’s perfectly healthy. Try to avoid feeling jealous of those relationships.
If you worry that your spouse is spending too much time with friends, find a way to talk about it without blaming or accusing them.

, Other military families know what you’re going through. They can relate. By developing relationships with other military spouses, you’ll build a community of support for when things are hard.If you have children, reach out to their parents’ friends. This is an especially good idea if you’re living on base.
You may be able to find a local support group, or an online forum for military spouses.

, Know that you and your spouse won’t always agree on everything. While there are certain compromises that must be made in a marriage, try to accept a certain amount of difference.Particularly when a spouse is deployed, your daily lives are very different. It is only natural that personal differences would be amplified during this time.
Trust each other to make decisions. Remember that just because one person is overseas doesn't mean they don't know what's going on at home.

, Unfortunately, it can be more difficult for the non-enlisted spouse to find a job. If you have young children at home, it may be extra hard to juggle working and finding childcare. However, employment is an important way to maintain a sense of independence.If you have a hard time finding a job or committing to something regularly, volunteer. There are many community organizations that are always in need of helping hands.
Try to find a job that gets you out of the house, so that you feel a sense of independence.

, It may not be what you want to hear, but turn off the cell phone, TV, and laptop when you’re alone. There are many distractions and disruptions that are part of military life. Try to keep a certain amount of time available for simply being present with each other.Of course, it’s okay to watch a movie together or listen to music while you’re spending time together. Just make sure you also leave space for quiet and conversation.
Just because a person's service is a 24/7 commitment, that doesn't have to mean they're focused on it all of the time. Phones, social media, and the news can be reminders of a person's military duty, which is why it's a good idea to turn them off sometimes.

, You may cook it together, or the civilian spouse may do the cooking before the other person comes home. However you distribute the labor, make sure that you are both present and available to sit down and eat together.You may want to arrange childcare during dinner once in awhile so that you can have a meal without having to also take care of the children.
Remember that when a spouse is deployed, eating together won't be an option. So savor the opportunities you have for this.

, Sweet gestures come in many forms. It may mean bringing home flowers or leaving a thoughtful note before going to work. When one spouse is deployed, a sweet gesture performed by either spouse can seem extra special. It shows that you're keeping each other in mind even though you're not together.You don’t need to perform these gestures every day. However, it’s nice to remember to be sweet on days other than birthdays and Valentine’s Day.
Don’t keep score. It’s lovely when a sweet gesture is reciprocated. However, if you’re only making the gesture to get something in return, you need to look at what’s motivating that.

, If your spouse is working long hours, it can be hard to stay awake late enough to have a good conversation when they get home. If they’re deployed overseas, their access to communication will be significantly limited. However, always do your best to stay in touch and check in with each other.


If it’s very difficult to find the time to talk, try setting a regular schedule. For example, “We sit down to talk every Wednesday night.” This can be difficult or impossible if one spouse is deployed, but you can do your best.

, Even if you’re feeling hurt or angry, always use “I” statements. That means you talk about your feelings without putting blame or judgement on your partner.For example, you can say, “I felt upset when you didn’t call yesterday,” instead of, “You never call when you say you’re going to.”
Another example is saying, “I felt angry that you chose to spend time with your friends instead of at home,” instead of “Your friends are more important to you than me.”

, We’re used to seeing photographs of ecstatic homecomings. It’s also the day the military spouses long for as soon as their loved one is deployed. However, there is often an adjustment period once the deployed spouse returns home. You'll need to talk about any surprises or discomforts that arise after the deployed spouse returns home.Most likely, the civilian spouse has taken on a lot of responsibility in the enlisted spouse’s absence. They may have a hard time relinquishing control over household duties and decision-making.
If the enlisted spouse has been in a combat situation, they could well be coming home with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this case, they should see a mental health professional as soon as possible.

, For many military members, there are things that they are not allowed to tell even their spouses. We’re taught that there should never be secrets in a marriage. However, in a military marriage, you must accept some secrets.The enlisted spouse might not be able to say where they’re going, or for how long, or what they’re doing there. They might never be allowed to disclose this information, even years later.

, If there is an important event coming up, the enlisted spouse must request the time off well in advance. Whether it’s a child’s birthday party or a graduation ceremony, the family is likely to be disappointed if efforts weren’t made to get that time off.Even with advance planning, remember that things may shift. You may be relocated thousands of miles away with little notice. That’s something neither of you has control over.

, Marriage is a lifelong commitment. It’s important to remember that when things get difficult. Part of making a lifelong commitment is committing to working through things together, rather than giving up.


Remind yourself and your spouse what value you saw in getting married. Talk to each other about the ideals you embraced as parts of your vows.
Being in the military should never be an excuse for staying in an unhappy marriage. If things are continually not working, it may be time to consider separation.

, This can mean plans for how the civilian spouse will keep themselves busy, but it should also mean plans for how the household will run. For example, who will provide childcare? What are the deployed spouse’s expectations for while they’re away?Your plan should include financial matters, such as how things will be paid for, as well as emotional matters, such as how often you feel you need to talk.
Be realistic. Putting too much pressure on the spouse who’s staying home can create an undue burden if the expectations aren’t realistic.

Keep yourself well-groomed.,
Get rid of worn out clothes.,
Keep your style updated.,
Consider hair removal.,
Get a new scent.",How to Impress Your Wife1," Women appreciate good grooming, so don't stop taking care of yourself just because you're married. Get your hair cut regularly and if you have any facial hair, make sure to keep it neatly trimmed.Personal hygiene is very important, so never get lax with it, no matter how comfortable you are with your wife.;
, One easy way to show your wife that you care about your appearance is to take the initiative to get rid of any clothes that are stained or torn. Don't wait for her to go through your closet and do this for you!Even if you don't have the time or energy to go through your closet, avoid wearing anything that is worn out or sloppy looking.

, You don't need to be a fashion model to impress your wife, but you should try to make sure your clothing is reasonably in style. Get rid of anything that is noticeably outdated or ill-fitting. Replace these items with garments that you think your wife will find attractive.If your wife has told you that you look good in a certain color, buy some clothes in that color. This is a subtle way of showing her that you value her advice.
If you know your wife hates a certain style, avoid wearing it, even if it's fashionable.
If your wife is stylish, she may enjoy the opportunity to help you pick out some new clothes, so ask for her advice.

, Many women do not like body hair, so if you have a lot of it, you may want to consider getting waxed. It will hurt for a moment, but it will be well worth it when your wife can't keep her hands off of your smooth skin., Your scent can complement your appearance, and can be a real turn-on for your wife. Consider try out a fragrance (or even a scented body wash) to make yourself more enticing to her.Consider asking for your wife's input when choosing a fragrance. She may have very strong preferences about scents.

Listen to your spouse.,
Encourage your spouse to let out emotion.,
Allow your spouse to be silent.,
Let your spouse grieve for as long as needed.",How to Help a Grieving Spouse1," Part of the grieving process is being able to talk about the deceased person and work through memories and feelings about that person. Be there for your spouse by listening to him or her talk about the deceased person. Don’t discourage your spouse not to talk about the person. Your spouse should focus on the good memories and the things he or she loved about the person.If your spouse starts talking about things he or she didn’t like about the person or bad memories, that’s okay, too. Let your spouse get it all out.
Tell your spouse, “I am here to listen if you want to talk about the person.”
Share your own memories about the person. Talking about the person with your spouse can help him or her remember the good things or work towards acceptance.;
, Going through the different emotions associated with grief is important. Never tell your spouse not to cry or show other emotions. Instead, encourage your spouse to let out his or her emotion. Your spouse may feel guilt or despair. Cry with your spouse if you can. If not, be there and let your spouse cry while you love and support him or her.Some people may get angry during the grief process. That is a normal part of grief. Don’t tell your spouse to calm down or stop being angry. Let him or her work through that emotion. Let your spouse yell if he or she needs to.
Fear of death or obsession about death is another common emotional response during the grieving process.
You may tell your spouse, “What you are feeling is valid. Let it out. I am here no matter what emotion you are feeling.”

, It’s okay if your spouse doesn’t want to talk. Sometimes, your spouse may just want to sit with you and not talk. You can still be there for your spouse even if he or she doesn’t want to talk. Support doesn’t always come in the form of words.You can sit with your spouse. Just having you near will provide comfort.
Touch your spouse. Hold his or her hand, squeeze his or her arm, or sit with your arm around his or her shoulders.
Offer hugs and offer to just hold your spouse for as long as he or she needs you to.

, Everyone grieves on a different schedule. Some people may ignore what has occurred and go on about their normal life for awhile after the death, and then one day weeks or months later they start to grieve. Other people may grieve immediately. Most people take between one and half to two years to fully grieve.Your spouse may take longer to grieve. That is okay. Don’t encourage your spouse to get over it or stop grieving. Don’t add extra stress on your spouse by making him or her feel like he or she has been grieving for too long. Let your spouse grieve at his or her own pace.

Ask your spouse to write down the same things for you.,
Ask for forgiveness.",How to Love Your Spouse Again," Instead of verbally criticizing your spouse, which is telling them exactly what you don’t like about them, replace it with feedback—sharing how their actions make you feel, whether anxious, embarrassed, uncared for, and so on.When someone knows precisely why their behavior is a problem—and they can relate to it since they probably have the same emotions—you are much more likely to get a civil response.


Make sure you share your feedback with a respectful demeanor, keeping sarcasm and anger out of your voice. You may want to practice forgiveness before each time you share feedback.
You should also take a mental step back from the relationship and determine that while your spouse isn’t 100% what you want, they are mostly good, which allows you to accept them unconditionally, in spite of the little things that irritate you.
When you sense a critical thought coming to your mind, arrest the thought and redirect it toward acceptance of your spouse as whole.;
, In order to help stop criticizing your spouse, you have to start looking for the good. Develop a positive reinforcement mindset—whenever you think of something negative about them, replace it with something you admire about them, and reward yourself for the effort. Rewards are proven to help us develop new habits and keep them.Reward yourself with something small, like a bit of chocolate, an episode of a show you like, or even a mini-break from a monotonous task.

, Physical affection is one of the clearest forms of communicating love and care. Studies show that even just a teacher giving a supportive tap on the back can compel students to volunteer twice as often. A massage from someone you love is likely to quell depression and even ease pain.Physical and verbal affection can communicate what your words don’t, helping to save a marriage.Do simple touches like a pat on the should when they do a good job, a small kiss on the forehead, or touch fingers.
Simple compliments communicate affection as well, like telling your wife she made a good dinner or sharing how happy something your husband did made you.

, Giving your spouse undivided attention is important for communicating value to them. If you or your spouse regularly watches TV while the other talks, or looks around the room or flips through the mail, or engages in any number of distractions while the other talks, then you aren’t really paying attention to them. Instead, focus on the other person’s eyes when they are talking.Focus on them when you realize they are sharing something with you.
Thank them when say supportive or complimentary things, as this shows that you heard them.
Show up with a gift of an item they recently mentioned wanting to have.

, Going along with paying attention is listening well. Active listening means that you wait until the other person is done talking and then give feedback—not necessarily trying to solve the problem. Share what they are saying by offering a story of an experience you had that was similar.


Make eye contact when they talk, or ask them to make eye contact with you when you talk.

, If you have been married for a long time, chances are that both of you have changed over the years, especially if you have children. Take some time to get to know them again. Ask them questions about their likes and dislikes. If they aren’t sure of what they like anymore, offer to take them somewhere like a restaurant to help them figure it out.


Make an effort to provide the things that you discover they like in gifts, at home, or on outings.

, Be intentional about being kind to each other. This may mean that you take stock of your interactions by recording them and playing them to back listen to how much you bicker. You can do things like making lists of what annoys you about each person and then write down how you usually respond. Determine to respond differently each time the other person does these 10 things.You can also be kind by serving the other person, such as cooking for them, assisting them with a project, or surprising them with things you know they like.
Choose not to be rude, critical, or other negative things.

, If you change your behavior without informing your spouse, you may find yourself full of expectations of change without the other person knowing why you are disappointed. Tell them your determination to change your marriage, and ask them for what you need as a husband or wife.


If you normally ignore your desires in an effort to put others first, try reversing this habit and expressing what you want before others do.

, In effort to get to know your spouse if you have been together for a long time, you could try pretending like you’re in a new relationship. Start going on dates and asking basic questions. You might be surprised to learn that their favorite color has changed or that their favorite food hasn’t been spaghetti for years now.If you still have kids that need a babysitter, don’t be afraid to hire one.
You may want to set up a weekly dating routine so that you are sure to date your spouse in the midst of a busy life.

, As part of your new dating plan, try new things. Go places you and your spouse have never been, especially a place one of you has always wanted to go. Try new activities in your town, or trips to other cities or countries. Creating new rituals with a romantic basis can cultivate feelings of love.You can use the strategy of doing new things to surprise your spouse with something they’ve always wanted to do.

, Think about the time when you were dating, when you didn’t have any criticisms of each other and accepted each other unconditionally. Talk about your first date, your favorite dates, how pretty your wedding was, and think about all the times you held hands and did fun things together. Connecting your memories with how you felt can help you feel those emotions again., When you were remembering the early days of your relationship, you might have thought about things you used to do together but stopped because life got busy. Re-create your first date, or meet with friends you haven’t seen together in a long time.


Doing things that you used to do when you felt strong emotion for your spouse can remind you what it felt like and help you feel it again.

, You may have lost love for your spouse because of something they did that made you deeply angry. They only way to resume loving your spouse after feeling such anger is to forgive them. Start by writing down the thing(s) they have done that make you angry.


This might be something big, like an affair or betrayal, or a bunch of small things, like ignoring you, lying to you, etc.
Writing them down helps you to see your thoughts and organize them so that you don’t have to think about them anymore.

, The same things that make you angry probably have also hurt you, but you can get hurt without getting angry. Write another list with all the things you can think of that your spouse has done (or not done) that has hurt your feelings. You can tell it is something that has hurt you if it creates an emotional response when you think of it.


Again, these things might be big, like cheating on you, or they can be a bunch of small things, like forgetting an anniversary, not helping you around the house, etc.

, Now that you have your lists, it is time to let go of your anger, hurt, and pain by extending forgiveness to your spouse. This is usually an ongoing process (and can involve many tears), so you may want to enlist the help of a trusted loved one or counselor/therapist to help you through your list.


There can be a lot of reasons why you have a hard time forgiving, and studying them can help you let go of anger., Chances are that your spouse has a lot of negativity built up towards you, just as you have towards them. Ask your spouse to write down the things you have done to hurt and anger them. You don’t have to ask them to forgive you at this point, just have them look at the things in your marriage that are causing them harm.

, Repent to your spouse for the things on their list, and ask them to forgive you. Repentance means that you choose to walk in the opposite direction, so you are agreeing to stop doing the things that have hurt and angered your spouse.This does not mean that you will be able to suddenly cease behaviors that you have been doing for years, and neither will your spouse. You should both have grace for each other through this process.

Get some quality time together.,
Appreciate his strengths.,
Embrace his weaknesses.,
Make each other better people.,
Understand marriage.,
Give him the chance to wow you.,
Imagine your future and make it happen.,
Don't expect him to be your whole life.",How to Love Your Husband1," You have to really know someone if you're going to truly love them, so make sure that the two of you get some quality time together. This means talking to each other! Talk about things that are important to you. Talk about significant matters (like religion and politics). Talk about your hopes, dreams, and goals for the future. This will help you understand who your husband really is, and let him understand the same of you.


Tell your husband that you want some quality time with him and why! This will help him understand why it's important.
Try going for a leisurely drive or a walk somewhere, in order to get time to talk together, especially if you feel like you can't talk at home.;
, Everyone has something that they're good at or something that makes them incredible and unique. Find this aspect of your husband and love him for it. There are lots of good reasons to love a person.


Maybe your husband is a good provider. Maybe he's got a great sense of humor. Maybe he's affectionate and loyal. Maybe he's really smart. Driven? Good at this job?

, Your husband is human, not a god, so expect there to be some flaws. We all have them. You too! However, when we love someone...really love them...we embrace those flaws. We love them not despite their weaknesses but because of them. Just like he will love you for who you are, you must love him for who he really is.


Maybe your husband is too talkative...but this can be an endearing quality. Maybe he's a bit messy...but he's your messy husband.

, This is the whole point of marriage: we work together to get through life and make each other better, more fulfilled people. You should also encourage each other to pursue the things you've always dreamed of and become the people you've always wanted to be. You will always be your husband's biggest advocate and he will always be yours...so cheer each other on!


Help him to really shape up and look more impressive, so that he can get that promotion at work.
Let him help you work on that bad nail-biting habit!

, Marriage isn't some romantic comedy movie. Those always end with the couple getting together. They don't show that marriage is really a lot of hard work. It's about butting heads sometimes and going through really difficult situations. Don't hold out in your heart for some guy that sweeps you off your feet and feeds you strawberries while he sings you a song he wrote. Appreciate that your husband will be the one who comforts you when your mother dies or helps you raise wonderful children. Marriage is a partnership, not an empty bouquet of roses.

, If you close your heart to your husband, you may be missing out on a truly fantastic man that will make you happier than you ever thought. Notice when he does sweet things for you and give him more opportunities to show you just how incredible he is.


Let him know that you like it when he's romantic. Maybe all he needs is an invitation!

, Imagine the future that you and your husband have together. Think about all of the wonderful things that the two of you could share in the future. Then, throw yourself into making those dreams come true. Whether it's saving up money for your child's college fund or making your home into a place you'll both be happy to retire to, this can help you see the bright future for yourself, rather than your current cloud of doubts.

, If you want to be a happy, fulfilled person, you need to rely on more than just your husband for your happiness. You're your own person! This means that you need to take things into your own hands in some parts of your life. If you feel unfulfilled, don't be too quick to blame it on your husband.


Try pursuing the career you always wanted or going back to school.
You can also try picking up a hobby that excites your passions but not his. This will give you a chance to have fun and also give him a break to relax.

If you treat your spouse like his opinions don’t really matter or like you always have the final say, then you’re bound to have an imbalance in your marriage. Make sure that you give your spouse’s views the same seriousness that you give your own and that you take the time to listen to your spouse and make him feel like you care.Work to be kind, loving, and understanding to your spouse. If you’re having a bad day and snap at him, make sure you apologize; give him the basic respect he deserves instead of thinking you can do whatever you want because you’re married.
You should also respect your spouse’s privacy. Don’t go snooping through his phone or computer if you expect him to feel respected.;
, If you care about your spouse and want to have a healthy and productive relationship, then you should avoid getting hung up on past mistakes you both made or keep reminding your spouse of his failures; instead, work on reinforcing positive behavior, enjoying your present time together, and thinking of all you have to look forward to. If you really care about your spouse, then you will be considerate of his feelings and won’t bring up the past just to get a reaction out of him.


Though it’s not always easy to let go of the past, you shouldn’t bring it up out of spite. Remember that your spouse is a living, breathing person too and that you shouldn’t bring up the past just to hurt him.

, Listening is one of the best ways to be considerate toward your spouse. Don’t just zone out when your spouse is talking about his day or wait for him to finish talking so you can say what you want to say; make an effort to really hear him out and to care about what he’s telling you. When you’re having a real conversation, put away your phone, make eye contact, and be considerate enough to really listen.


Of course, we all zone out from time to time. If that happens during a conversation, don’t pretend like you’re following; apologize and figure out what your spouse was really saying.
Ask your spouse questions to show that you really do care; you don’t want him to feel like he’s boring you.
Sometimes, all your spouse needs after a hard day is for someone to listen to him. You don’t have to feel compelled to give advice all the time.

, Though you don’t need to make your life revolve completely around your spouse, you have to remember that when you and your spouse decided to get married, you wanted to be a priority in each other’s lives. You should make sure to honor that decision and to make all of your big decisions with your spouse in mind, making sure that you try to do what’s best for you as well as for the person you are married to.


If your family or friends aren’t getting along with your spouse, don't take sides against your spouse, even if you think that your spouse is being unreasonable ; make sure you’re considerate of your spouse’s feelings and that you give him the love and support he deserves.

, If you want your marriage to be a happy one, then communication is key. You and your partner should be able to talk graciously to each other about your thoughts—especially about things for the two of you to agree upon or do together. Doing this daily helps foster communication and maintain trust between partners to keep your marriage healthy and strong.


Never say things in anger intentionally meaning to hurt your partner. Cruel words you said but didn't mean may be hard for your spouse to forget—they can cause lasting damage to your relationship. If you do end up saying something you don’t mean, make sure you apologize.
When arguing, keep to the subject and don't personally attack your partner.
In order to have strong communication, you have to be aware of your partner’s thoughts and moods even before you have a conversation. You should be able to read your partner’s body language and expression to be able to tell whether something is wrong and to feel comfortable bringing it up.

, If your partner trusted you with something very private and important, then you shouldn’t undermine that trust by reporting it to someone else just because you didn’t really think about it. If it was something painful and personal, then don’t use it as ammunition during an argument, or your partner will be betrayed. Be considerate of the fact that your partner trusted you with important information and make sure to honor that trust.


You should be the person your spouse trusts more than anyone in the world. Don’t do anything to jeopardize that trust. If you do make a mistake, make sure to apologize for it.

, If you sense that something is wrong with your partner, take time to embrace him and ask what's the matter—maybe that's the time he or she needs your attention the most. Don't ignore that opportunity. If your partner isn’t ready to talk, then you don’t have to push it and make things worse, but you should show that you’ll be there when he is ready and willing to open up.


If you and your partner are out in a social setting and you notice that something isn’t quite right, don’t ask about it in front of everyone; pull your partner aside to show that you’re really paying attention.

, Don’t ever think that you don’t have to say “I love you” because your partner should already know how you feel. Make an effort to tell your partner how much you love him or her at least once or twice a day and make sure you slow down, look your partner in the eyes, and say it like you really mean it. Don’t just say “Love ya!” as you leave the house or say “love you” in a text message—take the time to let your partner know how much he really means to you, in person.


Making this small effort to say these three sacred words can make a big difference in your relationship.
Don’t just say these words because you want something or because you’re making up after a fight; say them just because you truly feel them. That’s when it means the most.

, Making this effort to be affectionate when you start your day can lead you to feel more loving toward each other for the rest of the day. Though you may want to get started with your morning coffee and grooming routine, just spending a few minutes hugging, kissing, or cuddling your spouse can help you start the day off on the right foot. If you don’t see each other all day, then this affectionate gesture can make a lasting impression until you see each other again.


Taking the time to kiss your partner for just six seconds in the morning can spark the passion in your relationship. Don’t just give him a perfunctory “Bye, honey” kiss on the cheek; make sure you mean it, even if you’re in a rush.

, As your relationship progresses, you will find that there will be more and more obligations that will keep you from having time alone. However, you should make sure to get that time alone every week, even if you have to sacrifice some time with friends or family to make it happen. Remember that hanging out at your friend’s birthday party or at a barbecue at your parents’ house isn’t the same as just spending time alone together.If you feel like your schedules have been insanely busy and you haven’t had time alone together, then you should try to steal even a few minutes of your spouse’s time, whether you go for a quick walk together during a family outing or spend some time alone at a party.
As for your dates, make sure you plan those well ahead of schedule, so you and your spouse know to keep your schedules clear for those dates.

, Make sure to hug, touch, reassure, kiss, hold, or just be near your partner as much as you can. That physical connection can help keep your relationship strong and can make you feel close to each other, even if you’re not always on the same page. If you grow distant or cold and don’t even sit near your partner when you’re on the couch together, your relationship will grow distant, too.


Not everyone likes to be touched the same amount, especially not in public. Even if you’re not a big hugger, or a PDA person, make sure you give your partner reassuring touches at the right moment as much as you can.
It goes without saying that maintaining a healthy sex life can also help your relationship flourish. Be open and honest with your partner about exploring what you like and don't like.

, Whether it’s giving your partner a kiss on the hand, doing chores for him when he’s having a busy week, or leaving a sweet note on the mirror before you leave for work, you should never stop doing the little things, no matter how tired you are or how comfortable you feel in the relationship. You should never get lazy when it comes to your marriage and make sure to always make your partner feel special and loved.


If you’ve been too busy to do some of the usual things you do for your partner, try to make up for it when you have a bit more time. Let your partner know that you’re aware that you haven’t been as attentive as usual and that you want to make up for it.

, Make sure your partner knows how much you appreciate the little everyday things he does, like doing the washing up or making the bed. Don’t take those things for granted and tell your partner that you really do love and appreciate him and are grateful for all of the help he gives you. Of course, you can also respond by doing things that make your partner appreciate you in return.


You can even write your partner a love note thanking him for all of the things he’s done for you, from taking care of the dog while you’ve been sick to planning the most amazing birthday party ever for you.

, This will make the moment even more special. Gifts need not be extravagant or painfully expensive. It is always the thought that counts. A little something to create warmth and sweet memories can go a long way. Pay attention to your partner to hear what he’s been wanting and to get that unexpected gift for him at the right time.


Though special occasions, such as birthdays or anniversaries, can be a great time to give a gift, sometimes the most thoughtful gifts of all are given just because. Then your spouse won’t feel like you gave a gift just because you were obligated to do so.

, If your husband has had a busy week, then you should be understanding of that and spend more time cooking or doing work around the house. When you’re having a hectic time, he should do the same for you. Though you should find a balance of work that makes sense for both of you, if you care for your spouse, you should make an extra effort when he really needs you most.


Your spouse may even deny that he needs extra help, but if you can see that he is stressed out and overwhelmed, make the effort to cook, take care of the dog, or run some basic errands that week.

, You may think that you and your partner need to do absolutely everything together in order to live a happily married life. However, if you really want to maintain your bond, then you have to keep up some level of independence. If you and your partner do absolutely everything together and have no time to develop your own interests, then you are likely to become codependent and to lose a sense of your own identities.If you both spend time pursuing your own hobbies and interests, then you’ll continue and grow as people. You don’t want to be the exact same person you are now twenty years from now, do you?
Plus, if you and your spouse spend more time apart, then you’ll be able to appreciate the time you spend together more. It’s easier to take each other for granted when you’re always together.
You don’t have to bring your spouse along every time you hang out with your friends just because you’re married. Though you both should be integrated in each other’s social lives, it’s important to make time for “guy time” or “girl time” too, so you continue to build your friendships and your support network.

, If you want your marriage to last, then you have to keep making an effort to be romantic. While things will change after you’ve been with your spouse for a long time or when you have children together, you should still make an effort to make each other feel special, to have date nights, and to keep courting each other long after you’ve said your vows. This can help keep your marriage feeling exciting, sexy, and fun. Here are some things you can do:


Make sure to keep up with your date nights. Whether you have a date night every week or every other week, keep your dates with your spouse and make sure you don’t do the same old thing every time.
Find time for romance even when you’re at home. Whether you’re watching a romantic comedy or making dinner together with candles lit everywhere, it’s important to keep things feeling exciting even when you’re just at home from time to time.
Try writing each other really meaningful cards each year on your anniversary. Take the time to really write down all of the reasons why you love your spouse.
It can be romantic simply to keep your relationship feeling fresh and spontaneous. Going away on a last-minute weekend trip, signing up for a dance class on a whim, or opening that nice bottle of fancy wine you’ve been saving forever without planning for it can make your relationship feel very romantic and exciting.

, If you really want your relationship to last, then you have to learn to compromise and to make sacrifices for each other when it’s necessary. Your relationship won’t always be fun and easy, and there will be times when you need to sit down and have a serious conversation about what to do next. Whether you’re deciding where to live, when to have children, or making career decisions that affect you as a family, it’s important that you and your spouse have strong communication and know what your needs are before you make a decision.


Whether you’re making a big decision or a small one, you should make sure that both of you get to tell your sides of the story before a decision is made.
Listening is important. Let your spouse express his feelings without interrupting or disagreeing with him. Make sure you hear him out before you say what’s on your mind.
When it comes to compromising, it’s important to remember that it’s often better to be happy than to be right. Ask yourself whether you really want what you’re fighting for, or if you’re just being stubborn; that said, you want to make sure that you both make compromises for each other.

, As you and your spouse move forward in your relationship, it’s important that you can integrate your families and friends into your marriage and everyday lives. Though you don’t have to be the best of friends with each other’s families or to love every single one of each other’s friends, you should work to make it feel like your families are part of one big family, and like your friends are turning into mutual friends. This can help your marriage feel more secure and can make you both feel like you have a strong support network when you need it.


If you love your spouse, then you have to make an effort to love his family and his friends. If he has a particularly challenging family or group of friends, then do your best to understand where they are coming from and talk to your spouse about how you can build a stronger relationship with them without putting them down.

, If you want your marriage to last, then you have to be there when your spouse is going through a rough patch instead of waiting for it to blow over. Whether he’s dealing with a death in the family or doubting his career choices, it’s important that you’re supportive and understanding during this difficult time, knowing that your spouse will do the same for you when you’re having a hard time. You can’t expect your spouse to be in a good mood all the time, and you should make sure to be supportive when he needs you.


Of course, if you get into a pattern where one spouse is always supporting the other, that can get a bit frustrating and exhausting. If you feel like you’re always in the supportive role, talk about what your spouse can do to help you feel more like an individual.

, If you want to live a happy married life, then you have to understand that not every day will be a walk in the park. This doesn’t mean that you should expect marriage to be drab, dark, and disappointing, but it does mean that you should be prepared for the fact that there will be some struggles, some days of unhappiness, and some days when you just can’t even be in the same room as your spouse. It’s perfectly normal not to get along 100% of the time, and what’s most important is that you both know that and are willing to put in the work.


If you expect your marriage to be perfectly blissful every day, then you’re just setting yourself up for disappointment.
Remember that your spouse has flaws, just like you do. If you expect perfection, then you’ll only get sad or bitter. If your spouse has flaws you’d like him to work on, such as always being late, then have an honest, open conversation about it, and be willing to change the bad habits you can change, too.

, As the years go on, it’s likely that the person you’re married to won’t be exactly the same as the person you said “I do” to all those years ago. People change, gather knowledge and wisdom, and learn from their experiences as the years go on; they may even change their perspective on a number of things, from their thoughts on having children to their political affiliations. If you want to have a healthy marriage, then you have to accept that both you and your spouse will naturally change over the years; the important thing is that you grow together, not apart.


Be understanding of the ways in which your spouse is changing. If you feel that there are problems and he or she is turning into a person you don’t quite know anymore, then make sure you talk about it.
As you grow older, while it’s important to continue your own personal journey, it can also help you to develop interests together. Whether you like cooking together, following your favorite sports team, or watching the same shows year after year, it’s important to find a routine that can give you something to look forward to as a couple.
What matters most is that you and your spouse continue to love each other and be understanding of the fact that you will both go through ups and downs in your lives; if you’re true partners, then you’ll both grow into stronger, more capable, and more loving people.

Be there to listen.,
Be chivalrous.,
Plan dates around her interests.,
Do something sweet on special occasions.,
Help her out around the house.",How to Impress Your Wife2," Letting your wife know how much you care is a simple gesture that can go a long way. Every now and then, take a moment away from your busy lives and tell her how happy she makes you or how much you love being married to her.Be sure to switch it up. Telling her the exact same thing multiple times can feel rote and insincere.

, Your wife may need to vent sometimes, and it's important for you to be available to listen when she needs you. This will show her that you care about whatever is going on in her life and want to help however you can.Sometimes your wife may want your advice, but other times she may just want you to listen to her. If you're not sure what she needs, ask her.

, It's easy to get out of the habit of acting chivalrous after you have been married for a while, but your wife may really miss it! Try opening a door for your wife or pulling a chair out for her, just to show her that you care.Not all women appreciate chivalry, so be responsive to her feedback. If she seems annoyed when you open doors for her, stop doing it.

, It's not only important to keep going out on dates with your wife to keep the romance alive, but also to make sure that you consider what your wife is interested in when planning those dates. This will show her that you pay attention to her interests and want to get involved in them, which she will find very impressive.If you want to go out to dinner, be sure to think about your wife's favorite cuisines.
Dinner dates are great, but they can get a little predictable. If your wife has hobbies, find a way to incorporate those into your next date night (or day). For example, you could go on a kayaking date or take an art class together.

, Always remember important dates, including your wife's birthday, your anniversary, and Valentine's Day. When these dates come around, always have a little something special up your sleeve to keep your wife on her toes.The way you celebrate these occasions will depend on a variety of factors, including your wife's personal preferences and your budget.

Even little things like making the bed can make a big difference.If you're not sure what to do, ask your wife what would be most helpful.

, If you want to show your wife your intellectual side, consider taking an academic course together or starting your own two-person book club. This will give you the opportunity to have scholarly conversations and show her just how smart you are.Make sure she will enjoy the topic or the book. She may not find your intelligence that impressive if she finds the subject boring.
Avoid showing off your intelligence too much. It's important to give her the opportunity to contribute to the discussion as well, or else she won't find it enjoyable.

, Your wife will always appreciate a delicious home-cooked meal. Whether you're a seasoned chef or a culinary newbie, get into the kitchen and try your best at preparing her a meal she will love.If you've never cooked before, your wife will be impressed that you are trying, so don't feel like you need to start with something complicated.

, Ambition can be very attractive. Show your wife how talented and driven you are by going after what you want in life and achieving your goals. This may mean starting a business, applying for a promotion, or sending that novel you've been working on out to publishers.

Provide love and support.,
Avoid trite cliches.,
Acknowledge the death.,
Do everyday tasks for your spouse.,
Spend time with your spouse.",How to Help a Grieving Spouse2," The most important thing you can do for your spouse when he or she is grieving is to be there with love and support. Even if you are unsure how to be there for your spouse or you are scared you will upset him or her even more, you can show love and understanding.It’s natural to be afraid that you might upset your spouse. That’s okay. Get upset if you are upset. It may be comforting to your spouse to know that you are grieving or upset, too.
Tell your spouse, “I love you. Let me know what I can do to help you. I am here for you.”

, When people are unsure about what to say to someone, they sometimes fall back to cliches and tired phrases. When someone is grieving, people often say, “She’s in a better place” or “He is at peace.” You might feel like saying, “He had a long, great life” or something similar. Although these phrases may be true, refrain from telling them to your spouse.You should also avoid reminding your spouse of what he or she should be thankful for.Don’t tell your spouse to move on and stop thinking about the death. That may make your spouse feel like he or she is forgetting the person.
You may feel like these phrases are comforting, but they may feel empty to your spouse and cause him or her irritation.
Instead, say things like, “I’m sorry you have lost someone who means something to you.”

, Don’t ignore the death or avoid talking about it around your spouse. Denial won’t help your spouse with the grieving process. Stepping around around the issues on eggshells and ignoring it will only make your spouse feel isolated.Instead, acknowledge the death. For example, you can say, “I know that your loved one has died” or “I’m sorry that your loved one has died. That’s a difficult thing to deal with.”
By mentioning the death to your spouse, you let your spouse know that he or she can talk to your about the death. Use words like “death” or “died.” Softer terms like “gone” or “not here any longer” is another evasion. Don’t be harsh or cruel, but be honest and direct.

, Your spouse may go through a time where he or she cannot do his or her normal tasks due to grief or depression. Your spouse may not ask for help, may say he or she doesn’t need help if asked, or may not realize he or she needs help. You can offer help without your spouse having to ask.For example, you can offer to do the grocery shopping, make dinner, mow the lawn, or pay the bills if your spouse usually does these things.

, Talking about the grief is not the only way you can help your spouse. You can also help your spouse by doing normal or recreational activities with him or her. Take your spouse grocery shopping with you or have him or her help you make dinner. Encourage your spouse to help you with light house cleaning tasks, making sure not to expect more than he or she can do.You can also take your spouse for a walk or on a picnic.
Take your spouse out for a nice dinner and a movie.
Do a fun activity at home, like playing a game or renting a movie.

Realize that everyone grieves differently.,
Recognize the five stages of grief.,
Offer to go to a grief support group with your spouse.,
Watch for warning signs.",How to Help a Grieving Spouse3," Everyone has felt grief due to the loss of a loved one before, so you are able to understand what your spouse is going through. However, your spouse may deal with the grieving process differently than you did or in ways you don’t understand. That’s okay and perfectly normal.Avoid using phrases like, “I know what this feels like.”
Don’t get too worried or freaked out if your spouse goes through the grieving process in a different and unfamiliar way than you. There is not one right way to grieve.
If your spouse is a different gender, then remember that people of different genders may react to grief and loss in extremely different ways. If your spouse is the same gender, you still may find that your spouse approaches it differently.Some people may be vocal and outwardly emotional, others may keep it inside. Help your spouse no matter how he or she approaches the grieving process.

, There are five common stages of grief that people go through. Not everyone goes through these stages in the same order, and they may not spend long on each stage or may skip it entirely. Every grieving process is slightly different, but the general guidelines for the five stages are:Denial and isolation
Anger
Bargaining
Depression
Acceptance

, You can suggest that your spouse go to a grief support group or offer to join him or her at a support group. Grief support groups can help your spouse get through really tough times by connecting with others going through similar situations. You and your spouse may learn some grief management techniques during your meetings.Don’t force your spouse to go to grief counseling. Not everyone needs it or is open to going. If your spouse isn’t open to the idea, leave it.
You should only urge your spouse to get help if he or she is exhibiting the signs of serious depression or has suicidal thoughts. If your spouse is suicidal, you should contact a suicide hotline for help.

, The grieving process entails many different emotions. Your spouse will not only feel angry, guilty, scared, or upset, but he or she may be depressed, confused, disconnected, or overly anxious. This should start to dissipate as the person goes through the grieving process. However, a person who has experience grief may end up with a serious grief management disorder, like complicated grief, or clinical depression. If you think your spouse has complicated grief or clinical depression, encourage him or her to get help. The signs of clinical depression include:Difficulty getting through daily tasks
Obsession with death or excessive talk of death and suicide, especially an obsession with the loved one's death
Substance abuse
Lack of enjoyment of life or ability to think of positive times with the dead loved one
Strong feelings of anger, guilt, or bitterness
Withdrawing from everyone and life in general or feelings of numbness
Hopelessness
Obsessive focus on reminders of the loved one or obsessive avoidance of reminders of the loved one
Inability to trust others

Start back at square one.,
Go on dates again.,
Change the routine.,
Pick up a new hobby together.,
Challenge each other.,
Put in the effort again.,
Lead by example.",How to Love Your Husband2," When you want to fall back in love with your husband, sometimes the best route is to start back at square one: getting to know each other all over again. We change as we get older and go through different experiences in our lives and sometimes we get too focused on who we or our husband used to be. You need to be in love with each other as you are now!


It is very important to remember that it's normal, if you've been together for a long time, for him to have evolved into a different person. People really do change! If you're really right for each other, you'll be willing to love this new person too.
Go on a first date again. Introduce yourselves. Talk about the kind of things you would talk about on a first date. Talk about your experiences over the last few years and how you think you've changed. Talk about what you want for the future. And be honest!

, When we're on dates, we're putting in the effort all over again. We want that person to love us! We're more romantic and more likely to look at each other with a new pair of eyes. Go on dates again and make it a regular thing.


Just make sure you don't make the date itself regular. Don't go to the same place, eat the same foods, or do the same activities. Just like you wouldn't like a new boyfriend to think you're boring, you don't want to create this image in your husband's mind either.

, You eat the same thing for dinner on different nights of the week. Do the same thing every Saturday afternoon. Before you know it, your whole life runs like clockwork: from when you schedule your book club to when you have sex. That's no way to let romance into your life. It's boring. By breaking away from routine and constantly endeavoring to keep your life exciting, you'll find new things to love about each other and new memories that you can share.

, A new hobby is a great way to get the two of you doing something new and exciting, while also giving you something to bond over and share. When you're excited about something together, it's very effective at creating love and positive feelings. You can try:


Geocaching
Pottery
Learning a new language
Curating a wikiHow category!

, One of the great things about marriage is that we can work together to become better people. We can help each other achieve our dreams of what we want for ourselves. Sometimes, we forget to provide that for each other though. If you want to reawaken your love for each other, work on challenging each other to be better people and pursue the things you've always wanted.


For example, if your husband has been plugging away at a novel for years, help him to set aside one night a week where he can work on writing without interruption.
Maybe you both have been wanting to get in shape. Work together to develop a workout routine and motivate each other to stick to it and meet your goals.

, You should both try to put in the same effort through your entire marriage that you put into dating. When we stop acting like the other person is worth the effort, they start to feel like that's what we really think. If you stopped trying to look nice for each other every now and again, it's time to start back up. If you stopped trying to look sexy for each other, turn up the heat. If you stopped trying to woo each other, make your most romantic mix tape ever.

, If your husband sees you stepping it up, he'll be inclined to do the same. Of course, you can always talk to each other to try to get your husband back up to snuff, but positive change really goes both ways. Be the bigger person and be willing to start the chain.


For example, you can get dressed up and ask him out on a date. He'll be so wowed, he'll feel like he has to out-do you and be even more impressive with his date offering next time!

Have faith.,
Know when it's time to quit.,
Constantly communicate.,
Address major concerns.,
Stop keeping score.,
Be an adult.,
Funnel your energy into something productive.",How to Love Your Husband3," You need to believe that even when your husband hurts your feelings or does something wrong, it is usually not malicious. People don't usually do hurtful or annoying things for the sake of being annoying or hurtful. They do things because they're not thinking or because they think they're doing the right thing. Try to give him the benefit of the doubt before getting really angry.

, That said, your husband might do something hurtful on purpose or might not care about you enough to work on problems. Sometimes, we marry people who aren't who we think they are. You need to recognize when you shouldn't be loving your husband and solving your problems....you should be getting away as fast as you can! If your husband is mainly leaving a negative impact on your life, it's time to hightail it out of there.


If your husband is violent with you, you need to seek help. His violence is never your fault and you need to do whatever is necessary to protect yourself and your children. There is no excuse for violence.
The same can be said for emotional abuse. If you husband is constantly insulting you and making you feel trapped and worthless, you deserve better.
If you need advice, call the National Domestic Abuse Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. If you're from outside the US, go to http://www.hotpeachpages.net/ to find resources for your area.

, When your husband does something to hurt your feelings, say so. When you feel like he's ignoring your needs, tell him that. If you don't tell your husband that something is wrong, he might never know. But in the mean time, the more you keep those hurt feelings bottled up, the more you're going to grow angry with your husband and maybe even hate him.

, If he does something very serious, like cheating on you, you need to sit down with him and talk through the situation. Even if it's something smaller, like continually ignoring his half of the chores, it's important to sit down and lay out what went wrong and how the two of you can work together to make things better in the future.


In some cases, like with the cheating, the answer might be that you're not really good for each other and that you might be better people without this marriage. However, sometimes big problems can be worked through. Each situation is different.

, When your husband does something to make you mad, don't add it to the list in your mind. Don't save it to use as ammo later when you do something to make him mad. This isn't productive and it just leads you to cling to negative feelings. It may even make problems seem bigger than they really are. Instead, let small, unimportant problems and deal with bigger problems when they happen.

, Even if your husband can be petty and childish sometimes, don't stoop to his level. Acting childish and being really hurtful will only lead you to do things that you regret. You'll find, before you know it, that your relationship makes you into a person you don't like and it will escalate the conflicts that you do have with your husband.


Don't sling out insults, like calling him an idiot in the middle of an argument.
Don't do petty things, like ""forgetting"" to do the dishes until it's his week to do them.
Don't use sex for blackmail. Ever. Really bad idea.

, When you do have problems with your husband and you're all fired up and angry, find a more productive use of that energy. Instead of yelling at him or exploding, work really hard to team up with him to find a solution. Use that anger to power a real change in your relationship and how you treat each other, turning it into a positive force in your marriage. This way you get release while also solving the problems that you have.

Think about what attracted her to you and how you might've changed over the years. It can be easy to lose the spark after many years of marriage, but you need to think about whether or not you're actively making her unhappy in your marriage. Maybe she does things that drive you crazy, but try to think about what you could do to make things better for her.;
, Tell your wife that you realize the two of you are in a rut and you want to make things better. Ask her what you could do to change the course you are both on. Let her know that you want to invest in your marriage and that you are ready to change if necessary.

, If you and your wife seem to be fighting a lot, it might be a good idea to go to couples counseling together. Find a counselor that you are both comfortable with and start attending sessions. This can be a great way to talk about your problems with the help of a mediator that makes you both feel safe enough to talk about your feelings. They can also recommend methods and activities to practice at home to help you both improve your relationship and renew your levels of intimacy.

, Think about all of the things your wife does for you and write them down. Seeing them all lined up together might surprise you. Include things like household chores, running errands, working to make money for your family, etc. But also remember to include little things that are easier to take for granted like paying the cable bill every month so you don't have to remember to do it or replacing the batteries in your alarm clock so you won't be late for work.


Then think about all the things you do for your wife and how you might add to that list. Write them all down and try to remember to do them every day. Include things like starting a load of laundry or letting her pick what television show you watch together.

, Communication is the key to a healthy marriage. So often we take each other for granted and get lost in the monotony of everyday life. Ask your wife how her day was and really listen to her answer. Look her in the eye when she speaks to you so she knows she has your full attention.Don't interrupt her while she is speaking, and wait until she is done to respond. Let her vent to you about things she is upset about instead of always trying to fix her problems., It is quite possible that your wife does more for you than you realize. It's easy to get caught up in the routine of daily life and just expect that your wife will make dinner or clean the house or get the kids ready for bed - because she always does. Sometimes a simple thank you can make all the difference for a woman. It's important for her to feel appreciated and to know that you recognize all of the things she does for you and your family.

, Surprise your wife by making dinner or take over vacuuming the living room for her. Offer to do all the grocery shopping this week. Tell your wife that you want to be in charge of getting the kids ready for bed since she always gets them ready for school in the morning. Show your wife that you don't expect her to do everything by herself and that you are more than willing to help out.Doing all of the household chores might make you appreciate more all that she does for you.

, Offer to watch the kids for a day while your wife goes shopping. Or encourage her to have dinner with her girlfriends. Or even just offer to do the dishes so she can take a bath. Let your wife know that you think she does a great job and that she deserves a break from all of the hustle and bustle of her life. Everyone needs time to relax and providing that for your wife will let her know how much you care.

, No two marriages are alike. You need to think about your marriage and decide if there are any problems in particular that you could fix - problems that go beyond things like making your wife feel more appreciated and loved.

, If you have given your wife reason to question your behavior in the past, overcorrect your behavior now. Trust is a necessary component of a lasting marriage, so you need to let your wife know she can trust you. Go out of your way to let her know where you are, give her access to your phone and email, invite her out with you and your friends. Basically, do whatever she needs you to do so that she can trust you again. And then, do a little bit more than that.

, A separation is just a hop away from a divorce. It's better to deal with marriage problems together, rather than from separate spaces. If you start living apart, you might not see each other every day and the distance between you will grow. It's also easier to picture your life without the person, rather than feeling obligated to work hard and fix the problem, when you remove yourself from your marriage situation.


Whatever you do, don't help her pack her bags if she wants to leave. You might think you're trying to be nice by helping her, but she might interpret it as you encouraging her to go.

, Shared experiences are a great way to build intimacy between people.So, if you feel like you and your spouse are drifting apart, plan a fun activity that you've both never done before. Take tennis lessons together or hike to a new location. Try some weird new Sushi restaurant or get a tattoo. Doing something exciting and new together will help you both feel a connection that will rekindle the fire of your relationship.

, Spending quality time together is so important for a marriage. Try to have a date night every week or once a month. Get a babysitter and leave the kids at home. Go to the movies or get a hotel for the evening. Take a weekend trip to the beach or pick her up for lunch on your lunch break. Make it a point to show her that you love her and that you want to spend time with her, not just because she is your wife and you live together, but because you actually enjoy her company.

, After years of marriage, you may feel like you know everything about your spouse, but you'd be wrong. Try asking them get to know you questions like you did when you were first dating.You might be surprised by the answers. Ask her what clothes of yours she likes the best and what her favorite part of the day is. Ask her what items are still on her ""bucket list"" or what food she's never tried because she was too scared. People change over time and sometimes we forget to notice. Take some time to get to know your wife and the person she is now.

, While sex is a very important part of any marriage, it is also important to engage in nonsexual touching with your spouse.This helps you both feel connected and loved throughout the day. Try to hold your wife's hand, even if it's just for a moment. Cuddle on the couch while you watch TV. Put your hand on her leg while you're driving to the store. Any physical touch, no matter how small, lets your wife know that you are thinking about her and that she makes you happy.

It is not uncommon to see people wearing shades like dark gray or navy blue to a funeral. If you choose not to wear black, make sure you select a dark and somber color for your outfit.Stick to dark, neutral shades if you opt for something other than black. Navy-blues, dark grays, dark greens, and browns are all good shades.
However, make sure you to get an understanding of the type of funeral prior to selecting your outfit. For a more traditional funeral, it's advised to err on the side of caution and go for the classic black.;
, You should never wear bright colors to a funeral. Primary colors like blues, reds, and yellows may come off as offensive or disrespectful. Red, in some cultures, is seen as a sign of celebration. It's particularly important to avoid red.Bright colors should not be part of your outfit at all. A black dress with pink stripes near the bottom, or a black suit over a red button-down shirt, is not appropriate for a funeral.
However, in rare cases there is an exception to this rule. Family members, on occasion, may request brighter colors, or a particular color, to honor the deceased. Always go with the family's wishes in this case.

, Funerals are usually somber occasions. You want an outfit you might wear to a job interview over an outfit you would wear clubbing. In some cases, the family may request less formal attire to honor the deceased. However, unless other specified, stick with formality.


Black, dark gray, or navy suits are a good option. Ties and dress pants should be in similarly dark shades. You can also go with a dark colored button-down shirt and tie.Longer dresses and skirts are generally advised for a funeral. Avoid anything too form-fitting, as this may look like a going out outfit rather than a formal one. A dark colored blouse and dress pants is also a good option., In general, you don't want to show a lot of skin at a funeral. It's best to avoid sleeveless outfits, or outfits with very short sleeves. Instead, go for long-sleeved outfits. If you have a sleeveless black dress you want to wear, you can cover up your arms with a shawl or shrug., Patterns are okay for funerals, as long as they don't look too flashy. A floral patterned skirt, or a dark-colored striped shirt, is played down enough to be appropriate for a funeral. However, bright and flashy patterns are to be avoided, especially if they use flashy colors as well. A black shirt with red polka-dots, for example, is not a great choice for a funeral.As always though, remember to respect the wishes of the deceased's family. In some cases, a particular pattern may be requested.

, This is especially important if you're going to a wake or burial before or after the funeral. There is a lot of standing and walking at funerals, so you your shoes to be comfortable. High heels, for example, are not ideal. Make sure to stick to something formal and dark colored with your footwear.Black dress shoes or flats are a good option. A nice pair of dark green, navy blue, gray, or black flats or dress shoes are always a great option for a funeral.
If it's not a super formal funeral, dark-colored tennis shoes or converse sneakers can also work. Always err on the side of formality, however.

, If you're wearing a tie, make sure to play it down. Ties with bright colors or flashy patterns should generally be avoided. A solid colored tie, or a tie with no pattern, is your best option for a funeral. Make sure to select a darker color, like dark green, navy blue, or gray.However, there are exceptions to this rule. If you have, say, a novelty tie the deceased gave to you, family members may appreciate this gesture. You may want to check ahead of time, just to make sure this won't be taken the wrong way.

, If you wear makeup, keep it pretty minimal for a funeral. A funeral is generally a formal occasion. Just as you wouldn't wear dramatic, flashy makeup to your office, do not wear it to a funeral.A light covering of foundation and a nude lipstick is best. Add a small amount of blush, if you want, as well as some very light eye shadow and mascara.
As always, there may be exceptions depending on the wishes of family members. If you're, for example, going to the funeral of someone who worked in theater, family members may request flashier, theatrical makeup.

, If you're worried about picking the right jewelry, it's appropriate to go without for a funeral. In fact, this may help your outfit look more somber. However, if you want to add jewelry, stick to the classics. A string of pearls is vastly more appropriate than a bright, clunky necklace.If you wear earrings, choose respectful ones. Large dangly pieces, or hoop earrings, are a bit too flashy for a funeral. Instead, opt for stud earrings.

, If you wear pocket squares with your suits, these should be also be dark colored. Aim for shades like navy blue, dark green, and gray. A pink pocket square is generally inappropriate funeral attire., If someone is having a religious ceremony, there may be particular rules regarding dress. Make sure to check the denomination ahead of time and do some quick research. See if there are any rules about attire during mourning. You should always respect the deceased's religion.For example, certain religions may require extreme modesty from women during a funeral services. You don't want to show up in a dress or skirt that's too short.
An internet search can let you know about religious rituals. However, it's generally better to ask someone from the family. They can give you the best instructions regarding how to dress.

, If the deceased was from a different cultural background, different colors may be appropriate. While darker colors are traditionally used in Western funerals, this is not always the case in other cultures.Bright colors are actually associated with mourning in some cultures. In Korea, blue is the color of mourning. In Egypt and Ethiopia, yellow is considered a mourning color.
In some Middle Eastern cultures, white is actually considered a funeral color.

, If there's an outdoor funeral or burial, make sure you take this into consideration. You may have to, say, bring an umbrella if it rains or bring a coat if it's cold out. Make sure these accessories are also funeral appropriate.Even with things like raincoats and umbrellas, remember you're at a funeral. A bright pink umbrella is not generally appropriate for a funeral setting. Black umbrellas, and dark colored raincoats, are generally the best option.
You should also stick to dark colored coats and jackets. It may be considered bad form to show up for an outdoor burial wearing a white coat.

, You should always respect special requests, even when they're unconventional. If the family requests a specific color or pattern for the ceremony, try your best to accommodate this. If a family is going for an untraditional send off to honor the deceased, you should follow their wishes over traditional etiquette."

Be yourself from day one, and your spouse will have proven that you are accepted and loved for who you really are, not who you are pretending to be.;
, A good, stout sense of humor is indispensable for a great marriage. Try to see the humor in difficult situations, it'll help you both roll with tough times much better.

, Remember that marriage is a nuts and bolts arrangement. While you're planning your wedding, you may entertain fairy-tale notions of a life lived happily ever after. The reality of marriage is that sometimes, it's just a day to day grind - one or both of you may be tense, on edge, bored, not happy with the other one, not feel so warm and fuzzy. It's not all about your feelings. Repeat: It is not all about your feelings. It's about your commitment to one another. Whether or not you ""feel"" like you're in love, ""feel"" you're getting your needs met, or whatever, the reality is, you have sworn a vow to one another. A lot of the time, marriage isn't romantic at all - it's about teamwork and getting the job done every single day.

, Public wounds penetrate deeply and create a core of humiliation that grows resentment and condescension, two things deadly to a good marriage.

, They chose to be with you because there are aspects of your personality that they can learn from and absorb. Show them how much you love them by being supportive when they are weak and proud when they are strong. Listen to what they say, you may learn something.


Show appreciation and don't ever take him/her for granted or you will miss him/her when they're gone!






You are made differently, that's why you were attracted to each other. Most people clash about these differences, but when you realize that your strengths compensate for your spouse's weaknesses, then their strengths will cover your weaknesses too.







, By finding one way each day to make your partner's life just a little bit nicer, you will never forget that you truly do care for him or her. Doing nice things for your mate makes you think nice thoughts about him or her. It's a good habit.


Do the little things. Waking up to a hot cup of coffee or an ironed shirt, or coming home to lit candles are little ways to show that you care.







,


Hug and hold hands often, daily.







, It doesn't take much to make your spouse feel good. Be sincere and when you're given a compliment, even if you don't agree, just say ""thank you.""

,, It's no fun when someone asks you for your opinion and you say, ""whatever you want."" If all they wanted was what they wanted, they wouldn't have asked you. Be polite and give a complete and honest answer.

, Even if it's only 10 minutes before bed, talk, cuddle, and share each others company.

, At least once a month, have a special evening out with another married couple so you can laugh and learn from each others relationship. Have at least one romantic night out per month and bring the romance home with you!

, There are some restaurants that will teach you how to make a meal from start to finish or you can both learn to play a musical instrument. It's a great way to spend time together and see how each other learns.

, Being healthy and taking care of yourself shows your partner that you want to be around for a long time and will be able to care for them if they get ill.

, If you can't dance then take a lesson together and learn a dance to enjoy with each other.

, The exercise is not only good for your physical health, it gets the blood pumping through your brains and helps you think more clearly. The views and smells of nature will help relax both of you. The clear minds and the soothing affects will create a great environment to be open and honest and talk about everything.

, You do much more learning with your mouth closed and your mind open. You have one mouth and two ears so you can listen twice as much as you talk.

, You have built a relationship based on trust. Don't assume that your spouse is doing things for the purpose of irritating you - maybe s/he just doesn't realize something s/he does is bothering you. Let your spouse know about things that bother you without assuming the worst of him or her, and once it's out in the open give your mate time to make adjustments and corrections.


Don't assume a thing! Talk, talk, talk. Plan your diary together and synchronize the following day ahead of time.







, Ask yourself if something irritating you is really worth fighting over. Is something wrong, or is it just different from the way you would do it? Allow differences to go by without comment. If something is really bothering you, talk about it in a non-accusatory way, and see if you can work it out without arguing.


Laugh at the little mistakes in life, hold the drama for major crisis! Don't make an issue of the ""toothpaste tube"", laugh at the small nuisances and you will be a happier person for it!







, If you're both working 80 hours a week, why should the wife still have to do all the cooking and cleaning? Try to find a mix of jobs you both do better, e.g. dishes and lawn mowing, and share responsibility. Find ways of creating a routine that involves everyone, i.e.: “If you take the bins out, I’ll bring them in"", “You wash, I’ll dry"", etc. This will avoid the nagging housewife syndrome. Remember, you will be living together forever( til death do you part) - save some for tomorrow. The world won't come to an end if you don't finish all the laundry today.

, Being transparent with your partner is important, because it shows you each trust one another with every detail of your lives. If you're harboring secrets, they will eventually be found out and that will spell trouble for your marriage. Keeping things clear and open prevents suspicion and jealousy. Don't do things to get a rise out of your spouse, and if someone at the office is hitting on you and won't stop, tell your boss about it and ask that one of you be transferred. If you maintain a clean appearance and an honest, open communication with your partner, you will be trusted when it's truly imperative.

, Remember, your spouse is human, and so are you. Make allowances for the human condition: tired, overworked, over-stressed, family illnesses, personal illnesses, and simple frailty.

, Don't allow in laws to become outlaws! Keep your distance. Don't live as if you are extended branches of an untouchable hierarchy. Power struggles caused by in-laws are undermining of marriage and must be avoided.

, How you say things can have a larger impact that what you say. Remain calm and speak in a normal tone of voice.


Draw up ""rules of engagement"" (fair fighting rules). For example: ""Stick to the topic"", or ""Never generalize, such as saying ""You always..."".






Don't argue standing up. Choose a place where you can sit and discuss a situation like mature adults. Standing allows the liberty of waving your hands around and stomping like a child. Avoid it!







, Before you speak ask yourself this: If you or your spouse died that moment, would you want what you are about to say to be the last words you shared?


When you disagree, never insult the other person's character, but stick to the point at hand. For example: The glass vase is broken by accident. Don't say: ""You are so clumsy"". This is hurtful and degrading. Stick to the factual point.







, A lot of well-meaning people say that you shouldn't let the sun set on a fight. But it's far better to simply come to a point in the argument where you can stop fighting actively and sleep on it. Instead of continuing an argument that is escalating out of control and going in circles, stopping, resting, and waking refreshed can give you new perspective, and help you come to a better and more satisfying resolution than just fighting it out until you're both battered, bloody, and after you've said things you can never take back. Sleeping on it will also help you allow residual negative feelings to dissipate - you don't always just say, ""Okay, that's it, argument over,"" and return to those warm, loving feelings - sometimes resentment lingers awhile. Let it go - get some rest. You'll both feel better in the morning.

, The three most important words for a good marriage.

, When you say ""I'm sorry"", mean it! That means you won't repeat the action. Apologizing and then repeating the behavior shows your mate that you weren't that sorry after all, and it erodes trust over time.

, Be honest in all aspects of your relationship. If you have not been, start now!

, You will have much less stress to deal with if you work together to plan a budget, accumulate at least a small savings account ($500 emergency fund can work wonders), and prepare for the times when things go wrong, life will be much smoother.


Budget sensibly from the outset. It is preferable to mutually consider future expenses and agree!







, If you're having a rough patch, feeling like you just can't remember what attracted you to him in the first place, wondering what possessed you to marry her... just smile and behave yourself in a kind, gentle way. Act like everything is normal. In fact, go out of your way to be kind, thoughtful, and caring toward your mate. It may sound weird, but if you just keep putting one foot in front of the other, and act like nothing's wrong, eventually, everything really will be normal, okay, and even better.

, Cold shouldering or constant arguing about a contentious issue will likely just drive you apart. A thoughtful gesture can go a long way in helping you feel closer to each other, making it that much more likely that you will work through your problems. This works especially well if you feel like your partner does not compliment or do nice things for you often any more. Start complimenting them and make it a point to be nice -- they'll want to do something nice for you!

, Whether it's a compliment on his/her outfit or a thank you for just taking out the trash, it always feels good to get a little boost from the person you love. And you'll feel good doing the boosting.

Have an open conversation with your new partner.,
Keep your partner clued into your emotional state.,
Understand that you are not being disloyal to your late spouse.,
Consider the feelings of your future spouse if they are also widowed.,
See a professional counselor.",How to Have a Healthy Second Marriage if You Were Widowed1," Remarrying doesn’t mean forgetting. Falling in love with someone after your spouse dies doesn’t mean that you’ve forgotten your spouse or have entirely moved on. All it means is that you’ve fallen in love with someone else. You’ll likely still think of your former spouse and miss them, and that’s perfectly normal. Just make sure your new spouse understands.


Talk to your current or future spouse about your feelings. You could say, “I love you very much, but there is a piece of my heart that will always belong to my former partner. This doesn’t take away from how much I love you, but I just wanted you to know that there are times when I miss them.”
Getting this out in the open before you get married could prevent arguments and misunderstandings. Your new partner’s reaction may also show if you should marry them or not.;
, Grief is not time-limited. It's highly likely that you will continue to grieve for your first spouse even after remarrying. You can diffuse tension and maintain greater harmony in your new marriage by regularly opening up to your spouse about what you're feeling.


You might say, ""I feel guilty. I know I shouldn't, but I do. It's like I'm here happy and he's dead. That's why I pull away from you sometimes. I want you to know that so we can work through these feelings.""

, There may be a chance that you and your late spouse would still be married if they had not passed away. However, life handed you that card and it’s important for you to be happy. After all, your former spouse likely wouldn’t want you to be alone for the rest of your life. Marrying someone else is in no way dishonoring your late spouse; in fact, you’re likely doing exactly what they would want you to do.


If your family or friends are giving you a hard time about moving on, explain to them that you are doing what you need to do to be happy. You can say, “I’m sorry you feel that I am not honoring my late spouse by marrying again. However, there is no one right way to grieve, and I am doing the best I can to be happy at this point in my life and remarrying will do that. I hope you understand and will support me.”
Letting your family know that you will not tolerate them treating you badly because of this may stop them from negatively affecting your future marriage.Be sure to express this early to help prevent it from becoming a problem.

, You may feel that you have moved on from your late spouse, but your current or future one may have healed a little differently than you. They may still have pictures of their former partner in their home or may talk about them more than you feel comfortable with.


Just because you don’t do these things doesn’t mean it is wrong that they do. If you aren’t happy with the situation, talk to them about it.
For example, you could say, “I love you very much and I know how much your late spouse meant to you. I think it’s great you uphold their memory, but the way you go about it makes me uncomfortable.” You may be able to come up with a compromise that allows the both of you to feel comfortable., To ensure that you have fully moved through the grieving process, and won’t carry forward residual guilt or confusion that affects your next marriage, see a bereavement counselor. It can be helpful to talk to someone who is unbiased and will listen to your concerns about getting remarried after losing a spouse.


In addition, seeing a counselor together before your new marriage may help both you and your new spouse come to terms with this new chapter of life and deal with the expectations of children or other relatives."

Don't end your life prematurely.",How to Die Peacefully," It's important to make your physical comfort a high priority in end-of-life care. Depending on your condition, you may be taking a variety of medications, or undergoing a variety of different procedures, so it's important to discuss all treatment options with your doctor and ensure your comfort is provided in addition to these considerations.


Morphine is commonly prescribed to terminal patients, sometimes on a constant need-basis. While there's some debate about whether or not morphine may shorten your life span, it's efficacy as a powerful pain-reliever is proven. If you're in serious pain, talk to your doctor about the option.In some cases, it may be appropriate to pursue additional non-traditional methods of pain management, like holistic medicine, medical marijuana, or other non-western treatments. As long as these treatments don't get in the way of other care you're receiving, it's likely they'll be approved by your doctor, and might be worth a shot.;
, While not everyone has the luxury of paying for home palliative care, you should think about what will bring you the most comfort and peace in your particular situation. There may be more help available in a hospital but you may feel more comforted and peaceful in your own home.


If you're able to leave the hospital, try to get out as much as possible. Even going for short walks can help to get away from the beeping of hospital machines and be a nice change of pace.

, Dyspnea, a general term for end-of-life breathing difficulties, can affect your ability to comfortably communicate, leading to frustration and discomfort. It's something you can address and care for yourself, with some simple techniques.


Keep the head of your bed raised and keep the window open, if possible, to keep fresh air circulating as much as possible.
Depending on your condition, it may also be recommended to use a vaporizer, or to have additional oxygen supplied directly, through the nose.
Sometimes, fluid collection in the throat can result in ragged breathing, which can be aided by turning to one side, or by a quick clearing procedure your doctor can perform.

, Facial dryness and irritation from spending lots of time in a prone position can be an unnecessary discomfort in end-of-life scenarios. As we get older, skin problems become more significant, making them important to address swiftly.


Keep your skin as clean and moisturized as possible. Use lip balm and non-alcoholic moisturizing lotions to keep chapped skin softened. Sometimes damp cloths and ice chips can also be effective at soothing dry skin or cotton mouth.
Sometimes called ""bed sores,"" pressure ulcers can result from prolonged time in a prone position. Watch carefully for discolored spots on the heels, hips, lower back, and neck. Turn from side and back every few hours to help prevent these sores, or try putting a foam pad under sensitive spots to reduce pressure.

, The routine of being in the hospital will take a toll on anyone, and the constant blood pressure checks and IV drip can make it difficult to sleep. Be honest about your energy levels, any nausea, or temperature sensitivity you're experiencing to get as much rest to be as energetic as possible.


Occasionally, in end-of-life scenarios, medical staff will discontinue these types of routines, when they become unnecessary. This can make it much easier to relax and get the rest you need to stay energetic and somewhat active.

, It can get quickly overwhelming, confusing, and frustrating to be in the hospital and feel like you're not in control of your own life anymore. It can be very helpful emotionally to stay as informed as possible by using your doctor questions regularly. Try to ask these types of questions to the doctor in charge:


What's the next course of action?
Why do you recommend this test or treatment?
Will this make me more comfortable, or less?
Will this speed up or slow down the process?
What does the timetable for this look like?

, An advance directive is basically just a written document or a series of documents explaining what you want to have happen during your end-of-life care. It may outline a variety of topics, including your wishes for your care, should you become incapacitated, as well as naming proxies and a power of attorney.


These documents will need to be drawn up by attorneys and notarized. These aren't likely things that you'll want to have to spend a lot of time dealing with yourself, so it's common to delegate these tasks to others.

, There's a lot of comfort in knowing that you've taken care of everything ahead of time and haven't left big or stressful decisions to be made after you're gone. If you're up to it, it's important to have legal documents drawn up..


A living will describes the type of healthcare you hope to receive and whether or not you'd like to remain on life support, and under what circumstances, should you become incapacitated and unable to make your own decisions. Living wills can be prepared by attorneys and should be prepared ahead of time.
Last wills are designed to designate property to beneficiaries, assign guardians for minor children, and elucidate any last wishes. This is somewhat different than a living trust, which will transfer property immediately, as opposed to after your death., In some cases, it may be good for you to delegate these responsibilities instead to a proxy, in the event that you're unwilling or incapable of making these decisions for yourself. This is often an adult-aged child or spouse, who will be tasked with making choices regarding your health care as things progress.

, In some cases, it may be difficult to choose or assign proxy responsibilities to a private party, and you may wish instead to assign them to an attorney. This is extremely common and can be a relatively stress-free way of turning over technical responsibilities to someone else, allowing you to deal with your own comfort and emotional responsibilities.A health care power of attorney is different than a general power of attorney, which provides for financial assistance after death. While both of these may be appropriate options, it's important to distinguish between them., Though it may be slightly unnerving, it’s important to decide what you want to happen to your body after you die. There are many options and considerations, depending on your culture and religious background.


If you want a funeral, or religious ritual to be performed after your death, you may want to arrange the ceremony yourself, or delegate the responsibility to a loved one. Make the arrangements in terms of churches, funeral homes, if it helps you to find closure.
If you want to be buried, decide where you want to be buried and which family members you want to be buried near, if you haven’t made those decisions already. Secure a burial plot by making a down payment, and make arrangements with a funeral home in your area, if necessary.
If you'd like your body to be donated, make sure your donor status is up to date and accurate, according to your wishes. Contact the university or foundation to which you want your remains donated and make the necessary arrangements.

, There's no right or wrong way to die. For some people, it may be desirable to spend as much time with friends and family as possible, while others may find comfort in solitude, choosing to face things alone. Some people might want to kick up their heels and make the most of the last days, while others may want to go about the same basic routine.


Don't be afraid to have fun, or to spend your time laughing. Nowhere does it say that the end of life is supposed to be a somber affair. If you want to do nothing more than watch your favorite football team and joke with your relatives, do so.
It's your life. Surround yourself with the things and the people that you want to be surrounded with. Make your happiness, comfort, and peace your priority., Few people receive a terminal diagnosis and wish they'd spent more time at the office, and one of the most common near-death regrets is of working too much and missing out. Try not to spend the time you have left, if there isn't much, doing something you don't want to be doing.


It's unlikely you'll be making a marked financial difference for your family in a short amount of time, so focus on what will make a difference: addressing the emotional needs of yourself and your family.
Alternatively, some people may find energy and comfort in going about the routine of work, especially if you're feeling physically strong enough to do so. If it feels natural and reassuring to keep working, do it.

, One of the biggest regrets those who are facing death express is not staying in touch with old friends and relatives. Remedy this by taking the opportunity to spend a little time with them, one-on-one if possible, and catch up.


You don't have to talk about what you're going through if you don't want to. Talk about your past, or focus on today. try to keep things as positive as you want them to be.
If you want to open up, do so. Express what you're going through and release some of the grief you're experiencing with people you trust.
Even if you don’t have much energy for laughter or conversation, just having them sit by your side can bring you worlds of comfort.
Depending on your family situation, it might be easier to meet with people in big shifts, seeing whole families at once, or you may prefer focusing on individual meetings. These have a tendency to help slow down time, focusing on quality, rather than quantity. This can be a great way of maximizing the time you have left.

, It's common for those near death to want to uncomplicate complicated relationships. This can mean a variety of things, but it generally means trying to resolve disputes and go forward less burdened.


Make an effort to end any fights, arguments, or misunderstandings so that you can move forward. You shouldn’t engage in arguments and keep fighting, but rather, agree to disagree when necessary and end your relationships on a good note.
While you probably can’t be around the people you care about all of the time, you can plan to see them in shifts, so that you rarely feel alone.
If you can’t see your loved ones in person, making a phone call to someone you care about can make a difference as well.

, If your health situation is unknown to your friends and family, you may elect to let everyone know what's going on and keep them up to date, or you may prefer keeping things private. There are advantages and disadvantages to each choice, and it's something you'll have to decide for yourself.


Letting people know can help you get closure and feel ready to move on. If you want to grieve together, open up and let your friends family in. You can tell them individually to make it feel more personal, and tell only those people that you really care about, or make it more public. This can make it difficult to avoid the issue and focus on lighter subjects over the next weeks and months, though, which is a negative for many people.
Keeping your situation private can help to maintain your dignity and privacy, a desirable thing for many people. While this might make it difficult to share and grieve together, if you feel like this is something you want to take on alone, you might consider keeping it private.

, Your final days probably shouldn't be spent pouring over Nietzsche and contemplating the void, unless you're the sort of person who finds pleasure in these things. Let yourself experience pleasure. Pour yourself a glass of whiskey, watch the sunset, sit with an old friend. Live your life.


When you face death, you don't have to make an extra effort to come to terms with it. It will come to terms with you. Instead, use the time you have left to enjoy the people and things you enjoy, not to focus on death.

, One thing you may have to deal with is the fact that the people around you are having trouble coping with your death. They may look even more upset, hurt, and emotional than you feel. Try to be as honest as seems kind with your family, when discussing your feelings and desires.


Though you may want nothing more from them than comfort, optimism, support, and love, you may find that they will be having trouble in their own grief. That’s perfectly natural. Accept that people are doing their best and that they’ll need a break sometimes, too. Try your best not to be angry or disappointed at how they’re reacting.
You may find that some of your loved ones are showing little emotion at all. Don’t ever think that this means that they don’t care. It just means that they are dealing with your health quietly, in their own way, and that they’re trying not to upset you with how they feel.

, Talking to your pastor, rabbi, or other religious leader can help you feel like you’re less alone in the world and that there’s a path laid out for you. Talking to religious friends, reading religious scriptures, or praying can help you find peace. If you’re well enough to attend your church, mosque, or synagogue, you can also find peace by spending more time with people in your religious community.


However, if you don’t subscribe to a religion, don’t feel compelled to change your mind and to believe in the afterlife after all if that’s not really true to who you are. End your life as you've lived it.

, If you’re looking for a way to die peacefully because you want to end your life, don't. You should talk to a trusted friend or family member, check yourself into a hospital, and make an effort not to be alone at any cost. You may feel like you have no better option than to end your life. If you want to die peacefully, then you should make the most of your life while you can.


If you’re thinking about suicide and need immediate help, please call 800-273-TALK, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline, if you’re in the United States. If you’re in a different country, please call your nation’s suicide prevention hotline ASAP. Remember it is not worth it and nothing good can happen.

Be direct.,
Acknowledge their pain.,
Stay on topic.,
Avoid giving advice.,
Avoid talking about faith.,
Lower your tone.",How to Express Sympathy1," Tell the person that you care and are sorry for the troubled time they are experiencing. Most people feel awkward in situations in which they feel sympathy, and so they are unsure of how to comfort their loved one. Telling them you care is a great first step, and it opens the door for them to ask you for help if they need to.Say something like “I am so sorry.” Then try to offer assistance in a concrete way. Instead of saying, ""Let me know if I can help,"" suggest a specific way in which you can help. Try, ""I can watch the kids while you meet with the funeral planner,"" or ""Let me bring you dinner tonight."";
, Avoid comparing their pain to any other pain. Even if you have experienced a similar situation, do not assume that they feel the same way you did. Allow the person to feel pain in the way that they need to work through it. Saying things like “I know how you feel,” can be offensive.Instead of assuming things such as, “I know how you feel,” try saying something like “I can see you are hurt. Do you want to talk?”

, When you are expressing your sympathies to a loved one, avoid rambling. If your loved one is going through a hard time, jumping from topic to topic might be hard to follow, or they may lose interest altogether. Instead, reassure them that you are there for them, and then give them the space they need.Make sure that it is well understood that they can open up to you as much as they want/need to.

, In trying times, few people welcome hearing about what they should be doing. Only issue advice in rough times if the person specifically asks you for your input. Otherwise, saying things like “It’ll all work out, just give it time,” implies that you think you know more about their situation than they do.Aim for simply being available. Say things such as “If you need anything at all, just call me.”

, People often want to interject faith into hard times. While your faith may give you comfort or strength, the person you sympathize with may or may not share the same views on faith. Assuming that they share your views can come off as offensive and rude, and you should avoid pressuring them to discuss what they do or do not believe during hard times., If your tone is high pitched and loud, you will come off as flustered or excited. Neither of these are conducive to expressing sympathy for another person. When you speak, speak quietly and in a lower register to convey your sympathy."

Sit your child down.,
Find out what the child knows about death.,
Explain what “dead” means in simple language.,
Discuss your cultural beliefs.,
Try to avoid euphemisms like “sleep” or “went away.” These euphemisms might confuse children, and cause them unnecessary fear.,
Be honest and don’t hide your feelings.",How to Explain Funerals to Children1," Before broaching the subject of death and funerals, find a time to sit your child down. Use this time to find out what they already know and to fill in any gaps in their knowledge of death and dying. Choose a calm time of day to talk about the subject, perhaps in the morning or during a time when you usually read to your child.


Other opportunities to talk about death and dying with children are when they encounter a dead plant, tree insect, or animal, like a bird. Reinforce the idea that all living things die, but that it is a natural process that allows for new things to join everyone on Earth.;
, Find out what your child already knows about death by asking them what they think about it. You can ask them, “What do you think happens when something dies?” or “Do you remember the dead flower? Why do you think it died?”


Preschool children generally see death as reversible and temporary because they have no concept of permanence or experience with death to give them context. Children of this age are in what Piaget has called the pre-operational stage of development.During this time, children may have a hard time with abstract concepts in general, such as death.
By the time children are between the ages of 5 and 9, they come to understand death as more permanent and absolute. However, they usually do not relate it to themselves.From the age of nine and through adolescence, children begin to fully comprehend the meaning of death, particularly the idea that they too will die someday.

, When explaining death to your child, use straightforward, simple language. It helps to explain death as the absence of familiar life functions. Also, when explaining death, make sure to use reassuring language. Your child might ask questions about their death, as well as your death.


The child might ask, ""When will you die?"" Your child asks this because they need reassurance that you will be there to take care of them. You can respond, ""Don't worry. I will be here to take care of you. I don't expect to die for a very long time, and as long as I am alive, Mommy will take care of you.""You can also reassure your child by telling them that most people live for a very long time before they die, and that it was not their fault that Grandma died.
When you explain death you can say, “I have some sad news. Grandma died today. Her heart stopped beating. She does not breath in and out anymore. She cannot eat, see, hear or move. She cannot feel pain or be hurt either. It is different from sleeping because all your body parts still work when you are sleeping. But Grandma’s body parts have stopped working.”, You can also reassure your child by discussing your cultural beliefs about life, death, and the afterlife. Your child will most likely ask where the deceased person is going and what will happen with their body. The best answer is to say what you honestly think and feel. If you believe there is a heaven in the afterlife, tell your child that their loved one is going to a beautiful place where they will be happy. If you don't believe in the afterlife, you can tell your child that these things are a mystery.If you're uncomfortable talking with your child about what happened to the deceased's body, you can always refer your child to someone they trust. For example, they might talk to a family member or a relative, or someone with professional experience, like a clergy member or a member of the hospice staff.It is important to try to answer all their questions, and answer them in simple terms. They may repeat the questions they don't fully understand the answers to. This is normal.

, For example, a child may be afraid of sleeping or taking naps if you equate death with sleeping. Or, they might develop anxiety around separation, if they are told that someone “went away” when they died.It is also problematic to tell your child that someone died because of a sickness. Your child does not fully comprehend the difference between a serious illness, like cancer, and a temporary sickness, like a sore throat. Reassure your child by saying, ""Only very, very serious illnesses may cause death. Everyone gets sick, but we usually get better again. Remember when Mommy had a stomach ache, and got better again?""

, Remember to be honest about the situation and your feelings. Don’t try to hide your feelings from your child. Showing and verbalizing your own pain gives your child an example to follow. Holding back your feelings might give the impression that your child should repress their feelings, too. Let your children know that feeling sad, mad, confused, and crying are normal, healthy responses during this time.You can tell your child, for example, “It is okay to feel sad and to cry. Don’t worry, I will take care of you.”
On the other hand, it may take your child a minute to process the information and they might not respond right away. This is OK. Let them process the information. They will most likely bring the subject up on their own at a later time.

Do what feels right for you.,
Take it easy on yourself.,
Avoid making comparisons between spouses.",How to Have a Healthy Second Marriage if You Were Widowed2," The popular saying “You can’t please everyone” is popular because it’s true. Your friends and family may not be ready for you to marry, or even date, again. However, the good news is you are an adult who is capable of making your own decisions. You are responsible for your happiness and if you let others’ opinions affect you, you may sabotage your relationship.Keep in mind that it is typical for people to remarry after losing a spouse, but children will not want to replace their parent. Your experience and your children's experiences will likely be different in this way.

, You’ve undergone a major loss and now you are entering new territory. Chances are, you may not have it all figured out and you may have lots of questions regarding this new marriage. For instance, you may wonder should you buy a new home instead of living in the one you shared with your late spouse, if you should stop wearing your old wedding ring when you get a new one, if you should get new furniture, and so on.


Instead of trying to live up to others’ expectations or attempting to remarry after you become widowed in the “right” way, do what you and your new spouse feel comfortable with. Don’t be hard on yourself about this new chapter in your life and your marriage will likely be happy and healthy because of it.Take the time that you need and avoid rushing through this process.

, You likely don’t want your new spouse to compare you to their former spouse, so try not to compare them to your late partner. Additionally, avoid comparing yourself to their late spouse, as well. Doing so will just add unrealistic expectations to the marriage and may put unneeded pressure on your relationship. Instead, just be yourself and allow your partner to be themselves, as well.


If you believe your new spouse is comparing you to their late spouse, be open about how you feel. For instance, tell them, “I feel as though you compare me to your late spouse and I am not comfortable with that. It’s not fair to me, you, or our relationship.” Your spouse may not even realize what they are doing and may change their ways after you express your concern about it."
"
Talk to younger children about your intentions.,
Realize older children may be against your new marriage.,
Consider the feelings of your new spouse’s children.",How to Have a Healthy Second Marriage if You Were Widowed3," Young children don’t fully understand the concept of remarrying after their parent dies. They often fear that the new spouse will try to take the place of their late parent, or even them. Explain to them that you will always love their parent and you will also love them, too, no matter what.


Taking your child to see a therapist if they are upset about your remarrying may help them become more comfortable with the situation. The therapist may be able to offer different words than you that can help your child understand that they, and their parent, aren’t being replaced.Keep in mind that all children will respond differently. They may warm up to your new spouse right away or they may need time to adjust and work through their feelings.

, Your older children may be more vocal about not wanting you to remarry. They may not like the new spouse, or they also may feel that you haven’t grieved their parent long enough. However, it is important to not let their opinions prevent you from being happy. Although this may be difficult at first, it’s what you’ll need to do to keep your marriage healthy.


Tell your older children, “I understand you do not want me to remarry. However, I am in love and doing this will make me happy. You are entitled to your own opinion, but please do not disrespect me, my spouse, or our marriage.”
If they continue to act negatively towards your union, you may need to distance yourself from them until they are able to move on.This may only be a short-term behavior and they may come around if you hold your position.

, Your current or future spouse may also have children who might not feel comfortable about this marriage. To prevent this from affecting your marriage as little as possible, you’ll need to talk to them and your spouse about your relationship. Staying respectful and patient is the best way to help your relationship grow.


For instance, you can tell your new spouse, “I do not want to come between you and your children. However, I know that they are against our marriage. Please tell me what I can do to stop this from hurting our marriage and to make everyone comfortable.”
You must also tell your spouse that you expect them to defend you and not put up with any disrespectful behavior or words from their children."

Make physical contact with the person.,
Be aware of your facial expressions.,
Send them a gift.,
Coordinate people to send them meals.",How to Express Sympathy2," Making physical contact can reassure someone that you care and are available to them. Put your hand on their shoulder, or give them a hug. If you are not that comfortable with the person you are sympathizing with, shake their hand.Cease any unwanted physical contact. If the person seems to be moving away or uncomfortable making contact with you, do not force it.

, How you say something is as important as what you say. Make sure that your facial expressions match the condolences you are offering in a bad situation. For example, you should not say “I am so sorry for your loss/luck,” with a huge smile.


A neutral expression is usually best. This means relaxed eyebrows, making eye contact, and a neutral mouth (not smiling or frowning).

, The gift you send does not need to be expensive or elaborate. In many cases, just sending a card would be sufficient to express your sympathies. You can also send flowers to someone to express your sympathy for their current plight.

, Another way to show your sympathy and help in a tough time is to bring the person meals. This can free them of the need to cook for several days or weeks, and allow them the time and space to cope with their situation. The more people you can get to participate, the easier it will be to provide steady meals.


There are websites that allow people to sign up for specific meals on specific dates, which may make it easier for you to organize meal delivery. This way, the meals can be spaced out and you won't make the mistake of bringing multiple meals on the same day.

"
"
Check in every week.,
Be a good listener.,
Avoid judgement.,
Make yourself available to help.",How to Express Sympathy3," When a person goes through a difficult time, such as the loss of a loved one or job loss, they usually have a swell of support. As time passes, other people move on and continue their lives, leaving the person in distress to fend for themselves. You should check in every week with the person you sympathize with to be sure that they are still doing well.This does not have to be an awkward check in. You could simply have coffee with them once a week and say things like “So how are doing this week?”

, Your friend may need to talk about what they are experiencing. Let your friend know you are available to listen, and make it clear they have your undivided attention. Put away electronics like your phone and turn off the television or other distractions. Make eye contact, nod and make sounds where appropriate (such as ""Uh huh,"" or ""I see,"") to show that you are listening. Put aside judgement and don't think about your response or what you think they should have done/should be doing. Let them talk and don't interrupt.


Don't rush the person. They may not be ready to talk, or it may take them a while to articulate their thoughts.

, People often judge others harshly if they do not remove themselves from a bad situation (such as a hostile relationship) or “get over” a tragic event (such as a death in the family) in a certain time frame. Keep in mind that everyone fights their own battles on their own time, and it is not your place to decide when or how someone else moves to the next phase of their life. Remain caring and compassionate toward the person you sympathize with and reserve judgment for how the deal with their situation.This does not mean that you have to condone any behavior that they exhibit. You are free to cut ties with the person if/when the connection becomes unhealthy for you.

, Aside from frequent check-ins, you should make it clear that you are available to the other person any time they need someone to lean on. Answer their calls, texts, emails, etc. and be willing to help them do chores or other daily tasks. If there is a big project to be done, such as remodeling a room after a spouse passed away, volunteer to help out."

Consider the child’s age and developmental stage.,
Be honest and sincere.,
Avoid using euphemisms that might be confusing.,
Make sure the child understands what has been said.,
Allow the child to ask questions and answer them honestly.,
Read books about death with your child.",How to Explain Cremation to a Child1," A child’s age and developmental stage affects their understanding of death. Preschool age children might think death can be reversed. Children ages 5-9 realize death is final, but think they can escape it. By age 10 children begin understanding death as an irreversible part of life that will eventually happen to them., It is important to provide simple and relevant explanations of death to children. For example, if Grandfather passed away after a prolonged illness try saying, “Grandpa was sick for a long time. His body just quit working and the doctors couldn’t fix it.”


If your family friend died in an accident, try to word things in a friendly and safe way, such as ""Kim was in a bad car accident that caused her body to stop working and the doctors and nurses couldn’t fix it.” Don't use any words such as ""terrible"" ""scary"" ""horrifying"" and anything else that you don't need to say. Use words such as ""bad"". It gets across that there was something wrong, but it won't scare them.

, Do not use explanations like, “Daddy went to sleep,” as the child could develop a fear of sleeping. Likewise you shouldn’t say, “Mommy went away.” This can instill fear of even brief separations like a parent going to the store or the child going to school., It’s critical that you ensure the child has understood what you explained to them about death. This may take time and it may require the answering of the same questions repeatedly. Be patient with the child.After providing an explanation, ask the child to explain what happens when someone dies. Try asking, “Joey, what happened to Aunt Kristen when she died?”
Many kids learn by repetition, so they might need to have their questions answered repeatedly.

, It’s normal for children to have questions about death, and it’s important you are open and forthcoming when responding to these inquiries even if you don’t have all the answers.If a child asks, “Will I die, too?” try saying, “All living things die eventually, but most of us will live until we are very old so you don’t need to worry about dying right now.”
If your child asks, “Will you die, too, Mommy?” respond by saying, “I hope I live for a really long time. But you don’t need to worry because someone will always be here to love and take care of you.”

, There are many child-appropriate books on the subject of death that you could read with your child.Reading a book about death with your child may help them to gain a better understanding of it."

Explain the purpose of a funeral.,
Tell them what they will see.,
Arrange a visit beforehand.,
Explain the procession and the burial.,
Explain cremation if the body will be cremated.",How to Explain Funerals to Children2," Before attending a funeral, explain what a funeral is to your child. Explain that funerals are a time for friends and family to come together to say thank you, goodbye, and I love you to the person who has died. Tell them that it is a time to remember and to pay their last respects to the person that died. It is also a time to celebrate that person’s life, and to receive comfort and support from people who care., It is very important to explain to them what they will see. Explain to your child that they will see people expressing a variety of feelings. They will see people laughing, crying, hugging, and offering each other support.


If the funeral will have an open casket, explain to them what it is and what they will see. You can say, “A casket is a special box that holds the whole body. It will be made of wood and the inside of it will look like a bed with a little pillow. Your grandma's body will be dressed up in a pretty outfit, and will be lying in the special box. There will be flowers and pictures around the box.”, To prepare your child, you can arrange a visit to the funeral home beforehand. You can show them the room where the casket will be, and where the bathroom and the playground is.

, Also explain to your child what happens after the funeral. Tell them that everyone will drive to the cemetery where the casket will be buried. Explain to them that everyone will gather around the grave, a special hole that is a dug in the ground, to say prayers and to place flowers on the casket.

, Children may be curious and concerned about the body if it has become ashes. Be sure to reassure your child that this process is not painful; try not to use the word ""burn"" since that word suggests pain. You might discuss cremation as a beautiful process that helps the body turn back into ashes in order for it to become a part of the earth.


For example, “There is a special place called the crematorium. The crematorium has a special room, not like any room in our house, with a special fire. The fire is very, very hot, and will turn your grandma’s body into ashes. She will not feel any heat or pain. Her ashes will be put in a pretty container, called an urn. The urn will be at the funeral.”"

Consider what a child's grieving process is like.,
Let them ask questions.,
Encourage your child to participate.,
Tell them what others might say to them.,
Don’t force them to attend.",How to Explain Funerals to Children3," Children go through grief in a way that is different from adults, and becoming familiar with this process may make it easier for you to understand the child's behavior and feelings. These phases include:Understanding what death is and knowing how to tell when it has happened.
Recognizing that death exists and accepting the emotions that come along with knowing that death exists.
Reorganizing their identity, relationships, and environment in accordance with their understanding of death.

, Your child will have questions about death and the whole process. Be attentive and try to answer as many questions as you can. If you do not have an answer to a question, it is OK to admit that you don’t have the answer. Children understand openness and honesty. By showing them that it is OK to not know everything, they will also feel better about not knowing or understanding everything.If you don’t know an answer to a question you can say, “I’m not sure myself about that” or “I don’t know the answer to that.”

, Help your child feel included in the process by encouraging them to participate. Encourage them to draw a picture or write a note to place in the casket. You can bring them with you to pick out a card or flowers for the deceased’s family. Or, you can ask them to pick a song or special reading to say at the funeral., Also inform your child about what others might tell them. Tell them that others might say, “Don’t cry, ”“Be brave,” “Be strong,” or “Be extra nice to your parents, now.” Therefore, they can get conflicting messages. However, let them know that is OK to feel whatever it is they feel; that it is OK to cry.


Try to help your child understand that people cope with death differently, and that people are raised to deal with death differently. Explain to them that what those people were taught about death when they were young is different from what you are teaching them about it now., If your child does not want to attend the funeral, do not force them to. If you see that your child is feeling sad or worried, ask them about their feelings and listen. Provide them comfort by hugging them and by telling them to not worry, and that everything will be OK.


After a few minutes of talking and listening, do a fun activity together that will lighten their mood. For example, play a game, go to the park, cook, or go enjoy an activity together."

Define what intimacy means to you and your partner.,
Identify different types of intimacy.,
Discuss the value and importance of intimacy.Talk to your partner and discuss how you both approach the relationship.,
Be conscious of day-to-day intimacy.",How to Have a Healthy Marriage1," Intimacy does not just mean the sexual connection you have with your partner. You should communicate with your partner on how you define intimacy.This will help disperse miscommunication and help promote a more peaceful and respectful relationship.;
, Have a conversation about all the different types of intimacy you feel is in your relationship. Some may include:


Emotional (how you communicate feelings)
Sexual (the chemistry between you and your partner)
Intellectual (the exchange of thoughts and ideas between you and your partner).

, For example, consider:


How do you value the intellectual intimacy you have with your partner? Does your partner value intellect in the same way? If not, how does that make you feel?
How do you value the sexual intimacy you have with your partner? Does your partner value sexual intimacy in the same way? If not, how does that make you feel?
How do you value emotional intimacy you have with your partner? Does your partner value your feelings, or emotional intimacy, in the same way? If not, how does this make you feel?

, Intimacy, like many things in life, is a constant work in progress. To build a healthy relationship, be aware of how intimacy affects your daily life. Consider writing a diary or have daily conversations about intimacy. Consider answering the questions:


Has my partner met my intellectual needs today? How has he/hasn’t he?
Has my partner met my sexual needs lately? If not, how can I discuss this with her in a respectful manner?
Do I feel safe sharing my feelings openly with my partner? Why or why not? Is this problematic?

"
Follow the child’s lead.,
Don’t use words like burn or fire.,
Reassure the child that the deceased will not feel any pain.,
Tell the child the deceased’s spirit will not be harmed during cremation.,
Provide child-friendly details about cremation if the child asks for more information.,
Explain what will happen to the ashes after cremation.",How to Explain Cremation to a Child2," Each child is unique and not all children will be curious about the process of cremation. Answer the child’s questions and make sure you don’t push the child’s curiosity by explaining what they seem uninterested in.


Consider what prompted your child to ask about cremation to help guide the conversation. For example, did they over hear that a loved one was going to be cremated instead of buried and wonder what that meant? Or did they hear it from a friend or while watching TV? Use the situation as a way to tailor your discussion of cremation.

, Using such words can have a negative impact on the child. Telling a child that their grandmother will be burned or placed in a fire can cause fear. It’s important that the child is not scared by the concept of cremation.Don’t say, “Grandma wanted to be cremated. This means her body will be burned.”
Instead try saying, “Grandma wanted to be cremated when she died. This means that her body will be placed in a very hot room until her body turns into soft ashes.”

, Cremation can sound scary to children, and many are afraid that the deceased will experience extreme pain as their remains are burned. You can avoid this by reassuring them pain is not part of the process.Try saying, “Anna, I want you to know that Daddy will not be hurt when he is cremated.”

, If you are spiritual or religious, explain the soul will not be harmed. For families who believe in the concept of a soul, it’s important the child knows the deceased’s spirit or soul will not be affected by the process of cremation.Try saying, “Grandma’s body will be turned into soft ashes, but her spirit will not be harmed because it left her body when she passed on.”

, Do not go into detail unless the child asks you for specifics. Some children will be extremely curious about precisely how the process of cremation works. If the child wants details, try conveying some of the following information to them.Try saying, “There won’t be any smoke or smell when Mommy is cremated. It will just get very hot – about three times as hot as our oven gets – and this heat will turn everything into soft ashes except some pieces of bone.”
You can also say, “After cremation what’s left of Uncle Tom’s body will look similar to kitty litter. However the remains will be white because they are made of bone.”

, Letting a child know where their loved one’s ashes will end up after cremation can help them find peace and closure. Discuss the deceased’s wishes with the child, whether it be the scattering of ashes or their memorialization in an urn.


Try saying, “Aunt Ashley really loved the farm where we grew up in Kentucky. She wanted her ashes to be scattered there after her death, which is why we are traveling there next week.”
If the deceased’s ashes will be memorialized in an urn, say to the child, “Daddy wanted to be close to us always and asked that his ashes be placed in a special container called an urn. To honor him we will keep the urn with his ashes on the mantle.”

"
"
Include the child in the memorialization process.,
Allow the child to continue asking questions.,
Make sure you support the child in the weeks, months, and years following cremation.,
Note any changes in the child’s behavior.",How to Explain Cremation to a Child3," Allowing the child to make a decision about whether or not they will participate in the funeral, memorial, or scattering of ashes will allow them to approach their loved one’s death in a way that feels comfortable to them.You say to the child, “Bobby, we are going to have a ceremony to honor Uncle Ted. Is there anything special you’d like to do to say goodbye to him?”

, Just because a child did not seem interested in talking about death or cremation in the immediate days and weeks following the passing of a loved one doesn’t mean they won’t have questions in the future.


Try saying, “Amanda, I know it’s been a few months since we scattered Grandpa’s ashes. Do you have any questions I can help you answer?

, It is critical that children feel supported and loved throughout the grieving process. Creating a space for your child to mourn openly and remaining available as time passes will help the child heal.Tell the child you are there to support them in any way they need. Try saying, “Georgie, I’m feeling sad about Grandma’s passing and maybe you are, too. I just want you to know I am here to listen to and support you.”
Try visiting the place where you scattered the deceased’s ashes with the child. Allow the child to talk openly about their feelings, but don’t push them.

, After the cremation process is complete and the loved one has been memorialized, watch your child closely for changes in their mood or behavior. These types of changes may indicate that the child is having a hard time processing the death. Seek the help of a mental health professional if you notice any changes in your child’s mood or behavior."

Negotiate conflicts carefully.,
Forgive each other.,
Acknowledge accomplishments.,
Exemplify consideration.,
Respect boundaries.,
Stand up for your partner.",How to Have a Healthy Marriage2," You will fight with your partner. You will need to learn to resolve conflicts in a respectful manner in order to maintain a happy relationship. To do this, consider the following: Listen to what your partner has to say. Emotion can sometimes make us talk rather than listen. It might be difficult, but try and listen to what your partner has to say before you jump into what you have to say. You will need to actively listen, that is, try and acknowledge what your partner has to say.Keeping quiet while your partner talks is not always the same as listening.
Really think about what you have to say before you say it. Words have power and what you say may have a lasting outcome. A good trick is to rely on active listening to help structure your words. Try and repeat, exactly, what your partner says before your rebuttal. For example, “I hear that you are frustrated that I did not do the dishes. I’m very sorry, but I just had a tough day at the office and was exhausted by the time I got home.”
Apologize, and mean it! Sometimes, in a fight, both of your feelings might be hurt. Acknowledge these feelings and try and make amends to your partner. This will help negotiate the argument. For example: “I know you were looking forward to going out with your friends this evening and I’m sorry our plans have changed. I really need your support right now while I’m dealing with this.”

, All couples have disagreements, but the quality of a relationship is always measured by how well the couple makes up after a fight. Avoid holding grudges after fights have died down. Holding onto emotions can fester into a new conflict. Verbally let go of these feelings with your partner with an apology such as a “sorry for picking a fight with you” or “I forgive you for your outburst last night. I love you.”

, What might be important to you may not be important to your partner (and vice versa).If your partner is excited about something, verbally acknowledge it. This will help your partner feel that you respect her self-worth.


For example, if your partner received a promotion, congratulate her on it with a nice dinner or just a “Great job, honey! I’m really proud of your hard work.” Being specific with your accolades is even better than general comments.
Sometimes, what your partner views as an accomplishment may not seem like much to you. It’s important to be supportive. For example, if your partner is really excited about a high score on a video game, still acknowledge it. This will let your partner know that you value his hobbies or personal pursuits.

, As with acknowledging accomplishments, you also need to be considerate to your partner’s downfalls (not matter how large or how trivial). Follow the same guidelines with acknowledging accomplishments when being considerate.


For example: “I’m so sorry you didn’t get the promotion, honey. I know you’ve been working hard lately.”
Or: “I’m so sorry your save file got erased on your video game. I know you spent a lot of time on it.”

, If you are unsure what your partner’s boundaries are, talk to your partner about them.These boundaries can, contextually, be about anything. Your partner may have physical boundaries. Your partner may have boundaries about communication. Whatever the case, respect these boundaries and communicate with your partner about what these boundaries are.
Use active listening skills to talk about boundaries. For example: “I hear that you are uncomfortable with me touching you there. Do you want to talk about it?”

, You should protect your partner, and your partner should protect you. This may be from external forces such as negativity in the workplace, or perhaps internal dissonance with anxiety or depression. Let your partner know that you are her biggest advocate. Consider:


”I’m sorry that you are struggling with this right now. I am here to help you.”
”What your boss did was wrong. I cannot believe you had to go through that!”
”I do not appreciate what you said about my wife. I really think what you said was quite rude and I would really appreciate an apology.”

Spend time with each other.,
Explore common interests.,
Enjoy time alone.,
Celebrate!",How to Have a Healthy Marriage3," It is easy to get into an everyday routine of accomplishing personal goals. However, you should strive to spend time with your partner to continue to build healthy and happy habits. Some ways to do this include:


Eating dinner together.
Sharing a hobby.
Working out together.
Going to bed/waking up at the same time.
Schedule time during the day to sit down and talk. (Maybe after the both of you get home from work.)

, Try and take an interest in partner’s interests. This can be a hobby, or this can just being present and supportive of what your partner does. For example:


If your partner enjoys playing/watching a sport, then support the team or watch her games.
If your partner enjoys an activity, try the activity with him. Or, ask questions and encourage discussions about it.

, This may seem counter-productive to building a healthy partnership, but studies have shown the couples are happier if they develop some personal time.To develop some alone time, try:


Having a space designated as your own.
Scheduling time for your own. (For example, perhaps every other Saturday is your own day.)
Have your own hobby. While it is important to share your partner’s interest, it can also be healthy to have a unique hobby that you can enjoy by yourself. For example, perhaps take an exercise class by yourself.

, Enjoy your time with your spouse. Remember important dates like birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays. Do something you both enjoy to mark the good things in life.


There are many ways of celebrating. You can take your spouse out to a nice dinner at her favorite restaurant or stay at home and make your husband his favorite dinner. You can take a vacation or stay at home and enjoy a “staycation.” Celebrate in a way that you both enjoy.

Discuss parenting styles.,
Be consistent on parenting approaches.,
Be good role models.,
Be present.,
Present a united front.",How to Have a Healthy Marriage4," It is okay if you and/or your partner change views on parenting styles. Your views will evolve with experience. It is vital, however, to continue to communicate with your partner your specific views and opinions in a respectful manner.Parenting styles can be a broad category, but consider what you and your partner value in parenting. Do you want to raise your children with an emphasis on religion, education, physical fitness, etc?
Consider: How do you expect to discipline your children? How do you expect to educate your children? Do you want to travel with your children? There are a limitless amount of questions you can discuss with your partner regarding your children.

, You and your partner should communicate your approaches to parenting. It is important to be consistent in a number of ways when raising a child.Consider being consistent in the following ways:


Establishing rules. For example, do you and your partner agree on what your child’s bedtime should be? Discuss your reasoning and perhaps compromise on a set time. Providing a united front to your child helps to promote respect.
Providing discipline. Do you and your partner agree on discipline techniques? For example, do you think that spanking is appropriate while your wife does not? It is important to discuss, to communicate, and to compromise on the discipline of your child. You want your child to respect both of you equally and not resent one of you for being too harsh.Setting schedules. Discuss creating a schedule on parenting duties. For example, which of you will be making the kids’ lunches before school? Which will be driving the kids to soccer practice? Establishing a schedule and a routine with your partner (and your children) helps establish routines and limits the chaos of miscommunication.

, Your children are learning from you and your spouse. Model the behavior you would like your children to learn.This is especially important when interacting with your spouse; you two should model what a healthy, loving relationship should look like.


Avoid name calling. Even if you are fighting with your spouse, you should avoid saying hurtful things, especially in front of the children. If you are angry at your partner, keep it civil as possible or talk to your partner in private. Calling your wife by derogatory names or swearing at your husband sets bad examples. Instead, say something like: “I really do not appreciate the tone you are taking with me right now, can we discuss this later?”
Show respect. Do not demean your partner, especially in front of the kids. This will reinforce bad behavior. For example, if your partner does something wrong or silly, do not ridicule him in front of the children. An example of this might be if your husband suggests that Africa is a country. Instead of calling your husband an idiot, saying something like: “Do you mean a continent? I believe Africa is made up a lot of different countries.”

, Do not expect your partner to do all of the parenting. Raising children should be a joint effort; be present in your child’s life.


Being absent as a parent may breed resentment in your marriage as well as with your children.If you have to work or travel a lot and know you will not be present, try to show that you are still thinking about your partner and your children. This might be using a video program or telephone call to talk to your family while you are away.

, There will be rocky situations when parenting where you and your partner may disagree on things. However, it is important to present a united front when your children get into trouble, be it among themselves or in the real world. Consider:


How will you and your partner stop your children from fighting amongst themselves? You do not want to distinguish a “bad guy” if one of you the designated peace-keeper. Instead, talk about how you can mediate squabbles together.

Prep in advance for visits.,
Take a time-out.,
Practice deep breathing.,
Do a body scan.,
Vent to a friend.,
Look at the big picture.,
Strive for common ground whenever possible.,
Accept criticism gracefully.Learning to take criticism is one of the most powerful skills you can develop in life, especially when it comes to your in-laws.,
Put your best foot forward.,
Try to see from their point-of-view.,
Be receptive to helpful solutions.,
Don’t hold out hope for approval.",How to Stay Calm Around Difficult In‐Laws," If you already have a strained relationship with your in-laws, it won’t help to be caught off guard. Whenever you can, prepare for their visits and reduce your overall stress in the process.Preparation can include anything from having a guest room or mother-in-law suite ready to having essentials on-hand to whip up a wholesome meal.


Being ready for a visit in advance ensures that you are able to make a positive impression and actually enjoy your in-laws rather than spending their entire visit trying to catch up.
Of course, an impromptu visit is bound to happen some of the time. However, it may be helpful to ask your in-laws if they can always show the courtesy of at least calling ahead before a visit.
While you may want to make everything perfect, do not stress out too much about preparing for their arrival. This may continue to make you feel tense during their visit.;
, If one of your in-laws says or does something that usually ignites a negative response from you, simply excuse yourself and grab a breather. Go into a room where you can have privacy before you say something you regret. Gain control of your emotions and collect your thoughts first.While you’re taking a time-out, it may be wise to brainstorm a few solutions to handle what just happened in an adaptive way. When you re-enter the environment what do you plan to do? Come up with some options.
Once your calm, rejoin the gathering and try to maintain your composure as best you can. Remember, no one can make you feel a certain way unless you give them permission. You are in complete control of how you respond.

, One of the major advantages to deep breathing is that it can be performed virtually anywhere. If your in-laws are getting under your skin, you may find this exercise to be most effective when completed during your time-out. However, as you become more practiced, you’ll find that you can use it to help you stay calm in the moment, too.


One type of deep breathing exercising is the 4-7-8 method. In this technique, you can practice by sitting comfortably in a chair or on a floor cushion. Inhale through your nose for about 4 counts. Hold the breath for 7 counts. Then, exhale slowly by releasing the air through your mouth. Repeat as needed., Another way to relieve tension is by performing a quick body scan meditation exercise. This form of meditation brings awareness to areas of tension in your body, allowing you to release the tension and relax. In general, you should dedicate about 20-45 minutes to this exercise for optimal results. However, if you incorporate it into your daily routine you will be able to complete the exercise more quickly in especially tense situations.Close your eyes, if you’d like. Direct your focus to your body. Notice how you’re seated, feeling the weight of your body on the chair or cushion. Notice how your feet feel on the floor. Breathe deeply. As you inhale, take in more invigorating oxygen. As you exhale, release tension.
Notice your legs, your back. Are these areas tense? If so, let go of the tension. Let it melt away. Continue breathing. Bring your attention to your stomach, your hands, your arms. Then, your neck and throat. Relax each area as you move through it. Then, notice your body as a whole, releasing any remaining tension as you inhale and exhale.

, You may immediately want to go to your spouse and share your frustrations. But, this may not always be a good idea. In some situations, your spouse may side with you. In others, he or she may side with your in-laws. To release the tension without causing issues in your marriage, it’s best to vent to a trusted person who is impartial to the situation.If you need to talk to someone immediately to let off steam, you can call your friend during one of your time-outs.

, Sometimes, particularly when it comes to close family relationships, you have to be willing to overlook minor things. If your in-laws are constantly baiting you, it may be smart on your behalf to selectively choose what you respond to.


Ask yourself how important the situation is. Will it matter to your next week? Next month? Next year? If not, recognize that it’s minor in the larger scheme of things and let it go.For example, your mother-in-law’s comment about your hair being unkempt won’t really matter over the long haul. On the other hand, if she’s making remarks about your choice of religion, you may want to address the issue upfront since it’s likely to keep popping up.
Always listen carefully to what your in-laws are saying. You want to make sure that you are addressing a current issue and not reacting because of past unresolved problems.

, When you and your in-laws are disagreeing about an issue, you can strive to maintain the peace by looking to your mutual interests. This is an important aspect of learning to choose your battles because you must be willing to meet in the middle in some situations. Common ground does not mean fully agreeing. It means finding a solution that everyone can live with.For example, your in-laws want to take the kids for a week, but you’re skeptical because they do not enforce bedtime. You can share your concerns by saying “I know that you want to spend quality time with them, but I worry that they will get mixed up with their bedtimes when they visit. If we agree to allow them to visit, can you agree that they go to bed at their usual bedtime?”

, Instead of allowing your father-in-law to get a rise out of you when he comments about you hiring a lawn service, let the comment roll off your back. You may feel a sting, but don’t let him have power over you by over-reacting.


In response to criticism, you can merely say “I appreciate your concern. I’ll keep that in mind” and go about your business.

, Sometimes, the strain in your relationship with difficult in-laws comes down to effort. Your in-laws may continue to give you a hard time because it seems like you don’t seem to care one way or another. Don’t forget this is your spouse’s mother or father—and, perhaps, your kids’ grandparent. Show respect and treat your in-laws like the family members that they are. Making a minimal effort could make a difference in the relationship.Putting in effort could look like phoning your in-laws to see how they are getting on, taking an interest in their lives, and showing appreciation for the help they give to your family.

, Having empathy can be especially challenging when you have a tense relationship with your in-laws. However, trying to see things from their point-of-view could improve your perception of them and vice versa.


For example, your mother-in-law complains “It seems you all spend every weekend at your parents’ home.” Instead of snapping back about how you actually like your own parents, try to think about where she’s coming from. Maybe your spouse doesn’t make too much of an effort to visit. Even though the comment is directed at you, it’s really an issue between the two of them. When you realize this, you won’t take so much offense.Changes in their behavior may be small, and it may take time for your relationship to improve. This is ok. Try to appreciate them when they are trying to resolve your differences, even if it still is tense.

, As much as you may not want to admit it, you may have your guard up so high against your in-laws that you are repelling their help. In turn, they may only press harder and double their remarks and opinions. As a part of trying to improve the relationship, keep an eye out for good advice that comes your way.


When your in-laws suggest practical tips that are feasible to your way of life, thank them and make an effort to implement these strategies. You shouldn’t let your strained relationship get in the way of you taking good advice.
It can also help to ask for advice every now and then. When your father-in-law comes around say “We’ve been having an issue with fire ants in the yard. Do you have any ideas about how to get rid of them?” Doing this can make your in-laws feel valued and even reduce the amount of unwanted advice they throw your way., Having a harmonious relationship with your in-laws would probably be a dream come true. Unfortunately, it may never happen. Although it’s helpful to make an effort to improve a tense relationship, you should never bend over backwards or change who you are for their approval."

Know the four styles of parenting.,
Start with authoritative parenting to set clear boundaries that your child understands.,
Consider authoritarian parenting if you’d like to run a strict household.,
Try permissive style parenting if you want to give your child unlimited freedom.,
Avoid uninvolved parenting whenever possible.,
Decide which style works best for you and your child.,
Make a plan to stick to your chosen style.",How to Choose a Parenting Style1," Although there are many ways to be a parent, psychologists often refer to four main parenting styles. The styles are authoritarian, permissive, authoritative, and uninvolved. Although many parenting styles have their pros and cons at a given time, most research suggests that children who grow up with authoritative styles tend to be more socially adjusted and do well in school. For the most part, children whose parents hold high expectations (authoritarian and authoritative) tend to be more successful than children whose parents have few expectations (permissive and uninvolved).;
, The authoritative style of parenting falls somewhere between authoritarian and permissive. These parents set high expectations, but also explain the logic behind the rules they have set. This form of parenting focuses on the needs of the child and the parent. Authoritative parents expect their children to act their age, to control their emotions, and to learn independence. Children in authoritative homes are nurtured by affectionate parents who allow them enough freedom to explore life.Prepare to talk to your child. Authoritative parenting involves explaining the reasoning behind most of your decisions. This style can be quite challenging when your child throws a temper tantrum when you’re in line at the grocery store. Patience, however, doesn’t mean accepting your child’s behavior, but rather correcting it in a way that makes sense to them.
Make adjustments for your child. Your child's behavior may range from extremely obedient to very disobedient. Try being a bit more lenient if you think they need to explore more. Conversely, you may need to create a more strict environment for children whose behavior puts them in danger.

, The authoritarian style of parenting involves hard set rules and high behavioral expectations of children. Parents who use this style of parenting do not explain their rules to their children, but they expect them to follow the rules without question. Children are taught to always respect authorities.Consider being authoritarian in certain situations. Some children need strict boundaries when it comes to things like behavior and academics. It is possible to be more authoritarian in cases where your child may not necessarily understand or agree with the rules.

, Permissive parenting requires few demands from children. The parents have few rules or expectations. If the children do something wrong, the permissive parent may not punish them. This type of parent is nurturing and affectionate and allows children to express themselves freely. Permissive parents are accepting of emotional outbursts, sometimes resulting in poor behavior.Use permissive styles carefully. Having low, or few, expectations of your child can make it harder for them to do well in work, school, and other situations outside of the household.
On the other hand, children whose behavior is outstanding and under control may benefit from a bit of freedom once in awhile.

, The uninvolved parent demands little from his or her children and only provides what is required for basic care. Uninvolved parenting is a hands-off style that does not involve discipline, affection, or redirection of any behavior. The children's emotional needs are largely ignored. As a result, children tend to have behavioral issues and tend to be unhappy.Compared to the other styles, children of uninvolved parents tend to be the least competent.Many parents are uninvolved because of substance abuse or other mental issues. Other parents are uninvolved because of the pressures of keeping work that sustains a family. If you are unable to be involved in your child’s life, ensure that another adult takes the reigns in your absence.

, Evaluate the parenting styles and decide which one fits best. Remember to think about the many adult figures your child will interact with as they grow up.


Consider your child's other parent. You may or may not be parenting on your own. If there are other adults involved, think about what style they are using. For example, If your child’s grandmother is very permissive, you might feel the need to balance that with a stricter, authoritative approach. Alternatively, you could talk to her about making a compromise between your two styles.
Think about the culture you are part of. Parenting varies across cultures. For example, your child may grow up in a culture of authoritarian adults. This may or may not be good for your child’s needs. Think about whether you want to balance this with a more democratic approach.

, Once you’ve made a choice to parent in a certain way, make every effort to stick to it. Parenting is challenging and practices, especially disciplining practices, can go out the window when things get tough. Find a way to stick to the style you’ve chosen.


Don’t worry if you have to make changes. Children change, so parenting must change too. Be open to adapting your style for the various situations that come up.You may not want to swing from one end to another and confuse your child, but being a bit more strict or lenient on some occasions may be appropriate.

Review the main parenting styles with others involved in raising the child.,
Divide parental responsibilities.,
Make a parenting plan.,
Check in to see if you are being effective.",How to Choose a Parenting Style2," You don’t have to decide on a parenting style on your own. If you are raising children with other adults, talk to them about what they believe is best for the child. You may refer to the parenting styles, or come up with a hybrid style of your own.

, In any household there is a lot of work to be done. With two parents, it is important that there is open communication about whose job it is to meet the various needs of your child. You'll have to agree on a clear division of labor for things to run smoothly. Who will take care of bath time? Who will cook dinner? These are good questions to work through before the stresses of being parents pile up., Come up with a set of practices that you will use to ensure that you see the desired outcome for you and your child. Have a conversation with the parents involved and create a clear guide for how you will handle parenting issues.


Talk about discipline and praise. Figure out when and how you will praise, discipline, and spend time with your child.
Talk about parenting duties. Decide how you will divide child care, finances, and household chores with your spouse or co-parent.

, Check in with your fellow parent (or parents) to see how things are going. Think back to what you wanted for your child when you first put together a parenting plan. Compare your child’s reality with your original expectations. If things are not going as planned, consider adjusting your strategies or changing your parenting style.Ask key questions to see if things are going well. Is your child doing well in school? Are they making good choices? Do they have significant friendships? Are they happy?

Think about what kind of person you want to your child to be.,
Ask your parents what they did with you.,
Talk to other parents.",How to Choose a Parenting Style3," Parents play a large role in shaping their children. You are not the only one who has a say in their personality, but you’ll be your child’s first teacher, protector, and friend. Think about what you need to do to mold your child into a person you (and your child) can be proud of.

, One way to choose a style is to refer back to what your parents did. For some people, thinking back to their own parenting is heart-warming, while for others it may cause trauma. Either way, most parents end up continuing the parenting cycle in some form, so take care in analyzing your family history. Consider asking your own parents about the techniques they used with you. Decide if you want to pass those experiences on to your own child., If you have a child or are expecting, chances are you already know a few people who have children of their own. Ask them about the strategies they use with their children.


Touch on key topics. Parenting is a large subject. You may want to come prepared with questions about specific topics like how to discipline, how much free time to allow, and how to split parenting responsibilities.

Be aware of the kind of person you strive to be.,
Set achievable goals.,
Prepare for success.,
Surround yourself with positive people.",How to Be the Best You Can Be1," Know who you want to be and be that person. Make a list of the most important qualities in your personality. If you find yourself deviating from those qualities, slow down and regain your composure.


For example, if you want to be a more patient person, come up with a plan to practice patience in stressful times, such as counting to ten.
Things like meditation, exercise, and spiritual practices can help you recenter yourself on who you want to be.Try making a list of your values to figure out what type of person you strive to be. Look over this list often to remind yourself.;
, When your goals are specific and achievable you are more apt to meet them and feel good about it. On the other hand, if you goals are vague and unrealistic you are more likely to get frustrated and forego all of your goals.For example, going to the dentist twice a year is a specific and achievable goal. On the other hand, improving your health is too broad and vague.

, Eliminate things that stress you out and slow you down. Try to be one step ahead instead of one step behind. Being prepared will help you feel less stressed and overwhelmed. Create routines for yourself that promote success.Prepare for the next day the night before. Lay out your clothes or pack your lunch.
Stop procrastinating and get your work done before any deadlines.
Come prepared to meetings.
Keep in mind that success is not a straight line. You will sometimes have setbacks, and this is all part of progressing towards your goal.

, Find friends that support you or whom you admire and surround yourself with positivity. Spend less time with friends that are always negative and not productive. Learn from people who are trying to be the best versions of themselves.Be a source of positivity for those friends as well.
You might also consider why you admire certain people. What qualities do they possess that you would like to have?

Take time to self-assess.,
Make a plan to achieve your goals.",How to Be the Best You Can Be2," Spreading yourself too thin can lead to trouble, so it is important to decide what is important to you and focus on that. If you have too much stuff, get rid of some of it. If you have too many commitments, get rid of some of them. Unnecessary things cloud your thoughts and make it hard to be the best that you can be.


Declutter your house. Having too much clutter around you has been linked with an inability to focus.Streamline your finances by coming up with a filing system or go paperless.
Limit your commitments outside of work. Choose one or two activities to commit to and do them well.

, Only put things on your “to-do list” that you will actually do. If you have more to do than you can handle, delegate that work to people who offer to help you.For example, if your child’s teacher requests that you direct the school Christmas play but you know that you are especially busy at Christmas time, feel confident saying “no”.

, Keep a journal of your thoughts and feelings to determine how you think and feel throughout the days. After some time read through your journal to find patterns of success and failure.Create a plan to minimize the failures in the future.

, Divide your goals into long-term and short-term goals. Set deadlines for these goals and develop a plan to push you towards achieving them. Consider using a daily planner to allocate the time you need to reach your goals.


Keep in mind that changing your habits takes time, so look for ways to help keep yourself motivated. Try posting motivational messages around for yourself or watch a motivational video on Youtube every day.

Start with a foundation of strong self-esteem.,
Study literature and art that treat the topic of leadership through inspiration (rather than control).,
As you learn, begin changing your thoughts to match those models you've encountered.

When you find yourself engaging in controlling behavior, look into yourself to see what motivated your actions.,
Recognize that a lot of controlling behaviors are a result of insecurity.,
Sometimes you just have to relax.,
Think about how others feel when you boss them around.",How to Become Less of a Control Freak," Any approach at giving up control should come from self-awareness and a desire for well-being, rather than from anything else. See esteem links below for more information. Any attempt to change at the core in this way, without self-esteem, will lead to continual setbacks and depression. It's not easy!;
, Writings such as Ben-Hur, the Koran, the Old and New Testaments, and Leadership and Self-Deception are excellent sources. Movies might include ""Bridge over the River Kwai"", ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"", ""Dead Poets Society"", and ""The Cowboys"". Dance forms would include most Ballroom Dance styles, including the West Coast Swing, the Waltz, and the Cha-Cha; plays might include ""Man of La Mancha (Don Quixote)"". Even ""Star Trek"" can show you inspiring leaders who aren't afraid to delegate critical responsibilities. There's a lot out there.

,, Was it fear? Was it a lack of trust? A big part of control is a fear of vulnerability. As you learn to open yourself up, you will find the connections with others that you have been missing.

, The need to take over, to be the one in control is often rooted in the idea that others are not as capable as you. Honestly evaluating your insecurity level will be crucial in gaining mastery over controlling attitudes.

, Let things go and move on. Nothing is going to be perfect, so you don't have to try for everything.

, Horrible. Like they're a child, and you're the adult, and you're in charge. Getting told what to do is no fun; think about that. It makes you come off as bossy and sort of mean.

, Your life is affected by the four aspects that are mental (brain), emotional (heart), spiritual (faith) and physical (body). Learn to maintain balance of the four aspects, for as Spice girls have sung, “Too much of something is bad”.

, The only person that suffers when you do not forgive is YOU. The other person is probably caring less of what you feel. Be kind to yourself and forget about it.

, The more you can adapt to change, the easier your life is because change can open bigger and better possibilities for you, if only you’d accept it.

, Seeing a new place let you discover and learn more of other things in your life. It helps you expand your perspective and horizon.

, The best way to live is through continuously learning. Try to be better than “normal” yourself. Keep expanding and growing.

, Just like the swimming lessons you’ve always wanted to take back in high school. Remember that you’d never be too old to learn and discover where you really can win and be happy.

, We should not wait for memories to happen, we should make memories happen. Find time to create memories with others. Make a note of each moment you do not want to forget, both the good and bad. Read your journal once in a while to see how far you’ve gone along. Surely, it will make you SMILE.

, The ability to retrieve a memory decreases exponentially unless boosted by artificial aids like photographs and videos. Start taking those pictures you’d like to look back in your old days.

, Nothing beats a cheerful heart and mind. Be happy regardless. Make the world a better place to live in. Start sharing your sweet smile.

, To learn more about yourself is by being more exposed in to new people and learning from them. It will help you and everyone else grow; we evolve at the rate of the tribe we are plugged into.

, The old saying would always be true, “The more you give, the more you receive”. Our value as human being resides on what we can give and not on our capacity of receiving. Start spreading goodness by giving.

, There’s no better stress reliever than the joy and positive feeling given by the free spirit of a young one.

, Listening to the old ones makes you a year wiser. Remember, the best way to learn and avoid extreme failure is through the experiences of others.

, Do not be afraid to make mistake. Most successful people have gone through multiple failures. A great treasure of wisdom is hidden on every failure.

, Life is full of chances and you do not live if you do not take chances. As they say, the higher the risk the higher possibility of success.

, Who said that boys and big girls don’t cry? You need to cry, it eases the burden and it'll make you feel better and/or fall asleep.

, Who wins in an argument? Keep yourself from arguments. Nothing is solved with a heated talk. Learn to listen to what others may say without necessary believing and taking them as true for you.

, Reward yourself for a days’ work. Take that break, you deserve it and you need it in re-energizing yourself to another day of work.

, The most stressed people are those who do not know how to work smart. Do not take the entire task to yourself. Remember, you are not alone in this world. Learn to maximize and trust the abilities of others. It’s not a weakness to ask for help.

, Don’t try to act like someone else just to please everyone. You don’t have to, plus you can’t. Stand firm to who you are. Eventually, you’d discover who are worth keeping in your life from those who are not.

, People don’t care how much you know, they want to know how much you care. Start caring and let the people know that you care. Remember, that relationship is more lasting than accomplishments and prestige.

, Take a time to be with yourself and be silent. Such can relax the fast-pace life you are in and helps you discover more of whom you are and who you can become.

, Life is a journey. As you go along your journey, set your maps. Discover the right you at the right place and time. To help you discover, ask yourself, “If there was no praise or criticism in the world, then who would you be?” Once you know the answer, you are right there.

, Do not live for yourself alone; remember that there are other people and creatures that surrounding this world. Even if unaware, every move and action you take creates an effect to others. Learn to take responsibility of your actions. And start contributing your knowledge and experience for the benefit of the whole world.

Express your commitment to your family or significant other.,
Show your family you are committed.,
Demonstrate loyalty.,
Modify the emphasis you place on work.,
Do an overhaul of your to-do list for work and chores.",How to Be More Family Oriented1," Being family oriented does not mean that you need to neglect everything else in your life to be with your family. However, it does involve an intentional shift in mindset to prioritize your family. One way to increase your family orientation is to clearly convey your commitment to them.


You may say: “I want you to know I really value your presence in my life, and I am here for our family. I love you and care about you.” Saying words such as these can go a long way in helping your significant other or family members feel secure in your commitment to them.;
, Telling your family about your commitment is a solid first step in becoming family oriented; however, showing your family your commitment through actions will solidify your family orientation mindset. Those that are family oriented often value each other’s happiness and well-being and also cherish the unity that comes from a committed family.If your significant other is going through a crisis, cancel your other plans and ask them how you can help them get through this difficult time. If your child is performing in their first play, make time to go see it and support them. Actively showing your family they come first is a big step in becoming family oriented.

, Commitment involves a sense of loyalty and devotion, which can strengthen your relationships with your family. You can do this by standing up for your family members if someone bad mouths them, or staying faithful to your significant other even during difficult times in your relationship.


Stand by your family in times of success and happiness but also in times of despair. Being family oriented means supporting your family no matter the circumstances. If your significant other loses their job and finances become difficult, or someone in your family becomes chronically ill, continue to stand with your family and be supportive and helpful through these times.

, Oftentimes becoming family oriented means changing your mindset regarding other big obligations in your life, such as your job. Showing your family your commitment and appreciation may involve shifting some of your thoughts and behaviors regarding your work life.Consider cutting back on work hours or talk to your boss about taking on a little bit less responsibility as you make the shift to becoming more family oriented. You could say: “I’m trying to show my family my commitment and am trying to make them a bigger priority. I am still committed to this job but want to take on a little less right now.”
Create boundaries regarding your work. It is easy to try to fit in a little bit of work during every free minute you have, and soon you might find yourself constantly sending emails at 2 am when you should be sleeping, or during evenings while watching TV with your family. Therefore, creating boundaries regarding your work will be helpful in making sure you are giving more attention to your family., This is especially important if you have large, busy families, and you are not only trying to manage yourself, but also your spouse and children. Focusing too much on the to-do list can cause one to lose track of family time that requires just as much care and attention. Look at your list and reorganize it into three sections: Don’t, Delegate, and Do.

Don't: There are always a few things on your list you know very well you don't have the time for, so just take them off your list so you can stop worrying about them.
Delegate: Other things on your list are really things that you should be asking a coworker or another family member to help with. Delegate these tasks to the proper people so they get done the right way. Remember that trying to do everything yourself is rarely a sound strategy.
Do: Now your to-do list should be pared down to the things that really should be on it. Not only will your family thank you for the extra time you will be making with them, you will also feel much less stressed in the long run.

Have one-on-one conversations.,
Express honesty and support.,
Listen to those in your family and value their opinion.,
Get to know each other’s world.",How to Be More Family Oriented2," Intentionally spend some alone time with each member of your family so that you can develop a deep bond with each person on an individual level. This might be a time when you explore an interest you both share, or talk about an issue that has been bothering one of you. It can also be a time you express your appreciation and support of this family member., Strong families place a big emphasis on talking to one another in an open and honest way. At times, families that have depth and commitment experience conflict because of this honest communication. However, this conflict can lead to stronger and deeper family relationships.Communicate your needs as well as your concerns in an assertive, yet kind, manner in order to create healthy boundaries and show support for your family members. If you are experiencing a conflict with your significant other, you could say: “When you constantly point out my flaws, it makes me feel inadequate. I know you’re trying to help me improve, but I wonder if you can communicate with me in a way that is more constructive.”

, Being family oriented means caring about the thoughts and opinions of those in your family. Close-knit families frequently ask each other for advice about tough situations and value the perspective of their family members.


You might say: “I’m feeling really undervalued at work and don’t know how to talk to my boss about this. Can I talk to you? I think I need someone to listen and offer an outside perspective.”

, Family members can start to get isolated when everyone lives in the same house but leads separate lives without any connection. Therefore, when working on becoming family oriented, it is important to get to know the people and activities in your family’s lives.


Create a family calendar with important dates and activities. A family calendar will give everyone a glimpse of the “big picture” and will allow all family members to schedule around important commitments. If your partner has a big show coming up, or your son has a tournament in a couple weeks, it is easier to block off these times to spend with your family when you have a centralized location to remind you of these events.Meet significant people in each other’s lives. Becoming family oriented means knowing and understanding important areas in each family member’s life, including other significant people. Tell your husband that you are interested in meeting some of his work friends, or plan a night that your daughter can invite her soccer team over to the house. Showing interest in your family’s friends will communicate that you want to know about all aspects of their lives."

Enjoy dinner together.,
Plan a weekly family outing.,
Have lunch with your partner.,
Plan a weekday family outing.,
Acknowledge and cherish simple in-between moments.,
Develop new family traditions together.,
Do mundane tasks together.",How to Be More Family Oriented3," Mealtime can be a significant period each day that allows for enriching conversation and family bonding. In addition, it can be a relatively short time commitment in your own home that does not detract significantly from other obligations.Focus on making dinner time with your family enjoyable. Tell jokes, have light conversation, and pay compliments to one another.
Set a goal to have positive and productive conversations around the table. Perhaps every member of the family can share one good part of their day, or can ask family members for constructive feedback or support if something went wrong that day.
Turn off all technological devices during dinner, including the television, phone, computers, and tablets. Make sure the attention is only focused on each other and the meal at hand.
Have special family dinner nights. Once a week, cook a meal together, or have a “themed” night, such as homemade pizza night, or a taco bar. Include the family on planning and executing these meals so that each member feels ownership over this quality time spent together.

, Set aside one night per week that is spent with your family, and no one else. Have one person plan the activity each week, and alternate who picks the activity from week to week. Be proactive in blocking off this night and telling friends and colleagues that you are unable to participate in other activities during this particular evening.

, If you and your significant other work within a few miles of one another, make plans to have lunch together once a week. It's all about finding creative ways to spend time together. If you make a schedule of how you use your time, you will probably realize you have pockets of time throughout the day that are ineffectively utilized, such as lunch hours. If you are finding yourself never seeing your family, use these stretches of time to fit in family activities!, Many places throughout the city have discounted or even free tickets on weekdays since most people do not frequent site-seeing locales throughout the week. If you find out that a museum has free admission on a Thursday, or a botanical garden has discounted tickets on a Monday, see if you can arrange an outing with one or more members of your family that have flexible work hours or a day off!

, Bonding with your family and becoming more family-oriented is not about planning out every interaction. It is about simply living and honoring every bit of time you have with your children or partner. Our bonding and connecting experiences with our immediate families are not just about the trips we go on or the outings we plan. Some of the warmest, most charming and emotionally enriching experiences occur in ordinary, everyday life.

How do we become more mindful of these ‘in-between’ moments? It’s about listening to your partner and children to honor and give thanks for the things they share with you. Do your best to avoid giving commands or criticism during simple daily conversations. Show non-verbal signs of affection such as smiling, a pat on the back, a kiss on the cheek or a hug.

, You don't have to wait for a special holiday or birthday to bond with your family. Together you can create little, simple, and fun traditions. This could be going out on the weekends for breakfast, or making an extra special Sunday dinner. It could be a day of shopping each month, or a movie night at a favorite theater. If the weather is warm, purchase some flowers and plants, and have a family gardening party. It doesn’t matter what tradition you and your family invent, just make it special by incorporating something that everyone will get some enjoyment out of., Grocery shopping, cleaning the house, and yard work are all opportunities to get the family together! If one of your kids loves cooking, ask them to help you in the kitchen. If your spouse is just watching television, ask them if they’d like to come with you to run a few errands. These seemingly boring tasks are sneaky avenues of bonding with your family members."

Keep your word.,
Instill core values.,
Be willing to admit mistakes.,
Use your past failings as life lessons for younger relatives.",How to Be a Role Model to Younger Relatives1," One of the most important things that you can teach a child is being reliable as an adult. Many young kids may not have parents or other relatives that are dependable. Adults may promise one thing and then do something else. They may not be there on time, or at all.When you make plans to spend time with your niece or nephew for example, be there when you said you’d show up. Set aside time to be with them. If a friend invites to do something else, prioritize your time with your niece or nephew first.
If your young cousin has a soccer match coming up, and you agreed to go, then make sure to put that down on a calendar. If something else comes up, make sure to contact them at least a day in advance to let them know you’re not coming. Avoid accidentally forgetting to show up.;
, As a role model, you are a source of wisdom and inspiration. You help others to understand what matters in life. Many children may have role models like professional athletes, singers, or actresses, but they also need real-life role models that help them to understand morals and ethics.


Talk with them about real-life people that you admire, and what qualities make those role models special.
Give your younger relatives examples of people who have made an impact for good. Use examples of people in your community. Sometimes historical figures can also provide a good perspective.
Demonstrate to them what responsibility, respect, and integrity look like. Take this to heart in your own daily actions. If you’re taking a trip to the store with your younger relatives, think about ways you can model behaviors of respect when interacting with other shoppers, or when making purchases that show responsibility., Avoid acting like you’re too good or know better than to make mistakes. If you’re calm and understanding, you’ll help to teach your young relatives that it’s okay to make mistakes in life. Show them that you can overcome and move forward after a mistake. Consider saying, ""Yes, I messed up on this, but I am ready to make it better."" Demonstrate that you take initiative after making a mistake in order to correct it.
Show them that you are realistic when mistakes happen. Consider saying, ""I know I made a mistake. I will make every effort to address it. Remember that we all make mistakes, but it's about what you do afterwards that matters.""

, For example, let’s say that you got in trouble back in high school for skipping classes to hang out with friends. Explain to them the consequences of your behavior. Maybe you got disciplined by the school administration? Or had low grades that semester? Tell them how you overcame the situation and what you learned.


If you’re having some arguments with your relatives, think about how you would react if your younger relatives were in the room. Be calm and focus on ways to be mature in your opinions when talking with your family members.
Talk with your young relatives about mistakes that you or others have made. Ask them how they might have handled the situation themselves.
For example, you could approach a topic about mistakes in this way--""What do think about when getting caught for being tardy to class? I used to get sent to detention after being late three times. How do you think you'd handle the situation after being late?""

"
"
Accept others.,
Show commitment to your community.,
Be an emotional support.,
Make them feel safe.",How to Be a Role Model to Younger Relatives2," Focus on similarities rather than differences between you and your relatives. Even if you don’t have similar lifestyles or upbringing, there may be ways to connect them in a loving and accepting way. Give other people the benefit of the doubt, rather than assuming the worst.


For example, let’s say that your relatives watch certain TV shows or love certain video games. Maybe you have a different taste in things. Be willing to try these new things that they enjoy.
Let them be “the teacher” about certain things they like. Consider asking them things like, ""I see you like playing this video game. Tell me about some of the characters you like. What kinds of powers do they have?""
Avoid being negative about certain activities just because they are kid-oriented. Let’s say you’re in high school and you are hanging out with your eight year old cousin who wants to play with dolls. Avoid making them feel bad about what they like even if you think that playing with dolls isn’t fun or cool.

, If you’ve got some one-on-one time with your younger relatives, or maybe you’re baby-sitting them, consider taking them to different places other than just shops or play places. If you’re active in your own community through small business, local government, or the creative arts, show them what you do.For example, let’s say that you’re an artist, and they are planning to show your art class’s works at a local community center. Consider taking them to see the community center and the art work.
Explore local history with your younger relatives. Maybe there are old factories, stores, parks, or museums in your town that highlight what life was like many years ago. Help them to appreciate their community through history.
Teach them to appreciate and respect others in their community.

, Being a role model may also mean giving your support and undivided attention when you’re available and able to do so. Some young kids may have difficulty coping with stressors at school or at work. Focus on what they need and talk about what’s bothering them.Use active listening skills. Keep good eye contact. Provide validation if they’re talking about something difficult for them. Consider saying, “It sounds like that’s difficult” or “That’s a tough situation.”
Provide reassurance that they have support through you and others. Open up about what you can do to help or what support you can offer. Consider saying, ""I know you're going through a difficult time. Just know that I'm here for you. You can come to me if you need to talk about anything.""
Give hugs when they’re hurting. Give high-fives when they do something well. This helps to build their confidence.

, Give young children a “secure base” where they can feel safe. If you’re visiting your younger relatives, and their home life is chaotic, then find other places such as your home or safe public places that make them feel secure. And vice versa, if they are anxious when in public, find out ways to make them feel protected in those public spaces.With young children under 10, keep a watchful eye on where they are and what they’re doing particularly in public spaces. Don’t let them wander too far without supervision.
Avoid taking them to places that may involve vulgar behavior or make them feel uncomfortable.
Don’t have them watch movies or TV that is mature in its content, particularly if it is scary or violent.

"
"
Inspire others with what interests you.,
Do activities that promote confidence and personal growth.,
Laugh and have fun.",How to Be a Role Model to Younger Relatives3," Role models help others to find their passions. If you show your excitement about sports, art, cooking, or something else, you can help others be inspired too. Share your interests with your younger relatives. Find ways for them to be involved.If you love to play basketball, get your younger relatives to join you. They may not able to play at the level you’re at, but you can help to teach them the basics.
If you love to bake, ask your younger relatives to help out. Have patience that it may take them more time to learn, but they will be rewarded by helping.
Take them to events where they can learn about different careers, hobbies, and cultures. Consider things like a local food festival or craft fair in your area.

, Find activities that are fun but challenging. Find things that are age appropriate. Be confident in what you’re doing with them. Make them feel special by including them in something that you both can enjoy.


If they’re under 6, find toys and activities that help them to learn basic problem-solving and creative thinking skills like building something out of wooden blocks or learning how to do basic dance steps.
If they’re under 12, find activities that might involve exploring the outdoors or teaching them how to build or make something using craft supplies.
If they are teenagers, it may involve helping with a class project, taking them to a local art show, or volunteering together with a local non-profit.

, Be a friend to your younger relatives. Don’t act like you’re smarter or better than them. Make them feel at ease.


If they do something childish or mess up in some way, don’t laugh at them or make them feel judged.
It’s better to be laughing together and finding something you both can share. Show them silly cat videos online or other silly, age appropriate things.
Take this time to remember what it was like to be their age.

Consider the composition of the Universe and the cycles of the Solar System.,
Consider physical, mental, emotional and ethical reflexes and the freedom of the will to make decisions from among options.,
Consider the science of attraction.,
Consider the way in which a human being is a microcosm of the macrocosm of existence.,
Consider that there may be a symbology and numerology of nature.",How to Celebrate Wholesome Bliss," There are some who postulate that the Universe is as old as time itself. Time and space are inextricably linked and matter and energy occupy the fabric of space-time.

The Planet Earth rotates once each day (i.e., once every twenty-four hours), and the inhabitants spend approximately twelve hours in substantial darkness when half of the planet is hidden from the Sun, and twelve hours in substantial light when half of the planet is exposed to the Sun.



 


The excessively hot core of the Planet Earth is enveloped by a viscous layer known as the mantle which is in turn enveloped by the hard crust.
Also, the Planet Earth is orbited by the Moon, and it (along with the Moon and other uninhabited planets) orbits the Sun (i.e. one of many stars) in one of many galaxies.






The Moon encircles the Earth once every twenty-eight days whereas the Earth and the Moon encircle the Sun once every three hundred and sixty-five days and a quarter of a day.
The eight major planets orbiting the Sun are categorized as: the inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, and the outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Saturn is a ringed planet located in sixth place from the Sun and its ball and ring may be viewed as symbolic of acceptance and fulfillment.






There are approximately thirty days in a month and there are twelve months in a year. The four seasons of the year are winter, spring, summer and autumn. The winter months are the coldest whereas the summer months are the hottest.
The seven identified colors of a rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet and a prism can separate white light into these colors. A rainbow is a natural example of how unity may coexist with diversity.






Existence may be divided into living things and non-living things. The Planet Earth is a beautiful habitat for plants, animals and people.
The Planet Earth features mountains, valleys, plains, volcanoes and basins occupied by water.






The heat from the Sun causes water to evaporate into the air, which cools to form clouds, and this water falls to the Planet Earth from clouds as rain.
Gravity exerts somewhat of a depressive force on objects, attracting materials towards the core of the Earth, and it also exists around and between objects, and keeps celestial bodies in their respective motions. Plants consume energy from the Sun, and internalize water and nutrients from the ground. Plants also grow towards the Sun or a source of light.






Celestial sights and sounds that appear and perform from time to time are lightning that dances and thunder that sings with suspected fury. Natural disasters which pose a threat to life and property include earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes and wild fires.
Air, water, food, and sleep are necessary for the survival of each individual human being and heterosexual reproductive activity is necessary for the survival of the species.






Herbivores are animals which consume plants exclusively, carnivores are animals which consume animals exclusively, and omnivores are animals which have the capacity to consume plants and animals. Human beings are omnivores and are situated at the top of the food chain. Plants are constrained by their attachment to the Planet Earth whereas the mobile capabilities of biological entities range from the ability to swim in water, to moving around on land and flying in the air.
The Sun is a spherical gaseous object which emits immense quantities of light, whereas the Moon is a rocky spherical object, with a reflective surface, which houses and empties itself of the light from the Sun. The Moon waxes full and wanes empty which entails phases ranging from non-existent to partial to peak brilliance and the full moon is the phase of the Moon which entails the maximum reflection of light.





;
, The body is a vehicle, which houses the vehicle of the brain, whereas the will occupies the brain, and is the driver of both vehicles.

Homo sapiens are regarded as the crown jewel on the biological horizon in a manner reminiscent to the way in which: the great white shark is deemed the chief predator of the seas, the lion is regarded as the king of the jungle and the eagle is christened as the presidential navigator of the air.






Governments serve as the parents and leaders of the citizens of a nation and there is a concomitant duty to establish and preserve order in society through laws and law enforcement agencies which operate to protect life, dignity and property and to promote stability and upward mobility. The brain governs the body in a manner somewhat analogous to the way the laws of nature govern the cosmos.
Human beings belong to the most advanced category of organisms in terms of the possession of a holistic awareness of the existence of all of space and all of time and the ability to communicate with respect to the content of such an awareness.






Words are thought packages which can be used to convey ideas, feelings, instructions and questions from one mind to another. The will is the decision-making aspect of a person which flies freely when a person is awake, and voluntarily initiates those activities of the brain and the body which are not reflexive. The will translates events from the personal mental universe of dreams to the common physical universe of destiny.
At an advanced stage of emotional development the fate of the brain and body are hijacked from the hands of the emotions into the hand of the conscious decision-maker.






In the reproductive process, the mature female person houses the unborn human being for approximately nine months and endures the suffering as the body of the young person separates from her body during childbirth.
A person’s skull is permanently united with his or her ribcage at the top of his or her body whereas the skull of an infant separates from his or her mother’s pelvis during childbirth. An umbilical cord connects an unborn human being to his or her mother and this is the structure through which nutrition is obtained prior to delivery.






This attachment is severed subsequent to delivery and forms an obsolete mouth of the pelvis (i.e. the navel) and the child proceeds to obtain nourishment from the breasts on the ribcage of his or her mother. Therefore, the pelvis may be viewed as a house of separation, liberation and hunger whereas the ribcage may be viewed as a house of togetherness, captivity and generosity.
For generations, human beings have celebrated existence, life, and love with the artistic display and enjoyment of delightful food, engaging music, and rhythmic dancing.






Birth ceremonies, marriage ceremonies, and death ceremonies signify the three most momentous events of a person’s life. Death is symbolic of separation, marriage is symbolic of union and birth is symbolic of growth.
Plants are constrained by their attachment to the Planet Earth similar to the way in which a person’s skull is attached to his or her ribcage.






Animals are free to move around similar to the way in which the attachment between an infant and his or her mother is severed.
People are free to fly due to the human capacity to formulate instructions with the inner and outer voice. There is also a steady inhalation and exhalation mechanism which involves the automatic and possibly free pulling inward and pushing outward of air from a person’s head.






There is a natural mental signal to exclusively pursue pleasant sensations and to avoid all unpleasant sensations. Concomitantly, laughter is the expression associated with feeling high and tears are the expression associated with feeling low. Pleasure is usually a means to an end but in human beings the pursuit and enjoyment of pleasure and elevation may constitute an end in and of itself.
The Universe has certain natural quality benchmarks to be met in the sense that organisms must qualify to survive and reproduce.






There is a natural predisposition to reject the members of a species perceived as inferior and to accept the members of a species perceived as superior. Love is the act of recognizing and maximizing the inherent value of an entity. Love is generally regarded as the most uplifting and magical emotion that a person can experience.
Love is typically expressed by way of carefully observing a person, maintaining physical closeness, exchanging passionate words, arduous actions and meaningful gifts. If a person’s natural inertia, or reluctance to work, is not regulated, then it may result in wasted time, un-utilised energy and a lower standard of living for him or her.






Each person has the capacity to assess what is possible at a given moment, and to personally decide upon a course of action or inaction or upon a choice of words or silence from among his or her options. A person’s internal nature emotionally rewards personally constructive behavior and emotionally punishes personally destructive behavior. Each human being has a name, or a group of symbols, which are representative of him or her. Each person also has an innate ambition for his or her name, as well as for himself or herself to be held in the highest possible esteem.

, Human beings have a natural desire to be sophisticated and impressive physically and mentally and there is also an innate desire to appear and perform more impressively than others of the same gender.

Relationships tend to be the most fulfilling aspect of life and the play of being hungry for each other should be balanced with the work of being happy to help each other survive and thrive. Romantic relationships are characterized by an intense physical, mental, and emotional connection between two people as each endeavors to solicit and retain the full attention of the other. With regard to competing for a romantic partner, it is quite obvious that if another person is more attractive than a particular person, then there is a greater chance of this particular person being ignored by some potential romantic partner due to the presence of the more attractive person.






The five standard senses used for an evaluation of things in the physical realm are seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, and tasting. The eyes feature the unity of love and the ears feature the separation of fear. The nose protrudes as a mountain on display and the mouth is a receptive basin. The skin captures the oneness of existence. Sights and sounds have a duplicating feature which allows them to be recorded. There are pleasant and unpleasant sensations which may be experienced with each sense organ.
Artificial ornaments which have been utilized in the protection and advertisement of the human body and his or her status of wealth include clothing, jewelry, houses and cars, whereas natural ornaments include a person’s skin, hair, teeth and nails.






The skull of a human being is conferred with the prestige of an elaborate mane. Hair is coveted as decoration for the face, and the eyes are also completely encircled with hair referred to as eye lashes which are in turn partially encircled with hair referred to as eye brows.
Strands of hair emanate from the skull in a similar manner to the way in which rays of light emanate from the Sun and the brows of the eyes regally spread across the forehead like the wings of a bird in flight. The colors and textures of eyes, skin, and hair, range from dark to light.






The texture of skin and hair ranges from hard to soft. Exposure to the Sun darkens the complexion of the skin whereas the lack of exposure to the Sun lightens the complexion of the skin. Hair and nails are rooted in the body but are dead materials which continue to grow as long as a person is alive and may be cut without the sensation of pain. The skull may be viewed as a house of knowledge, the ribcage as a house of strength, and the pelvis as a house of beauty.
It has been observed that males tend to have greater capacity with regard to physical strength whereas females tend to have greater capacity with regard to physical beauty.






The capacity to acquire knowledge is more or less balanced between genders and there is an innate capacity to interpret situations that is called intuition.
The skull and spine of human beings assume more of an upright posture, and it is apparent that the average height of males exceeds the average height of females.






Health and fitness are universally appealing and men tend to flaunt muscles whereas women tend to flaunt curves.
A skull has a more or less standard structure, however, the ribcage and pelvis of a person may be structured as a pear, hourglass, ruler or an apple. A pear is structured with a narrow ribcage and a wide pelvis, and depicts a love in tandem with fear relationship. An hourglass is structured with a wide ribcage and a wide pelvis separated by a slender waist and depicts a fear in tandem with fear relationship. A ruler is structured with a narrow ribcage and a narrow pelvis and depicts a love in tandem with love relationship. An apple is structured with a wide ribcage and a narrow pelvis and depicts a fear in tandem with love relationship.
The spine is rooted in the pelvis, the ribcage is attached to the middle of the spine, and the entire spinal column supports the skull. Two limbs are attached to the ribcage and two limbs are attached to the pelvis. The upper limbs (i.e. the arms) culminate with two hands, each having five fingers, and the lower limbs (i.e. the legs) culminate with two feet, each having five toes. The legs are united whereas the arms are separate. The 2 legs, the 2 arms, and the 1 spinal column amount to 5 which may be segmented as 3 groups in this instance.






The tripartite structure of the human anatomy may be viewed as a primary grouping of the pelvis and the legs, a secondary grouping of the ribcage and the arms and a tertiary grouping of the skull and the spine.
Each of the lower limbs has the upper leg, the lower leg and a foot and each of the upper limbs has the upper arm, the lower arm and a hand. The skull, the hands and the feet feature the contrast of light with darkness and feature a characteristic of wholesome growth such as hair on the scalp of the skull and nails on the hands and feet.
Each hand consists of four regular fingers and one opposable thumb. The five fingers may be considered as: the two lower fingers (i.e. the pinky and the ring finger) and the two upper fingers (i.e. the middle finger and the index finger) and the thumb. The thumb may be viewed as the head finger or the finger of wholeness. The hands are able to grasp, and the fingers, toes, hands, and feet, may be utilized for the quantification and measurement of things, events, and qualities. Each of the five fingers may be represented by the five elements of earth, water, wind, darkness and light.

, Reality refers to all that exists and happens and includes the awareness of such.

The three branches of science are: chemistry, which explores the composition of what exists in relation to space, physics, which explores causes and effects of events in relation to time, and biology, which explores the makeup and processes of organisms as conscious entities that are mortal.






The six directions of space are Up, Down, North, South, West and East, the three aspects of time are past, present and future, the three states of matter are solid, liquid and gas, and the light of awareness is contrasted with the darkness of ignorance. In solids the particles are tightly packed, in liquids the particles are more loosely arranged and in gases the particles are scattered.
Matter is made up of atoms and the main subatomic particles are protons, which are positively charged, electrons, which are negatively charged, and neutrons, which are neutral.
A person is an awareness occupying his or her brain, which is housed by his or her skull, which is closely connected to his or her ribcage, and this is distantly connected to his or her pelvis.
The pelvis may be viewed as symbolic of space by virtue of a mother’s pelvis which houses an unborn human being, the ribcage may be viewed as symbolic of time by virtue of the heart which occupies the ribcage and beats with a repetitive tempo, and the skull may be viewed as symbolic of matter by virtue of the brain which occupies the skull and houses the energy of the will.






The heart is a strong and rhythmic pump, which consists of four chambers, and which circulates blood around the body, and the brain may be divided into the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere, and is the control center for the body.
The scalp of the skull is typically hidden by hair and represents darkness and ignorance whereas the face is exposed and represents light and knowledge. The face of a mature female is usually more exposed than the face of a mature male. The symbol of occupant depicts masculinity and the symbol of house depicts femininity.






A child is an interwoven wholeness growing out of the blissful union of his or her father with his or her mother.
The pelvis may be viewed as a feminine house of beauty shadowed by ugliness, the ribcage as a masculine house of strength shadowed by weakness, and the skull as a neutral house of knowledge shadowed by ignorance.






The buttocks reject the death-suggesting waste of harm from the pelvis, the breasts of a mother offer the life-sustaining food of help from the ribcage, and the head transcends categorization as masculine or feminine and signifies neutrality.
The bodies of females tend to resemble the shape of a pear due to a wider pelvis, the bodies of males tend to resemble the shape of an apple due to a wider ribcage, and the body of a child may be symbolically represented as a mango or a skull by virtue of the way in which the Sun is centered at the helm of the Solar System.






The skin of the mango is symbolic of the outer protective skull, the watery pulp is symbolic of the grey matter of the brain, and the seed is symbolic of the energy of awareness.
A female who has reached the age of puberty typically operates according to a 28-day menstrual cycle which begins with a 5-day purging of old material from the lining of the womb in a flow of blood and this cycle repeats itself until late adulthood and is suspended during pregnancy. The schedule of the Moon orbiting the Planet Earth and the schedule of a mature female’s menstrual cycle are concurrent and the Moon influences the tides of the ocean.






3 is typically interpreted as the number of wholeness and growth as the feminine and masculine opposites of duality transcend their boundaries to unite as one in magnificent celebration.
A child partakes of life hidden in the mother’s pelvis prior to birth before partaking of life exposed in the supposed domain of the father after birth, and the awareness is hidden from the physical body by the maternal brain when asleep and exposed to the paternal physical body when awake.






Therefore, a mother of space (i.e. the pelvis) and a father of time (i.e. the ribcage) has been juxtaposed (connected by the neck) with a child of matter and energy (i.e. the skull).
The 3 dimensions of space, the 3 tenses of time, the 3 states of matter and the contrast between darkness and light amount to 11 aspects of existence. This structure describes a family of 4 which may arguably be construed as a family of 3 because matter and energy are scientifically interchangeable.







, This may be encrypted in characteristics of nature as well as provide guidance to the species from nature as represented via natural appetites and this feature of nature may be purely natural or may involve divine design. Sophistication of form and/or function usually necessitates prior design. Life is uniformly characterized by the existence of opposites.

Be mindful that the relationships in nature are comprised of the feminine aspect, the masculine aspect, and the transcendent aspect of wholeness in a manner analogous to the significance of the colors black, white and gray. The color black absorbs energy whereas the color white reflects energy. The color gray is a balanced mixture of the color black and the color white.






In sexual relations between a male and a female, the male is the solidified donor and the female is the liquefied recipient and this is analogous to the celestial relationship between the Sun which gives light for the Moon to reflect. The color black takes whereas the color white gives thus suggesting that the color black is a feminine characteristic whereas the color white is a masculine characteristic. The union of a male and a female facilitates wholesome growth.
The relentless masculine Sun and the elegant feminine Moon apparently serve as parents to the transcendent explosion of life known as the Planet Earth.
Analogically, the house and occupant relationship is featured in reproductive activity between a female and a male, in an unborn child residing within an expecting mother and in an entity of life residing within the cosmos.






In human beings, the two female egg-producing glands are the ovaries, which are located separate from each other, whereas the two male egg-producing glands are the testes, which are located together. The union of moving toward an object of pursuit may possibly be interpreted as the masculine force of love, the separation of moving away from an object of avoidance may possibly be interpreted as the feminine force of fear, and wholesome freedom transcends a fixed direction.
Psychologists have documented the survival instinct, the pleasure principle, the will to superiority, the sex drive of social inclination and the identity crises as universal natural influences on the behavior of humanity. Therefore, the trichotomous forces may be delineated as feminine fear, masculine love and wholesome freedom. The inherent articles of fear are proposed as death, pain, inferiority, isolation and self-ignorance and the inherent articles of love are proposed as life, pleasure, superiority, connection and self-knowledge. An awareness of this psychological heritage of humanity facilitates more opportunities for empathetic interaction between people.






The masculinity of the male gender is epitomized by the male reproductive organ which is high, sensitive and erect whereas the femininity of the female gender is epitomized by inner and outer lips which hearken of a hereditary or artificially induced fullness that may appear in the lips on the face of a person decorating the skull, the breasts of a woman decorating the ribcage, and the buttocks of a person decorating the pelvis. The male reproductive apparatus also features a sac of reproductive material and the female reproductive apparatus features a miniature erect sensitivity.
A banana is reminiscent of a penis and a strawberry is reminiscent of a clitoris. Additionally, a mountain is illustrative of a penis and a basin is illustrative of a vagina.
The pelvic bone of some females is legendarily enamoring with outward curves of beauty whereas the triumph of masculinity is the higher propensity for muscle development constituting dominant masculine strength in some males. For reproduction to occur in nature between human beings, the strength of the male reproductive organ must be strong enough to access the inner recesses of the female reproductive passage and the initial occurrence of such a connection results in drops of blood from the torn hymen of a female.






The arousal of a male due to the sight of a ripe and attractive female may be analogous to a tree ascending to the perfection of the Sun or the rain of the clouds. If a female is fertile ground for the male deposit of sufficient quality then life may perpetuate. In human beings, the sublime bliss of peak sexual stimulation may be enjoyed alone or in concert with another.
The fusion of the individual male spermatozoon on an odyssey with the individual female ovum of destiny generates a third transcendent entity of new life not resident within the singular gametes in reproduction amongst human beings.
The natural categories of superiority are inferred to be attractiveness, strength, knowledge, highness and fullness and the natural categories of inferiority are inferred to be repulsiveness, weakness, ignorance, lowness and emptiness. There is also an innate tendency towards the pride of showcasing traits of superiority and the shame of hiding traits of inferiority in human beings.






Love may be intuitively viewed as masculine solidity due to the closeness of pursuit, fear may be viewed as feminine liquidity due to the enhanced flexibility of avoidance and freedom may be viewed as gaseous wholeness due to the possibility of maximum expansion with the light of pride affording exposure to virtues and the darkness of shame affording concealment to vices. The tenets of love and fear are time-oriented with regard to what happens in life and the tenets of pride and shame are space oriented with regard to the configuration of what exists in life.

Avoid negative people in your life.",How to Balance Work and Family," A value is a principle, standard, or quality considered worthwhile or desired. Values guide our actions and structure our lives.


Areas where we often have strong values include housework, meal and meal times, child care, car and house maintenance, relationships between spouses and parents and children, education, money, politics, religion, etc.
Specifying your values is key to managing work and family demands. They tell you what is important in your lives and what matters to you. All too frequently, we don't acknowledge or question our values until a problem arises.;
, Most of us have some general sense of our values, but this is often vague. Many of our values remain unconscious. These values - the ones we hold but are not entirely aware of - often contribute to feelings of stress; this stress can be understood and managed once we become more in tune with our values.

, For example, what if you believe that one should be at work early and you also believe that the kitchen should always be clean before one leaves the house? How do you rectify these competing values? Such conflicts are stressful and can leave you feeling drained and unsatisfied until you examine these values and reflect on how they interact.


Modifying or prioritizing our values can be one way of easing role strain and conflicts between values. For example, do you value being at work early more or less than leaving the house clean? Decide which is more important to you and go from there., Goals are important in our lives and help us decide how we use our time.


Goals include statements such as ""I want to own my own business by the time I am 40,"" or, ""I want to finish college before I start a family."" Our predetermined values shape our goals and give us the push needed to achieve those goals. The values underlying these two goals might include a high regard for initiative, achievement, and education.

, Some goals may be concrete and specific, like the two examples above. Other goals, however, will likely be more abstract, relational and more reflective of your well-being and place in the world. For example, you may strive to build supportive relationships with friends, raise healthy and responsible children, or cultivate a deeper and more spiritual understanding of yourself.

, To ease role strain we can choose to put some goals on hold, let go of some, and modify others as needed. Think about the things you want most out of our life when determining this ranking.

, Everyone has ideas about how things ""should"" be done and how people ""should"" behave in certain situations. Often these expectations, perceptions, and attitudes come from a combination of our own individual values and generally accepted social norms.


Identifying the ""shoulds"" in your life may be harder than figuring out our goals because the former often exist below the surface. However, holding onto attitudes and expectations that don't fit with your current needs can cause conflict and stress. Many of us hold high expectations about ""having it all,"" about being everything to everyone, and being ""perfect"" in every area of our lives. But in trying to reach these unrealistic expectations, we often find ourselves exhausted, burned out and incapable of effectively fulfilling any one part of our lives. Instead of getting to this point, pause and reflect on the attitudes and expectations you have and adjust those that do not support what you need at a given time., Forgive yourself when things are missed and don't get done. In other situations, accept that things will pop up that will require your attention and may result in you having to readjust your goals. Negotiate with your spouse, partner, co-workers, and boss for what you need.


Be open to and try to embrace change. Never get too comfortable, because just as soon as things seem to be under control, they can change at a whim!, Prioritizing is central to effective time management. Juggling work and home life and trying to find time for time with friends and family and on your own is not easy. Even if we are using our time efficiently, this doesn't mean that we are using it effectively. In other words, we might be doing things right, but we aren't necessarily doing the right things. Often, we don’t plan and schedule activities that move us toward our goals, especially those goals that aren’t concrete. One way around this is to prioritize your goals and decide which are most important in the short-term, medium-term, and long-term.


Once you have determined which goals are most important for you, start working towards those ones first and foremost. Don't lose sight of your other goals, but try to focus in on those that require your immediate attention.

, Ask yourself what you need to do on a given day to reach the goal you have set for yourself.


Figure out a benchmark for your goal. How will you know when you've reached the goal?

, These determine how you take charge of your time and space and help you get in touch with and manage your emotions. Boundaries express the extent of your responsibilities, power, and agency; they also inform others what you are willing to do and accept.


Be willing to say ""no."" Remember that being able to say ""no"" when pressed to take on additional responsibilities is your prerogative; in fact, it is what is key to effectively balancing work and family. For example, if your boss asks you to work over-time but you have already promised to attend your child's school event, you can say that you have already made a commitment and try to find an alternative solution that accommodates your existing commitments.Set boundaries literally on your time. Carve up your daily asks into increments of time; figure out how long you can and are willing to spend on a given task.

, Create daily routines and a structured plan each day rather than reacting to whatever comes up. Plan ahead and anticipate your needs.


A good idea is to have a back-up plan ready in case of emergencies so that you are prepared with a contingency plan should the need arise.
Establish a supportive network that you can draw on. Connect with friends, relatives, neighbors, coworkers, and professionals. Be ready and willing to ask for help if you need it.

, It's good practice to make time for other activities besides work so that your days are balanced, enjoyable and fulfilling.


Make time healthy habits, such as eating health food, exercising, meditating and taking other forms of quiet time.Many gyms, for example, are open over the lunch hour and may offer a reduced corporate membership.

, You block out time for meetings at work, so apply the same principle to your home life? Scheduling this time with family in advance will make it hard to cancel at the last minute and helps set that time in stone. Treat your family as if they matter just as much as the most important business person in the world and don't miss your ""scheduled meetings"" with them.Eat meals as a family. Studies have shown that sharing a family meal together benefits the spiritual, mental, and physical well being of the entire family. Families that eat together have lower rates of substance abuse, teen pregnancy, and depression, as well as higher grades and self-confidence.Eating together helps keep a family connected and engaged with one another; it can become one of the most enjoyable parts of the day for kids and parents alike. Make time for the big and small moments in life. Take time to celebrate major milestones, achievements, graduations, birthdays, and holidays together with your family. Even marking smaller accomplishments (e.g., your child's winning goal in the championships) with a small token or special gathering will help each family member feel special and valued.

,


Do something basic with your partner and/or family. It doesn't have to be a special event or take long, just something where you are together with them, such as watering the garden or taking care of the lawn, going for a drive or walk together, etc. As long as you are relaxed and listening, they'll feel that they're getting the attention they need and want.
Enjoy the bedtime routine if you have children, including bathing them, reading to them and putting them to bed. Spending these moments with them lets them know that you care and are available for them. Use the rest of the evening to catch up on the day with your spouse or partner. Consider this like a debriefing session; ask questions about one another's day and offer advice or guidance, or simply listen. The day-to-day is just as important to a healthy, mutually beneficial and sustaining romantic relationship as the grand gestures and proposals.

, We waste a lot of time in our daily lives thanks to television, Internet, video games, etc. Try removing any unnecessary distractions that don't really add any value to or enhance your live.


Set specific times for activities like web-surfing, watching TV, and playing video games. Pick and choose what you will do and for how long. For example, if you have a favorite TV show that airs on Thursday nights for an hour, set aside the time to watch it, but do other things before, rather than watch more TV as you wait. Consider TV-watching an activity that is time-bound, rather than a way to pass the time. When in doubt, ask yourself ""what matters most in my life?"" Returning to and reflecting on your core values is a good way to pull yourself away from wasting time and spend that time on something that matters., Address how they feel about your work-life balance. By keeping the lines of communication open, you are avoiding building up resentment among those affected by your actions.


Explain to your family and friends why sometimes you are not able to do everything they would like you to do (e.g., you have to miss a school event because of a work obligation). Openly explaining the situation can help others understand and empathize with your situation., Many times we feel we have more control if we do everything ourselves. However, this can keep us from reaching our real goals; we're not super-humans after all!

, Although many of us resist reallocating home and work tasks for fear of losing control, we stand to gain from delegating work. We will not be overextended and will be better able to successfully meet the remaining and important tasks. Delegating is not easy work because it relies on trusting others with things that matter to us; however, it is key to finding that work-life balance.


For example, you may ask the babysitter to get started on cooking dinner before you get home from work or ask him or her to do some light cleaning. This will give you a bit of a jump ahead on your household responsibilities.

, Try to find ways to simplify your life where possible and given your particular circumstances.


For example, if you feel crushed for time to do grocery shopping each week, try online shopping. You can pick what you want and have it delivered to your house. A few extra dollars may be worth it to save a lot of time, depending on your situation.
Look locally for projects, organizations, and businesses that might be able to help you save time, such as dry cleaners that offer early morning pickup and drop off or milk delivery services., Stop the burden of guilt from hanging over your day. Many people feel guilty for being at work instead of at home; the opposite is also true. This is a zero-sum game.Accept that having or doing it all is a myth. Instead, realize that the most important thing is that you do the best you can given your situation and limitations. Rather than constantly feel guilty, re-focus your energy on doing the very best you can do everyday - in all capacities of your life - with the time you have.,


Do something that relaxes you as an individual. Exercise, go for a long walk, listen to music, read, cook or do a yoga class. Take downtime for yourself; this is necessary self-care that will make you more able to deal with the stresses of your day-to-day life.
Make one night a week a fun night for yourself and your family. Plan a movie night, games night or family night out. Everyone gets caught up in their daily routines and schedules so it's a good idea to have one night a week where everything stops and the entire family comes to together to reconnect., Surround yourself with people who boost your energy and make you feel positive, directed, and grounded, while avoiding those who gossip, complain, or have generally negative attitudes.

Try to separate work and play.,
Set priorities.,
Create a schedule and try to stick to it.,
Manage procrastination.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Be inventive.",How to Balance Your Professional and Personal Life1," In the age of online learning and telecommuting, you can easily spend your whole day at home and get everything done. Attending school or working from afar may even add more flexibility to your home life. However, a downside is that work or school can creep over into home and/or family activities. It can be hard to back away when work is always within reach. Plus, without a clear separation between your home and office, it may be hard to transition from your work life to your personal life.To counteract this issue, you need a distinctive work zone.


If you telecommute or go to school online, you might find it helpful to get work done at a local library, coffee shop, or cohab community for students or telecommuters. When your work is done, you can physically leave the environment, which might help you to transition to your personal life.
If you have to work inside of your home, then do your best to keep a separate space for working. This might be a home office, or just a specific spot at your kitchen table. Don’t stress if you occasionally work someplace else.
If you work in a traditional office, make sure that you find a relaxing way to transition from work to personal life when you finish up for the day. For example, you might use your commute home to listen to music or a book on tape, or stop by the gym for a quick workout, or call up a friend and chat for a bit.;
, To successfully walk the tightrope between professional and personal you need to understand where your priorities lie. Therefore, in a pinch or when faced with an urgent circumstance, you aren't conflicted about what's most important to you.


Create a list of the most significant aspects of your life. Of course, you might include items like family, romantic relationships, work, and spirituality. You might also include volunteering, staying active, maintaining a social circle or other passions.
Review your list and rank these items starting with #1 as the most important, #2 as the second most important and so on. Your rankings will show where your priorities lie. That way you can be sure to make an effort to incorporate these top priorities into your daily and weekly schedules., If your week goes by in a blur and you are unable to recount which tasks you do on which days, it can be helpful to spend a week logging everything you do.After this week has passed, you will have a better idea of how to factor in different work/school assignments and personal activities or errands into your schedule.


It can be most helpful to develop a weekly schedule involving all the constants like work, classes, church, and social activities with other one-time events. Then, each night before map out a daily to-do list of the individual tasks you need to get done based on your priorities.For your daily schedule, highlight the three most important tasks you need to get done each day (aside from actually going to work or going to school).These might be professional items like working on a presentation or personal items like going to the dentist or your daughter's ballet recital.
You may even create two separate lists if this one is to constricting - one with three major tasks for work/school and one with three major tasks for home. As long as you have accomplished these 3 to 6 tasks each day, you will have been productive.

, Procrastination is a major obstacle that could be standing in your way of striking a good balance. You may see your professional and personal lives seeping into one another because you often wait until the very last minute to get things done. This causes you to end up working late, or being distracted at work by personal tasks.


One method to overcome procrastination is to write out your reasons for enrolling in school or being in a particular career path and so on. For example, if you want to help people, you can complete your assignments with the intrinsic purpose that they are helping you reach that goal. Keep this list in your work space for when you are feeling unmotivated.
Another way to beat procrastination for getting things done is to break larger projects down. Doing so makes the overall project seem less daunting and increases motivation as you complete the smaller parts.

, You'd be surprised how much distractions are impeding on your time and productivity. Research estimates claim most people spend about 20 minutes of every hour handling unplanned distractions. As a result, about two whole hours of each day is spent trying to refocus after being distracted.If you can minimize the distractions in your professional life, you can prevent it from constantly interfering with your personal life. Try these tips to eliminate distractions:Focus on important rather than urgent tasks - urgent tasks are reactive-based, important tasks are proactive-based
Turn off the notifications on your phone or computer
Create a clean and clutter-free work space
Put your phone away
Close any programs you're not actively using
Get water, snacks or visit the bathroom during routine breaks to minimize physical interruptions

, Regardless of how hard you try, there will be some times when one or the other becomes more demanding in your life. Learn to be creative and think up possible ways you can meet the urgent priority while still attending to the other.


For example, maybe you are working overtime every week and never get to go out with your significant other. You can make the special effort of lighting candles during dinner or choosing a film to watch on the couch one evening. This won't take up too much of your time and it may prevent your partner from feeling neglected.
You may be able to pass off large projects or split the time with another coworker to ease your workload and make more time for relationships and family. If you can't afford to work less, plan to spend your lunch hour in the park with your family or bring your family to the work picnic.

Know the issues.,
Recognize the resources available to you.,
Figure out where you want to be.,
Develop SMART goals.",How to Be a Good Strategist1," Developing strategy is built on a foundation of understanding. In order to create a method by which you can succeed in your given area, you must recognize and accept the shortcomings. When you understand what needs work, you can build a strong action plan for overcoming those obstacles. Here's how to spot those shortcomings.Look for the activities or responsibilities you constantly put off. People often avoid what they feel less competent in.
Pay attention to the feedback of those around you. If your partner and your boss give similar constructive criticism, the common ground may be an area of weakness for you.
Ask the opinion of a trusted friend. Find someone who will speak candidly with you and ask him what areas you can refine.
Look closely at previous setbacks. When you failed at a task in the past, what were the major barriers to your success?;
, The next step toward identifying your given objectives is to assess what resources you have at hand. Do you have everything you need to reach your goals? Are you maximizing these resources by using them most effectively?For example, oftentimes, a leader may have a team of people there to help on a project, but only employ a few of the players. Make use of every person available to you for optimal success.

, Now is the time to dream. Close your eyes and envision what you would like to see happening in your life over a set period of time. Think about your career. Your relationships. Your finances. Your passions. Your health. Ask yourself the following questions:


What is missing from my life right now that I would like to incorporate?
Am I moving towards the person I want to be?
Where do I see myself in 5 years? 10 years? 20 years?

, Once you have pinpointed a few goals that you would like to move towards, it's time to create an action plan to reach them. In order to ensure that these goals come into fruition, they need to meet certain qualifications. The most effective goals are SMART goals.S is for specific. Your goals should outline who is involved, what you want to accomplish, where this will take place, when you expect to reach the goal, which requirement or resources are needed, and why you want to achieve it (i.e. the purpose).
M is for measurable. Your goals should include a concrete and clear way to track progress.
A is for attainable. You should be able to see yourself reaching these goals and know that you have the skills, resources, and willpower to achieve them.
R is for realistic. Your goals must be feasible based on your unique circumstances and the resources you have available to you. Set the bar high, but not so high that it's nearly impossible for you to achieve it.
T is for timely. Your goals must include time constraints. If there is no time frame, there is no urgency. Allot yourself a reasonable amount of time to reach the goal while still challenging yourself.

However, you must remember that you are the adult and you must model appropriate behavior to them. Don’t let their actions dictate your behavior, but stay calm and courteous regardless.If you need to take a moment to excuse yourself, try stepping into another room and taking some deep breaths. Then, return when you feel calm enough to interact with them in a warm manner.


Greet them with a smile and with a “hello” each time you see them again.
Respond to them when they speak to you, even if they typically ignore you.
Treat them how you would want to be treated.
Remember that this situation is new for them as well and they are likely unaware of how to navigate it properly.
They may feel that showing kindness to you is a slap in the face to their own mother, so be empathetic to the range of emotions that they likely have.;
, If your stepchild is being unkind or combative with you, it is likely not the best idea to spend time with them alone until your relationship becomes more cordial. Plan some group outings with your stepchildren and your spouse so that you can get to know them better in a safe and fun context.


Plan a trip to the movies or to ride go karts. You can also go to the mall together or have lunch.
Let your stepchild know they can invite a friend if they want to. This may help to ease them into interacting with you.

, Sit down and have an honest and sincere chat with your stepchild. There may be some underlying issues they have with you that you are unaware of, and some of these issues may be out of your control. Though you may not be able to fix everything, recognize the sheer importance of being heard and listened to. Give your stepchild that respect.Try to validate what they are feeling and empathize with them.
Avoid giving them a lecture.
Pull them aside and don’t bombard them in front of others.
You might say something like “I have noticed that we aren’t really getting along as well as I would want us to. I wanted to talk to you about how we can work to build a bond and get along well for your dad, but also for us, too.”
If they don’t want to talk, respect that. Give them space and let them know you are here when they’re ready.

, Once your relationship has become at least cordial, you can begin considering spending more alone time with your stepchildren. Offer to pick them up from school more so you can spend a bit of time with them to yourself just to chat. They will likely appreciate you for doing things for them.


Consider having lunch together or going for a walk.

, Though there is certainly an age gap between the two of you, there are likely some interests that you both share in common that perhaps you could enjoy together. This will provide you with something to do together that you both enjoy and will deepen your bond.You could go thrift shopping together or watch a new television series together.
Consider exploring your stepchildren’s hobbies with them, even if you are not particularly interested. Invest time in learning more about their interests and helping to develop them just like you would with your own child.

, One other way to bond with your stepchildren is to start new traditions as a family. Your stepchild likely had traditions with their parents before you married their dad and they may feel that they have lost out on enjoying some of those things. Though you cannot recreate those moments, you can create new ones. This is a great way to further strengthen your family unit.For instance, consider making it movie night every Saturday and allowing a different family member to pick the movie each week.
Be careful not to replace old family traditions because this may upset the child. Instead, try to make room for some new traditions while keeping the old ones.

, Your stepchild may be showing resistance to you because they do not feel that they can trust you as of yet. However, you should work to correct that misconception by being dependable and honest. If you say you are going to do something, do it and if you tell them something, be sure it is the truth. The moment they feel that you have backed out on a promise, the greater the resistance they will show you.If you expect them to be trustworthy, you have to model that behavior for them.
If they tell you something in confidence, don’t share it with anyone unless it is related to their safety.

, Don’t make a big deal when they come over and treat them like a guest. This is their home, too and they should feel that that is the truth. Give them chores just like you would your own children and don’t let them get away with things just because you don’t get to see them all of the time. They will respect you more and view you as more of a mother figure if you behave like one.This doesn’t mean that you can’t do nice things for them or that you shouldn’t act excited to see them.

, If you have married their father after he divorced their mother, they are likely dealing with plethora of emotions like resentment, sadness, or confusion. Be patient with them during this time and offer your ear to them should they want to talk about it.You might broach the topic by saying something like “I know you are probably feeling a lot of emotions regarding your dad and me getting married. I don’t know exactly how you feel but I can imagine. And I want you to know that that’s okay and that I want to help you get through it if you want me to.”
Never bash their mother, even if you feel that she has done some wrong. If your stepchildren speak negatively about their mother to you, listen to them empathetically and then try to encourage them to bring these complaints to their mother and deal with the problem in a direct way.

, Just like you would with your own children, you should set boundaries with your stepchildren, as well. Talk to your husband about parenting and establish some mutual ground rules between the two of you and have him communicate those to your stepchild.Reinforce those rules even in his absence or else they will continue to disrespect you.
For instance, if your stepchild mouths off to you or is disrespectful, let them know immediately and tell them that you won’t tolerate that behavior.

, You should have an open and honest conversation with your husband about your place in correcting the children. You may feel uncomfortable disciplining them the way their parents do, and that is okay. But it is also important to be cognizant of the fact that you do want to establish a maternal bond with them and a part of establishing that is in disciplining them on occasion.Keep in mind that discipline will depend on the child’s age, the level of the biological parents’ involvement, and the situation. Younger children typically require more correction than older children. Teens may not respond to your correction as well as to their biological parents’ efforts to correct them.
If you are having trouble finding your role in disciplining, then you might consider talking with a therapist for help.
Perhaps your husband has talks with the children when they behave badly, but you don’t feel comfortable with this. You could, however, make them go to timeout or take their cellphone.

, At the end of the day, you wouldn’t even know these children if it weren’t for your spouse. A family is at its best when the household is built on love so make sure that you don’t lose focus on loving your spouse. The fact that you are trying to love your spouse’s children shows that you have love for him as well so honor that and keep your marriage strong.Go out on date nights regularly.
Communicate with your spouse regularly.

, Remember that love is built over time. Though mothers often love their own children before they are born, you are in a totally different dynamic with these children. Focus on loving them over time and remember that love is a verb. It is something you should do AND feel.Keep in mind that it is okay if your feelings take a while to catch up to your actions. Try to be mindful and loving with your actions and allow your feelings to develop naturally over time.

, Acknowledge that you are doing all that you can to be good to your stepchildren, but sometimes all of that good may not be good enough. As long as you are being genuine, kind, and respectful, you are doing your part in the relationship. This is not a popularity contest, it’s a family.Be sure to maintain your own individual relationships, interests, and hobbies. This will help you to maintain your self-esteem and identity.

, Your spouse will have a direct understanding of the child and may be able to provide advice on how to connect better with them. Talk to him about your frustrations and allow him to comfort and guide you on this journey to creating a stronger family.You could say something like “I am feeling pretty upset lately because I feel that Jenna doesn’t like me. I’m trying to be good to her but I don’t know what else I can do.”

, Your friends can also be a great source of support during this time as well. If you have any friends who have married someone with children, consider reaching out to them to see how they navigated those relationships. They will be able to give you advice that you may not have thought about.


Your friends can also be a great source of support for venting. Venting to your spouse about their kids may put them in an uncomfortable position.

, Sometimes, the best person to talk to during this process is yourself. Take some time to write down how you are feeling about the dynamic between you and your stepchildren. It can be cathartic and freeing to get your thoughts out onto paper.

, You may find that after all of the work that you have put in to bond with and love your stepchildren, that things have not improved. Perhaps you are feeling very distant from their or perhaps their resistant behavior has escalated. Whatever the issues that pervade, consider seeking counseling, either for yourself or for the family, so that you can move beyond these issues."

Assess your situation.,
Be protective of your health.,
Shield your passions.,
Learn to say ""no"".,
Cut back.",How to Balance Your Professional and Personal Life2," As hard as you try to strike a balance, there may be some situations where crossover is necessary, especially if you have kids. Consider your personal and professional lives to identify situations where some crossover may be necessary. Think about your family members and your personal responsibilities. How often do these people and responsibilities require your attention while you are working?


For example, if you have young children, then arranging your work schedule around your kids’ schedules may be necessary. Or, if you are the primary caretaker of your children and you work from home, then you may need to put work aside and take a break whenever one of your kids needs something.
It is also possible that work may have to take precedent over your personal life sometimes. For example, if you work as an on-call healthcare provider, then you may sometimes need to cancel something in your personal life to do your job.

, The needs of others at work, school, or home can quickly overwhelm our own physical needs. Unfortunately, neglecting your health can have costly consequences, such as missing work or classes and being unable to participate in social or family events. Being anxious about getting everything done creates stress, and if it is not tended to stress can have debilitating effects on your physical and mental health.To counteract stress and nurture your body be sure to get involved in some type of physical activity several times per week. It can be joining a company sports team, jogging around the block with your partner, or visiting a local gym.
In addition to exercise, you can combat stress by consuming several balanced meals each day, getting adequate sleep, and pursuing your outside interests., When work, school, or relationships become too demanding, we might give up our hobbies or interests to meet those demands. The problem is, giving up these things take away our ability to debrief from professional and personal stress. Make an effort to protect your leisure time and continue any social outlets or hobbies you participate in.Try treating yourself with a short break to engage in a hobby after completing a significant amount of work.
Another way to shield your passions is to schedule them in. Work your pottery class or book club into your calendar just as you would with professional projects or family obligations.

, It may seem rude or selfish at first, but, with practice, you may find that selectively turning down different projects or opportunities is quite freeing. Say ""yes"" to those requests that meet your top priorities and that do not constrain your already packed schedule. Here's how to say ""no"":Show that you understand the significance of the request by saying something like ""It sounds like a great opportunity, but...""
Give a brief explanation, such as ""Honestly, this is a bit outside my area of expertise"" or ""I have too many deadlines approaching.""
Recommend an alternative. For example, you might say ""I can't, but I think I know someone who would be a great fit"".

, If work and home are constantly competing for your time, then you need to make the choice to cut back on one or the other. Otherwise, you will keep yourself stressed and unhappy. Take a look at your life to determine which side needs greater boundaries.


Do you regularly get called away from home for work? Does your boss drop assignments on your desk at the last minute? Are you financially able to work a bit less? If the answers to most of these are ""yes"", work may have been intruding on your life, but it looks like you can afford to talk to your boss about cutting down your hours or workload.If you are a working mother, cutting down on your work hours may be the key to feeling more content. Research shows that women are generally happier when they cut back on work for the sake of meeting family needs.Does your partner or spouse frequently interrupt your work day for non-emergency family or home issues? Is your work performance suffering because you stay up all night partying with friends or your partner? Do you have to leave work to handle errands or do excessive amounts of housework? If you said ""yes"" to any of these, your home life may be stifling your capabilities at work. You need to decide if you need to set boundaries with individuals in your home that often intrude on your career.

Have separate professional and personal profiles.,
Be clear about how to handle professional and personal data.If you telecommute, you need to be aware of your company's policy for dividing professional and personal data.,
Create specific windows for being active online.If social media is a part of your professional life, you may find yourself spending excess time online beyond what's necessary for your job.",How to Balance Your Professional and Personal Life3," With social media becoming an ingrained part of most people's work and home lives, it can be hard to separate the two. If you are active online in both your professional and personal lives, it's important to create a distinction between them to monitor what is being put out in the online world regarding that side of you.


Many people choose to use LinkedIn for their career or academic connections and Facebook or Instagram for friends and family., Some companies may provide their employees with completely separate devices (e.g. phones and computers) strictly for work purposes. Others may allow the use of personal devices.


Find out what the guidelines are about such matters. Also, be sure that any personal data, such as contacts, photos, and music are appropriately backed up.

, Logging on several times a day or whenever a notification pops up is disruptive to both your professional and personal life.


Make the choice to unplug for a few hours each day. Or, choose a short window to engage with your friends or followers online, then log off for the remainder of the day.

Try to keep set work hours.,
Dress for work even when you are at home.,
Take a lunch break.,
Prevent yourself from doing household tasks.,
Treat yourself at the end of the day.",How to Balance Your Professional and Personal Life4," It can be hard to maintain the same work hours every day when you work from home, but maintaining regular work hours can help you to keep your work and home life separate.Choose realistic work hours and stick to them. For example, you might decide to work from 8:00am to 4:30pm on Monday through Friday.


Don’t let your work hours creep into your personal time. When it is time to stop for the day, stop working, shut down your laptop, and step away from your work space.
Try to set work hours that work with your personal life. For example, try to avoid working on the weekends if you know that there are things you will want to do.

, Change into work clothes in the morning and non-work clothes in the evening. Rolling out of bed and going straight to your workspace in your pajamas will make it harder for you to transition into your workday. The same thing goes for wearing your work clothes into the evening.Try getting up about 30 to 60 minutes before you want to start working for the day so that you can get dressed for work.
Make sure that you change out of your work clothes when it is time to relax. For example, you can switch to pajamas or your favorite jeans and a t-shirt.

, When you work at an office, taking a lunch break is necessary and you may even have someone else reminding you to take one. However, when you work from home, it can be hard to remember to take lunch breaks and you may be tempted to work through your lunch or eat at your workspace. Instead, make lunch breaks a mandatory part of your day.Set a time for your lunch break to start and end every day. For example, you might agree to take lunch from 12:00 to 12:30 each day.
Ask a family member or significant other to remind you when it is time for your lunch break. If you are worried about forgetting to take a lunch break, then ask one of your friends or family members to come get you when it is time for a break.

, You may be tempted to do things around your house while you are taking a quick break or making a work phone call, but this can blur the dividing line between work and home.Try to prevent yourself from doing any housework or anything that is not work related while you are on the clock. If you notice a household chore that you want to complete, write it down on a notepad and save it for the end of your work day.
Keep in mind that everyone is different. For example, if you find that folding laundry is a soothing way for you to spend a break, then go for it!

, Finding a simple way to reward yourself for a hard day of work is also important. You can reward yourself with a walk outside, a cup of tea, a chat with a friend, or any other pleasant activity that indicates your work day is over.Consider doing something social at the end of each day. Working from home can be isolating, so it is important for you to find ways to interact with other people. You can do this by talking to your significant other, meeting up with some friends for coffee, or taking an aerobics class after work.

Consider keeping a more flexible schedule.,
Take advantage of childcare options.,
Use busy boxes to entertain your kids while you work.,
Work in the same room with your kids.",How to Balance Your Professional and Personal Life5," Working set hours does not work for everyone, especially for those who have young children. You may have to get used to getting your work done 5 to 10 minutes at a time to accommodate your kids’ needs or you might have work in the evenings to complete what you didn’t get done during the day.


You may also need to keep some odd hours to balance your personal and professional life as a parent working from home. For example, if you have young kids at home with you when you are working, then you may need to work an hour or two after your kids go to sleep or after your partner returns home in the evening.Make sure you ask your employer or client if it’s okay if you work on a more flexible schedule to accommodate your child’s needs. Flexibility might not be an option if your employer expects you on the clock between certain hours every day. However, if you’re a contractor, you might be allowed to work when you can throughout the day or night.

, Asking someone to watch your kids for a few hours each day can also be a great way to get things done. If you have willing grandparents or other family members close by who are willing to watch your children for a few hours every day, then you may want to take advantage of that.


Consider what works best for you and your babysitter. For example, maybe your parents can come over to the house, or you can drop your kids off for a playdate with grandma a few times a week.
A trustworthy babysitter can also be a great option if you can afford to pay someone to watch your kids. If you do not have a good regular babysitter, then ask friends and family if they know anyone.

, If you don’t have anyone to watch your kids while you work during the day, then you will often need to find other ways to keep them busy with something while you work.One way to do this is to create a busy box with lots of fun items in it to keep your child busy while you work.


A busy box is filled with a variety of toys and activities that are meant to keep your child entertained while you work. For example, a busy box might include, crayons, clay, a coloring book, stickers, puzzles, and other toys for your child.
Prepare busy boxes the night before and place them near your work space. You can use an empty shoe box or other small box and select from your child’s toys and other items to create the box. You might even throw in a surprise now and then, such as a new coloring book or a new package of stickers.
You can even create themes for busy boxes. For example, if you want to teach your child about colors, you can make boxes with collections of red items, blue items, etc. Or, you might create a theme for a busy box based on one of your child’s favorite movies, books, shows, or characters.

, It is a good idea to work in the same room with your kids so that you can supervise them and provide them with more entertainment options as needed. For example, if you work out of your home office, you might create an area for your kids by placing a special rug or play mat along with some of your child’s favorite toys.


You might also need to learn how to talk to your kids and play with them while you work. Being able to work and engage with your kids at the same time is a skill, but you can develop this skill with practice.
If you have a backyard with a play area for your kids or a nearby park with a playground, then you might even consider taking your work outside for an afternoon."

Talk openly with your children about your business travels.,
Make regular contact by video or telephone when away.,
Play online games with your kids or partner.,
Use your time away as ""you"" time.,
Limit business travel to shorter trips when possible.",How to Balance Business Travel and Family1," Help to prepare them for your absence. Provide them with reassurance and answer any concerns they have.Discuss about when you'll be away, where you're going, for how long, and when you'll be returning.
Show them that you care and will miss them, using your words or hugs. For example, say, ""I care about you so much. Even though I'll be away, you'll be in my thoughts. I will be sending hugs and kisses even from afar.""
Make them feel safe, and provide them with reassurance about who will take care of them while you're away. Answer their questions if they have specific concerns while you're gone. Consider saying, ""I will miss you very much. Remember that I will be away only a short time. Trust that your dad will take good care of you while I'm away, and make sure that you have everything you need."";
, Modern technology makes it easier to stay connected while you're out of town. Make ""face time"" a priority while you're gone by scheduling phone calls in the evenings after work.If the business trip is for multiple days or weeks, regular phone calls can help you to stay connected. If you're only gone for one night, the phone call may be more of a ""check in"" with your family than a long conversation.
Depending on the age of your kids, and your comfort level with various technology, try video chatting on your phone or laptop. This real-time, face-to-face interaction can help to reduce the distance you're feeling from your kids.
Make video chatting and telephone calls feel more like regular conversations. Focus on topics that you and your family enjoy talking about. Avoid dwelling on feeling sad that you're away, or trying to discipline your kids from a distance.
When you’re video chatting, take your family on a virtual tour of the place where you’re staying. This will help them feel as if they’re there with you.

, You can play social games with your family on your phone or tablet wherever you are. Find a game app that you can play together as a family or one-on-one. Set aside 15-20 minutes to play together before bedtime.

You can find free games on social gaming sites like cafe.com or omgpop.com.

, Being away from your family and traveling on business can be stressful. Use this time away from your normal routine to focus on your needs.When you're on a business trip, you will likely have ""down time"" in the evenings or mornings. Use this time wisely by focusing on you.
Consider doing activities that help you feel refreshed. Use the hotel's fitness center. Get a massage. Explore the city. Have a relaxing dinner.
By making your business trips less stressful for yourself, you'll likely feel more prepared to handle family responsibilities when back home.
If things are stressing you out at home, being on a trip can also be a good way to get a little healthy space and regain some perspective on your family life.

, If you've been traveling for work for years, you may have enjoyed the luxuries of extending your trips to include visits with friends and family, or taking extra time at the end of a trip for yourself. When you have responsibilities back home, consider ways to shorten trips so that family time takes equal priority.Find out if there are ways to reduce the length of your business trips to just overnights, or during the week. Find out if you can arrange your travels so that you're home for more Saturdays and Sundays.
Shorter trips may be less disruptive to your family routine. Think about doing trips that are a few days rather than a whole week.
Try packing more meetings in each day, so that you maximize your work time while away. For example, have meetings at 5pm and 7am, in addition to normal business hours as way to utilize time more efficiently.
Consider whether a trip is necessary at all. In some cases, you may be able to conduct your business remotely via video calls or other digital meeting technology.

Break large tasks down.A good strategist knows how to work smarter and not harder.,
Seek input regularly.,
Learn to delegate.,
Surround yourself with effective people.",How to Be a Good Strategist2," One way to work smart is to work your way through big projects by tackling smaller, manageable parts. This helps you beat excess stress and fend off procrastination. Plus, as you complete each part, you gain a greater sense of self-efficacy and confidence in your abilities.


Look at the project as a whole and decide how it can be divided into several steps. What should be done first? Second? Third?
Create an action plan that allows you to complete each section in a logical order. Once every section is complete, review the project in its entirety before submitting.

, An effective strategist knows that continual growth requires taking a step back and reassessing one's methods. It also means seeking feedback from others. Getting input from others brings awareness to what's working or not working. It also reinforces the idea that success is a team effort.


Be specific in your request. Ask, ""How do you suggest I handle this task?"" or ""How do you think I can improve my client relationships?""Whether you agree or disagree with the response, paraphrase the feedback so that the person knows you received it (e.g. ""So, you're saying I need to...""). Then, thank the person for his input. It can be very effective to seek input from a range of sources--superiors and subordinates alike.

, Good strategists are highly impactful leaders. One technique that helps you to maximize that effectiveness is delegation. When you are tackling a difficult project in which a team member has the skills to assist, reach out for help. This strategy can greatly improve your performance and productivity.


Delegation is an effective strategy because it enables those who are properly suited for specific tasks to handle them accordingly. That way you are not wasting time trying to retrain or learn new skills that someone on your team already has.
Another reason to delegate is to give other team members a chance to learn tasks that you do repeatedly, and, therefore, have already mastered.
Let's say you have a big project that needs marketing, statistics, and writing work in order to be completed. You might reach out to your best people in those categories. Doing so will ensure that the project receives the most capable hands on deck.

, A good strategist does not try to be the smartest man in the room. He does, however, know the smartest man in the room. Successful, effective people resonate an energy that is contagious. If you surround yourself with people who are empowering, resourceful, and motivated, you will be, too.


If you are not convinced that those you spend time with influence you, consider this. There is a popular personal development concept that describes any person as being the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.Even if the metrics are not accurate, you have to know that others' good--and bad--habits can rub off on you. So, spend time with people who embody the qualities you, too, would like to possess.

Reassess your progress.,
Be open-minded.,
Build an always-learning attitude.,
Anticipate challenges and plan accordingly.",How to Be a Good Strategist3," A big part of being a competent strategist is knowing when to switch tactics. Developing goals is wonderful, but you also must be willing to terminate a plan or incorporate new strategies if you are not getting the anticipated results.


If, upon reassessment, you find that you do not see the progress you would like, go back to step one. Consider what and why your methods are not working. Examine what resources you currently have at your disposal. Then, come up with some new ways of meeting your objectives.Know that it takes time to meet many goals. Don't switch strategies until you can confirm that the tactic is, in fact, not working. In some cases, you may not have given your methods enough time to show results.
Consider this scenario: you are aiming to build up a long-term savings account. You were able to consistently deposit a set amount into the account every week. After successfully moving towards this goal for a period of time, you might decide to increase the amount you are depositing each week to meet your long-term goal faster.

, If you are closed to new ideas and techniques, you limit yourself. An essential part of your arsenal as a strategist must be a willingness to be wrong, to be surprised, and to find inspiration in the most unlikely of places. If keeping an open mind poses a challenge for you, try the following tips:Listen more, even to those with lesser titles than you.
Reinforce those who have the courage to try new things or make changes.
Gather all the facts before making a decision.

, A good strategist is like a sponge, constantly soaking up knowledge and experiences. Because science and technology are always evolving, you must understand that you, too, must educate yourself to stay abreast.Learn by reading books, watching films and documentaries, and completing online and in-person training in your given area. Regularly acquire new skills.
Observe others to see how they are doing things.
Ask questions; never assume you know everything.

, A capable strategist has mastered the notion of foresight, or he has someone on his team who has this skill. Many great leaders and businesses are toppled because a new trend or technique rendered their old methods useless. In order to prevent this, one must anticipate and plan for challenges. Do this by:Staying connected. Keep your finger on the pulse of the people. Know what their challenges are.
Researching your area of expertise. Stay abreast of new trends, products, and the users' response to them.
Consult with the customer or end-user. Consider their opinion on new initiatives.
Develop special teams to anticipate and respond to challenges.

, Children may feel abandoned by a parent who is away for long periods of time. They may feel like that can't rely on you to be a stable part of their lives. This can lead to resentment.Be nurturing when they seem upset, frustrated or anxious about your business traveling. While they may not fully understand your work responsibilities, particularly if they are younger, it is important to tell them often that they matter. Consider saying things like, ""Even though I'll be away, I am always thinking of you.""
Redirect the negative feelings to positive actions. Give them hugs, even if they seem to pull away. Show them that your love is unconditional.
Connect and check in with them as much as possible while you’re gone. Try fun and creative approaches, like playing online games with them. This will help them feel as if you are a presence in their lives even while you are away.

, Make sure that your partner or spouse doesn't feel overwhelmed and burdened every time you travel on business. Discuss with them about what support they need to feel less stressed.


Identify extra help that you can arrange when you're away. For example, consider having a babysitter or housekeeper help out when you're traveling to ease the load off your spouse. Or, help to order or prepare meals that are ready-made before you leave for a few days.
Make sure that your spouse has free time to rest and relax. Recognize that they also need ""me"" time.
Don't forget to appreciate what your partner does. Depending on how you show your love, consider giving gifts, words of love, or physical affection to make them feel special.

Adjust your business schedule to attend important family events.,
Negotiate with your company to see if spouses or children can fly with you.,
Take your family on trips with you sometimes.",How to Balance Business Travel and Family3," Make sure that you're aware of important upcoming events that your child participates in. Keep a calendar of important birthdays, anniversaries, and family get-togethers. Attending significant events shows that your family is just as important as your work commitments.Talk with your spouse or partner about upcoming events in the next three months. By planning ahead, you're less likely to miss out on important times with your family.
If you can't make it to an event, make sure to set aside time to be with your family afterwards. For example, let's say that a last-minute business trip conflicts with attending a dance recital with your child. See if someone can record the event, and then watch it with your child and family afterwards. Turn it into a special event at home by watching it in the living room together.

, Some companies are more accommodating than others. It may also be a matter of your negotiating skills. If you've been traveling awhile for business, this may give your leverage to negotiate and see if your family can attend.Even if the expenses of travel cannot be paid in full for your family while on business, see if there may be hotel accommodations or plane airfare that can be included for them.
Consider ways to negotiate for a plane ticket for your spouse, but not the children. Your employer may be more willing to assist with this fare.
Be assertive and have a clear case as to why helping with family expenses is good for the company. Consider discussing about company values of work-life balance as part of their mission.

, Even if your company can't pay for your family's expenses, give your family an opportunity to travel and explore in the same way you do. Find ways to add-on family time while you're away on business by having a short family vacation after you're finished with your work.Let's say you travel to different places for work-related conferences. Consider bringing your family with you. While you're at the conference, they can explore the city. You can also have time with them in the evenings or after the conference is over.
If you travel frequently to the same destinations each year, consider taking them to one of the places you visit that's family-friendly. Help them to understand what you do when you're away. They may feel more interested in what you do for work if you take them along from time to time.

See a sex therapist.",How to Get Your Partner to Be More Interested in Sex," Lots of couples have different sex drives. Just because your partner is not interested in sex as much as you are does not mean that he or she is not attracted to you. In fact, there are lots of other reasons why your partner may not want to have sex as much as you do, such as:hormone deficiencies
feeling sick
poor self-image
fatigue
stress
low mood or depression;
, Having a good emotional relationship with your partner may lead to a better sex life. Start taking time to talk to your partner as a friend. Show your interest in your partner’s happiness and well-being. Some good ways to improve communication include:Asking about your partner’s day. Make time to sit down and chat with your partner at least once per day, such as during dinner or over your morning coffee. Say something like, “How was work?” or “Did you have a good time with your friends?” or “What do you have going on today?”

Calling or texting during the day. Staying in touch throughout the day can also help to improve your communication. Try sending your partner a quick text or calling just to say hi. You might text your partner something like, “Thinking about you. What are you up to right now?” or call and say “Hey, how’s your day going so far?”

Listening. Use good listening skills when your partner is talking to show that you are interested and engaged. For example, face your partner, make eye contact with your partner, nod your head, and make neutral statements to indicate your attention, such as “Yes,” “I see,” and “Go on.”

, It is important to let your partner know that you would like to have sex more often and any other concerns that you have about your sexual relationship. Telling your partner these things can make it easier for you and your partner to come up with solutions to the problem.For example, you can start a conversation about your sex life by saying something like, ""I feel closer to you when we have sex on a regular basis, but we haven't been doing that as much lately. Is everything okay?”
Keep in mind that your partner might have had bad sexual experiences in the past with partners who were not as considerate or understanding. Be considerate and let her know she can tell you things without your judgment (if that is true of you).

, Don't let your thoughts and actions be controlled by your wish for physical intimacy. Building a foundation for physical love takes time.Consider backing off for a while to allow your partner time to be ready for sex on his or her own time.


There will be many, many opportunities to have sex in a relationship, so in the grand scheme of things it's probably not all that big of a deal to have a bit less sex than you would ideally like.

, Try setting aside 30 minutes per day where you and your partner will do something sexy together with the understanding that it does not have to lead to sex. It can just be a way to relax and feel intimate with your partner.For example, you could take a shower together after hitting the gym, light some candles and enjoy a glass of wine, give each other massages, or just lie in bed and talk for a while.
Try not to push sex during this time. Just enjoy the intimacy with your partner and go with the flow. Remember that just because your partner is not in the mood for sex one night, that does not mean he or she will not be in the mood another night.

, Talk to your partner about the possibility of introducing some sex toys or aids into the bedroom. Sex toys can be effective at increasing arousal and pleasure during and prior to sex.For example, you might try:


flavored lubricants
vibrators
sex positioning pillows, such as wedges
a sex swing
edible underwear
anal beads
ticklers
restraints, such as fuzzy handcuffs or bondage gear

, You should not put pressure on your partner to have an orgasm, but you can ask if there is anything that you can do to make it easier for your partner to have an orgasm. You can also read up on some different techniques to increase your partner’s chances of reaching orgasm.Keep in mind that many women need direct stimulation to the clitoris to reach orgasm, so licking, touching, caressing, or using a vibrator on this area can greatly increase the chances that she will orgasm. If your partner is a man, ask him what works for him. This can help ease his performance anxiety issues and may turn him on, too. Touch your partner all over and kiss in places other than the lips (but also kiss the lips).
Use lubricant to avoid painful sex or chafing.
Change things up, whether it is a different position or a different room, don't always have sex exactly the same way.
You can also look into topical products such as Zestra, which can may help to increase blood flow for women who suffer from female sexual arousal or interest disorders.
Let your partner know that you find his or her body sexy. Sometimes people are self-conscious about the way they look, and this can turn them off from sex. Reassuring your partner that you find him or her attractive may make it easier for your partner to relax and get in the mood.

, Dressing up in costumes or even just engaging in a little fantasy can help to make sex more exciting. Talk to your partner about the possibility of introducing a little role playing into your sex life.


For example, you could dress up as someone that you know your partner finds sexy, such as a celebrity, a certain type of professional, or as a fictional character.Another option is to pretend you are new (or secret) lovers and meet in a hotel room at a designated time. You can also wear sunglasses, dark clothes, and even wigs for some extra intrigue.

, If this is a new relationship, she might have a physical problem she is ashamed of, such as an STD. Be open, kind, and caring to encourage your partner to share her feelings with you. Often, you can help her by simply having a supportive attitude.


Be prepared to not react outwardly negatively to what she says. However, if you are not prepared to have sex with someone with an STD, you'll need to be upfront about this. If you find out she has an STD and want to break-off the relationship, the key is to make it about you having a problem, and not her.

, Physical intimacy is not possible if you are not emotionally close to each other already. If you have been intimate before, but your partner seems no longer interested, think about problems you might be having on a non-physical basis. Do you fight a lot? Do you spend enough time together? Does your partner feel loved in your everyday interactions together? If any of these things might be lacking, work on them before trying to persuade your partner to have sex with you.
If you have not yet had sex with your partner, make sure she feels comfortable around you and trusts you. Be considerate of her needs in a non-sexual way, i.e. make sure that she is enjoying the activities you choose for dates, and show interest in her daily life. Celebrate her successes and support her when she is having trouble with school, work, family issues, health problems, or just having a bad day.

, It may be that your partner has become dependent on pornography and so has less desire for real sex. Or, it may be that your partner wants to have more variety of sexual experiences with you. For example, she may want to watch pornography together before or during sex with you.Having a non-judgmental conversation where you carefully broach the subject of pornography and how it should, if at all, fit into your sex life together, can at the least mean that you shared an intimate, possibly difficult-to-have conversation, which may itself make you two feel closer and increase her desire for sex.

, There's a good chance that you and your partner have developed some classic roles regarding sex. You may be the one who typically tries to initiate sex and your partner is typically the one to deny. Doing more of the same will likely result in the same, frustrating outcome. To try to change things up you can:


Back off from initiating for a while and see what happens. Maybe your partner will feel less pressure and will initiate sex with you.
Focus on your other needs. Because your partner has been declining sex, you may be so focused on it that you are neglecting other important aspects of your life. Start doing things that are important to you such as hobbies, spending time with friends, and doing other things that you care about.

, Reflect on some of the times you and your partner have had some of your best sex and think about what was going on during that time. It may be that your partner tends to need a certain ambiance to be in the mood, so if you can re-create that, she may be more interested in having sex. For example:


Was it great after you had both done something exciting together?
Was it great after you both opened up emotionally, exposing your vulnerabilities to one another?

, Let your partner know that it is important to you that you see a qualified professional to talk about your sex life.If you are a woman and your male partner is the one with a lower sex drive, it is possible that he has low testosterone, and/or is suffering from impotence or performance anxiety. Be clear that you love him no matter what but that he will be happier seeing a qualified professional who can help.
If you are a man and your female partner is the one with a lower sex drive, a sex therapist can help you two identify how to get your sex drives more on par, or help you work through compromises that leaves both of you happier.

Discuss the reason you feel the garage needs cleaning.,
Show him the hazards of navigating through the garage, as well as potential dangers if household or lawn chemicals are stored there.

,
Offer to make a family project out of it.,
Remind him of things he may have misplaced over the past months that he may find if he cleans the garage.,
Agree on a date for him or your family to clean.,
Break the job into smaller tasks.,
Point out that if you clean it yourself, you might throw away something that's important to you.,
Consider a reward for cleaning the garage.,
Ask if there's anything he would like you to do.,
You could also tell him no beer until the garage is clean.

",How to Get Your Husband to Clean out the Garage," A good point to bring up is that vermin might settle into the mess, or that they've already settled. They could pose danger to your family by bringing in diseases, or in the case of poisonous vermin, might bite them.;
,, Large garages full of accumulated clutter can be serious work to clean thoroughly, and may be a daunting task to take on. Plus, some of the clutter in there might belong to more than one person, and it would be unfair to have him clean up everyone's things alone.

, For instance, if he has lost some tools or fishing gear, it may well be an incentive to clean the garage in hopes of locating the lost items.

, It's easier to get to it if you set aside a specific day for doing it, and making sure you do it right away.

, It can be overwhelming to clean a garage in one effort. Perhaps clean the northwest corner one weekend and another section next week.

, However, this might backfire on you and he might throw out something important to you.

, For example, if he cleans out the garage you both can go out to dinner that night-- your treat.

, Your husband might be more willing to do what you ask if you're helping around the house as well. or you could put something of value of his somewhere then say it is in the garage tell him clean it out and you will find it once he finishes go get it and give it to him

Understand that growth spurts can lead to troubled sleep.,
Let your toddler sleep for as long as he can at night.,
Keep nap times short and sweet.,
Rearrange your toddler’s day to fit his new sleeping habits.",How to Deal with Toddler Growth Spurts1," Growth spurts often lead to troubled sleep for a long stretch of time (usually weeks) while your baby quickly gains weight and grows. Growth spurts occur at any time but may also happen specifically during the third, sixth, 12th, 24th and 36th week after birth. While growing, your baby might act as if he is in a fog because he is not getting the sleep he needs.


Luckily there are ways you can help your baby sleep better, as described in the following steps.;
, Your toddler’s body grows mostly at night while he sleeps, so it is a good idea to let your child sleep as much and as long as he can. Don’t wake him up to feed him; just let him keep sleeping.If you notice that your child’s nightly sleeping patterns are being disrupted, consider changing his napping schedule during the day. This will be discussed at length in the following step.

, If you let your child sleep too long in the day, he may be too restless and stimulated at night to stick to his normal sleeping pattern. Playing soothing music may help your child to fall into a short nap more quickly.


If your child seems to not need a nap during the day, then let him just keep going through his day without a nap. This may help him to sleep better at night.

, You can engage in activities that keep him stimulated during the day so that when it comes to sleeping time at night, he will be less stimulated and more likely to sleep. Being active during the day may also help him to sleep through the entire night. However, do not overstimulate your child right before bed, as this could lead him to have a hard time falling asleep. Suggestions for afternoon and evening activities include:


An afternoon walk or bike ride through the park.
A calming activity in the early evening such as drawing, story time, or listening to his favorite music.

Take a tech break.,
Limit the information your devices prompt you to consume.,
Establish boundaries, and stick to them.",How to Avoid Being Overwhelmed by Information1," If you feel like you’re starting to drown in information, the best way to get your feet back on solid ground is by turning off the faucet. Every single day, get away from both your phone and computer for an hour or two. For many people, this simple task seems almost unthinkable. In fact, the harder this may seem, the more likely you will benefit from taking a break.As incredibly and useful as smartphones, tablets, and laptops are, they are also the vessels through which you are exposed to far more information than you can possibly handle.;
, The torrential accumulation of information that is available will only continue to increase. However, you can choose to limit the amount of information that literally occupies your mind. In particular, set aside a block of time to tackle the task of unsubscribing to every email list you no longer want to receive. Similarly, change the settings on your phone to only allow a few apps to distract you with alerts.Depending on the forms of email and other applications you use on your online devices, the specific process of limiting your exposure will vary.
Essentially: eliminate the sources of distractions that expose you to unnecessary information that is contributing to mental discomfort, whether you realize it or not.

, With our increased connectivity to other people and literally limitless sources of information, it can readily seem as though you are always being exposed to more and more things to think about, respond to, or otherwise address. This can readily lead to information overload. There are all sorts of boundaries you can set up to reduce the amount of information that brings itself to your attention.A classic example is setting up some strict work-life boundaries. That said, peoples’ increasing use of social media platforms means you’re not only facing a barrage of emails from work, but an endless stream of updates, promotions, invitations, and emoticons.
Recognize that you may simply need to commit to leaving your work computer at work, or disallow yourself from using social media platforms outside of scheduled time slots that you choose to do so.

Choose the right moment to draw attention to your spouse’s habit.,
Bring up the subject of the habit in a gentle way.,
Describe the problem.,
Stay focused on the issue at hand.,
Do not use generalizations.,
Stay calm when discussing the habit.,
Help your spouse engage in positive behavior.,
Remove opportunities to engage in a habit.,
Ask for help.,
Provide positive reinforcement.,
Reframe the way you think about your spouse’s habits.,
Be patient with your spouse.,
Focus your attention on one habit at a time.If you want your spouse to change many habits all at once, they might be resistant and resentful.",How to Get Your Spouse to Stop a Bad Habit," Don’t try to describe the problem to your spouse when both of you are rushed and heading out the door to work in the morning. Similarly, don’t try to have a serious conversation with your partner when you are trying to cook dinner, dress your child, or watch TV.Avoid having a conversation about your partner’s habit in public or at their place of work.;
, Do not surprise your spouse or put them on defense by starting the conversation with a statement like, “You have a bad habit.” Instead, bring the subject into focus for your spouse by focusing on your feelings. For instance, you might say, “There’s something I want to talk about” or “Can we talk about something?”You might also have success by using a formulation like, “I want to talk about my feelings concerning…” or “I feel that…”

, In order to get your spouse to stop a habit, they must admit that they have a habit that ought to stop. When identifying your spouse’s habit, it is important to be polite and thoughtful but honest. Do not use accusatory language like, “You left the lights on again!” Instead use “I”-centered language in the form of “I dislike it when you leave the cap off the toothpaste.”Be specific when describing the problem.For instance, instead of saying, “You don’t listen to me,” say, “When we were talking about the movie last night I really wanted to share my opinion with you, but you just talked over me and didn’t seem interested in what I had to say.”
Cite similar instances of the problem as you see it to demonstrate to your spouse that they do, indeed, have a bad habit.

, Do not use the conversation about your spouse’s habit to discuss every little thing that irritates you about your spouse. For instance, if your spouse has a habit of leaving the door unlocked when they get home at night, do not use the discussion to talk about their failure to pay bills in a timely manner. Save that conversation for another day.Additionally, do not use the conversation about your spouse’s habit to bring them down. Make the conversation about the habit, not the person. For instance, instead of saying, “You always throw away my leftovers! You’re wasteful!” say “I noticed you threw away my leftovers. Can we talk about that?”
It’s okay to admit your mistakes, but do not let your partner move the discussion away from their habit and toward your habits to avoid blame.For instance, when they bring up your habits, say, “That may be so, but I want to focus on your habit for a moment.”
If your spouse does try to steer the conversation toward your faults and away from their own to avoid responsibility, they are exhibiting a classic sign of narcissism which should be taken seriously.

, Avoid describing your spouse’s behavior in terms of absolutes like “always” or “never.” For instance, avoid a sentence like “You never leave enough parking space for me.” Instead, be specific about occasions in which your spouse did not leave enough parking space for you.For instance, you might say, “Yesterday, the day before, and last Wednesday, you did not leave enough parking space for me. This makes it quite impossible for me to park in the driveway.”
Other absolutist words and phrases to avoid when drawing attention to your spouse’s habit include phrases like “all the time,” “every time,” “everybody,” and “nobody.”

, When communicating with your spouse about their habit, do not yell or get angry at them. Simply sit down and have a rational, reasoned conversation about the habit. Do not use foul language, threats, or intimidation. These behaviors will not make your spouse conducive to stopping their habit., Getting your spouse to stop a habit often means replacing it with a different habit. Identify things you can do – for example, giving your partner cues or reminders – that encourage good behavior.For instance, if your spouse has a habit of not picking up the mail from the post office, talk to them about finding a solution to the problem.
You might suggest that your partner program reminders into their phone, or get in the habit yourself of shooting them a text message at around the time they get out of work.
Encourage your spouse to come up with ways to break the habit. If they come up with it themselves they will be more likely to make the change.
After your partner has received the cues that encourage a new habit for long enough, they will be fully broken of the habit and will no longer need the cues.

, For instance, if your spouse’s habit is eating too much junk food, stop buying junk food. Instead of loading up on cake, candy, and chips at the grocery store, pick up healthy snacks like carrot sticks, trail mix, and apples. This will help your spouse manage their temptations.If your spouse tends to engage in their habit during a certain activity, encourage them to limit engaging in that activity. For instance, if your spouse tends to drink too much when watching football with their friends, encourage them to watch football less frequently.

, Talk to other family members and friends about helping your spouse break their habit. For instance, if your spouse has a habit of being constantly late, you might encourage your child to remind your spouse that they need to meet you at such-and-such a time. The more people you and your spouse can enlist to help your spouse break the habit, the better.If your spouse has a habit of leaving the car windows down during summer months, you could encourage neighbors to let one of you know by saying, “My spouse tends to leave the windows of their car down when it’s hot. Please let one of us know if you see the car windows down.”

, To motivate your spouse to break the habit and engage in a different one, provide them with some enticements.For instance, if you’re trying to get your spouse to stop their habit of not putting their dishes in the sink after dining, you could give them a kiss on the cheek each time they put their dishes in the sink after a meal.Other spouses might respond better to verbal praise. For instance, using the dishes example again, you might say, “Thank you for putting your dishes in the sink” when your spouse puts their dishes in the sink.
You and your spouse could celebrate together when your spouse meets certain milestones. For instance, if your spouse has a habit of forgetting to check the post office box, the two of you could enjoy dinner at a nice restaurant when they have successfully checked the post office box daily for one week.
Experiment with a variety of positive reinforcement measures to discover what works best with your spouse.

, Many people think that their spouses are deliberately trying to irritate them or cause problems when they engage in a habit time and again. However, this is likely not the case. The truth is probably that your spouse simply has a habit that developed over many years. They just need help seeing their habit and getting some motivation to change it.For instance, if your spouse has a habit of using all the toilet paper and not replacing it, you might think they are insensitive to your needs or don’t love you.
Think about your own habits that bother your spouse. Reflect on these behaviors and ask yourself about your motivations.
You’ll find that you do not go out of your way to upset the person you love and cherish more than anyone in the world, yet your spouse still gets frustrated occasionally by your faults. Likewise, you will then realize, your spouse is only human, and has their own flaws – as do we all.
Don’t take your spouse’s habits personally.

, Bad habits – like good habits – take time to form and time to break. If your spouse is not making as much progress toward breaking their habits as you’d like, try to be patient. Offer helpful reminders and continue to encourage your partner as they work to stop their habits., This will make it even harder to change your partner’s habits. Instead, choose one habit, and after solving it, move on to another habit.Start with one your spouse’s habits and then work on changing one of your habits. Enlist your spouse's help to help you change your habits as well.

Make yourself available if your child is still breastfeeding.,
Establish an eating pattern for your child.,
Be aware that your breast milk supply will increase to meet your child’s demand.,
Be prepared for your child to become a picky eater.",How to Deal with Toddler Growth Spurts2," If your child sleeps more than usual, he may wake up hungry more often. If you are still breastfeeding your child, make sure to be available when he wakes up.


If you cannot be around, consider pumping your breast milk and having bottles ready for when your child wakes up.

, Because of his growth spurt, your child will probably be hungry at random hours of the day. However, you should try to stick to a feeding schedule that also involves naptime. Once the pattern is established, you may find that your child is less cranky.


Children who are going through growth spurts have a tendency to be very cranky because they are either tired or hungry all the time.

, If your child seems to be eating a lot more at each meal, or drinking a lot more breast milk than normal, let him do so. His growing body needs the nutrients. Don’t be concerned that your breast milk will run out; if your child is demanding more milk, your body will rise to the occasion to meet the demand.If you are feeding your child regular baby food, consider adding a bit more food to his regular meals.

, Your child may prefer only one type of food at this stage in his growth. Your child’s appetite may decrease depending on how he copes up with his growth spurt.


Make sure that you are feeding him on time and that you are giving him the right amount of milk (breast milk or formula) together with other foods such as fruits, vegetables, meat and poultry

Give bottle fed toddlers something to soothe themselves with.,
Try to be as patient as possible.,
Reassure your child, even when he is cranky.",How to Deal with Toddler Growth Spurts3," Bottle fed toddlers may be crankier and cry more often than breastfed ones because there is no natural way for bottle fed babies to self soothe. If this is the case with your child, consider giving your child something to soothe himself with during or after bottle feeding.


Soothing items can include something to suck on, like a pacifier, or something soft, like a blanket or stuffed animal.

, Dealing with a screaming toddler can be very frustrating and stressful. Try to remember that your toddler is also going through a stressful time; his body hurts, he’s tired all the time, and he doesn’t understand what’s happening to his body. To help your toddler cope, try to remain calm and collected when you are around him.


If you show your frustration to your child, he can feed off of your emotions and become crabbier or more upset.
Stay calm and think about some activities that you can do together instead. When you are feeling like screaming yourself, begin playing with your toddler, singing to him, or reading a book. You could also go outside and let him run around in an attempt to burn off some energy.

, Crankiness goes hand-in-hand with growth spurts. While your child’s crankiness may seem endless and harrowing, your child will quiet down once the growth spurt is over. During the growth spurt, try to reassure your child that everything is ok, and that you are there to comfort him. This may help to ease his crankiness a bit.


Cuddle, hug and show affection towards your child during this time. Playing with your child and taking him outside may help to distract him from his crankiness.

Have your child measured by his pediatrician.,
Understand what growth charts can show you.,
Try to refrain from taking your own measurements until your child is older.",How to Deal with Toddler Growth Spurts4," To keep track of your child’s growth, his pediatrician will use a growth chart. Try to tell your child to stand up straight and not squirm around so that the doctor can take accurate measurements. There are four basic growth charts that your pediatrician uses depending on the sex and age of the child. These are:


Boys Growth Chart from Birth to 36 Months.
Girls Growth Chart from Birth to 36 Months.
Boys Growth Chart from 2 to 20 Years.
Girls Growth Chart from 2 to 20 Years.

, It should be remembered that growth charts are used to see a pattern of growth in your child and not as a tool to compare his results with other kids his age. If the pattern your child presents has always been more or less the same since he was born, then your child is growing normally. Growth charts help the doctor and yourself to recognize when something suddenly changes in your child’s growth pattern.If a change in growth does occur, the doctor will most likely order an x-ray to be taken to examine your child’s skeletal age. Skeletal age is the measure of your child’s bone development.

, While you may want to keep track of your child’s growth, try to let the doctor do this for you. Children between the ages of 6 and 18 months have a tendency to fluctuate in growth; this is absolutely normal. A parent keeping track of their child’s growth at this time might become needlessly worried.


Fluctuating growth patterns generally stop when the child reaches adolescence.

Reduce the clutter in your physical work space.,
Keep a paper schedule.,
Make lists and prioritize responsibilities.,
Get clarification on your specific responsibilities.,
Don’t be afraid to say no.,
Work to improve your productivity one step at a time.,
Build short breaks into your work day.",How to Avoid Being Overwhelmed by Information2," As important as it is to keep your virtual inboxes scrubbed clean of unnecessary sources of information, you also need to keep your physical workspace organized as well.Keep the surface of your desk, in particular, free of clutter.


A helpful rule of thumb: If you don’t use it every day, put it somewhere out of the way, preferably even out of sight.

, While electronic schedules can potentially increase the ease with which you stay abreast of multiple commitments, they can also readily become bogged down with unimportant events or be incapable to importing different types of events from all your different communication platforms. Paper schedules offer the benefits of having everything important right in front of you, titled, labeled, and otherwise organized in a way that’s entirely up to you.

, Make of list of everything you need to get done, and organize it according to different types of tasks or the timeframe in which they need to be completely. Most importantly, however, make sure to indicate tasks of greater importance so that you are reminded to get them out of the way first.


To help doing so, consider using different colored inks when writing your lists and schedules to visualize your responsibilities and keep what’s important in front of your mind’s eye.
For more specific guidance on making productivity-enhancing lists, see the wikiHow article on how to make a list.

, If your responsibilities at work have become bothersome or you feel as though you’ve been tasked with more than you can handle, you should communicate with your boss or supervisor. In particular, ask for clarification regarding what, specifically, is expected of you.If you are consistently asked to perform tasks that are not part of your job description, bring this to their attention.
Frame the conversation as motivated by your desire to better understand what is required of you. Say something direct and respectful like, “I’m hoping to clarify the specific tasks I am individually responsible for.”

, You may be taking on more than is healthy or productive. Though it may feel as though you’re struggling to balance or process large amounts of information, you may simply have committed to more tasks than can reasonably be addressed at the same time.Don’t allow co-workers to take advantage of your willingness to take on additional tasks. Think about what is being asked of you by yours peers – as well as your superiors – and be honest when you are unable or unwilling to do what is asked of you.
Another rule to follow: Only say yes when you really mean it. Maybe there is a simple task that either you or a coworker could complete. Don’t agree to taking it on unless it truly does not bother you to do so.

, It can be counterproductive to try to change the way you do several things all at once. If you identify multiple steps you intend to take to increase your productivity, implement them one at a time. Wait to implement a new step until you’ve fully incorporated a positive change into your life and no longer think about it., Especially if you sit at a computer all day, you will be more productive, and feel less overwhelmed by constant information, if you take quick, scheduled breaks every few hours. Aside from giving your brain a moment to recalibrate without new information coming in, your perspective on whatever you’re doing will likely improve with the chance to step back and clear your mind.Choose the frequency and duration of breaks based on your job, and on what seems to work for you. Some people prefer a five minute break every hour, or a half hour break every few hours.

Get plenty of sleep.,
Avoid intense discussions just before bed.,
Start the day on a positive mental note.,
Keep a journal.,
Walk to work.,
Get support from friends and family.,
Get professional help.",How to Avoid Being Overwhelmed by Information3," The amount of your rest you get may not seem immediately related to your ability to resist the sensation of information overload, but getting enough sleep is vital to your ability to process information efficiently. Further, getting sufficient rest decreases the likelihood you will experience the feeling of being overwhelmed, regardless of what your day holds.The perfect amount of sleep varies for different people. If possible, go to bed while allowing for eight hours of sleep before you get up. If you repeatedly wake up without an alarm after six or seven hours of sleep, this amount of time is likely sufficient.
Help yourself get to bed by developing healthy sleep habits, including minimizing screen use in the evening and avoiding caffeine later in the day.

, Important personal discussions that will engage you emotionally, and potentially upset, surprise, or sadden you should be avoided right before bed. While it’s important to have these types of conversations if you or someone you love feels it is necessary to do so, try to avoid having important conversations in the bedroom.This can be challenging, as many people’s best chance to speak with their partners often occurs right before bed.
To prevent new, potentially significant issues from coming up in the evening, establish a policy with whomever you spend your evenings not to begin potentially serious conversations with in the hour or two preceding your usual bedtime.
If you and yours can’t help yourselves from talking to one another excitedly, consider implementing a silent wind down period before actually going to bed. They may sound like overkill, but policies such as these can greatly enhance the quality of your rest.

, Starting the day relaxed and ready to go will greatly enhance your ability to deal with stress – including the stress associated with the inevitable onslaught of information endemic to contemporary life. Meditation exercises, journaling, or gentle physical exercises, for instance, are a healthy and empowering way to greet the day.Spend five minutes lying in bed and picture yourself rising, preparing for the day, and stepping out into the world ready and capable of handling whatever you encounter. If concerns rise up in your mind, immediately picture yourself dealing with them, without thinking about the specifics.

, The act of writing out your thoughts and feelings on paper can have a significantly positive effect on your ability to center yourself and clear your mind. Not only will your thoughts become more organized, they will have a tangible existence in your journal, which may allow you to quit revisiting them in your mind.Further, the act of writing will help you remove some of the mental detritus that’s floating around your mind by helping you focus on those things that are worth addressing further while pushing away the rest.

, Stated simply, getting a bit of exercise – including just a moderate walk – will help your mind and be resist becoming overwhelmed for the rest of the day. As you walk, you take in all sorts of information – sights, scents, temperature changes – but they’re pieces of information that your body craves. More tangibly, the increase in your blood’s circulation will help get your body physically engaged and ready to tackle the day’s tasks.

Exercise more heavily after work if you had a particularly overwhelming day. Exercise immediately reduces stress by improving your breathing, diminishing the physical symptoms of feeling overwhelmed, and increasing the supply of relaxing neurotransmitters to your brain.

, Resist the inclination to hole up when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Your friends and family in particular will can offer an incredible source of support just by offering their ears. The opportunity to simply express your thoughts and feelings will go a long way in helping you process the information and sentiments you may be struggling with.Know that friends and family members are much more likely to be humbled by your willingness to speak with them than they are to be feel burdened. Don’t hesitate to open up.

, If you continue to struggle with the feeling that you’re overwhelmed by the amount of information you encounter in your daily life, get help from a mental health professional. Professional psychologists can help you learn to prevent and address stress, not to mention adjust your lifestyle to one that may help you feel overwhelmed less often."

Relax yourself with a controlled breathing exercise.,
Focus on a simple activity.,
Actively address problems that are bothering you.",How to Avoid Being Overwhelmed by Information4," Meditation and mindfulness are extremely effective ways to address the feeling of being overwhelmed, not to mention clear your mind and reduce stress. Respond to any overwhelming sentiments as soon as they arise by taking a moment to breathe deeply and focus on your breath while doing so.Close your eyes and inhale deeply while counting slowly to four. Exhale just as slowly, again counting to four.
Repeat this process several times, while thinking only about your breath as in enters or leaves your body, filling and emptying your chest.

, If your mind tends to wander when you attempt to focus on your breath, start by focusing on a particular action. For instance, go for a quick walk and focus on your footsteps. Don’t assess your footsteps, rather feel them occur mindfully, without passing judgement. Your ability to focus with the goal of emptying your mind will improve the more you perform simple mental exercises such as these.Look for opportunities to practice focusing on something simple throughout your day, as this will help keep your mind more focused generally.
Another great opportunity to practice mindfulness is during a meal. The next time you sit down to eat, choose somewhere quiet, and try to think only about each bite - including how it feels and taste as you chew - and nothing more.

, If something is weighing on your mind, it may likely contribute to the feeling that there’s too much going on in your life, even if you’re thinking about other things most of the time. Be proactive about addressing any sources of stress in your life, as they will likely contribute the feeling of being overwhelmed if left unaddressed."

Treat your children as individuals.,
Avoid comparisons.,
Help your children resolve conflicts.,
Intervene when necessary.,
Listen to each child.,
Encourage cooperation.,
Consider the roots of your rivalry.,
Take the initiative to smooth things over.,
Learn to respect and admire your sibling's talents.,
Consider your sibling's perspective.,
Talk to your child about the new baby.,
Make a smooth introduction.,
Help with the transition.,
Deal with an older sibling acting out.,
Encourage an older child to be kind to a new baby.",How to Avoid Sibling Rivalry," At a certain point, children want to feel separate from their siblings. They will develop their own interests, skills, and talents to develop their sense of self. Encourage this by treating each of your children as an individual. This will help your child form a healthy identity separate from his or her sibling.Do not respond differently to children's interests or successes. At times, this can be tough. You may share an interest with one child that you do not share with the other. However, give each child's interests equal attention.
Avoid any behavior that could make it look as if you're playing favorites. Maybe your son Mason plays football, while your daughter Jacqueline plays hockey. You don't understand the rules of hockey as well as football, and this could make you look more interested in Mason's activities. Try to make an effort to learn about hockey so you can nurture Jacqueline's individuality.;
, Never compare one child to another. This is likely to foster a sense of rivalry. Even in moments of frustration, do not compare your kids.Your children may have different abilities. One child may excel at math, while another excels at science. Avoid comparing your child's abilities. Praise each child equally for his or her unique skills.
Always keep the focus on your child when praising him or her for skills. Never bring up the other child.
To help your children see how you want them to behave, try pointing to adults as models of good behavior instead of older siblings. For example, you might say to your child, “See how dad always says please and thank you when he needs something? That’s important to do. Always say please and thank you to be polite.”

, You do not want to intervene in a way that makes it look like you're taking sides. Never say one child was right and the other was wrong. Instead, try to help your children resolve conflicts.Instead, encourage your children to compromise. Try to find win-win negotiations. For example, say things like, ""Mason, don't you think Charlie deserves a turn? If you let him play with your Legos, maybe he'll share his stuffed animals with you.""
If your children start picking on one another, remind them to express their feelings respectfully. Help your children identify what they're feeling before they act.
Never engage with arguments like, ""He started it."" Respond with something like, ""Regardless of who started it, you two need to work this out.""

, You cannot let every argument or dispute get worked out between your children, however. At times, you will need to intervene. When appropriate, break up disputes.Dangerous fights require intervention. If your children are hurting one another, separate them immediately. If one child is engaging in abusive and bullying behaviors, this needs to be addressed.
You should also talk to each child privately. Neither child should be scolded or reprimanded in front of the other, as this can fuel rivalry. Pull the child who was the aggressor aside and tell him why his behavior was unacceptable. You should also talk to the other child, in private, and explain he was treated inappropriately. Encourage him to talk to you if it happens again in the future.
If one child is always the aggressor in the situation, talk to a therapist. You may need to get the aggressive child into counseling to prevent abuse and bullying.

, One-on-one attention is very important to each child. It's normal for siblings to feel frustrated with one another, and you need to let your children vent such frustrations. Listen objectively, however, with the goal of offering solutions rather than stirring up conflict.Let your child tell you about any insecurities or frustrations he or she has with his or her sibling. Your child should be able to vent negative feelings to you.
Acknowledge you understand your child's feelings without explicitly agreeing. Encourage your child to talk out his or her issues with the other sibling. If you want, you could host regular family meetings where you discuss any problems disrupting your family's harmony.

, Building a culture of helping between family members can help to promote cooperation over competition. You can encourage cooperation among your children by acknowledging cooperative behavior, thanking them, or by praising them when they are helping each other.


For example, you might say something like, ""Jon! You are being so helpful with your sister! You must love her so much! I'm proud of you."" Or, you might say, ""Oh my goodness! You two are such little helpers, everyone gets a hug!""
You can also try playing cooperative games with your children to help them get along. These are games where you do not compete against each other. Instead, you work together to win the game as a team. For example, you can teach your kids to play musical chairs with hula hoops, but as you remove hoops, encourage your kids to share the remaining hoops rather than excluding one of them from the game., If you feel competitive with a sibling, there may be a reason for this. Think about when and why the rivalry began. Understanding its roots may help you see how it's irrational.Did something happen early in childhood that made the two of you competitive? Did your parents seem to favor one sibling over the other? Did you two compete in the same field professionally?
Think about who your sibling his outside his or her relationship with you. Try to view your sibling more as a person than a potential threat. This can help you empathize with your sibling more, lessening any feelings of competitiveness. You may realize that, for years, you were not seeing your sibling as a person, but a rival. Try to think about when this mentality began.

, Sibling rivalry can cause familial tension. If there has been damage done between you and a sibling, someone needs to take the initiative to smooth things over.Try to repair the relationship. Something as simple as a phone call can help open up communication again. Let your sibling know you've been thinking of him or her and would like to get together.
Being the bigger person is sometimes difficult. You may feel like you deserve an apology, or that your sibling should have to make the first move. Try to let go of these feelings. Your sibling may not even know you're feeling the way you are, so don't be too bitter to reach out.

, Jealousy can come from a sense of inadequacy. Instead of coveting your siblings talents, try to foster feelings of respect and admiration.Recognize when you're feeling jealous. If your sibling, say, accomplishes something, it's okay to pause and acknowledge you're feeling some jealousy. You can accept your feelings without acting on them in a negative way.
Congratulate your sibling for his or her accomplishment. Then, examine why it made you feel jealous. For example, maybe your sibling landed his or her dream job. You've been working a so-so job for awhile, and haven't been applying elsewhere. Maybe this is more about you underperforming than your sibling.

, Sibling rivalry is often more mutual than it feels. While you may feel everything came easy for your sibling, or that he or she had an unfair advantage, stop and consider your sibling's perspective.Ask your sibling how he or she felt about your childhood. Try to see some of the issues through his or her eyes.
Maybe you were always envious your sibling got more attention as a kid. However, your sibling may have felt a lot of unfair pressure to perform growing up. He or she may have envied your freedom.

, Your child may be jealous of a new infant. You can help the transition go smoothly by talking to your child about the new baby in the months before your due date.Have your child help prepare for the baby. Have him or her help set up the nursery, pick out names, and get toys for the baby. This will make your child see him or herself as a nurturer. He or she may be less threatened by the baby's arrival.
Make sure you explain the baby will not be a playmate right away. Make sure your child knows the baby will eat, sleep, and cry for most of the day at first, but eventually your child will become friends with the baby.

, You want to make sure the first meeting goes over well. Right from the get-go, you want your child to feel safe and happy with the new baby.Have your partner of a loved one bring the child into the delivery room. Have someone else hold the baby as you cuddle your child. This will prevent feelings of jealousy.
You can give your current child a gift from the baby. For example, give your child a shirt that says ""big brother"" or ""big sister.""

, A smooth transition can help prevent tension and rivalry. When the baby comes home, make sure to introduce the baby into your home as smoothly as possible.Children younger than 2 may not really understand what it means to have a new baby. Allow them to see the baby, and show them pictures and storybooks about babies.
Older children, between the ages of 2 and 4, may be jealous of the baby. If this is an issue, help the child get involved with the baby. Foster feelings of support by having your older children come shopping with you for baby toys and supplies.
School-age children may also be jealous, but can better understand a baby's needs. Explain to them why a newborn needs so much care, and let them know the benefits of being a big brother or sister.
All children, regardless of age, should still get individual attention after a baby is born. This will lessen feelings of rivalry.

, Children may act out to get attention after a baby is born. If your child is acting out, ask him or her if something is wrong. Encourage open communication so your child can talk to you if he or she feels upset.Ask your child how he or she feels having a new sibling. Listen to the responses, and reassure your child that he or she is still cared for.
You can also praise your child for behaving well. You want your child to see he or she gets attention for behaving rather than acting out.

, You want your child to feel loving and protective of the new baby. Tell your child about appropriate behavior around the baby and allow him or her help with the baby's care.Allow your child to watch or help when you feed or change the baby.
Praise your child for showing the baby affection, such as singing to the baby.

Take the “let’s get healthy” approach.,
Compliment his/her toned physique after one workout.,
Choose a fitness routine that may not seem like exercise.,
Talk about your successful results--without being annoying.,
Ask him/her to motivate you to work out.",How to Get Your Significant Other to Work Out," You want your sweetheart around for the long haul and being out of shape is not only a little unattractive, it can be working against the aging process. Those who infuse cardio and exercise into their lives can help slow down the aging process and prevent chronic and possibly deadly diseases.


Let his/her doctor take the blame. Your significant other’s doctor told him/her some tests were a little off--the cholesterol or sugars were too high, for example. Tell your sweetheart you love him/her and that you want to lower the numbers together in the gym.
He/she is feeling a bit sluggish and tired lately--exercise can help. Rev the engines and increase energy levels by being more physically active. If he/she complains that he/she is exhausted all the time, consider adding a quick walk or run at night. Once your significant other sees the increase in energy he/she may want to hit the gym to achieve that level of pep.
Focus completely on health and not weight. Especially if you are heading into or are already in middle age or beyond, exercise is no longer just to look hot. It keeps the organs healthy and may help your honey avoid the same medications his/her friends have started (i.e. blood pressure pills etc.).;
, The best way to keep the motivation train running is to start gushing a few days following that initial workout. He/she will love the strokes, which may have him/her continuing with the workouts.


Be sincere and not fake. Don’t tell him/her that after that first workout he/she has certainly lost 20 pounds. However, a compliment like, “Hey, your biceps look firmer or your butt looks pretty good” will take you pretty far.
Don't deliver a compliment while looking for one in return. Don’t be flexing in the mirror, glance over and then say, “Hey baby, you look hot, what do you think about these guns?” He/she will know it’s a backhanded compliment and see through your ruse.

, For example, suggest taking a doubles tennis class together or ballroom dancing. He/she may think it's a fun way to bond, when in reality you’ll know that you are raising his/her heart rate.


Find something that will interest your mate. Maybe a game of touch football sounds like heaven on earth to you, but to him/her it's a snooze fest. Consider what he/she would enjoy before you start making plans.
Get friends in on your game. If your friend wants to get his/her spouse or partner to workout too, make it a foursome for added fun (make sure that the spouses are friends before you commit).
Select something he/she can do. Don't go hard core if your sweetie hasn’t been working out lately or hasn’t worked out at all. Find something you know he/she will find success and enjoy.
Get competitive. Some people are motivated by friendly competition. Consider rolling out a “challenge” where you will see who can be a better golfer, runner etc.

, Nothing motivates some people more than seeing their partner getting hot and toned while they are still sluggish and doughy (although be careful with this notion as some people may retreat into sloth even more).


Pull out old clothes that you’d been saving for a “skinny day.” He/she may be green with envy if you can fit back into your old size or better yet---the smallest size ever.
Purchase new clothing that accentuates your new figure. Shopping can be fun when you are able to wear outfits you couldn’t fit into before. He/she may see that and want the same for him or herself.

, Another way to entice your mate to exercise is to act as though (or maybe it’s true) you can’t get motivated to work out unless you have a partner--your significant other.


Ask him/her to help you devise a fitness plan. This is a sneaky way of getting him/her to perhaps look at a fitness plan for him or herself. Use online apps or fitness websites to help you configure a program that will fit both of your needs.
Tell him/her you can’t get motivated unless he/she joins you. Avoid whining when asking him/her to continue to stick to the program. Be direct but explain that your continued dedication is dependent upon his/her participation.

Plan ahead to pop the question.,
* Short, simple words carry a lot more power than big, fancy words.,
Purchase an engagement ring.,
Ask your lover to marry you.,
Begin to plan the wedding.",How to Get Married1," Your (hopefully) spouse-to-be should be surprised, delighted, and / or put a bit off-balance by your proposition. It is the sort of romantic moment most people live for, so be sure to get it right by planning it out early. Think about the appropriate place, time, and words to say. Try to think of things your lover particularly enjoys – favorite restaurants, activities, and / or music – but for whatever reason does not get to indulge in very often. Use these as background elements to set up a truly memorable proposition to marry.;
, If you want to make a great impact with what you say, plan to speak plainly and from the heart., Since you are doing the asking, it is your responsibility to have the engagement ring picked out ahead of time. Think about what your lover likes and dislikes. If there is jewelry for you to examine, do so and avoid gems and colors that make few or no appearances in your partner's current collection.


Feel free to specifically ask your partner about engagement rings, but be sure to do it well in advance of when you actually plan to buy the ring, so he or she will have forgotten all about it.
Do not feel as though you have to spend an exorbitant amount of money on an engagement ring. The more important thing is what the ring symbolizes. Besides, the wedding itself is likely to set you back plenty on its own.

, With the ring stowed safely away, begin your day or night out together. Be on your best behavior and keep things happy and bright. When the time comes, drop to one knee in front of your partner, pull out your ring, and say your piece. With any luck, you will get a resounding “yes!”.


Propose in public, if you can help it at all. Having witnesses around proves to your lover that you are ready to get married no matter who knows it and no matter what they might think. The people around you will love the show, too.

, Once the night is through and you are successfully engaged to be married, waste no time in laying out plans for the ceremony and honeymoon. Even a small civil ceremony needs a time and a place; most people will also want a more formal ceremony, whether religious or civil, which requires all kinds of event planning skills and plenty of money. Do not forget to register with a wedding gift registry, if you would like people to bring wedding gifts.


Plan the wedding with your lover. Include parents and legal guardians as well. More often than not, they will be glad to help plan and defray the cost of the event.

"
"
Pick a time and place.,
Be prepared.,
Tie the knot.",How to Get Married2," As a general rule of thumb, do not get married immediately after the engagement is announced. Instead, enjoy being engaged for a little while. With any luck, it is the only time you will ever be engaged in your entire life. Once you can both agree on a day, find a justice of the peace, notary public, or other legally-empowered person to perform your marriage. Call ahead and set up an appointment; it will give him or her something pleasant to look forward to that day.

, Arrive to the site of your ceremony early, and bring at least one witness along. Dress up or not as you like it: Only the two of you, the master of the ceremony, and your witness(es) will be there to see.

, Follow the lead of the official and exchange vows. Kiss your spouse when you are done! You can choose to get a marriage license the same day you get married, in most cases; fees vary by state, but are not usually very expensive. The license gives you legal proof of your marriage for tax and other purposes. Once you have it, you do not need to renew it.

Choose a venue.,
Choose a theme.,
* Weddings based on ancestral culture can be fun, especially if either both parties share a similar background, or both parties come from very different backgrounds but are willing to compromise.,
* Weddings based on shared interests and style can be very flashy and enjoyable for all involved, as they provide easy ways to take standard traditions and twist them around a little bit for a clever new take.,
Hire help.,
* Trust your helpers.,
Set up as early as possible.,
Go with the flow.",How to Get Married3," Most religious or semi-religious people will probably want some kind of wedding in a church, but if you and your partner choose a civil ceremony, that does not mean you do not have options. Aside from chapels and meeting halls available to rent, city parks, family estates, and even cruise ships may be viable options. People have even gotten married while skydiving. Discuss costs and personal values with your lover and settle on a venue that suits both of you.

, For people who strictly adhere to one of the older churches, the details of the ceremony will more or less follow tradition; for everyone else, it is time to pick and choose. Remember to keep more than your likes and dislikes in mind. This is a serious and life-altering event; plan it so that it reflects your deeply held values and beliefs as well. That is not to say you cannot have fun picking a fanciful theme, but do not forget the momentous nature of the day.

, Feel free to get a bit theatrical, especially if you do not want to do everything according to actual ancestral wedding traditions: Matching torcs and a silk-clad harpist are perfectly appropriate for a Celt-Irish themed wedding, for example., The main thing to be aware of is cost: A Gothic wedding and a video game-themed wedding might seem like diametric opposites, but both are likely to cost more than a plain ceremony., This does not necessarily have to be a professional, such as an event planner, but it helps, if you can afford it. Otherwise, ask around among friends and relatives to find people who can assist in planning things like seating arrangements and help put up garlands, streamers, tables, and other elements right before the wedding. For more time-consuming or complex tasks, offer to pay a little bit.

, If there is a question or problem, they will come to you. Instead of hovering, why not find something else to work on or help out with?, Normally, you will not be able to set things up for your wedding until the day arrives, but that does not mean you cannot be up before dawn and working on it. In some cases, you can begin to prepare a day or even a few days beforehand. If you are fortunate enough to have this option, take it: Setting up a wedding is exhausting work.

, Once the ceremony starts and the wedding is on, you and your soon-to-be spouse are the center of attention, not only for everyone attending but even for anyone who happens to pass by (as in an outdoor wedding) and notice what is going on. This is not the time to nitpick or berate anybody nor is it the time to get upset when something is less than perfect. Instead, set a shining example to everyone around you. Be forgiving of problems or complications that arise. Keep your composure with a smile, no matter what, both during the ceremony and at the reception. Your parents and friends will be impressed and remember the event fondly.

Get your wife’s opinion.,
Move closer to her.,
Flash your wedding rings.,
Use eye contact.,
Ask for respect.,
Laugh about it.",How to Get Other Guys to Stop Staring at Your Pretty Wife1," Value how your wife feels about the situation and get an understanding of how if affects her. If she is bothered by the stares, discuss whether or not you should intervene on her behalf.


If you have addressed this issue in the past, then you may already know how your wife feels about the attention that she receives. If this is the case, make a decision in advance on how you will respond so that you do not overreact.
If your wife does not recognize the problem, then maybe there isn't one and you can just enjoy your day and time together.;
, Demonstrate that you are a couple by holding her hand or linking arms to show that she is not just a friend.


Showing affection with a kiss on the lips is a great way to demonstrate that you are in a relationship.
Your wife is probably proud of you and appreciates it when you show affection to let others know that you are together. This can also apply to a situation where someone is staring at you and you want to demonstrate that you are taken. It works both ways., Sometimes when a man finds a woman attractive, he does not take the time to look at her ring finger because he is focused on admiring her beauty. If either you, your wife, or both of you discreetly flash your wedding rings, that will eliminate any question about whether or not you are married.

, Let the other guy know that you see him looking at your wife. If at a restaurant, for example, look at the guy who is looking at your wife to show him that you are uncomfortable with his actions.


Another way to use eye contact is to gaze into your wife’s eyes to demonstrate that you have a connection that the outside world cannot touch. This approach can also be used if you have an admirer staring at you., Politely ask the offender to stop staring at your wife. Tell him that you would appreciate it if he showed you and her a little respect. Most decent people will stop staring at this point.


Encourage your wife to share her opinion with the person staring, but only if she chooses to say something. She can do this without creating a scene by casually saying that she is taken.
If you continue to be concerned about the attention that your wife receives, discuss your insecurities and ask her for reassurance., As with many things in life, it is always good to have a sense of humor. Sometimes you just have to laugh it off and know that it is comical that other men think that your wife would even be remotely interested in them.

Determine if you able to get a domestic partnership.,
Consider the limitations, including those by the IRS.,
Consider the benefits.",How to Get a Domestic Partnership1," The laws regarding domestic partnerships and civil unions are different in various locations. Because domestic partnerships are not uniformly created, it is challenging to locate the statutes. Start with the state statutes and search for domestic partnerships or civil unions. If you find nothing, look at codes for your local county/parish and city, again, searching for domestic partnerships or civil unions. If you find nothing in any set of statutes, contact the clerk of courts or the county recorder’s office.Some states do not provide for domestic partnerships or civil unions at all.
In some of those states, individual counties or cities may have enacted domestic partnership or civil union laws for that location.
Some states forbid domestic partnerships or civil unions.
Some states provide for domestic partnerships or civil unions that are consistent throughout the state.
Some domestic partnership or civil union laws are available for use by all residents.
Some are limited to only particular groups of people, such as homosexuals, heterosexuals over age 55, employees of particular governmental units, etc.;
, A domestic partnership is not a marriage, and the partners do not usually qualify for the same benefits as marriage, including Social Security spousal benefits. Be sure you know the effect the domestic partnership will have on your income taxes and future retirement and estate planning. The IRS is clear that:Domestic partners cannot file married, either jointly or separately
One partner cannot file head of household claiming only the other partner as a dependent.
There are also special rules in calculating income from partnership property

, There are a variety of benefits of having a domestic partnership over a marriage. There are also benefits to having a domestic partnership instead of just living together. Some of these include:


The ability to retain separate property to pass to your pre-existing descendents
The ability to visit in hospitals if necessary
The ability to inherit in some situations
The ability to make decisions as the “next of kin” as necessary
The ability to take advantage of employee benefits earned by your partner in many cases

Gauge his interest in marriage.",How to Get a Husband," You aren't going to meet the man of your dreams by sitting home and watching bad reality shows. You have to get out and start meeting people. You have to enlist your friends and family in helping you meet new people. One of these guys you meet could be the one.It's important to do things that are outside of your comfort zone. Not only will this widen the net for potential mates, but it will also make you more interesting. For example: if you're usually a bookish type person, try going out to a concert, or take rock climbing lessons. You'll meet all different types of people, who in turn will introduce you to an ever-widening network of potential husbands.
Make sure that you tell family and friends that you're looking for a relationship and ask them to set you up with a guy they think you might like. Family and friends can be great for that sort of thing and will usually have your best interests at heart.
Try different dating styles. Make an online dating profile and see what turns up from that (after you weed out the online dating morons) and try out blind dates that have been set up by your friends and family. A large proportion of married people met their significant other through mutual friends or through family.;
, Confidence is that trait that can get you more dates than any subjective ""attractiveness"" is going to. Fortunately, unlike physical appearance, confidence is a trait that can be learned and developed. The more you try it, the more confident you will get, and the more men will be intrigued by your confidence.


Fake it 'til you make it. The great thing about confidence is that you can fake it and trick your brain into actually believing that you're confident. Start small--wear those heels you love, but think you look silly in, or that bright red lipstick--and work your way up to bigger acts of confidence--asking a guy for his number, buying a guy a drink, etc.
Don't compare yourself to other people, especially other women. Someone is always going to be better-looking, more successful, with better relationships. You need to focus on the good things about yourself, rather than how you compare to others.

, Dating can be a bit like marketing, or like looking for a job. You have to learn how to present yourself in a way that draws guys in. This doesn't mean that you give up who you are, it simply means that you know how to get across the best, and simplest, sides of who you are.Draw up a list of good qualities. If you're having difficulties (and a lot of people with self-esteem issues do) have a trusted friend help you out there. For example: you might say that you're ""a good listener,"" ""funny,"" ""a fabulous hiker,"" ""up for anything,"" etc. They have to be positive qualities!
Have an image. Pick three of the things that you put on your list and create an image based on these. Again, this does not mean sacrificing who you are as a complex individual, but it is a shorthand way to present yourself and for your friends/family to talk about you with potential dates. For example: using the above qualities you present yourself as ""a funny, outdoors person, who's up for anything.""
Dress for success. If you're going in for a job interview you're not going to be super slovenly. You don't want to dress yourself super uncomfortably and you want to make sure you're dressing for the occasion (dressing to the nines to go to the gym is probably not the best idea).

, It's really important that you don't limit your options for dating by focusing exclusively on ""dating"" places (like the bar, parties, etc.). People meet their significant others in all kinds of places, and you'll need to be open to that possibility.For example, if you're on a long train ride, maybe make eye contact with that guy across the train you think is cute. If you're really bold, strike up conversation.
This is also why it's so important to get out there and do things. You could very well meet that special someone at the park, at the library, on a plane to somewhere far away, at your local charity benefit.

, If you're putting yourself out there, marketing yourself effectively, then you're going to start garnering interest. Now's the time to start weeding out the ones that aren't going to cut it: the players, the really strange ones, the ones who wouldn't make good husbands, etc.Don't be so picky. While you are trying to get rid of the ones who won't work, you should also consider giving a chance to guys that you might not normally go for. This doesn't mean that creepy guy you met at the bar, but it does mean maybe trying out someone who doesn't have rock hard abs, or who dresses in a manner you aren't sure you like. You never know what might come out of that sort of relationship.
Some things to look out for in a potential mate: he blames women for everything (eventually he'll start to blame you, too; run away from the ""you're not like other women"" guy; bonus points for derogatory language); a guy who's obsessed with looks (your looks will ""fade"" as you get older and he'll start looking at the younger crowd); someone who doesn't want to be exclusive (it's unlikely that he'll ever commit to being exclusive; you can do better).

, Remember, there is no guarantee that you're going to find a husband. Even if you do, he's probably not going to look like a movie star, treat you like a queen, and devote his every second to your needs. That doesn't mean you won't find someone whom you love and are passionate with.

, When you've met someone that you think you might like, show them that. While this doesn't mean getting super clingy and pouring your emotions all over them, it does mean that you give off signs of interest, like flirting.Eye contact is the most basic and most important part of flirting. You can use this without any of the other accoutrement that articles on flirting always recommend. When you're talking with the guy, dancing with him, or giving him looks across the dance floor, maintain constant eye contact. In the beginning it might be a little uncomfortable, but it goes from uncomfortable to soul-piercing pretty quickly and builds a connection between the two of you.
Smile. This will soften the intensity of your gaze, and it will also show that you are interested. Never try to fake a smile, because fake smiles never reach your eyes.
Ask him questions about himself. People love to talk about themselves, so it will make him more likely to open up and to realize that you're interested in him. Don't immediately jump in after he talks with an anecdote of your own. Instead ask follow up questions on whatever he just said.

, You need to make sure that you have your own life outside of him. Have nights out with just your friends. Go and do fun things by yourself. Not only will you show that you aren't clingy, but the two of you will have more stuff to talk about when you meet up.


Don't drop everything to meet up with him every time he asks. You don't want to blow him off, or say no so many times he doesn't think you're interested. However, you do want to make it clear that you have things going on in your life other than him and while you enjoy being with him, he isn't the only thing you have going on.
For example: if he calls and asks you to go out that night, say something like ""I'd love to, but I promised my friend I'd go to her art exhibit opening. Maybe we could meet up next weekend?"" You show that you have other things in your life, and you also show that you are interested in him.

, Laughter is a great way to pique someone's interest. You don't have to turn into a stand-up comedian to do this, fortunately. It's also important to remember that each person has a unique sense of humor. You'll need to gauge the types of things he thinks are funny before you launch into your witty repartee.


One type of humor that tends to work well on most people is telling a funny story, something that actually happened. For example: tell him about the time that you got lost in the metro system and had to have your friend come and rescue you, or that time you tried to make donuts and ended up almost burning down your apartment.
Don't belittle yourself, however. Don't call yourself stupid or dumb or whatever pejorative you come up with. This will feed into your insecurities rather than boosting your confidence. You can poke a little gentle fun at yourself without calling yourself names.

, Just as with women, the opinion of a guy's friends is going to be very important to whether he keeps seeing you and whether he gets serious about your relationship. You will want to make sure that they like you.


This doesn't mean that you have to be a pushover and bend over backwards to accommodate his friends. Likewise, if they say rude or disparaging things that you don't agree with, you have every right to call them out. In fact, you should probably reconsider the relationship with your guy.
When you're hanging out with your guy and his friends, ask them questions about themselves (what do they do as a job? where are they from? what did they study in college? what did they want to be when they were little?). Again, people love talking about themselves and if his friends think you really care about the answers, they're going to be a lot more interested in keeping you around.

, A big problem that people have when it comes to dating is rushing into things. You really want to get married, and that's completely understandable, but you have to really make sure that you want to be married to this person for the rest of your life, otherwise it's going to cause problems down the road.


It's usually best to give it three months before you start to get more serious. This amount of time lets you get over the initial high (the ""honeymoon phase"") and allows to you look at the relationship more clearly.
For example, say you meet a nice guy and you've gone on a few dates. Instead of right away trying to hint towards marriage or moving in together, you step back and let things move naturally in that direction. He's less likely to feel broadsided by your need for a husband.

, Another thing that has a tendency to foul up relationships is too many expectations. If you're coming into a relationship with your entire marriage and life until death planned out, that's a huge amount of pressure to put on another person. Chances are things aren't going to work out in the way you have planned (welcome to life).


For example, say you've gone out with a guy for a few dates and you're already telling your friends that he's ""The One"" and you're spending all this time fantasizing about your perfect marriage together, instead of spending time with him just being in the present relationship. You have to allow that relationship to develop as it will.
There's nothing wrong with daydreaming, or hoping that he might be the man you marry, but you have to make sure that you're grounded in the reality of the relationship. That amazing guy in your head might bear little resemblance to the guy you're actually dating and it will hurt you when he turns out not to be like you've been imagining him.

, A good way to make sure that things progress further than a few dates is to engage in the things that he's interested in. This doesn't mean molding yourself to what you think he wants, or that you leave your own interests by the wayside. It means that you find out about his interests, ask him about them, and maybe try them out.


For example: He really likes to swim. You could ask him about the kinds of swimming he does, how he got into swimming, does he like to compete, and so on. You could even have him help you improve your own swimming techniques.
Remember, though, if he is only interested in his own hobbies and never in yours, there are going to be problems later on. He's probably a bit narcissistic and certainly not as interested in you as you deserve.

, A really important part of creating a lasting relationship is to make sure that you show the other person how important they are to you. He'll feel that he's important to you and that will strengthen your relationship.


Tell him what he means to you. Say things like ""It really means a lot to me that you did all the dishes last night,"" or ""Thank you so much for listening to me rant about my terrible day.""
You can also do little things to show your appreciation: take him out for one of his favorite activities as a surprise, write him a letter with the reasons why he means so much to you.

, You need to find out whether he's the marrying type and how he might feel about marrying you, in specific. If he doesn't want to marry and that's super important to you, then it might be time to move on and find someone with whom you are more compatible.


You can come right out and ask ""How do you feel about marriage?"" (Avoid doing that in the beginning of the relationship, otherwise you'll come off way too strong.)
It might be better to ease into this question. You could bring up some mutual friends who just got married, or someone at work and say ""I think that your earlier 30s are a good time to get married, what do you think?"" If he reacts badly to the idea of marriage, that is not a good sign.
You should also pay attention to how he uses ""we"" and ""us"" in referring to the future. The more he's making future plans with you in terms of a partnership the more likely he is to be looking towards marriage and commitment.

Acknowledge that you have lost your wife's trust because of something you did (or did not do).,
Consider whether you really want to regain your wife's trust.,
Be prepared to accept your wrongdoing.,
Deal with whatever you did wrong.,
Talk to your wife.,
Expect your wife to feel insecure about you.,
Be attentive.,
Be supportive of your wife's wishes.,
Be sincere.,
Work at it.,
Give your wife space and let time do the healing.",How to Gain Your Wife's Trust Again," You made a choice to do it (or not do it). It comes right back to your impulsive actions or willful inaction, your failure to respect her and your relationship and your willingness to hurt in to pursue something else that you felt mattered only to you. Whether you've had an affair, embezzled the household savings, committed harm against her, sullied her reputation, or whatever, the same issue lies at the heart of your actions––you made a bad choice and you lacked respect.;
, You must truly want to restore what you had or at least start over. If you feel compelled to do so out of reasons beyond your own wishes (such as being pressured by family or social obligations), then it is possible you haven't learned your lesson and whatever you did will only rear its head again later. Instead, you must want to restore what you both had because it matters to you.

, You cannot gain back another person's trust when you feel compelled to lay any, some or all of the ""blame"" on that other person. Telling your wife that she seemed ""too busy, too preoccupied, too bored, too shopping addicted, whatever"", you are just making excuses for your behavior. This isn't about how she was failing to meet your expectations; you've destroyed her expectations of you, so this is all about rebuilding a broken foundation. Do not make it seem as if she was the cause, in any way. If you do that, she won't see your attempts to regain trust as genuine.

, End the affair, get a job to repay the lost funds, get counseling for your violent tendencies, get counseling for your sexual addition or pornography usage, etc. Whatever the problem, seek out and actually put in place the solution needed to stop the reason for the breach of trust. Without this positive sign of your willingness to make changes, she won't have any reason to trust that you have changed and are setting forth a new course.


Cease all involvement with anyone that has been an issue. Even if you've been the flirty type when interacting with others, keep the flirting to a minimum.

, Explain what you have done, why you accept the blame for what you have done and set forth exactly what it is that you are now doing to restore her faith in you. This will require courageous honesty on your behalf, as well as a willingness to listen to what she has to say in return. She will probably have a lot to say but even if all she does is listen, respect her choice of reaction and simply be there for her. You cannot fix ""her"" feelings––she is entitled to them, so listen and learn.


Let her know every day that you have time to listen to anything she has to say. No interruption or arguments about what's being said; just listen.

, Broken trust comes with wondering a lot about the person who broke that trust––questions such as what are you doing, where are going, who are you with, where have you been, are you really doing what you say you're doing are going to be whizzing through her mind a lot. Do what you can to preempt the questions by giving information in advance, that can help her to feel satisfied that you are telling the truth.


If she's worried about where you're going and who you'll be with, ask her along. Or, ask her to call you or let her know you'll call her and have your phone on video chat, so that she can actually see where you are and who you're with.
Offer to attend something she cares about that you've neglected to become involved in. This might be church, a hobby, a sporting activity, etc.
Be more open. Show her your online social networking accounts; show her your friend lists, etc. Show her your phone, open for her to see the contact list. Be willing to pick up the phone when she calls. Don't make her chase you.
Keep the clock as your unofficial accountability partner. Don't be late and don't have questionable lapses in the time it should take you to get home.

, Be careful about how you display your attentiveness; the modern day woman is wise to the purchase of flowers, chocolates, jewelry, etc., as guilt gifts, especially when these haven't formed part of your behavior since the dating years. While it may feel right to buy her something nice by way of an initial apology, don't think that it will be the salve that solves all; it can only be one thing in your repertoire of dedicated refocusing of attention back to her and your relationship. In actuality, it is important to be fully engaged with her, by listening, explaining clearly and carefully what you are doing and thinking, and apologizing when you have given her any further reasons to feel a lack of trust. Being attentive includes:


Spending more time together. Be home instead of at the pub, work or the sports field. If she is going to regain trust in you, it'll only come through attentiveness in the present time, by showing that you are dedicated to being around, spending time with her and being clearly interested in her company.
Going through the household needs together. This can be a great time to rearrange who does what to keep the household functioning. Perhaps a new budget, a new chores list, a new way of running the house are in order. Maybe even a new house is in order; moving away from what was to a fresh, clean start can sometimes be just the ticket to restore a relationship.
If you have kids, considering whether your parenting approach needs to be improved or changed. Perhaps you have neglected your part of the child raising; if so, you can make changes to spend more time with the kids. Or maybe you only focused on the kids to the exclusion of your wife; once again, you can reorient this skewed slant to be more balanced.
Eating supper/dinner at the same table. Do not eat with anything electronic on the table or outside it; such items interfere with your connectedness.

, She may feel that your behavior or actions have undermined her opportunities to do something she believes is important; find ways to help her achieve these wishes or, at the very least, don't be a cause of hindering her. If she suddenly has a desire to go and do relief work in a disaster zone, perhaps she needs the break from you.

, If you truly want to regain your wife's trust, you must let her see that you mean everything you say and do. Actions speak louder than words, and she will be watching closely, waiting for slip-ups because she is not sure whether or not you are sincere. This may feel hard for you, as if you're being judged, but it's just one of the realities of trying to win back trust––you are on show, no matter how uncomfortable that seems. You have something to prove, and she is slowly processing whether or not you're managing to prove your reliability as a spouse or partner to her again.

, Healing a breach of trust takes time, effort and solid evidence of change for the better. You can't expect to win back her trust overnight. You will have to work at it. It could take years. You will need to have the mindset that this is worth it and to accept that you won't give up. Show your wife (partner) that you are really committed to getting her back.


Realize that there will be times when you wonder whether you are having any impact. This is normal. However, it is also hard to bear. At such times, talk to someone about your feelings, such as a trusted friend, a therapist or even a parent if you feel okay with that. You may even feel okay about talking to your spouse about your feelings; your genuine distress may help her to see that you are really trying hard and finding it hard too. Just don't use it as a reason to seek her pity though; that won't set your relationship on an even keel, so don't even try.
Use your faith as self-support and for couples support too (if she is willing). At least for yourself, you may find that prayer, contemplation, meditation and/or reflection are pathways of healing for you. Read your faith text, read stories about forgiveness, read about people who have managed to restore lost trust. If your wife and/or family are willing, spend time praying or reflecting together.

, She is going through a huge range of emotions, just as you are. Some days it'll seem clearer to her than others. She may find it easier to talk about it with you sometimes but not other times. All of this is normal and part of the healing process. It is important to not rush or push her into reaching decisions about her feelings or her wants for the future; if she feels pressured, the easiest option may be to give up on you for fear of being controlled or manipulated. Space, time and love are the ingredients for helping her to come around to forgiving you, trusting you and starting anew.

Use self-control.,
Trust your wife.,
Present yourself with confidence.,
Be reasonable.,
Ignore him.",How to Get Other Guys to Stop Staring at Your Pretty Wife2," Controlling any jealously or possessive urges that you may feel could prevent unnecessary drama. Before you do or say anything, decide not to allow another person’s actions negatively impact you. Sometimes your inability to maintain control may be the result of past experiences where you did not feel secure. If you have ever had someone cheat on you before, you may fear that it will happen again, which may cause you to feel jealous. Realize that your past is not your present and jealousy is not warranted in this situation.

, When you react to another person staring at your wife, you display a lack of trust in her and possibly even low self-esteem or low self-worth. Not allowing the stares of others to affect you will show that you trust your wife and those staring are not a threat. Remember that she chose to marry you and likely has a connection with you that she does not share with anyone else. Building your relationship on love, trust, and respect can reduce feelings of jealousy and help you to maintain control when someone is staring. You must believe that your wife will not do anything to break your bond and know that what you have is special.Most wedding vows include “forsaking all others,” so remember that your wife made a commitment to you that probably means a lot to her.

, Whether it is a confident walk or standing tall, presenting yourself with confidence when you enter a room can sometimes eliminate the problem because those observing will know that they cannot compete with you.Feelings of inadequacy can sometimes create possessiveness because you want to control the person so that they do not leave you. Having confidence can alleviate that need for control.
To build your confidence, you can make a list of all of the things that you like about yourself and perhaps even include the things that your wife likes about you. This exercise can help to remind you that you are in fact a great catch., It is not uncommon for a man to admire a woman. There were probably even times when you observed an attractive woman and found yourself staring. It is reasonable to expect that your attractive wife will receive admirers, but that does not mean that anyone will act on those feelings.

, When observing a guy staring at your wife, it may be hard to tell what kind of person you are dealing with. He might have an anger problem or a chip on his shoulder, which could create a problem. Instead of getting upset or jealous, just ignore him. You cannot change what other people do, but you can certainly change your response to their actions.

Acknowledge your wife's beauty.,
Enjoy it while it lasts.",How to Get Other Guys to Stop Staring at Your Pretty Wife3," Be sure that you are giving her enough of that kind of appreciation and attention. You do not want everyone else showing appreciation for your wife when you are not.


Be sure to acknowledge the many other wonderful attributes of your wife and not just her outer appearance.
If she enjoys being appreciated for her appearance, your interference might be perceived negatively.

, As women get older, their appearance changes. This does not mean that your wife will no longer be attractive, but it does mean that she probably will not receive that type of attention forever."

This often includes living in the same home and acting as a married couple. If an employer requires proof of a domestic partnership or civil union prior to offering benefits, they should also require proof of a marriage., Unlike marriages, ceremonies are not required for domestic partnerships. Many couples like to celebrate their relationship with a formal ceremony, and you can do that. Some differences between marriage and domestic partner ceremonies include:


The officiant (person who conducts the ceremony) does not have to be recognized by the jurisdiction
An officiant is not required
The ceremony can be performed either before or after the domestic partnership is registered.

Find a quiet time to sit down together and make a list of your monthly expenses. Compare this to your monthly income to determine whether your family needs additional money each month.Be sure to include everything that you spend money on each month, including rent or mortgage payments, loan repayments, utilities, school tuition, food, transportation, clothing, and entertainment.
In addition to expenses, be sure to consider savings that you might need for retirement, emergencies, or even luxuries like vacations. Talk to your wife about your long-term financial goals and whether or not you will be able to meet them with only one income.;
, While you may think a second income will make a huge difference to your family's financial situation, there may be lots of costs associated with your wife's returning to work, especially if you have children. Sit down together and come up with a list of all of the additional expenses you will incur if she does indeed go back to work. Balance these against her potential salary to determine if the decision makes sense for your family.


If you have young children, childcare can be a huge expense. Coming up with an affordable and quality solution to this problem could really help your wife decide that it's okay for her to go back to work.If your wife did all of the laundry and cleaning, consider whether you will need to hire someone to step in to perform those tasks while she is at work.
Think about whether you will be eating out more if your wife no longer has the time to cook meals at home every day.
Consider whether you need buy a new car in order for your wife to commute to work.
Think about the everyday expenses associated with going to work as well, including gas, tolls, business clothing, and lunches.

, If your wife has been taking care of all of the housework and/or has been taking care of the children while she has been out of work, she may be reluctant to return to work for fear that she will still be responsible for all of these tasks. It will be much easier to convince her to go back to work if you offer to split these responsibilities with her.Come up with a childcare schedule that is equal and fair. If she did 99.9% of the childcare, you’ll need to step up your game. Offer to take on nighttime feedings if you have an infant or take the kids to soccer practice during the week if you have older children.
Start helping out more with cooking, cleaning, and laundry as well. If she sees that you are willing and able to take on these tasks, she might feel better about the idea of going back to work.
Ask how you can make her life easier if she goes back to work. Sometimes it may be not be evident what can be helpful, so instead of guessing, just ask her.

, The decision to return to work is not just a financial one; there are also a lot of emotions involved. It's important to determine how your wife really feels about returning to work and to address any concerns she may have about it.Some women get bored and depressed when they are not working. If you think this is the case for your wife, let her know that you are concerned about her and think that returning to work may be beneficial for her.
Some women may feel extremely guilty about returning to work if they have young children. If your wife feels this way, it is important to sit down with her and talk about what you can do to ensure that your children stay happy and healthy after she returns to work. This may involve finding the right daycare program or making sure that your wife's work schedule is flexible enough that she can still attend soccer practice.

, It will be helpful for both you and your wife if you have a plan for how to juggle your new schedule. Think carefully about your wife's responsibilities and limitations when deciding how many hours she can reasonably commit to working each week.


If you have children, think about when your wife will need to be home to care for them. If she needs to be able to pick them up from school everyday, a full-time schedule may not work.If your wife is recovering from an illness, be sure to consider how many hours she will be able to work without further damaging her health. Don't push her to do more than her body can handle.Keep in mind that there are other options besides full-time and part-time employment. Depending on your wife's skills and your family's financial situation, she may be able to find work-at-home opportunities or even start her own business.

, The last thing you want is for your wife to go back to a job or industry she hates, so be sure to discuss whether or not she was happy at her last job. Your wife will be much more willing to return to work if she can do a job that she genuinely enjoys.


If she enjoyed her last job, encourage her to contact her previous employer to find out if there are any job openings that would be right for her. If this is not an option, brainstorm other job opportunities that would offer similar rewards and challenges.
If she did not enjoy her last job, talk about what it was that she didn't like. It's important to understand if she didn't like the specific company she was working for or if she didn't like the kind of work she was doing. If she didn't like the kind of work she was doing, she may need to pursue something completely different.

, If your wife has been out of work for an extended period of time, going back to the same kind of work that she used to do might not be the right fit for her anymore. Sit down with your wife and discuss what has changed for her since she last worked.She may have discovered a new passion during her time away from the workforce. If this is the case, brainstorm different job opportunities that would allow her to pursue this passion.
Your wife may also have different priorities now than she once did. For example, she may not be interested in returning to a job that requires constant travel if she wants to be able to spend more time with the family. If this is the case, brainstorm job opportunities that would utilize her skills, but would not require travel.
If your wife needs help deciding what she wants to do, encourage her to see a career counselor., If your financial situation is urgent, your wife may not have the luxury of being able to wait around for the perfect job. If this is the case for your family, sit down with your wife and talk about the possibility of her taking a temporary job to help pay the bills.Make sure she understands that you want her to continue looking for her dream job while she is working at her temporary job. Be supportive if she dislikes what she is doing and help her seek out opportunities for a job that will be more fulfilling.

, The workforce changes quickly so if your wife has not worked for a while, she may no longer have the skills that employers are looking for. It's very important that your wife understand the new norms in the industry, which may mean acquiring some new skills.Keep in mind that technology has probably changed since your wife last worked. Even if it's only been a few years, encourage her to take a course or teach herself to use the latest technology related to her field.You can also help her get back in touch with her industry by researching conferences for her to attend or subscribing her to industry publications.This will not only help her stay on top of the latest trends and news, but it may reinvigorate her passion.

, Job hunters are typically much more successful in finding a position when they network with other professionals in their industry. If your wife is not already doing this, let her know how important it is to her success.If she has contacts from her last job who may be able to help her in her job search, suggest that she reach out to them by phone or email. Social media sites like LinkedIn also offer great networking opportunities.
If your wife doesn't know people in the industry anymore, encourage her to meet people by doing volunteer work that is related to her field or attending conferences., If your wife has not worked for a long time, chances are her resume needs to be updated. Putting all of your experience down on paper can seem like an intimidating task, but it's very important that she write a good resume, as this is the only way to make a good first impression with most prospective employers.


If your wife has been out of work for a long period of time, encourage her to organize her resume in a functional format instead of a chronological format. This means grouping her relevant experience and skills by type instead of listing them in date order.If you are a good resume writer, help your wife by offering to revise or edit her resume for her. If this is not something you are particularly good at, consider asking a friend or family member who is a talented resume writer, or even hiring a professional to help her polish her resume.

, To help boost your wife's confidence and increase her chances of getting hired, help her practice for interviews by asking her sample questions. Focus both on common interview questions and questions specifically related to her extended absence from the workforce.Help your wife brainstorm about industry-related experience she accrued during her time away from work. For example, if she is a graphic designer, she may have used her skills to design posters for the kids' school play. Talking about these kinds of endeavors can help your wife convince potential employers that she was never entirely removed from her field of interest.
Common interview questions include things like, ""Why do you want to work for this company?"", ""What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses?"", ""Why do you think you would be a good fit for this position?"", ""What are your career goals?"", ""What was your biggest accomplishment and biggest failure?"", and ""How do you deal with angry customers or disagreements with coworkers?""Make sure your wife is knowledgeable about the company she will be interviewing with. It's also a good idea to help her think of a few questions that she wants to ask the interviewer that show interest in the company and/or position.A good question might be ""What do you hope for the company to achieve in the next year?"" or ""What is the biggest obstacle facing this department right now?"" Advise her to avoid asking questions about pay or benefits unless the interviewer brings these topics up first.

, Re-entering the workforce after an absence is not easy. Many formerly successful professionals find it very discouraging that they are not able to find high-paying jobs as easily as they thought they would be able to. Be prepared for this reality and be willing to be emotionally supportive if your wife becomes discouraged.It's common for people who have been out of work for a long time to doubt their own skills and abilities. If you feel this is the case with your wife, give her a confidence boost by reminding her of her many talents and accomplishments.
It helps to be understanding if the job search is not going well. Even if the family is under a lot of financial pressure, it will not help the situation if you become confrontational or accusatory about your wife's inability to find a job.

Be a good listener.,
Communicate your needs.,
Do the little things.,
Maintain boundaries.,
Attend couples counseling.",How to Get Closer to Your Partner After Having Kids1," You and your partner may communicate differently and have different needs after having kids. Be sure to listen to your partner and try to understand their needs. If you’re unclear as to what your partner wants, just ask. Don't try to guess or read their mind. A simple, “How can I help?” or, “What can I do to make things better?” can take the guesswork out of knowing how to respond.More than ever before, now is the perfect time to improve your listening skills. Reflect and restate things your partner says. For example, say, “Let me make sure I understand what you’re saying” or, “It sounds like you feel really overwhelmed.”Paraphrasing will only help to strengthen communication. It allows you to better understand what the other persons concerns are (they will correct you if you did not repeat back correctly what they need). It also allows the other person to feel important and that you really care and are interested and focused in what they have to say.;
, You may want to give your partner the silent treatment or you might feel uncomfortable bringing up difficult topics. Remember that good communication can help both of you work together better. Kids bring in new needs to your family and you may want you and your partner to work together in a certain way. Be clear in your wants and needs by stating them to your partner.If you’d like something from your partner, be honest in what you want. Say, “I’d really like a hug” or, “I need to talk without getting any advice.”
If you differ in beliefs about how to raise your child, talk about important issues such as discipline and attitudes. Take turns discussing each of your positions and find a healthy compromise that both of you can live with., While it may be unrealistic to sweep your partner off on a romantic getaway, make small gestures to show them that you care. Brew the coffee in the morning or surprise your partner with dinner after a long day. If you know how much a clean house means to your partner, take extra care to tidy up and keep things nice.Show your partner that you care and love them by your words, gestures, and behavior.

, Do you have overly-involved in-laws or family members? You may begin to resent your partner if you have problems with their family and vice versa. The key to growing closer instead of further away is by discussing boundaries. You have the right to say no, even if the family is generous with gifts and babysitting. Talk to your partner about setting boundaries and keep in mind that boundaries help you to maintain a good relationship together.Be firm when setting boundaries, yet gentle. For example, say, “Our children love having you in their lives and really look forward to seeing you. Right now, however, we need some space for ourselves.”

, You might think that couples counseling is only for those who have had a particularly rocky transition into parenthood, or couples who are on the verge of breaking up, but it can actually be extremely beneficial for all couples. A therapist is there to act as a mediator in any situation — there don't have to be major issues or dysfunctional behavior for a couple to benefit from therapy. Sometimes starting therapy before any anger, hurt, resentment, or other ""dysfunction"" begins can help prevent serious problems down the road.


A therapist can help modify dysfunctional behavior or help you to break harmful habits you both contribute to. You might need some help communicating more effectively or approaching issues you tend to avoid."

Focus on the positive.,
Learn to live with certain flaws.,
Encourage your spouse's goals.",How to Get Along with a Spouse1," It's important to take time to appreciate your spouse during your day-to-day life. There is something that initially drew you to this person and you need to make sure you nurture feelings of love. Take time to focus on the positive aspects of your significant other.


Fondness and admiration are among the most important aspects of a longterm relationship. Sometimes, day to day activities and responsibilities result in people losing focus of their affection for their spouse. Make time to nurture these feelings.One activity that encourages feelings of fondness is the ""I appreciate"" activity. You and your partner each write down three or more positive characteristics of one another, another with examples that illustrate these characteristics. You then take turns reading what you wrote to one another.;
, Everyone has flaws. There is no such thing as a perfect spouse and certain behaviors do not change, even after repeated requests. If the issue isn't major, sometimes it's better to let it go.


A lifelong bad habit is unlikely to change, even with persistent requests on your part. If your partner is sort of messy, for example, he or she may learn to tidy up more often but never quite remember to wash dirty dishes right away or take out the recycling on a regular basis. While such behaviors might be annoying, if they're not deal breakers it might be best to let it go.It's perfectly acceptable to ask your partner to change major issues that upset you. If, for example, your spouse has a tendency to make poor financial decisions this is a big enough factor that the two of you should work through it. Small flaws, however, are not subject to change and you should not go into a relationship expecting to perfect or improve your partner., Marriages are happiest when spouses encourage one another. You should support your spouse's hope and dreams and try to actively encourage him or her to pursue things that would help with long term goals. Try to listen and understand what your spouse wants in life and find ways to support him or her. Obviously, you can't achieve goals for another person but you can provide emotional support and advice throughout your spouse's path to success."

Accept offers to babysit.,
Find a novel activity together.,
Reintroduce old pastimes.,
Take time for yourself.,
Set aside time to talk kids and finances.,
Communicate face-to-face.",How to Get Closer to Your Partner After Having Kids2," Sometimes friends and family members offer to watch the kids for you. If they do, take them up on it. It’s okay to place your kids in the loving hands of someone you trust so that you can spend time with your partner. If you feel guilty, remember that your children can benefit from you and your partner’s happy and healthy relationship.If there are not people close to you willing to watch your kids, find a babysitter in your community. Ask other parents for a recommendation.

, Instead of going to the same restaurant again for dinner, find a dance class or go to a hockey game together. Engaging in novel experiences can help you and your partner feel more connected.Have fun together and remember that this is someone you enjoy being with. Keep the focus on you and your partner and don’t bring up topics like finances, plans, or maybe even the kids.


Try painting, frisbee golf, or going on a boat ride to try something new.

, Reestablish yourselves as a couple by making time for each other and the relationship. If you and your partner used to go out to the movies, set aside time to go to the movies together. If you used to go hiking together, visit those special places again.Think about what activities you did when you were dating or newly in love. This can help bring up old, happy memories of you and your partner.

, Consider having some time every week to yourself. This can be relaxing alone time or time with friends. Having children means a lot of your time is devoted to them and your family, yet having time for yourself is important to your own health and well-being and can help you relieve stress that builds up at home.Start a relaxation practice by engaging in daily yoga and meditation.
Keep up with your own friends and hobbies.

, Have a weekly meeting to discuss the details of family, kids, and expenses. Having time set aside for these issues means that these discussions don’t overtake your other conversations or get carried through over days. When the discussion is over, do a fun activity such as eating ice cream or going on a walk so that you walk away feeling good.Write down kids’ schedules, work engagements, bills, and other items throughout the week so that you can tackle items quickly and efficiently.

, Save important conversations and other discussions for when you are together. While cell phones make communication much easier and faster, make sure you and your partner are not doing the majority of your conversing on your cell phones. When you do spend quality time together, consider making it technology-free time.Show your partner that you are committed to giving your attention fully to them and not engaging in distractions, like glancing at your phone or watching TV.
A face-to-face conversation allows you to pick up on the subtle cues communicated through body language. A person's body language, eye movements, tone of voice — these can all help you understand the other person better. When you are reading an email, or a text message things can often be misunderstood, which can ultimately cause greater issues.

Empathize with your partner.,
Regain intimacy.",How to Get Closer to Your Partner After Having Kids3," It’s common for new parents to experience certain emotions. For example, new fathers often feel isolated, left out, or in competition for their partner’s attention and affection. This can lead to him becoming withdrawn or depressed. New mothers often feel overwhelmed with their sudden new role. Feelings about her appearance may make her feel ashamed or embarrassed. Put yourself in your partner’s shoes in understanding their needs.Let your partner know you support them. Say, “I know raising kids can be hard, and I’m here for you and our family as support.”
Offer to help your partner. Do child caretaking together and try to take care of any family needs that you can.

, You may abstain from sex during pregnancy or after birth, and getting back to sexual activity may be a long road. Many women may feel “touched out” after touching the baby all day and nursing. If one or both of you is not ready for sex quite yet, be intimate in other ways such as by holding hands, cuddling, and being close to one another.Be sure to communicate your thoughts, feelings, and needs about intimacy with your partner.
If you feel fear, insecurity, or anxiety about returning to sexual activity after having a baby, you may want to talk to a therapist.

Communicate effectively.,
Accept your partner's values.,
Learn your spouse's communication style.,
Understand how your partner expresses love.,
Pause during arguments.",How to Get Along with a Spouse2," Effective communication is key to preventing and dealing with the inevitable disagreements that surface during a marriage. Learning how to communicate in a productive matter is important to getting along with your spouse.


When expressing frustration, avoid statements that place an external judgment on a situation. Statements should start with ""I"" instead of ""you."" For example, say you want your spouse to give you more alone time once in awhile. Instead of saying, ""You expect me to do everything with you and I never have time to myself,"" rephrase it in a way that emphasizes your personal feelings on the situation and not objective fact. Try something like, ""I feel like I don't get enough time to myself and that makes me feel stressed.""Listen to your partner's side of the argument. Oftentimes, fights over a small issue are driven by underlying circumstances. When the two of you disagree, try to listen actively and repeat back anything you don't understand for clarification.Do not expect your partner to read your mind. If something he or she does bothers you, you cannot expect your spouse to simply figure this out. The sooner you say something, the sooner the issue can be addressed and dealt with effectively., No two people have the the same opinions and values 100% of the time. You need to accept your partner's values even when you do not agree.


Couples are generally able to get along fine with different political or religious values. However, it's when someone feels their values are not respected that problems arise. Even if you radically disagree with your partner on a given subject, try to understand where he or she is coming from and respect his or her opinion.If you really radically disagree with your spouse about an issue, it's okay to agree not to discuss it. Sometimes, it's hard to give up your desire to change a person's mind, especially if it's a subject you care about deeply., People tend to communicate in different ways. You should pay attention to how your partner conveys his or her feelings. This will allow you read your spouse better and smooth over arguments more effectively.


Some people are more visual communicators. They do not necessarily talk out their feelings but visual clues, such as how they carry themselves and eye movements, convey feelings. If this is the case with your partner, make sure you two communicate face-to-face.If your partner tends to get very emotional during communication, try to speak softly and provide reassurance by holding hands, touching, and other warm gestures.When talking, always paraphrase what you two have said. This way, you'll be sure you understand each other., People have different ""languages of love."" That is, people use different means to show that they care. If you or your partner feels under-appreciated, the two of you might just use different ""languages of love.""


Words of Affirmation means your partner expresses how he or she feels directly. You might hear ""I love you"" a lot and get a lot of compliments on small matters. This is perhaps the most direct and easy-to-read language of love.Acts of Service means someone feels actions are louder than words and shows affection via completing small tasks for their significant other. Your partner may, for example, take the garbage out for you or do the dishes if you've had a long day. These people are sometimes less verbal with their affection and their acts of love are easy to overlook if you don't realize they're meant to convey affection.Receiving Gifts means people feel loved via sharing and giving. Your partner might bring your flowers or a small treat from the store to show he or she cares. Like Acts of Service, your partner may be less verbally affectionate if this is how he or she expresses love.Quality Time means love is expressed by giving the other person undivided attention. Your partner may want to spend time with you alone and treasure small moments you might not think much of. Nightly dinners, for example, may be very important to your partner if this is how he or she expresses love.Physical Touch means your partner shows affection via touching. He or she might want to hold hands, cuddle, and kiss. Your partner might be less verbally affectionate, but will strive to make up for it through contact., If an argument is getting nowhere, it's okay to pause. If neither side is listening anymore, and you're repeating the same information, simply stop the argument, give each other some space, and revisit the issue later."

Establish rituals.,
Maintain a healthy sex life.,
Create shared values.,
Have your own sense of self.",How to Get Along with a Spouse3," Rituals are important to a happy, married life. Find ways to spend time together one-on-one throughout the week.


Rituals can be anything meaningful to you and your partner. Going out to dinner once a week, watching a particular show together, taking long walks, and other activities you enjoy as a couple can serve as rituals.It's important to maintain some kind of a schedule. Obviously, things get busy and sometimes you might miss a dinner here and there. However, having a set day of the week or set time of day for one another can help assure you two don't miss each other in the shuffle., Sex is important to a romantic relationship. Maintaining a healthy sex life longterm is vital to getting along with your spouse.


If you and your partner have different sex drives, there are ways to compromise. This does not simply mean having sex more or less based on someone's needs, but you can explore fantasies, varying levels of foreplay, role play, and other means to get you and your spouse on the same level.If sex is becoming a problem, you see a couple's therapist to see if there are any underlying issues affecting your sex drive., It's important to have some shared values as a couple. While you may not agree on everything, you should have certain shared values. You can work together on what your goals are for the relationship, the future, and career. Establishing values together as a couple can strengthen a relationship and assure a positive future., The healthiest, happiest couples have individual lives apart from one another. You cannot rely on your partner to meet all your needs all the time. Even while striving to spend time with one another, find activities you enjoy doing alone or with other people as well. Join a book club. Have a weekly bar night with just friends. Get involved in a craft. A little space is important for a healthy romantic relationship.

Breathe.,
Be supportive.,
Do not be brutally honest.,
Try new experiences together.,
Be prepared to laugh at yourself!",How to Enjoy Marriage," Always allow room for each other to breathe, to make mistakes and to grow. Never smother someone.;
, Even in a marriage, it is important to encourage your partner through thick and thin. Even if your partner comes to you with the worst idea you have ever heard, be supportive. Most ideas will not come to fruition but the support you provide will always be remembered.

, Just because you have been married for a period of time, no matter how long, always consider your partner's feelings and be tactful, always. Never be overcritical.


Instead of criticizing your partner's distasteful habits, hint to them how much you like it when they do the opposite. Do this in a genuinely kind manner.

, Try discovering SCUBA classes, rock climbing, a parachuting experience. The sheer thrill of learning something new creates a positive mood boost and gives you a shared experience.

, Never take yourself too seriously.

Remember to always respect everyone.,
Think about why you support traditional marriage.,
Listen to what the other person has to say.,
Use a clear, confident voice to state your arguments.,
Agree, or, if the discussion gets out of hand, just agree to disagree.",How to Defend Traditional Marriage," Never bully or intimidate someone over their sexual orientation or beliefs. If you make harsh statements or ridicule people, those considering and those in favor of the redefinition of marriage may not listen to your defense of traditional marriage.;
, Do you actually support traditional marriage, or do you just say you do? There is a difference. If you don't firmly support traditional marriage, you would be hypocritical to defend it. But, if you do firmly believe in it, ask yourself, ""Why?"" Your own reasons why you support traditional marriage can be your strongest argument.

, Don't interrupt them. If you don't listen to them, they have no reason to listen to you.

, If you are mumbling, the other person won't be able to understand you. Your arguments can be based on:



Your personal beliefs - Ask yourself why you support traditional marriage. Then, simply restate the answer you tell yourself in your head to the other person. After the initial statement, go into why you have come to that conclusion.

Your knowledge - Use your brain. Back up arguments with hard evidence when possible. This will be hard to do though, since the even the most well-established facts themselves are so often disputed and even changed.

If you are talking to a non-Christian, quoting the Bible or religious figures is unlikely to work. You can mention the Bible, but don't go reading long passages to them unless they express an interest.
If you do read from the Bible, steer clear of Romans 1:18-32. If you don't know this passage, it is one of the most famous passages condemning homosexual acts, and lots of people are offended by it because it says that anyone who commits homosexual acts must also be arrogant, heartless, and other extremely negative traits. If you start quoting this, people are likely to call you homophobic and stop listening to you, so use this passage only with great caution, if at all.



The purpose of marriage in society - Explain the important role that marriage plays in the world. While not all marriages result in families, families most of the time result from a marriage (be it by birth, surrogate birth, adoption or otherwise). A marriage binds the parents together, which is the ideal condition for raising children. Marriage is important because raising strong kids in strong families is important.

Drawing the line - So, now the big question is who has the right to marry whom. ""Should anybody be allowed to marry anybody and raise a family?"" Anybody, meaning any two adults.

State that, ""Many arrangements exist, so it would be unfair to leave one out, if attraction between couples is the question."" Many people think some of these groups should not be allowed to marry including the person with which one is arguing. One could try to use this to their advantage, if done carefully.
If they answer ""yes"" and believe that all these groups should be allowed to be married, you are in for a tough time.
So, if they answer ""no"" to the question, ""Should all of these groups be allowed to marry?"" begin narrowing down the list. To narrow it, one has to figure out which group they think is helping society the most.


""Child Birth and Family"" One should be prepared to research laws and regulations should one choose this argument. In most cases, a heterosexual couple can produce healthy children on their own. The parenting argument is also a tough point to win, so one should also be prepared to respond with as little possible discrimination. This includes responding to adoption and surrogate points.
""What about polygamy?"" One should choose their points appropriately when arguing against Polygamy. Polygamists can produce healthy children just like monogamist, heterosexual couples. However, the one spouse has to split their time between all the different spouses in polygamy. One should consider whether there are advantages or disadvantages to one's argument.

, Both of you will still have the opportunity to explore an opposing viewpoint and reach outside your comfort zone. These are things that can help a person grow and understand their own beliefs more fully. In any case, you will both probably think about it on your own anyway.

Prepare to leave if he won’t change.",How to Deal With Your Husband's Jealousy of Your Friendships," It can be too easy to discard old friendships in favor of your husband. But both partners in a marriage need to continue to cultivate and maintain friendships beyond the one you share together. Friends are an important outlet for confiding in, for boosting your confidence, and for the ability to say things without reprisal. Don't give that up., Think about whether you have been spending more time with your friends than with him. He might be upset because you do have a better relationship with your friends than you do with him and share more of yourself with longtime friends than with your husband. Try to approach the issue from his perspective., He may be feeling threatened by the closeness you seem to experience with your friends. Reassure him that your friends not taking his place but are another source of balance in your life.Ask yourself if anything has changed in your situation. Have you or your husband changed jobs? Have you moved? How is your life different than an earlier time when your husband might not have felt so jealous? Think about how life changes affect both you and your partner.""I know you’ve been feeling upset about all the time I spend with my friends, but you knew I had close friends when you married me. They aren’t you -- they’re just another link to my college years.”
""Why do you think you’re getting so upset about the time I spend with my friends? I love to spend time with you, but my time with them is special, too. They have supported me through so much.”
""Do you want to come out with me and my buddies and see what we do? I haven’t invited you because I thought you wouldn’t like it, but I’m happy to have you come so you can see you’re not missing out.”

, If your husband is newly jealous of you and your friends, you need to find out why. If nothing for you has changed, what is going on in his life that might have caused this?""It never used to bother you when I went out on Thursdays. What happened?”
""I’m worried about you being jealous of me going out with my friends. You always told me I should go, but now I feel like you’ve changed your mind. What caused that, do you think?”
""I am wondering if you’re upset about this because of losing your job. What can I do to help?”

, If he has given much thought to it, you could discuss it when you’re talking about the jealousy. If not, he might want a few days to come up with some thoughts about how to resolve his discomfort. Make it clear that you are not going to give up your time with friends, you just want to do it in a way that is more acceptable to him as your husband. You could also make some suggestions of changes.


While you’re out with your friends, he could go out with his friends and you could meet up at the end of the evening.
Ask him to plan a night out or weekend adventure for the two of you to reconnect.

, Make time to spend with your husband and time to spend with your friends. Make sure that when you and your husband make time for each other, you’re both ready to be free and relaxed., Even though your husband is having trouble with your relationship with your friends, don’t let your relationship with them suffer. Refrain from talking too much about your husband and his jealousy of your friendship -- they will certainly be in contact with him in the future, and it could be uncomfortable for everyone. Just explain that you’re trying to figure out a way for you to continue being a good friend and wife and that sometimes it’s complicated., If your husband refuses to talk to you about his feelings, it might be time to suggest couples’ counseling. Because it’s a neutral environment with a trained mediator, he might be more inclined to let you know what he’s feeling. Sometimes he might not know what he’s feeling, and talking to a therapist can help., If your husband refuses to talk to a counselor or therapist with you, it might be a good idea to book an appointment yourself. You need help sorting through your feelings and trying to understand why your husband is acting as he does. Because it’s partly tied to your friendships, this is not a time to talk these issues over with your friends -- you need someone outside the situation., Sometimes jealousy can be a sign of a larger issue in your relationship. Ask yourself whether your husband wants you to spend less time with your friends just so that he can keep an eye on you and keep you away from your support network. Does he check up on you all the time? Does he try to limit your access to your family as well? These may be signs of attempts to control you and can be signs of an abusive spouse., If he continues to act in the same controlling manner, let him know that you are unwilling to tolerate the behavior. If it becomes necessary, you might need to tell him that you are considering leaving because you don’t feel safe and appreciated in the relationship. Excessive control is a marker of abuse in a relationship -- no one should have to tolerate it., Only he can stop being jealous and controlling. If he refuses to stop his behavior, leaving is often the only choice. It might spur him to get help and attempt to deal with his problem. If he does not deal with the problem, realize that you might need to leave him for good."

Plan for your retirements.",How to Discuss Finances Together in a Marriage," The time to start talking about merging your finances is before the wedding, but at least 40% of couples avoid doing so.Start the conversation with your action items first. This could mean starting off by talking to your spouse about your desire to look at your own credit score as you prepare to buy a house and suggest that he or she does the same. Say something like “Have you checked your credit report lately? I’ve been wanting to get a good picture of my financial standing. Maybe we can do it together?”
Things like credit scores for both of you may change how you approach buying a home, for example. You may find if one of you has a higher score than the other, it may be better to buy without both of you on the mortgage. However, things line up, remember you are on the same “team”.;
, Print your credit reports and any supporting documentation, such as account balances and credit card debt. Financial choices need to be based on numbers not emotion. Make sure you both have a clear idea of what debts came into the union and how you can work to pay those down.Early on you are doing this to get on the same page about your individual financial pictures. However, in the future, it may be nice to take time each month to sit down together and look over the numbers. Viewing credit card statements and account balances can be a way to keep you accountable as far as goals and also open the floor for an ongoing discussion with your spouse.

, Before you get started, you must be forthright with your spouse about any habits you happen to have that are not apparent on your credit reports.An example of a bad habit would include not taking the time to write down purchases made on your debit card so you can balance your check book. When you were single, this may have not seemed like a huge deal, but with two people sharing accounts it can quickly become a problem.
Other bad habits you need to bring to your spouse would include past blemishes on your credit like having too many credit cards open, being in default on student loans or having bills in collection. All of these issues can impact credit, but they can also be addressed and resolved.

, Placing blame and arguing over money will not make any issues better. If you ask your spouse to be honest about credit challenges and then start the blame game you will probably not get that same level of honesty in the future., This means looking at your spouse as he or she is speaking, listening carefully to fully get his or her point of view, and then taking that one step further by confirming what you have heard.When you sit down to have a tough conversation with your spouse, you will break the trust if you are not willing to listen. Don’t ask the tough questions unless you are ready to handle any answer.
The exchange of information should be fair and equal., Even after getting married there are no laws that say you have to merge all your accounts. Having separate accounts does not mean neither of you knows what the other is doing. Both partners should have access to the records of the other since you are sharing a household.Depending on the credit scores for both spouses, it may make more sense to keep separate accounts especially if you want to buy a home soon. One spouse alone on a mortgage is going to have a higher chance of getting the loan than two people with mixed credit scores.

, This will include how you make decisions about both small and large purchases. The person who is most organized and financially savvy may be the best choice for managing the finances. However, both partners should take on the responsibility in some way. So, choose duties according to your individual strengths.For example, one of you may be better at saving, so you will be in charge of building an emergency fund and overseeing retirement savings. The other may be in charge of paying monthly bills and balancing the checkbook. Decide based on what’s best for you and your spouse.

, You will need to know who is writing the check for rent, paying the electric bill and other household bills. You do not want to get into a situation where both of you thought the other paid the electric bill and you learn that it wasn’t paid when the lights are turned off. You also don’t want to pay bills twice and be short money.Being upfront about how much both of you make and how you will divide the bills will make things much easier. Some families divide everything I half while others just pool their money regardless of who makes what.
The use of credit cards versus cash should also be explored as one partner may be used to always using a card and then paying it off once a month while the other only uses cash. This needs to be talked about.

, Regardless of who makes more money, a big ticket item should be bought together. This is a good time to set boundaries about how much either of you can spend without talking to your spouse. This can be as simple as saying you have a spending limit of $100 without checking in since that is a low amount in your budget and won’t overdraw the account., This budget should include all the household bills, ongoing needs and bills that were outstanding from before you got married. The budget needs to be realistic and something you both commit to. Consider these tips:Tally up every single monthly expense and plan for them in advance.
Include separate and joint goals.
Include long-term goals like saving for a down payment on a house.
Negotiate with ongoing bills to cut down interest rates or get rid of fees.
Automate whatever you can so that you don’t miss paying bills and acquire late fees.
Go back and revise your budget as needed.

, If you didn’t already have an emergency fund before getting married, now is the time to build one. An emergency fund acts as a cushion in times when unexpected expenses pop up or one of you is out of work.


How big your emergency account is will depend on you and your spouse. Many families tuck away enough money for at least 3 to 6 months of expenses.This provides greater security over the long haul.
This savings account would be for true emergencies only, not impulse buys. Take the time to set boundaries as to what qualifies as an emergency.
Some households use a credit card for emergencies like car repairs. Make sure you both agree if this is a good use of your credit cards and leave the available balance for such an emergency. If either of you has problems with managing credit cards, this may not be the best option for your household.

, Don’t fall prey to the idea that it’s your spouse’s problem—it’s not. Both of your debt is usually considered during major purchases, so working together to shrink each person’s debt is ideal.


It can also be helpful to get financial advising or attend a debt reduction course for couples. If you have a significant amount of debt—or have no idea where to start to pay it down—it may be practical to involve a professional who can assist you.

, Talk to your spouse and come up with a plan that suits both of you for retirement and start saving. Keep in mind, that men and women often have varying opinions when it comes to retirement, so be willing to compromise and consider your spouse’s perspective.Include payments to 401K and other investments as a part of your budget. Part of this process also includes changing the beneficiaries for each account now that you are married.
If you don’t already, you also need to draw up life insurance policies to secure your spouse and your family in case of a tragedy.

Make time for discussions.,
Talk face-to-face.,
Use a counselor.,
Start the conversation.,
Raise your concerns.,
Use “I” statements.,
Speak regularly about your marriage.",How to Discuss Your Future Marriage During Your Engagement1," If you want to have a serious discussion with your partner about your future marriage, take some steps to make sure that it can go well. Set aside time when neither of you is distracted or needs to rush off anywhere. If either of you has kids, have a babysitter watch them to give you plenty of time to talk together. Find a time when both of you are relaxed and can focus on communicating.Schedule a time to talk so that it’s not spontaneous or out of the blue.;
, Make opportunities to talk in person. Don’t make a habit of bringing up difficult topics through emails, phone calls, or in text messages. If you have something important to say to your partner, make sure you speak in-person.You can, however, send a text message or say during a phone call, “Do you have time to talk later tonight? There’s something I’d like to discuss together.”

, Whether you want to see a therapist or a spiritual mentor, premarital counseling can help you discuss the workings of your future marriage. This is an opportunity to consider what your marriage may be like with the help of another person’s perspective. A counselor can help guide your conversations about marriage and ask meaningful questions to consider as you move closer to marriage. Seeing a counselor has the added benefit of being in a neutral location and with a neutral person.

A premarital counselor may have you discuss topics such as finances, spiritual beliefs, family relationships, arguments and fighting, and the role of affection and sex., If you need to talk to your partner but are not sure how to initiate the conversation, do a bit of planning. You may want to write down certain speaking points you have so that you don’t forget them. Don’t spring important conversations on your partner and instead, make them cooperative conversations.Say, “It’s important for us to be on the same page when entering our marriage. I’d like to spend some time talking about our lives together and how we can better understand each other, and what we want for our marriage.”

, Now is not the time to shy away or put off serious discussions about your future together. If you have concerns about your partner’s habits (such as excessively playing video games or turning to alcohol to cope with feelings), now is the time to bring these concerns up and how they may affect your future marriage.There’s no perfect person or perfect marriage. If you have serious concerns, decide whether they are deal breakers or livable problems.
For example, if your partner has kids, think about what it will be like to potentially live with the children at least part time, and if you’re ready for any changes to custody. Say to your partner, “What is it going to be like with your child here? How do you enforce rules? What will my role be?”

, As you discuss your future marriage, get into the habit of communicating in a positive and productive way. Listen to your partner and understand what they say. One way to do this is through using “I” statements. Stay away from blaming statements and turn to statements about the self. Using “I” statements help you stay away from assumptions and to speak clearly. Instead of telling your partner the things they do that annoy you or frustrate you or that you’d like changed, say how things look from your side and how they make you feel.For example, instead of saying, “You’re not helping settle our new house! You’re not a helpful person” say instead, “I feel frustrated that I’m doing so much work for the new house. Can we find a way to split the tasks?”

, Talking about your marriage shouldn’t be a one-time discussion. Keep your discussions ongoing. You may wish to have one large discussion and follow-up many times afterward. Don’t be afraid to bring up topics related to your marriage and discuss them openly.

Perhaps you and your partner can find time each week to work through details related to your future marriage.

Talk about your partnership.,
Discuss spirituality.,
Talk finances.,
Tell each other your goals.,
Talk about your future in-laws.,
Discuss your family planning.",How to Discuss Your Future Marriage During Your Engagement2," Especially if you’re moving in together after your marriage, you may wish to discuss things like splitting chores, making meals, and running a house together. Your partner may lack certain skills like cooking or may differ in their approach to cleaning, so be clear on your expectations ahead of time. Is your partner cleaner or messier than you, and how will find a compromise?If you’re moving in together for the first time, have an idea of how the house will be run and who will be responsible for certain tasks.

, If you and your partner come from different faiths or spiritualities, talk about how this may affect your marriage. For example, if you’d like your partner to know your own spiritual traditions, say so. If you want to get married or raise a family in a specific tradition, talk this over with your partner. Consider any requests your partner has for you to learn their traditions.If you are hoping that your partner will convert to your faith, consider if that does not happen and how you will feel about it and your partner.
Ask your partner, “What role will spirituality play for you in our marriage? Do you want me to participate in any traditions with you or your family?”

, Whether you choose to combine your finances or not, you will need to talk about how to split expenses for things like rent, groceries, household necessities, pets, and other items. You may choose to contribute different amounts of money based on each of your income levels or blend all of your money together. Whatever you choose, talk about the arrangement ahead of time. Talk about your attitude toward money and savings.Talk about each person’s credit and how that might affect the marriage.
Say, “Say, I want to discuss how we each go about managing money. Do we put more emphasis on saving or spending?”

, Talk about where you want to live, what kind of job you want, where you want to travel, and what other goals and adventures you’d like to accomplish for the future. Talk about your short-term and long-term goals. If one partner wants to live in a different area or travel for work, discuss this openly and talk about how it might affect the marriage. Discuss your hopes and dreams and support each other on your goals.Ask your partner, “I'd like us to talk about what things we want to do separately and together in the short-term, and the long-term. Is this okay with you?”

, Joining your partner’s family may have some perks and drawbacks. Talk to your partner about what the family is like and how you will fit in. Are there customs or traditions you should know about? Ask if there are certain things you should avoid talking about with your partner’s family such as politics, religion, gun control, etc.Ask your partner how to get along and fit in with their family. What should you call your partner’s parents? Do you need to speak more loudly to his aunt or make any gestures to show respect?
Say, “What can I do to best fit in your family? How can I best show respect?”

, Even if having kids is a while off, start to talk about your potential family. Do both you and your partner want kids? How do you feel about adoption or being a foster parent? While you may disagree on the number of kids you want, you should both be on the same page of wanting or not wanting children prior to getting married.More delicate yet still important to discuss is physical and mental health history. If you or your partner have a history of cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, bipolar disorder, or another illness in your family, let your partner know as this may affect your married life and your potential children.
Ask your partner, “Do you want children? How many? Do you have any physical or mental health problems that may affect our children?”

Find compromises.,
Talk about your conflict style.,
Focus on listening.",How to Discuss Your Future Marriage During Your Engagement3," If discussions about your marriage bring about conflict, recognize that this is normal. There will inevitably be things that you and your partner don’t agree about. Yet, determine whether you can come to a compromise or whether your disputes are a dealbreaker. If you’re committed to making your future marriage work, find ways to compromise or find solutions.You may need to learn when to drop a topic or recognize that it’s not ultimately important to your future marriage.
Deal with larger disagreements in a number of subsequent conversations.

, All couples will experience conflict at one time or another and in varying degrees. What’s important for couples is to understand each other’s conflict style and how compatible they are together. For example, you might avoid conflict while your partner may be hostile in conflict. If both of you have a similar conflict style, it may be better for conflict resolution.For example, if both of you are volatile, it can be better than if one of you is volatile and the other is conflict-avoiding.
If you handle conflict differently, don’t give up hope just yet. Work with a therapist to help you understand each other better and communicate more effectively.

, You might feel quick to defend your position when in conflict with your partner. Give your full attention to your partner without building a case against them. Instead of trying to find holes in what they’re saying, do what you can to understand their points and perspectives.Ask questions. One of the best ways to better understand your partner is to ask questions and not make assumptions.
Check your understanding by saying, “So let me see if I’m understanding you…” or, “What I hear you saying is…”

Sign in front of a notary public.,
Keep a copy.",How to Draft a Cohabitation Contract," At the top of the page, insert the title: “Nonmarital Cohabitation Agreement.” Make the words bold or underline them.;
, In the first paragraph, you need to lay out the facts about the parties: name, address, as well as the date the agreement is entered into.


For example, you could type, “Agreement made this 12th day of June, 2016, by and between Ashley Smith (“First Party”) and Ben Jones (“Second Party”), who reside at 1234 Alphabet Drive, Chicago, Illinois.”, In the second paragraph, you explain why this contract is being created.


For example: “The Parties desire to establish their rights and responsibilities with respect to each other’s property and income, as well as any property and income they may acquire, either separately or jointly, during the cohabitation.”, You need to state that each person has made complete disclosures about finances and debts to the other person:


“Each Party has made a full disclosure to the other Party concerning their debts and assets.”For this reason, it is a good idea to sit down before drafting the contract. You should gather all of your financial information and meet with the other person.

, A valid contract requires “consideration.” This is what you give up in order to make the contract. You should explain the consideration in a separate paragraph. Typically, in a cohabitation contract, the consideration is your promise to abide by the contract.


You could write something like this: “Consideration consists of the mutual promises contained in this agreement and of the promises of each Party to act as the living companion to the other.”

, You need to explain how rent (or a mortgage) will be divided between the two of you. There are two ways to divide the rent: assign a dollar amount to each person or assign a percentage.


You should probably assign rent (and any other expense) as a percentage. Your rent and other expense can increase each year, and you don’t want to redraft the contract each year.
As you divide up expenses, you should create three columns. Label the first column “Monthly Expenses,” and underneath put “rent” or “mortgage.” Label the second column “First Party” and the third column “Second Party.” Underneath, write the percentage each person will pay for each expense.If you decide to divide expenses in half, then each person will pay 50%.

, After rent, you need to divide up your utilities. Common utilities will include:telephone
gas
electricity
water and sewer
garbage collection
cable television
internet service
property taxes

, If you took out debts with the person you are living with, then you will need to divide the debts. Assign a percentage, just as you did to utilities:car or truck payments
home equity loans
other loans
credit cards
day care

, You should decide how you will divide household expenses such as food and home improvements. Go through and assign a percentage to the following:groceries
school lunches (if you have children)
cleaning supplies or services
yard maintenance
home maintenance and improvements
home security
appliances
home furnishings

, You can also decide ahead of time how you want to divide personal expenses like entertainment, travel, eating out, or pet-care costs. Some people might not want to get into this level of detail; instead they might only want to divide the big costs. However, if you want to allocate personal expenses, then do so for the following:take-out meals
entertainment
gifts
travel
any hobbies
pet care
babysitting

, Although you will be living together and sharing common expenses, you probably want to maintain ownership of your individual property. This is property you bring into the house for your own benefit. It also includes anything you bought for yourself without an intent to share. You might want to include a few provisions regarding the following:


Individual income: “The parties shall keep the following property as separate property: Individual earnings, salary, or wages acquired both before and after the execution of the Agreement.”
Gifts: “Individual gifts, devises, inheritances, or bequests acquired both before and after the execution of this Agreement.”
Property: “All real or personal property, owned by a Party at the date this Agreement is executed, to include all proceeds or income derived from these properties.”

, You might be worried that by living together you are creating a common law marriage. If you did, then either of you might be entitled to support and maintenance after you separate. You can waive any support or maintenance in the contract:


“The Parties waive the right to ‘palimony’ or any other form of maintenance or support, both permanent and temporary.”, Likewise, you should expressly waive the right to share in each other’s estates at death:


“The Parties waive the right to share in each other’s estates on death.”, Sometimes cohabitants will disagree on something. For example, you might disagree about whether to install a landline phone. Or you might disagree about who gets joint property if you separate. You should include a provision stating that you will try to resolve disputes in mediation.


For example, you could write, “In the event a dispute arises between the Parties, the Parties agree to participate in mediation. They will participate in at least four hours of mediation in accordance with the United States Arbitration & Mediation procedures. The parties agree to share equally in the costs of mediation.”, If you go to court, then a judge will need to interpret the contract. You can decide which state’s law to use. Generally, you will use the law of the state you live in.


A sample provision might read: “This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois.”, This clause states that the written contract contains the entire agreement between the parties. It is important to have because you don’t want the other person claiming that you had an oral side agreement.


Here is a sample merger clause: “The Parties intend that this Agreement is the full and complete agreement between the parties regarding their cohabitation. There are no other agreements, oral or written, between the Parties regarding the cohabitation. The Parties can modify this Agreement only by a writing executed by both Parties.”, If you end up in court, then the judge might find that one provision in your cohabitation contract is illegal. When that happens, the judge has to decide whether to sever that provision and keep the rest of the contract or void the whole contract. A severability clause tells the judge to sever any illegal part of the contract but enforce the remainder.


You could write, “If any paragraph or provision of this Agreement is found invalid, void, or unenforceable, then it is the intent of the Parties that the remaining parts should continue in force and effect.”, After you have typed up the contract, you should have an attorney go over it with you. A cohabitation contract is a valid contract. You should fully understand your rights and responsibilities.


To find an attorney, you can contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral.
If you don’t have much money, you should read Hire a Lawyer When You Have Low Income for tips on getting low-cost legal help.

, Include a line for both people to sign individually. Above the signature line, include the following:“I have read the Agreement and have spent time considering its implications. I fully understand the contents and I agree to its terms. I voluntarily submit to the execution of this Agreement.”Add lines for witnesses. You should probably have two witnesses observe the signing. Include a signature line for them as well.

, You should sign the contract in front of a notary. Although not required in every state, having the contract notarized can help resolve disputes later on about whether the contract is valid.


You can find a notary in most courthouses or large banks. You can also use the locator feature at the website for the American Society of Notaries.Make sure that you take personal identification to the notary. A valid passport or driver’s license should be acceptable.

, Store your copy of the cohabitation agreement in a safe place. You will want to refer to it later should a dispute arise.

Hold the bottom of the coffee cup with your free hand to keep it firmly in place.,
Place the knife blade against the rough bottom of the cup and slide it back and forth.",How to Sharpen a Knife with a Coffee Mug," Examine the bottom of your coffee cups to identify one that has enough rough space around the bottom. Consider using an older or “least favorite” cup as you may end up making a few marks on the bottom of the cup as you sharpen the knife.


Use only a coffee cup. A teacup is typically too delicate and does not contain the rough bottom required for sharpening.;
, You can sharpen as you go or on an “as needed” basis or you can get everything together that has been dulled and complete the task in one pass.


This technique works for all knife sizes and types (except butter knives) so feel free to apply this method across the board.

, Find a smooth, flat surface for this project and make sure the surface is not slippery (or wet). If the coffee cup slips from your hand while you are sharpening the knife, you could slip and cut your hand.

, The only way you’ll be able to sharpen the knife is to ensure the coffee cup does not move or slip.

, The motion should begin to sharpen the blade edge.


Turn knife over and perform the same motion on the other side of the blade to sharpen the other side.

Perhaps it can be located in an opening room foyer or living area that is located in or near the entrance doorway.;
, Although fireplace mantels work for temporary display, mounting them on sturdy boards around and near Christmas trees work too.

, How good does a broken house (to a Christmas village) look when it's broken? Tiny fingers will always find their way into touching and prodding these buildings, and sometimes causing devastation when the house falls and breaks into zillions of tiny pieces.

, Unless the room is a tiny walkway with no viable places to put them, spread them out into other attached rooms in the house (perhaps even on the same floor as the floor the houses initially started at).

, Those that can become lit need to be powered to an electrical outlet, in order to work effectively. A house without the light will look like a house that has lost all of its electricity after an ice storm (dark and dreary) and not very appealing to anybody who walks by the village house on occasion.

, Know exactly where each areas of houses have been placed.


Keep an itemized listing of each of your houses and where in each room the house/houses are placed. Describe any tiny people gathering in your list, include what they wear and other attributes that set them each apart from all the others.

, When the areas start to fill up and when you can't fit another fingernail-sized item on the area, it's time to move the village to a new place.

, White felt draped overtop of all the mounting areas is one of the easiest methods to making the area look like a Christmas scene to begin with. Not too many areas in the world don't have snow at Christmas (except those in warmer climates (like Southern California, Florida and Hawaii) and also south of the Equator).

, Use white bowls and plates placed bottom side up to create a curvature that a hill/valley would show off.

, If you have train sets that are proper scaled to the Christmas Village model, add them to the scenery. Set up a train depot.

,, These include ice skating rinks made of either aluminum foil, on a piece of cardboard ice skating rink (or a cut piece of a mirror), into noticeable pieces that all your ""skaters"" can skate on.

, They can be gathering on sidewalks, near mailboxes, gathering on street corners, and almost any other place that could be deemed an important valuable place.


Unless you really want to be funny, try not to show the people in areas where the conglomerates of people may look like they are fighting one another. It doesn't look spectacular.

, Leave some of the benches (if available) open, as not all benches will ever be full of people.

Get replacement bulbs when you buy your lights.,
Determine the source of damage.,
Test each strand individually.,
Check your power source.,
Check the fuse first.,
Check the strand and sockets for damage.,
Check first for loose connections.,
Replace dead bulbs.,
Test bulbs in a dead section.,
Test the strand after you’ve replaced bulbs.,
Continue to care for bulbs when stored.",How to Replace Dead Christmas Tree Lights," Purchase replacement bulbs for your Christmas lights at the same time that you buy your string(s) of lights. They are often sold at the same places and you are more likely to find ones that fit the kind you buy at the time rather than months or years later when you need them.


Your package of lights may already come included with a few replacement bulbs.
Make sure any replacement bulbs are of the same voltage as the original strand. Look on the package to determine the correct voltage for bulbs.If you cannot find a pack of replacement bulbs for your light strand, simply buy a second short strand of the same lights so you can use the bulbs from it as replacements.;
, Plug in your string of lights to see which of the following problems is occurring in order to adequately solve it:


There are a few individual bulbs that are not working at random across the strand. This indicates the easiest solution, which is to just replace the individual bulbs.
There is a whole section of the strand that is not lit. This is common, as light strands are often wired in series, so one bad bulb will affect the following bulbs in the string. You should be able to replace one or a few dead bulbs to fix the rest.All of the bulbs in the light strand are not lit. This could indicate a problem with a fuse in the string, or with a few bulbs affecting the entire circuit.

, Disconnect light strands from each other if you have several strands attached in one long string. Test each one in an outlet to determine which strand(s) are the source of the problem.


One or a few bad bulbs on one strand can affect the other strands, as they operate in a series circuit when connected. Or, there could be problems on more than one strand.

, Make sure that your power source is reliable and is not the cause of your light failure. Ensure that the switch is flipped to “on” if you’re using a power strip or surge protector, and that there is power going to the room of your home where you are plugged into an outlet.


You should try plugging your string of lights into several different sources of power to determine if one of them is the source of the problem.
If your power source is not the issue, be sure to unplug your lights before proceeding with any further adjustments or fixes to the bulbs.

, Before you check the bulbs themselves, pop open the cover on the end of a string of lights with a small screwdriver. Gently remove the glass fuse(s) and replace if brown or burnt in appearance.You can buy replacement fuses for Christmas tree lights at a hardware store or where light strands are sold.
Plug the strand back in once you’ve replaced a burnt-out fuse to see if this fixed the problem.

, Lay out your string of lights and look for any damage or fraying of the wires that connect bulbs. Also look for damage of the plastic sockets where the bulbs fit in.


Discard a string of lights if you see either wire or socket damage. Replacing the bulbs will not solve the issue in this case, and the strand is considered unsafe for further use.

, Look at the bulbs on your strand of lights to be sure that each one is seated firmly into its plastic socket, as they sometimes come loose.


Focus first on looking at individual unlit bulbs, or the first and last bulbs in a section that is unlit, but you should check all bulbs for loose connections.
Gently push a loose bulb down into the socket until its connecting edge appears flush with the socket or it clicks into place.

, Remove any bulb that you know for certain is dead, either because it is an isolated unlit bulb in a strand of otherwise functioning bulbs, or it is clearly shattered, burnt-looking, or otherwise discolored.


Gently remove a dead bulb by grasping it between two fingers and pulling it up out of the socket. Some bulbs may require you to twist the bulb before pulling up.
Replace any individual dead bulb with a new one of equal size and wattage, placing it firmly down into the socket.

, If you have a section of unlit bulbs in the strand, use a bulb tester, found in stores where Christmas lights are sold, to determine which bulb is causing the problem.


Inexpensive bulb testers can be found as a plastic mold or pen-shaped tool powered by a 9-volt battery.Start with the first and last bulbs in an entire strand that is unlit, or the first unlit bulb that follows a section of working bulbs.
Follow the individual instructions provided with your bulb tester for proper use. Remove any bulb you discover to be dead and replace with one of equal size and wattage.

, Plug your strand back into a power source after you’ve replaced any bulbs found to be dead to determine if all bulbs are now lit.


You may need to replace more than one bulb in a section of unlit ones. Continue to test all bulbs in an unlit section if replacing just one doesn’t solve the problem., At the end of the season, of after you’ve replaced bulbs, ensure that others are not broken or damaged by storing them where they will not be crushed or exposed to extreme temperatures.


When putting up or taking down lights, be sure not to pull too hard on the strand, or otherwise roughly handle the wires and bulbs in such a way that could damage them.
Coil your light strands neatly around a piece of cardboard, a clothes hanger, or other sturdy object, then place them into a box where there will not be pressure placed on the bulbs or wires.
Note that typical Christmas tree lights usually have a life of about 1,000-1,500 hours, or about one to three seasons of use (unless they are LED lights, in which case they can last much longer).Plan to replace light strands every few years rather than continuing to attempt bulb replacements beyond the strand’s expected lifespan.

Choose medium to large size Christmas light bulbs.,
Check the light bulbs.,
Work on one bulb at a time.,
Paint the bulb with craft glue.

,
Sprinkle the painted bulb with glitter.,
Lay the glittered bulb on the wax paper to dry.,
After drying, pick up each bulb and check the surface.,
Place the glitter bulbs in a display arrangement in your home.",How to Repurpose Old Christmas Lights Into Glitter Decorations," The bulbs need to be a decent size, otherwise they won't look spectacular when glittered. Unscrew then from the light holders and put the rest of the light arrangement to one side for re-purposing in its own right, or for recycling.;
, Discard any that are cracked, chipped or broken. If they need a clean, give them a wipe down with a damp cleaning cloth. Allow to dry before proceeding.

, That way, you can fix any mistakes as you go and the glue won't dry out on you while preparing each one. Before starting, lay out a sheet of wax paper on the work space––this will catch the glitter and prevent sticking.

,, Rotate slowly to add evenly across the entire surface of the bulb.


Choose colors that mean the most to you for celebrating the season. Typical colors include gold, silver, red and green. White for snow is good too, but only use this on white bulbs as the color of the bulb beneath it will show through.

, As it is drying, start the next and repeat as many times as you need to complete the bulbs.

, If the glitter is uneven anywhere, do touch ups and dry as before.

, It's completely up to you how you display them but here are some suggestions:


Arrange the baubles in a large bowl or on a cake stand. Ring with tinsel.
Fill a mason jar with the baubles.
Glue a hanging thread onto the baubles and hang from the Christmas tree.
Fill a large wine glass or brandy balloon with the baubles.
Attach the baubles to a rope or strong string and hang along the wall or over windows or doors.

Unplug your Christmas lights.,
Find the male sockets.,
Look at the socket to make sure it is marked and configured correctly.,
Open the socket door to get to the fuses.,
Check the fuse after you've open the socket door.,
Examine the color of the fuse to see if it is burnt.,
Find the replacement fuses that came with your lights.,
Replace the fuses.,
Plug the lights back into the outlet.",How to Replace a Fuse on Christmas Tree Lights," Before you open the plug cover, make sure you unplug the lights. It's always a good idea to unplug anything electrical before you work on it. Be careful not to electrocute yourself.Find the socket that enters the wall. Take a firm hold of the socket and pull it out of the wall.
Don’t pull out sockets from the cord. Pulling out light sockets from the cord can cause damage to your lights.
Test your lights to verify that they are still not working. Turn on the switch to see if the lights light up.;
, Male sockets are those with plugs as opposed to those that have space to receive plugs. They will be those plugged into other light strands or into the wall.Check each socket to see if it's male or female. Male sockets are the only ones that have fuses in Christmas tree lights.
Gather all the light strands that are not working. If multiple strands are not working, you may have to replace multiple fuses.
Make sure not to miss any male sockets that are not working properly. If a fuse is not working, the entire light strand will not work.

, Marked sockets will usually have an arrow pointing away from the cord and a sliding door that conceals the fuse.

Find the marked section of the socket. The underside of the plug is where the fuses are located.
Look for the arrows pointing on the socket. They should be pointing away from the cord and towards the male end of the plug.
Locate the sliding door that conceals the fuses. The piece marked with the arrow slides up to reveal fuses underneath.

, Before you replace the fuse, you need to open the socket with the arrow and sliding door. You may need a small screwdriver to do so if you cannot move the door by hand.


Find the grooves on the socket door. They should be relatively obvious to your touch.You may be able to push this door up with your fingernails. Don't force it if it does not come up easily.
If the socket door won’t come up by hand, you may need a small flathead screwdriver or kitchen knife. Find a knife or screwdriver that fits the small size of the socket door.
Use the knife or screwdriver to gently push up the socket door to show the fuses. Don’t use too much pressure, since you don’t want to damage the socket or the fuses underneath.

, Once the socket door has been opened, you will see the fuses underneath. Observe the fuses to see if they are damaged and need to be replaced. They are very small, so make sure to not lose them.


Locate the fuses. There will likely be two, but there may be only one. They should be immediately behind the socket door. Make sure the socket door is slid up far enough so you can comfortably reach the fuses.
Remove the fuses. Take your small screwdriver to pop out the fuses. They should be easy to remove. Don’t use too much force as to not damage the fuses.
Be careful to not lose the fuses. The fuses are very small and can be easily misplaced.

, Burnt fuses are easy to recognize. Look at them carefully before deciding if you need replacement fuses. If you’re not sure, you can also use a voltmeter to check their strength. Burnt fuses appear dark. If the fuse is obviously dark to your eye, then the fuse is burnt and will no longer work.
If you can’t tell immediately, take out each fuse and look more closely. Some fuses may be burnt, but do not show external signs.
Use a voltmeter to check the fuse strength. If the voltmeter does not register anything when checking the fuse, then it is burnt and needs to be replaced., Hopefully, you saved any replacement fuses. If not, you may have to find an electronics store that carries spare fuses.Locate the spare fuses. For many Christmas light sets, the spare fuses are in little plastic bags taped to the light set.
Remember where you’ve put the spare fuses if you removed them from these plastic bags. Keep them in a secure location with other electronic or Christmas lights.
Find an electronics store to get spare fuses. If you’ve lost the fuses, you may need to find them at an electronics store. However, it may be difficult to find them at those that do not specialize in Christmas lights or electrical repairs.

, After locating the spare fuses, put them back into the plug door. Be careful to not damage them when you're putting them in. Fuses can be fragile and easy to break if you're not careful.Place the fuses into the fuse socket. Don’t force them in. They should pop into place.
Make sure both fuses are secure before closing the plug door. They should be firmly in place in the grooves of the fuse socket.
Close the plug door. Use the small flathead screwdriver or kitchen knife to cover the fuses back up.

, Once you’re replaced the fuses, test out your Christmas lights to see if they work. If the lights still do not work, there may be another issue rather than burnt fuses.Make sure the socket door is securely closed. You don’t want your fuses to fall out of place.
Plug the lights back into the socket. Ideally, you Christmas lights should light up.
If your lights do not light up, the problem may not be your fuses. Check your cords for any fraying, verify all the bulbs are secured and working, and make sure your socket is in good shape."

Consider buying LED lights instead of incandescent bulbs.,
Make sure to buy decorations marked for outdoor use.,
Use or purchase GFCI outlets.,
Use different outlets to plug in multiple lights.,
Use plugs that utilize different circuits.,
Obtain a fresh living tree or fire-resistant artificial tree.",How to Use Christmas Lights Safely1," Traditional Christmas lights that use incandescent bulbs usually get hot, while LED lights stay cool to the touch. Using LEDs can reduce the likelihood of a fire starting. Look for Christmas lights from reputable Christmas retailers or light manufacturers and search for the LED varieties available.Popular brands include Ucharge Solar White Christmas Lights, TaoTronics Dimmable LED String Lights, and Qedertek Christmas Solar String Lights.LED lights will also save you money on energy costs.;
, Outdoor decorations are manufactured to withstand the cold and elements. Check your light's packaging to see if the decorations are marked for outdoor use. If you're in doubt, look for the Underwriters Laboratories or UL label. If the label is green, your lights are meant for indoor use only. If the label is red, that means that the lights are suitable for both indoor and outdoor use.UL is a widely accepted lab that tests lights for safety.
Make sure any extension cords are also suitable for the outdoors. The designation letter for outdoor extension cords is a W., Before hooking your Christmas lights up, make sure that the outlets you're using have ground fault circuit interrupters. These outlets look like normal outlets, but have the reset button on them and regulate the electrical current in a circuit. When there is a short or ground fault, the outlet cuts off the electrical current, which can prevent an electrical fire., You will have to account for the amount of wattage your holiday lights require. Take a look at the package to determine the wattage of your lights and then calculate how many watts you'll need based on how many strings you'll be using. On average, 265 ft of incandescent light would require 1,952 watts of energy or 6 separate outlets on two different circuits. In comparison, LED lights would need 38 watts and a single outlet to function., When doing extensive outdoor lighting, it's important to understand which circuits the outlets are on before plugging in your lights. Most circuits are 15 or 20 amps and can handle 1,440 max watts and 1,920 max watts, respectively. When exceeding this watt usage, make sure to use separate circuits in your house. Take a look at the circuit breaker layout in your house and determine which plugs are attached to which circuits.Also take into consideration other electrical equipment or appliances plugged into the same circuit as your Christmas lights.
Use a surge protector if you don't want to blow a circuit in the house.

, Having a dried or dead Christmas tree wrapped in lights is a recipe for disaster. Look for trees that look healthy and have fresh looking needles. If using an artificial tree, make sure that it's fire resistant and that it is not made of metal, which could conduct electricity in the case of a shortage.The dry needles on dead trees can catch fire due to the high heat created by some incandescent bulbs.
Make sure to water your tree daily if you are buying a living tree.

Make frosted pine cones.,
Make vintage ornaments from old metal pieces.,
Hang metal frame fabric ornaments.,
Fill clear globe ornaments.,
Make custom drum ornaments.,
Turn seashells into fanciful ornaments.",How to Make Your Own Christmas Decorations1," These pretty ornaments are surprisingly easy to make at home with some plain, natural pine cones. Pick out nice, even pine cones with a pleasing shape and lay them out on newspaper. Next, take white spray paint (such as Frost White) and spray one side of the pine cones. Let the paint dry for a few minutes, then turn the cones over and spray the other side. Finish the ornaments by hot gluing short loops of white satin ribbon to the base of each cone, so that they hang point-down.


You can spray more thoroughly for a bright white look, or at an angle from the bottom to give the appearance of snow on the edges of the pine cone eaves.;
, You can make old-fashioned looking ornaments to add a bit of Victorian class to your Christmas tree by hot gluing ribbon loops to old baking molds, commonly found at antique malls and retro shops. Make several using different, ornate shapes, and hang them at different points all around the tree. For even more variety, tie ribbon loops to old iron and bronze skeleton keys and hang them, too.


Skeleton keys can be spray painted white or finished with cheap clip-on holiday brooches to make them stand out more, if you wish.

, Cheap, small nickel frames are a great choice, since the metal has a nice, lustrous finish. Buy a few frames suitable for wallet-size pictures, and collect scraps of festive cloth. Open the back of each frame and stretch a piece of fabric across the backing board. Pin, stitch, or hot glue it in place on the back, and then hot glue a ribbon to one corner of the frame and hang it diagonally.


If you have plain white fabric and markers, you and your children can make a fun project out of stretching the cloth and then decorating each ornament with drawings and words, before closing and hanging them.

, Clear, thin glass globe ornaments are cheap to buy, and though they look pretty on their own, they're also ideal for customizing at home. Throw a pretty object, like a peacock feather or a piece of petrified wood, inside each one, and then hot glue the top shut.


Adding a single object is only the beginning for these versatile ornaments. You can add craft snow and a miniature model tree or snowman to make a tiny winter scene, or paint glitter onto the walls of the ornament to make it sparkle. Be creative!
For a truly dramatic effect, use a small rubber band and a round or oval-shaped piece of paper or other blocking material. Strap the oval smoothly to one side of the ornament, using the rubber band to hold it in place across the “equator” of the ornament. Suspend it from a hook, and apply a coat or two of glass frosting spray paint. Once the paint is dry, remove the band and oval for a picture window effect with a thin clear band bisecting the rest of the frosted orb.

, Festive little drums are a classic holiday motif. Make your own cheaply and quickly by buying small, round wooden (or cardboard) boxes from your local craft store and decorating them with a band of thick ribbon around the body, or thin ribbon around the outer edge of the lid. Hang them by gluing a thin piece of ribbon underneath the lip of the lid at either end.


Vary drum sizes and ribbon colors and patterns to make a festive little set of unique drums.

, Seashells are great as ornaments on their own – just hot glue some gold or silver cord to them to make a hanging loop – but they're easy to dress up, as well. Try painting one or both sides of a shell with thin glue, and then thoroughly coating it in colored glitter to make an iridescent shell. Paint glue on in separate stages to create different areas of colored glitter for a two-tone effect, or paint a thin line of glue to make a glittery edging effect that's great for spiral-shaped shells.


If you have a sea urchin shell, try gluing a bundle of tinsel underneath it once it's been dressed in glitter, to make a “jellyfish.” Hang it from the top and center so the “tentacles” hang down.

Inspect your lights.,
Test your lights.,
Don't overdecorate.",How to Use Christmas Lights Safely2," With the lights unplugged, check for cracked bulbs, loose insulation, or wire frays. Cracked lights or damaged sockets could cause a fire or electrical problem in your house. Before you install your lights, make sure to inspect them carefully for damage. Dispose of any strings that are broken. If you are reusing lights from a prior year, it's important to inspect the lights annually to ensure nothing was damaged., Test the lights on the ground and make sure that they all work before attempting to install them. Unravel your string of lights and plug them into a free socket. Look over all of the individual bulbs on your string. Check for flickering or dead lightbulbs. You can also purchase a special light tester that will tell if there are any malfunctioning bulbs.The last thing that you want to happen is to realize that your lights are broken when you are up high on a ladder.


Test turning your lights off and on multiple times.
If your lights dim, test the dimming feature to make sure that they are working correctly.

, Consider how much area you need to cover with your holiday lights by measuring and don't go overboard. Too many lights in a concentrated area could cause an electrical fire and be unsafe.Consider the spacing in between your lights and how long each of the light strings are. Lights with a 4-inch bulb spacing will illuminate a wider area at a lower cost.As a general rule, plan for around 100 mini Christmas tree lights for every vertical foot and a half (0.45 meters) of space you want to light.

Use a wooden or fiberglass ladder.,
Do not pinch wires in doorways or windows.,
Use specialized hooks when hanging lights on your gutter or windows.,
Unplug the lights when installing them.,
Use an automatic timer or shut off your lights when you sleep.",How to Use Christmas Lights Safely3," When hanging your lights, you may need to use a ladder to get to higher places. Metal ladders are conductive and could electrocute you if something goes wrong with the lights. Avoid wooden ladders that have metal reinforcement wire, as these can also conduct electricity., Do not place wires in doorways, windows, or under heavy furniture. This can destroy the insulation of the wires and leave them exposed, which could cause an electrical fire. When installing the lights, make sure that they have a clear path that won't be disturbed. Do not put wires across walkways where there will be a lot of foot traffic and refrain from having wires hang down at head height.Use the instructions found inside of the light packaging.

, When hanging your lights up on a window or your house's gutters, it's important that you hooks that are made specifically for hanging holiday lights. There are multi-purpose plastic hooks that you can purchase at many hardware stores or online.You can also get individual holders for each light bulb that will help hold them in place and will help you be more precise with the layout of your light display., You should have already tested the lights on the ground to ensure that they work before trying to install them. Do not install lights while they are plugged in. An unplanned short could electrocute you, or you could damage the light socket or your string of lights if you leave them connected., Make sure to occasionally turn off your lights when you are sleeping or are out of the house. If you are forgetful, you can get an automatic timer that will turn the lights off and on at variable times during the day. Keeping the lights on for an extended period is not only a waste of money but can also be dangerous.You can purchase an automatic timer at larger chain hardware or retail stores like Home Depot, Lowes, and Walmart."

Frame an ornament.,
Make snow puffs for the mantel.,
Decorate for dinner with holiday napkin rings.,
Wrap candles for an instant centerpiece.,
Decorate a plain wreath.",How to Make Your Own Christmas Decorations2," This striking and elegant wall decoration is easy to make with fifteen minutes and some basic supplies. First, tie a pretty tree ornament to some ribbon and make a loop. Take an empty wooden picture frame (painted to match the ornament, if you like) and make sure the ribbon is long enough that when you hold the top against the top back side of the frame, the ornament hangs in the center. Once you're satisfied, mark that spot and hot glue or nail the ribbon in from the back. Hang the frame on the wall to show off the ornament suspended in its center.

, These are spiky, unique looking ornaments that recall snowflakes and dandelion fluff in equal measure. Start with balls of craft foam and lots of flat toothpicks. Sit down and stick the toothpicks into the foam balls all over, as closely together as possible. Once the entire ball is covered, adjust the toothpicks until they're all about even, and then spray paint the whole thing white. They look great sitting on top of other objects or just scattered as a set of three or four across a shelf.


Use different-sized foam balls to make varying sizes of puffs.

, Thread thin ribbon through the tops of one or two small globe ornaments, and then tie the thin ribbon through the center of a bow knot in a piece of wide ribbon to serve as the napkin ring itself. Use two different colors, such as blue and silver, for a pretty and classy look.


As with all napkin rings, this works best on cloth napkins; however, if you skip the ornaments, you can make even a plain table festive by tying utensils together with satin bows.

, Wrapped candles are quick, easy, and impressive to look at. Start with a candle in a dedicated glass holder, or use a pillar candle set in a properly-sized wine glass or other piece of glassware. Next, wrap the base or center area of the glass with something festive. Bits of sleeve cut from old winter sweaters look cozy; a fat velvet ribbon with a bow is festive; sprigs of cedar glued around the base are warm and elegant.


Consider using pretty Mason jars, such as diamond-patterned jelly jars, as candle holders for an extra-homey look. You can even turn the ring of the jar upside-down and set the jar inside it for a more elaborate display!

, There are an endless number of crafty things you can do with a wreath-form base to create your own custom Christmas wreaths: glue fruit and nuts to them, wrap them in fabric, cover them with globe ornaments – but there's no easier or more fun way to create a quick custom wreath than to start with a plain fir- or pine-bough wreath from the store and let your creativity take over from there. Try adding gift tags with the names of your family and friends, or sticking floral elements (the kind that come on plastic spikes) in to add fruits and leaves.


You can also decorate your wreath just like a Christmas tree. Instead of hanging the ornaments, tack them to the boughs straight through the tops. Use a couple different sizes and colors to create a look that's at once homemade and professional.

Take your tape measure and mark three lengths of 33 inches (83.82 cm) on each 1x4x6. Then cut three arms.You can buy 1x4x6 boards at your local hardware store. Simply ask for 6-foot (1.83 m) pieces of 1x4 board.;
, Once you have made your arms, adjust your miter saw to make 30-degree cuts. Use your tape measure and mark off the cuts for each piece. Then, cut 12 V pieces at 8 inches (20.32 cm) long. Finally, use the remaining wood to cut 12 3-inch (7.62 cm) triangle pieces.A miter saw will have a slot for cutting a 30-degree angle on your board.
If you want to save time and make your cuts more accurate, cut one V piece and one triangle piece to use as guides for your remaining pieces.

, Use a paintbrush to apply standard white paint to each piece of wood. Once painted, allow the boards to dry for a few hours. If the boards feel sticky or paint comes off on your fingers when you touch it, let the boards continue drying.If you want to hang your snowflake outdoors, consider using exterior paint.

, With a hammer and nails, attach four V pieces and four triangles to one of the 33-inch (83.82 cm) arms. First, hammer the V pieces on each end of the board, being sure to form a V shape about one inch (2.54 cm) away from the ends. Then, attach two triangles immediately below the bottom of each V. The two small triangles should make larger triangles with the base facing the V pieces.Repeat this step two more times to make the remaining arms.

, Once you have finished assembling all three arms, stack them up on top of each other. Create an X with two arms and place them across the middle of the third arm. Then drill a hole through in the center of the snowflake where the three arms intersect. Finally, insert a 3-inch (7.62 cm) bolt into the center hole and tighten it with a nut.You can find a bolt at your local hardware store. It will hold the snowflake together and allow you to take it down for easy storage.

, Once you assemble your snowflake, attach a heavy-duty hanger used for mirrors or pictures onto the snowflake’s back. Place the hanger towards the top of the arm stacked on the bottom. This will allow you to hang your snowflake securely indoors or outdoors.You can find a hanger at your local hardware store.

You and your family will have to work together to keep everything running smoothly as you go back to school.;
, If you used to cook and clean for hours each day, chances are you won't be able to continue this as you go back to school. Talk to your spouse and children about the new demands on your time, and ask them to step up and help around the house. Redistribute basic household chores like washing dishes, doing laundry, cleaning, and cooking, so that everyone helps out as much as they can.

, Write down when you are in class or at work, and then set aside times when you'll need to study. You can also schedule time to spend with your family, doing chores, or anything else you need to do. Post this schedule somewhere where the whole family can easily see and refer to it.


If you want, add your kids' and spouse's schedules, so that it can serve as a reference for the whole family.

, If you're at work or in class when they get out of school in the afternoon, arrange for them to carpool with friends, walk or bike, or take the bus home, or find an after-school care center for them. If your classes are in the evening, find a babysitter to watch them, or leave them with friends. This will help to ensure that your kids are well cared for while you get some time for you and your schooling.

, In a house full of kids, there are constant demands on your time and energy. There are always dishes to wash, fights to break up, cleaning to do, or questions to answer. This is not a very productive study environment. Find somewhere away from home - a library or other quiet place - where you can study productively. If you need to be at home, then isolate yourself in a room and tell your kids to stay away while you study, interrupting you only in the case of emergencies.

, Get plenty of sleep, and stay in shape. This will help keep you healthy and happier, which will help you deal with your busy, potentially stressful schedule. If you find yourself struggling mentally or emotionally with your new role, consider seeing a therapist. Making your health a priority is the best way to keep you and your family happy as you return to school.

Consider a child psychologist.",How to Know if Your Toddler Is Eating Enough," Most toddlers struggle with sitting at the table long enough to eat an entire meal. Pay attention to how often your toddler eats during the day. If they eat five evenly spaced meals or snacks per day, they are likely eating enough. Toddler’s are actually very good at determining when they are hungry or need to eat. As long as they have five small portions of food during the day, they will not starve or be too low in nutrients.If your toddler does not eat at all during the day or barely eats anything at each meal, they may not be eating enough.;
, Toddlers have small stomachs and may not eat large portions at meals. If your toddler eats a handful of food at each meal, they may be getting enough to eat. If they merely pick at a few pieces of food each meal, they may not be eating enough.You can try charting how much your toddler eats for one week to get a better sense of the portions of food they are consuming. Write down how much your toddler eats at each meal for one week to determine if they are getting enough food.

, Toddlers are known to be picky eaters and may show a preference for certain types of food. Take notice of what your toddler eats at each meal. Look to see if they prefer certain foods, such as starchy foods, vegetables, fruits, or beans. They may end up eating more of one food at meals because they like the taste of it.Write down what your toddler eats at each meal for a week. Notice if your toddler tends to go for the same foods at every meal. This can help you meal plan and modify your toddler’s diet so they eat more.

, As long as your toddler has a lot of energy and is growing properly, they are likely eating fine. Factors like genetics, general development, and ethnicity all come into play when determining a healthy weight and height for toddlers. Speak to your doctor about measuring your child’s growth and weight to ensure they are healthy.If your toddler does not seem to be growing properly or is underweight, this may be a sign that they are not eating enough at meals. Your doctor may recommend a diet plan to ensure your toddler gets the energy and nutrients they need to grow.

, Make sure your toddler has grains, vegetables, fruits, protein, and dairy at every meal. Add a very small amount of fats and sweets to the plate as well. Offering your toddler all the major food groups will ensure they have access to all the nutrients they need to grow and stay healthy. It will then be up to them to eat it once you present it to them.As part of a balanced diet, you should give your toddler around six servings of grains per day as well as two to three servings of vegetables and fruits. They should also have two servings of protein like chicken, beef, tofu, or beans, and 16 to 20 ounces of dairy like yogurt, milk, or cheese.

, Most toddlers do not need a lot of food at each meal to feel full. Adjust your toddler’s diet by serving them smaller portions at each meal, about 1 tablespoon of each food group on one plate. This is equal to ¼ of an adult portion size. Give your child less than you think they will eat and ask them if they want more or are still hungry once they are done with their plate.Give your toddler one tablespoon of food for every birthday they have had. For example, if your toddler is three, give them three tablespoons of a grain like brown rice, three tablespoons of vegetables and fruits like spinach, broccoli, apples, or pears, and three tablespoons of protein like fish, chicken, or beef.

, Toddlers often do not eat enough in one meal to remain full until their next mealtime. Have healthy snacks on hand to offer them between meals so they are not starving. Toddlers should have three full meals and at least two snacks a day. Provide healthy snacks like low-fat string cheese, fruit slices, yogurt cups, whole-grain crackers with peanut butter, or slices of lean chicken or turkey.Do not give your child snacks close to their next mealtime, such as in the next hour. Have them eat their snacks a few hours before their next meal. This way, your toddler will be hungry enough for their meal and not too full on snacks.

, Modeling good eating behavior for your toddler can help them develop good eating habits as they grow. Having regular mealtimes and a set eating routine at meals can make sitting at the table and eating easier for your toddler.Sit with your toddler at meals and turn off all distractions, such as the television or your phone. Make meals a family affair where everyone sits down, eats, and talks together. Show your toddler that you are enjoying your meal by chewing your food slowly and finishing all the food on your plate.

, You may be frustrated by your toddler’s lack of interest in their food. But resist the temptation to force your toddler to finish everything on their plate if they tell you they are full. Allow them to stop eating if they are no longer hungry. Pressuring them to eat will only make them upset and can cause food related issues for your toddler.You should also avoid bribing your toddler so they will finish their food. Do not offer them a sweet or dessert if they finishing their food. This can encourage them to use mealtime to get attention from you and can end up causing more issues for your toddler.
Do not threaten or punish your toddler for not finishing their meal. This can cause anxiety and stress for them around food.

, If you are worried about your toddler’s lack of interest in food, speak to your pediatrician about the issue. They can do a physical exam on your toddler and determine if they are malnourished or not growing properly due to poor diet. They can also offer tips on how you can get your toddler to eat more at mealtime in a healthy way.For example, you may ask the pediatrician, ""Is my toddler at a healthy weight and height for their age?"" ""Should I adjust their diet or eating habits in any way?""
Your pediatrician can also recommend a pediatric nutritionist for your child if they are malnourished or not getting enough to eat.

, Your pediatrician can recommend a pediatric nutritionist that you can go to for a consultation. The nutritionist can create a custom meal plan for your toddler and give you advice on how you can make sure your toddler is eating enough on a regular basis.Over time, the nutritionist may modify your child’s meal plan to be less regimented or strict, especially if they show signs of improvement and are eating more regularly.

, This will likely only be an option if your child’s lack of interest in food is severe and they appear to have psychological issues related to food. Speak to your pediatrician about getting a referral to a child psychologist, if necessary. Sometimes toddlers can develop adverse reactions to food due to issues like anxiety or stress.For example, you may ask the child psychologist, ""Do you think my toddler has issues with food?"" ""How can I help my toddler develop healthy eating habits?""

However, if you want something else, consider a small flowering shrub, which will continue to bring beauty to the grave site for many years.If you want a flowering shrub or flowers, pick something small, native, and easy to maintain. Check with a local nursery to ask what would be best for your area. Also, ask about how often you need to prune the bush. For instance, in a very dry, hot area, you may want to consider a succulent or pretty blooming cactus.
Some people use flowers such as chrysanthemums and geraniums because they don't take as much effort to maintain as other flowers.;
, For instance, in fall, you may want to place several small pumpkins on the grave site. Near Christmas, you may want to add poinsettias or a small wreath made of evergreens. In other words, you may want to decorate the grave site periodically, updating it by what's available for the current season or upcoming holiday., You can find a number of options for lighting that are solar powered. Many companies build lighting specifically for graveyards, so consider one of those options first. However, you can also find inexpensive solar-powered lighting even at home improvement stores or garden stores., Even if your cemetery allows any type of decorations, most prefer non-breakable options. For instance, pick metal containers over glass or stone and plastic over ceramic. Broken containers can be unsightly and a hazard., You can use art to decorate your loved one's grave site. For instance, try small saint statues or painted stones.Just remember that anything you use should be weatherproof, including sun-proof; if art isn't made for outdoors, the colors will fade quickly.

, One way to honor the deceased person is to decorate the grave with items related to his or her religion. For instance, you could use crosses for a person who was Christian. Alternatively, some Jewish people use small stones to decorate their graves., If your loved one had a favorite animal, think about a small stuffed animal. Alternatively, you can use a small animal made out of stone for a more permanent option., If your loved one was a veteran, consider adding a small flag to the grave site. You could also use a small stone painted with a flag or the emblem of the branch the person was in., Above all, give the person what he or she loved in life. From a favorite school to a favored sport's team, use the person's favorite things to guide your decorations. Just remember that you have to account for wind, weather, and sun; something like a football would blow away, so chose something else to represent it, such as a small weatherproof flag., Most cemeteries these days have websites with the grave site decorating rules listed; if the one you're visiting does not, you'll need to call the office or city in charge of the cemetery. Every cemetery has different rules for decorating grave sites, and you need to know what rules apply before you decorate., What you place on the grave site will often be limited to just the grave site, meaning you can't encroach on any graves next to the one you're decorating. Even if you have space around the site, most cemeteries will limit what you place to your site., Some cemeteries will not allow you to place flags on grave sites at any time. In turn, they may put out flags on certain holidays, such as Memorial Day., Most cemeteries will allow fresh-cut flowers at any time. However, some limit the times that you can use silk flowers, such as not allowing them in the summer.Others will allow potted plants, but only if you maintain them. Anytime flowers become faded or die out, the cemetery will likely remove them.You may also be allowed to plant a small bush or flowers in the ground over the grave, but this practice varies from cemetery to cemetery. In general, you must maintain them yourself and make sure they stay within the grave site. If the plants die, they'll likely be removed.Similarly, other cemeteries will allow wreaths at certain times of year, such as winter wreaths only during winter months. Often, to place a wreath, you'll be required to use a tripod., Some cemeteries allow you to place holiday-related decorations. However, you'll usually have to place them and remove them within a certain time frame., Some cemeteries do not allow any other type of decoration.Items such as food, statues, rocks, lights, stuffed animals, and so on may or may not be allowed, so check before you bring them., Some cemeteries have more restrictive rules on mausoleums than grave sites. In other cemeteries, the reverse is true. Make sure you check the rules for the correct type of grave., For instance, some sites do not allow you to attach anything to the headstone. Other places will not allow you to place permanent vases below the ground., The cemetery has the right to remove decorations at its discretion. In addition, it is possible that others may disrespect the site and remove the items. Don't put anything out that you may want back."

Be consistent.,
Use the same rules for punishing your child every time they misbehave.,
Acknowledge your child's poor behavior whenever it happens (and punish them if necessary).,
Assign a reasonable punishment from the get-go, then stick to it.,
Set very clear boundaries.,
Fit the punishment to the crime.,
Be calm, but firm.,
Present a united front with your partner.,
Be a positive role model.,
Don't forget to reward good behaviors.",How to Punish a Child1," This may perhaps be the single most important thing to remember when disciplining a child. Your child can't learn the rules if the rules are always changing. Consistency is crucial both for getting your child to behave and for getting your child to learn which sorts of behaviors are acceptable and which aren't. Punishing a child inconsistently or allowing the child to weasel out of punishments teaches them that it's sometimes (or always) OK to behave badly. Below are just a few tips to keep in mind in terms of punishing your child consistently:;
, Don't arbitrarily change your rules or change the punishments for certain behaviors without a clear reason for doing so.

, Don't ignore bad behavior when it's inconvenient to deal with.

, Don't pick one punishment and then allow your child to get out of it or switch to an easier one. Don't let a child get out of their punishment with tears or puppy-dog eyes.

, Your child will have a hard time avoiding bad behavior if they don't understand what bad behavior actually is. You should give your child a basic idea of what's wrong and what's right from as young of age as they are able to understand this distinction. The way to do this is by establishing clear boundaries, that is, making it clear to the child why and how a certain bad behavior is wrong, then punishing the child when the behavior is repeated (and, of course, by being consistent about these boundaries.)


Obviously, your child/children's ability to understand the reasoning behind your boundaries will change greatly as they grow up. For instance, a toddler who's just learning how to speak won't understand not to draw on the walls with a marker if you lecture it about how harming other people's property is disrespectful. Instead, you'll have to suffice with a firm ""no"" and, if necessary, by taking their marker away.

, Different types of bad behavior demand different punishments. Small acts of disrespect or first-time infractions may deserve nothing more than a clear warning, while deliberate disrespect or violent behavior may require a serious response. Try to be reasonable about the punishments you assign, keeping in mind that children aren't perfect and learn by making mistakes but also that it's important to make sure they understand that their misbehavior is wrong and won't be tolerated.


As an obvious example, grounding a child for a month is a little harsh if all they did was forget to bring home a paper from school for you to sign. A better punishment would be just to keep them from getting their allowance until they remember it.
You'll also want to make your punishments age-appropriate; grounding a toddler won't do you much good. For a good guide to what sorts of punishments are appropriate for different age ranges, see Parents.com's punishment guide for children ages 1-10., Certain bad behaviors from your children may really get under your skin, but getting furiously angry with your child won't do you much good in the long run. Parents who can't control their anger will have a hard time making clear-headed, logical decisions about how to punish their child and may come to rely on emotional outbursts (or worse) as a way of getting their point across. In addition, getting in the habit of making your point with anger can set a bad precedent; if you get angry and yell at your child so often that it becomes a common occurrence, your anger may eventually lose its meaning, requiring you to get even angrier for your child to take notice.


Thus, it's a wise idea to work on keeping your anger in check when your child is misbehaving. For example, if your child gets frustrated when playing catch and starts disrespecting you, don't lash out, instead, calmly tell them, ""You know not to talk to me like that. We're done playing catch. You can get started on your homework."" Keep your cool if they reacts to this with anger; you don't want to teach your child that they can easily drive you nuts.
For more on this topic, see our How to Control Anger article or one of the many calm parenting guides on the web.

, An old-fashioned piece of parenting advice that's still relevant today is to make sure to agree to form a united front with your partner when it comes to disciplining your child. This means that both parents must agree to the family's rules for discipline and follow them equally. Failure to follow this rule can lead to trouble; a family with one parent who's firm about punishments and another who's lax may encourage the child to run to the ""easy"" parent as soon as he's done something wrong.


As a very general rule, the importance of a united front decreases as a child gets older. By their teenage years, most children will understand that parents can disagree about certain things without either of them being wrong. , Always, always, always remember that your children learn from watching you. The things you tell your children to do aren't nearly as important as the things you show your children to do. Keep an eye on your own behavior when your kids are around. Make an effort to be a polite, happy, caring, hard-working, and productive person and your kids will notice.


What you don't do is also very important. Don't do anything in front of your children you wouldn't want them to do in front of you. This includes throwing tantrums, acting immaturely, or giving into bad habits. For example, if you stress the importance of good manners to your children but spend every Wednesday night cursing and yelling at your elderly mother on the phone, you're sending the message that it's actually OK to have bad manners when someone's annoying to you.

, Punishment is only half of the battle. In addition to punishing bad behaviors, you'll also want to go out of your way to reward good behaviors like hard work, kindness, and patience. When your child is doing their job of being a kind, hard-working young person, encourage them to keep it up by showing them warmth and attention. Once they are used to receiving this sort of treatment in return for good behavior, withdrawing your affection when they misbehave can be a punishment on its own.


Scientific research has shown that the power of positive reinforcement is not to be underestimated. In one study, positive parenting techniques corresponded with lower levels of antisocial behavior and substance abuse as the child aged."
"
Withhold privileges.,
Use restitution (make the child pay you back).,
Use time-outs if your child responds well to them.,
Use natural consequences.,
Use grounding.,
Force the child to apologize for major misdeeds in person.,
Use safe, mild corporal punishments sparingly (if at all).",How to Punish a Child2," When it comes to precise definitions of which punishments are suitable and which aren't, parents' opinions differ; some parents opt for a strict approach, while others are more gentle. While there's no single right way to discipline a child, the suggestions in this section are intended as all-purpose tips that nearly all parents should find helpful. One example of a punishment that's suitable for all families is removing a misbehaving child's privileges. For instance, if a child's grades have been suffering because they haven't been doing their homework, you may want to restrict video game time to the weekends until they can show you a test with a grade of B+ or better.


To be clear, you'll only want to take away a child's privileges as a form of punishment, not their basic needs. Temporarily keeping a child from seeing their friends or watching TV is one thing, but keeping a child from sleeping, feeling loved, or getting adequate nutrition constitutes child abuse., In the real world, there are consequences for breaking the rules; if a grown-up does something wrong, they will often be forced to pay back the people they wronged in the form of community service, paying a fine, and so on. Show your child the consequences for bad behavior by making them work to get things back to the way they were (or better) before they misbehaved. This is an especially useful tactic for when the child causes property damage. For instance, if your child deliberately paints on your kitchen table, a good punishment would be making them go through the process of stripping, sanding, and varnishing the wood to get it looking like new again.

, Time-outs are somewhat controversial; to some, they're a weak, ineffective, coddling way to discipline a child, while others swear by them. While some parenting experts believe that time-outs aren't effective for all children, many believe that, when used correctly, time-outs can help an agitated child cool down and discourage bad behavior.Try experimenting with time-outs for minor infractions; if your child seems willing to behave after a quick time-out, they may be effective for you, but if he becomes more agitated or doesn't seem bothered by the punishment, you may want to use other tactics.


The amount of time spent in time-out should vary based on the child's age and the seriousness of the misbehavior. A good general rule for minor misbehavior like back-talking, not listening, and so on is about one minute of time-out for each year of the child's age.

, Adults can't afford to act shortsightedly or selfishly all the time. If a grown-up stays home from work to play video games, they may lose their job. Teach your children the importance of self-motivation by allowing them to suffer the natural consequences of their poor behavior. In other words, don't rescue them when they misbehave in a way that's against their own self-interest. For example, if a child won't stop playing to come eat dinner, just clean up the table when you're done with your meal and refuse to make more food afterward.This sort of approach helps children build the self-discipline that will help them succeed later in life.

, As children age, they start to form important social connections with their peers and begin to spend their free time with these people. Temporarily cutting a child off from these enjoyable social relationships is one way to discourage bad behavior, especially if the grounding keeps the child from attending something they deem is important, like a birthday party or dance. Like time-outs, however, some experts believe that grounding can be ineffective for certain types of children, so use your best judgement and be willing to change your strategy if you're not getting results.


Note that grounding should never be a permanent or semi-permanent condition. Keeping a child from forming mutually friendly relationships with others can affect their ability to function as adults and is usually considered a form of abuse.

, Though it's often overlooked, the power of a heartfelt, personal apology can be huge. For example, if your child tears up the neighbor's yard, playing tag with their friends, making them come over to the neighbor's house and apologize is a great punishment. For added effect, you may also want to make them spend the next Saturday helping to get the yard looking good again.


Making a child apologize to someone they've wronged face-to-face doesn't just force them to go through an unpleasant experience as a form of punishment, it also prepares them for an adult life in which they'll need to apologize for their mistakes to maintain healthy relationships. An in-person apology is also a very humbling, diminishing experience for a child to go through, which can help with out-of-control egos.

, Perhaps no topic in child discipline is more controversial than the use of corporal (physical) punishment. Some parents make a point of never raising a hand against their child, while, for more old-fashioned parents, spankings, paddlings, and even open-handed slaps for especially bad misbehavior are acceptable. If you do decide to use corporal punishment, reserve it for the most serious offenses. Relying on it too heavily can dull its effectiveness and, worse, teach children that it's acceptable to hurt people less powerful than them.


While it's every parent's job to decide the best way to discipline their own child, there is some evidence to suggest that relying too heavily on corporal punishment is a bad idea. For instance, some research associates corporal punishment in children with delinquency in adolescence and even violent behavior and emotional dysfunction in adulthood."
"
Don't ever beat a child.,
Don't be an emotional abuser.,
Don't punish a child's curiosity.,
Know the dangers of harsh, overly-strict parenting.,
Know the dangers of weak, permissive parenting.,
Get outside help for major behavioral issues.",How to Punish a Child3," Even parents who practice corporal punishment usually make a clear distinction between the occasional spanking and a deliberate, violent beating. It's never OK to beat a child. This is almost universally recognized as a form of abuse by parenting associations. In addition, clear links have been established between suffering beatings as a child and increased rates of mental illness as an adult.Additionally, certain forms of violence can cause permanent, even lethal damage to a growing child. For instance, shaking a young child in frustration or anger can give it brain damage or kill it., It's perfectly possible to be an abusive parent without even raising a finger towards your child. Neglect, isolation, and intimidation are all ways to damage your child's emotional growth. Though raising a child can be frustrating, these behaviors are never okay; not only are they cruel and unfair to the child, but they can also lead to serious problems, including self-harm, substance abuse, depression, and even suicide.Below is a brief list of behaviors that qualify as emotional abuse. For a complete list, consult anti-abuse resources like the American Humane Association:


Isolating the child from others from normal social interactions.
Verbally assaulting the child with insults, threats, and ridicule.
Terrorizing the child for failing to meet unreasonable expectations.
Deliberately humiliating a child.
Using fear and intimidation to control a child.
Ignoring or neglecting the child's basic needs.
Forcing the child to do something wrong or unhealthy.
Refusing to show your child love, tenderness, and affection.

, Children are naturally curious; they learn by interacting with the world around them. Try to avoid punishing your child for misbehavior that's a result of honest curiosity. Punishing a child for doing something that they didn't even know was wrong may encourage them to be afraid of new experiences in the long run or even make the bad behavior more exciting.


For example, it would be wrong to punish a child for asking their friends about sex, a better idea is to sit down with them, answer their questions, and explain why it's a bad idea to talk about sexually explicit things in public. Admonishing them without an explanation will probably just make them more curious.

, It's easy to go too far in your quest to discipline your child, but this is something you should always strive to avoid. Holding your child to unrealistic standards and assigning excessively strict punishments can affect their ability to live a happy, healthy life. Always remember that your goal as a parent is to help your child get to the point where they can basically parent themselves, not bully the child into living life exactly as you want them to.


It's also important to note that overly harsh parenting techniques are often ineffective because they deprive the child of the chance to become self-disciplined. If a child is constantly reacting to the punishments and demands of an excessively strict parent, they never learns how to motivate themselves., On the other hand, it's equally easy (if not even easier) to go to far in the opposite direction. Refusing to follow through with punishments and letting your child walk all over you teaches them that they don't need to behave well or work hard to get what they want. Making a habit of caving to a fussy child or repeatedly rescuing them from unpleasantness can also ruin their ability to deal with negative emotions in a mature way. In a word, this creates a child who is spoiled.


Again, this sort of parenting actually does your child a disservice in the long run. Most parenting experts agree that raising a child with an overly permissive style can lead to an adult who has a hard time getting satisfaction from their life and having a positive self-image., Unfortunately, some behavioral issues are beyond the scope of normal parenting techniques and may require professional help. These problems can't (and shouldn't) be treated with normal punishment and discipline techniques. They may require medicinal solutions, counseling, or mentorship that an ordinary parent can't provide. Below is just a short list of problem behaviors that require the attention of a professional:


Crime (shoplifting, vandalism, violence, etc.)
Substance abuse
Other addictions (internet, sex, etc.)
Mental/emotional illnesses (learning disorders, depression, etc.)
Dangerous behavior (risk-seeking, street racing, etc.)
Rage or violent outbursts

Teach your toddler how to interact with the baby.",How to Manage a Toddler While Caring for an Infant1," Toddlers are very mobile. While it's always important to keep your home safe for a toddler, be extra certain to keep things safe when you're also caring for an infant. It's more difficult to grab or stop a toddler when a newborn also needs care.The most important thing is visibility. Create an area where your toddler can play under supervision while you deal with an infant. Go for a big, open living room and block it off using gates and doors.
Cover electrical outlets, as these can be dangerous if a toddler sticks their finger in one.
Use gates and doors to block staircases. Keep baby locks on cupboards and cabinets.;
, You will have to change both your toddler and infant regularly. While changing your infant, it's important to be able to keep your eyes on your toddler. Keep the changing table in a space where you can observe your toddler while changing your infant.For example, keep a changing table in the living room, facing towards the room. If you need to change your toddler, you can keep an eye on your newborn from there.

, Make sure anything breakable is well out of a toddler's reach. When caring for an infant, it's difficult to jump to action quickly to stop a toddler from injuring themselves with a fragile item. Put away things like glass decorations, vases, and breakable lamps., A sling can be used to carry your infant from place to place. This can increase your mobility, allowing you to keep up with your toddler while carrying your infant. You can buy this online, at a department store, or at a store that sells baby supplies.Make sure to talk to your child's doctor before buying a sling to make sure it's safe for you and your baby.
Buy a sling designed for your infant's age. With very young infants, you may have to wait a few months before you can use the sling.

, A toddler will want to interact with the baby. Allow them to talk to the baby, touch the baby, and do things like watch feeding or help with diaper changes. Many toddlers like to feel like they're helping a younger sibling.Make sure your toddler knows how to be gentle. Correct your toddler if they get too rough and observe interactions at all times.

Teach your children how to write a bill.,
Consider what your children will need to do when shopping as adults.,
Cover how to do the taxes with your child.,
Discuss the responsibilities of having children with your child.,
Suppose your children want to live by themselves when they reach adulthood.,
Teach your children how to be productive and manage stress.,
Teach your children how to use a credit card.,
Cover maturity with your child.,
Understand that one important skill in the workplace is hiding true feelings.",How to Prepare Your Child for Adult Life," Writing bills and checks is one of the most important responsibilities in adult life. There are many bills that adults will need to write, including house bills (especially if they own houses) and electricity bills. There is essential information that will need to go on the bill, including an invoice number and the client's information.;
, There are necessities that adults tend to be responsible for buying for themselves, such as food and clothes. It's important for people to know where to find certain items, to know how to ask for help and where to go, and to know how to pay for the items at checkout upon completion of the purchases, including using a self checkout.


Try doing a ""practice run"" with your child at a store, in which you give him or her a certain amount of cash and have him or her try to shop for him/herself. Have him or her ask you, or a customer service representative, for help if he or she needs it. Once done, have your child talk to you about how the practice run went, and work on helping him or her improve on certain things for next time.

, One of the main responsibilities that comes with adulthood is doing the taxes. The tax deadline is usually on April 15th, and it is important to know how to get the taxes completed and ""turn them in"" on time. It is a long process with a lot of hard work, so have your children practice their taxes until they ""get the hang of it"".

, It may not seem like it, but having children is a lot of responsibility. If your child becomes a parent, he or she will need to know how to take care of his or her children. Tasks that come with having children include feeding them, finding clothes for them, finding a suitable school for them, and listening to them vent about their problems.


Have your child devise a plan for how they will take on the responsibility of having children; it's better to do so ahead of time. For example, you could have him or her write down how he or she plans to complete these tasks efficiently.
It is important for parents to know how to deal with children that are not very well-behaved, such as when they have a temper tantrum. Discuss the ways to respond to temper tantrums and bad behavior in a calm and mature way.

, This can be peaceful and fulfilling. When an adult lives by him/herself, he/she will not have to deal with his/her partner snoring or worry about fights, or deal with their children's constant whining and begging for ice cream, but there are certain risks to living by yourself as an adult.


For example, when an adult lives by him/herself, he or she may not be feeling well, so sick that he or she cannot take care of him or herself, and there's no one to help. Discuss with your child a plan for what he/she will do in this situation, such as having a friend visit the house temporarily help with this.
Talk with your child about how he or she will handle his or her feelings. Say that when your child is an adult living all by him/herself, he or she faces depression and is at a loss for what to do with no one to talk to about the situation. Ask your child to think about ways to handle this.
If your future adult decides to live with other people, cover how to deal with certain issues when they arise. For example, say your ""young woman"" lives with her boyfriend when your child is an adult, and the boyfriend begins to act immature and start a fight. Discuss with your child how to handle the situation maturely, including leaving the house for a little while until the girlfriend/a boyfriend calms down.

,


Most adults are working, and productivity is important in any job. It is important for adults to maintain a good, reliable work ethic in order to get their tasks done on time. For example, working adults could create a work schedule to balance between tasks if they have multiple things to do, with breaks in between. It's important to ""pace it out"" and spend a little time on a certain task (or more than one) every day.
Stress is also a major part of adult life. When an adult has a lot going on, he or she can become stressed at times. Teach your children relaxation skills that will benefit them as they progress to adulthood. Meditation is an important one; it may help to visualize a setting that you enjoy in order to relax. In addition, exercise can help cause stress to go away. Spending time in nature and swimming are two examples of exercises that have benefits on stressed people. Devise a plan with your child for how to handle stress.

, It's important for adults to know how to get a credit card and use it with financial responsibility. Make an important point to your child: The bank or business that issues your adult the card will have to check the credit history, so when your child is an adult and gets a credit card, he or she will have to use it responsibly.


A strong credit history is very essential, so it's best to start by making small purchases, since that can make it a lot smoother to make financial transactions in the future.

, Adulthood is all about maturity; if your child acts immature as an adult, people will think that he or she is still a child (or at least acts like it). Maturity includes not sweating the small stuff, letting go of what's outside your control, and accepting the times when you don't get your way. Practice this all with your child, and teach them how to respond maturely to certain situations such as when he or she receives an insult.

, Cover how to do this with your child. For example, when at work, someone may send your adult a rude, unprofessional email that is very upsetting. However, tell your child that sometimes, telling your coworkers what you actually feel may get you fired. Have him or her think about how he or she would respond to certain situations. For instance, he or she might reply to a rude, whiny email asking for a meeting with ""Thank you for your note. We can definitely schedule a meeting for (time)"".

Tell your child about the new baby.,
Have your child help set up the nursery.,
Buy them a “big sibling present.” To get them comfortable with the idea of being a big sibling, give your eldest child a “big brother” or “big sister” gift to celebrate their new role.,
Set up some bonding time with future babysitters.,
Read books about becoming a big brother or sister.",How to Prepare for a Second Child1," Set a moment aside to tell your first child that you are having another baby. Explain that it is going to be a wonderful time and that your child will have a sibling to play with or spend time with. Tell your child that your second baby will be so lucky to have a big brother or sister. You want to instill a sense of excitement, responsibility, and anticipation in your first child.

For instance, say something like, ""In a few months you are going to have a new sister or brother to play with! They are going to look up to you because you're going to be their big brother, and you're going to teach them lots of things."";
, Include your firstborn in the process of preparing for your second baby by getting their help with the nursery. Contributing to the setup of the nursery will let your child feel pride rather than jealousy over the baby’s quarters. Have your child help by:Asking for their input about color and decorations in the room (e.g. help choosing a mobile)
Having them paint or draw a picture that you will frame and hang in the room
Getting them to complete simple tasks like laying a blanket in the baby’s crib, setting up stuffed animals, or testing the mobile

, The gift should be something that marks their more grown-up position in the family, but also something that they will be excited to receive (e.g. a bicycle). Time giving the gift as closely as possible to the arrival of the baby to create a positive association., If you intend to have grandparents, other family members, friends, or babysitters help care for your firstborn after the birth of the second, allow for some bonding time beforehand. Invite them over for supper or along for other fun activities (e.g. visiting a zoo) to let your child feel more familiar with them. Set up brief excursions that you don’t attend. This will allow your child to get comfortable with being away from you, and with spending time with their future babysitters.For instance, have a prospective babysitter take your child out on a short trip for ice cream.

, To help your child understand what will be happening in the family, read books or stories geared towards their age group about becoming a big sibling. Making time to read with your child will both prepare them for their new role, and encourage bonding time with them. Visit your local library or book store to find books that your child will enjoy."

Have a routine for spending time with each child.,
Work on a sleep schedule.,
Stock up on quick and easy dinners.,
Keep necessary items nearby.,
Entertain your toddler while you feed.,
Choose your battles with chores.",How to Manage a Toddler While Caring for an Infant2," It can take a few weeks to get on a schedule with a new infant. Over time, work on finding a routine that works. Make sure to spend adequate time with your toddler each day so they don't get jealous of the new baby.No routine is perfect for everyone. Look for a routine that works for you and your children.

, If possible, get your infant and toddler to nap and sleep at the same time. If your kids are on the same sleep schedule, it will be easier for you to take advantage of alone time to catch up on chores or get some rest yourself. Try to put them both down for naps around the same time and get them ready for bed at the same time.

, If you cook, it's not necessary to prepare anything fancy when you have a newborn. In fact, it's better to keep things simple. When caring for a newborn and toddler, stock up on quick and easy meals. Look for things that can be boiled, steamed, or simply popped in the oven. Rely on the basics while adjusting to having a new infant.If you have time to cook one night, make double portions and freeze meals for later.
Look into services like Blue Apron, which sells meals that are pre-prepped and can be made quickly and conveniently at home.

, Stock supplies throughout your home so you're not left scrambling if your toddler or infant is in need. This way, if you need an item in a hurry, you know where it is. Keep things like diapers stored throughout your home. Leave boxes filled with your toddler's toys in various places in your house. You'll be able to hand your toddler a toy quickly if you need a few moments to tend to the infant.If you drive, it's a good idea to keep necessary items in the car as well. This will save you time getting everyone out the door in the morning.

, When feeding your infant, your toddler may sometimes want attention while the baby is eating. Your toddler may sometimes be occupied with their own toys and games. However, if your toddler wants attention, find something you can do while feeding the baby.Telling stories or singing songs can be done while you're breastfeeding or bottle feeding your baby. You can also read to your toddler if they're able to turn the pages while you read.
Games like ""I-Spy"" and ""Simon Says"" are easy to play when feeding your infant.
If your toddler is at all curious about the new baby, you can let them watch you breastfeed or bottle feed and explain the process.

, Your house may not be as clean as you want when you're juggling a toddler and infant. Learn to accept some mess. If dishes have to sit in the sink overnight, for example, let them so you can catch up on sleep.If it's within your budget, think about hiring a house cleaner for some days of the week."

Talk to your toddler about the new baby.,
Remember your own needs.,
Expect some emotional changes.",How to Manage a Toddler While Caring for an Infant3," Your toddler may be jealous or confused by a new infant. To manage their emotions, sit down and talk to them after a new baby is born. Make sure they understand the responsibilities of being a big sibling.Tell your toddler what they were like as a newborn. This will help them understand the baby is not that different from them.
Tell the older child how to help the baby. Let them know they can talk and sing to the baby.
Show them books, pictures, and videos about infants and young babies.

, It can be easy to neglect your own needs when juggling a toddler and an infant. However, it's important that you remember basic self care. When time permits, give yourself a small treat. Even something as simple as a haircut can recharge you when you're burnt out from childcare., Many people worry about bonding with their new baby if they already have a toddler. You may experience some stress, anxiety, and even sadness when keeping up with a toddler and infant. Accept that this is normal. Other people experience it and it will pass with time.If your sadness becomes debilitating, however, talk to a therapist to rule out postpartum depression.

"
"
Ask friends and family members for help.,
Try professional services.,
Look into churches and community centers.,
Accept help that's offered.",How to Manage a Toddler While Caring for an Infant4," Just after the baby's born, see if a friend or family member can offer you extra assistance. Simply having an extra hand around the house can be a huge help when you've just had an infant. A family member, like a parent, may actually be eager to spend time bonding with your kids.Approach someone directly and ask with gratitude. For example, ""I would really appreciate if you had any extra time to come over and help with the kids. I'm still adjusting to my new schedule.""

, Professional services can be helpful, if they're within your budget. Consider hiring someone part time to help out the kids or do some basic housework.You can always hire a high or college school student to help with the housework. Someone in school may not charge as much as professional services.

, Churches and community centers may offer help for parents with young children. See if they offer classes or even free or discounted daycare.If you are currently a member of a spiritual community, take advantage of any services offered.
See if there are any free or cheap childcare classes. Going to classes with other moms and children can help you learn tips and tricks about how to manage your time.

, Sometimes, it can be hard to accept help, even when you need it. However, everyone needs extra help from time to time. You do not need to feel like a burden for accepting help when in need.The person offering to help may get something out of helping you. They may genuinely enjoy being helpful and being around kids. Accepting help is not necessarily taking advantage of someone.
Remember times others have needed help. You have probably offered to help them as well. You likely did not feel resentful of the other person, or judge them for needing help. They probably do not feel this way about you either.

Wash your old baby clothes and sheets.,
Sterilize your firstborn’s bottles and pacifiers.,
Replace or sterilize baby toys.,
Test your baby monitor.,
Buy a new crib mattress.,
Check the expiration date of your car seat.",How to Prepare for a Second Child2," If you intend to reuse your firstborn’s baby clothes and sheets, wash them thoroughly, especially if they have been sitting in storage for a while. It is not necessary to use a detergent specified for babies, which can be purchased if your newborn demonstrates any signs of skin irritation. Use a liquid detergent as opposed to a powder one to avoid residue that might irritate your baby’s skin., To sterilize pacifiers and bottles, fill a pot with water, add the items, and bring the water to a boil. Allow it to boil for ten minutes, then let it cool. Remove the items and place them on clean paper towels to air dry.If any pacifiers or bottles appear cracked or stained after washing them, throw them out.

, While it might be tempting to reuse all of your firstborn's baby toys, it is best to buy new ones to prevent the spread of bacteria. Stuffed animals, which can usually only be spot-cleaned, may carry germs that could be harmful to your baby. Bath toys may have developed mold or mildew over time and should be replaced.Chew toys can be reused, but should first be sterilized along with the bottles and pacifiers.

, If you are going to reuse the baby monitor that you purchased for your first child, check the gadget to make sure it is still functional. Change the batteries if necessary, and have replacement batteries on hand for a quick switch the next time they run out. If the baby monitor doesn’t work and it is still under warranty, call the company to have it replaced., While your first baby's crib is likely still in good enough condition to use for your second child, it is best to purchase a new crib mattress. Wear and tear can reduce the quality of the mattress and hinder the comfort of your new baby. Opt for an organic mattress, as the synthetic material and off-gasses of non-organic models may be harmful for your baby., Car seats have a six year expiry date and should not be used past that point. If you wish to reuse your firstborn's car seat, check the date on the label and make sure that it is still safe to use. If not, replace it with a new car seat to make sure that it passes the minimum safety requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration."
"
Schedule regular doctor appointments.,
Join a parental support group.,
Prepare for postpartum emotions.,
Eat nutritious foods.,
Set reminders for your prenatal vitamins.",How to Prepare for a Second Child3," If you are preparing to have a second child, schedule regular doctor appointments to monitor your health. Your first pregnancy, as well as the demands of motherhood, may have drained you of strength and nutrients required for a successful second pregnancy. Your physician can prescribe medication or supplements, if needed, or recommend dietary changes to boost your health.Note that your second pregnancy will not necessarily be the same as your first. Your doctor should still screen for pregnancy-related illnesses (such as gestational diabetes), even if you did not experience them during your first pregnancy.

, Look for parental support groups in your area where you can meet and talk with other parents in similar situations. Parents with two or more children may be able to give you advice and insight about the process of bringing home a second child and adjusting to the new addition to the family. Look for online group listing or ask about support groups at your local community center, churches, daycares, or schools., After giving birth, many mothers experience the “baby blues,"" which are common and generally last a couple of weeks. Others suffer from postpartum depression, which is a serious and difficult condition that should be treated by a doctor. If you suffered from postpartum depression after the birth of your first baby, discuss your concerns and options with your doctor before delivering your second child. Addressing your emotional health preventively will help you stay conscious of it once your second child comes., While caring for a child it can be difficult to find the time to eat nutritiously. Aim to eat foods high in protein, dairy, fruit, vegetables, and whole grains for optimum energy. To make this easier, make healthy meals ahead of time that you can reheat quickly on the go, or buy pre-cut fruit and vegetables for simple snacks that you can share with your child. To get the nutrients that you need, opt for foods like:

Lean red meat
Yogurt
Whole grain bread
Cheese
Apples
Carrots

, Taking prenatal vitamins is an important way to boost your health while you are pregnant, but caring for a child can often distract from such things. Set a reminder alarm on your phone to make sure you don’t forget to take your vitamins every day. You can also put your vitamins into a pre-marked pill box to keep track of what you took on each day of the week."

Check the banjo.,
Hold the banjo upright.,
Thread the strap beneath the neck.,
Thread the other end under the tailpiece.,
Adjust as needed.,
Tie the ends together.",How to Put a Banjo Strap on1," If you want to use this method, you'll need to make sure that there is enough space in between the head tension bracket hooks to thread the strap completely through.


You can use this method for most bluegrass banjos, especially those with a one-piece flange, but open back banjos and beginner banjos may not have enough space and will require a different technique.;
, Position the banjo in your lap so that the neck faces straight up and the strings face toward you.


The neck of the banjo should represent the ""12 o'clock"" position of the instrument.

, Look at the hooks along the side of the banjo. Thread one end of your strap through the hook lying at the ""2 o'clock"" position of your banjo, then through the next three hooks along the side of the banjo, moving away from the neck.









The starting point will usually be two or three hooks down from the neck. When the strings face you, move to the right of the neck. When the strings face away from you, move to the left of the neck.The threading motion will be similar to the process of sliding a belt beneath belt loops on a pair of pants.
For most cradle straps, the ends are thinner than the primary body of the strap. Only slide the thin end beneath the hooks; do not use any of the thick strap.

, Position the other thin end of the strap beneath the hook at the ""4 o'clock"" position of your banjo. Slide it along the side channel, beneath all of the other hooks, until the two strap ends meet.









The initial hook will usually be the second or third hook to the right of the tailpiece (with the banjo strings facing you).
Alternatively, some prefer to thread the other end beneath the hook at the ""9 o'clock"" position. This spot will lie at the left side of the banjo when the strings face you. If you prefer the way the strap feels when in this position, you must still thread it beneath the other hooks along the side channel, moving away from the neck, until you meet the first end., Place the banjo strap over your neck and check the fit. Pull more strap through the side channel hooks if you need to tighten it.









Ideally, the banjo strap alone should be able to hold the banjo in the playing position even when you don't have your hands on the banjo.

, Locate the eyelet holes in both strap ends. Thread the black laces of the cradle strap through the eyelet holes of both ends, then tie the black laces together to keep the strap secure.









If your cradle strap did not come with black laces, you should be able to use standard black shoelaces, thin paracord, or thick and durable string to lace and tie the strap in place.
This completes the process. You should now be able to wear the banjo strap and play the instrument.

"
"
Check the banjo.,
Hold the banjo upright.,
Attach one end of the strap beside the neck.,
Attach the other end of the strap near the tailpiece.,
Adjust as needed.",How to Put a Banjo Strap on2," This method is your best option when there is very little space in between the head tension bracket hooks on your banjo. If you cannot fit the cradle strap through these hooks, you will need to use this option to attach the strap.


Most beginner and open back banjos require the use of this technique. Other professional bluegrass banjos can typically use the standard cradle strap technique.

, Stand the banjo in your lap or on a working surface. The neck should stand straight up, in the ""12 o'clock"" position of the banjo.


The strings of the instrument should face you.
Note that you can alter this position to something more natural or comfortable once you familiarize yourself with the correct placement of the strap. While learning, though, it helps to hold the banjo like this.

, Tie one end of the strap onto the second or third hook next to the neck of the banjo.








With the banjo strings facing you, count two to three hooks to the right of the neck.
Consider investing in a strap with leather tabs attached to either end. You may also find straps that have metal or plastic hooks on either end, but use these carefully, since the strap hooks can damage the wood of the banjo.Snap or hook the end of the strap over the appropriate hook of the banjo. If you do not have a modified strap, you can tie the end of the strap around the hook of the banjo using sturdy laces, paracord, or string.

, Tie the other end of the strap to the second or third hook away from the tailpiece.









With the strings facing you, count to to three hooks to the right of the tailpiece. Note that both ends of the strap should be on the same side of the banjo when you divide the banjo in half vertically.
Snap, hook, or tie this end of the strap to the appropriate hook of the banjo, using the same method of attachment used for the first end of the strap.

, Place the banjo strap over your shoulder and behind your neck. If the strap is adjustable, adjust it to fit so that the banjo hangs in its natural playing position without being held.









Completing this step should complete the process, and your banjo should now be ready to play.

Learn about the different attachment styles.,
Read and respond to your baby’s cues.,
Hold and touch your baby.,
Interact warmly with your baby.,
Make eye contact.,
Recognize when your baby is overstimulated.,
Don’t worry about being perfect.",How to Raise a Securely Attached Child1," There are four main attachment styles and learning about these may help you to bond with your baby. You can also consider your own traits and upbringing to determine your own attachment style. The main attachment styles are:Secure
Ambivalent
Avoidant
Disorganized;
, Teach your baby that they can trust you to take care of them by learning to interpret their signals. Pay attention to how they act when they are hungry, tired, and wet. When they need something, respond as quickly as you can.It may take you a few weeks to start understanding your baby’s cries and other cues. Keep trying, and trust yourself to get it eventually.

, Babies need lots of physical contact for healthy development. Hold your baby as often as you can, and ask other people, such as your partner or a relative, to hold them when you can’t. Consider buying a sling or another type of carrier so you can keep your baby with you all the time., Smile at your baby, sing to them, and play with them often. If your baby makes noises to get your attention, respond by cooing back at them. Positive interactions tell your baby that they are important to you, which will make them feel safe and valued.Even small babies can sense when you’re impatient or unhappy, so do your best to stay warm and positive when you interact with your little one.
Also keep in mind that a lack of interaction can have negative consequences. Make sure that you do not let your baby cry for too long without holding them and providing comfort., Eye contact helps you and your baby bond. Encourage your baby to look at your face, and let them look away before you do. Smile and talk to your baby while you are making eye contact.Don’t try to force your baby to make eye contact. Looking at a person’s face can be intense for a baby, and they may not be able to do it for very long.

, You don’t need to interact with your baby all the time. Infants’ nervous systems aren’t fully developed, so they can’t always handle a great deal of stimulation. If your baby acts cranky or doesn’t want to engage, they might need a break., No parent is able to know exactly what their baby wants all the time. It’s okay if you occasionally interpret your baby’s cries wrong or can’t pick them up immediately. If you do your best and keep trying to understand them, it won’t damage their attachment to you."
"
Be physically and emotionally available for your child.,
Spend time with your child.,
Pay attention to your child’s personality.,
Praise your child when they do good things.,
Avoid threatening to abandon your child.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Raise a Securely Attached Child2," If your child wants to tell you something, listen to them, even if they’re not telling you anything objectively important. Take the time to comfort them if they are sad or hurt. Talk openly about feelings with your child, and share your own emotions with them.Doing this will teach them that feeling their emotions is normal and it will also validate them as a person.


You might say, ""I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything. I'm always here for you."" You must be willing to follow through on this, however. Carve out time to talk to your child on a regular basis.

, Make it a priority to talk and play with your child regularly. Read to them, take them to the playground, or ask them to show you their favorite toys. Show your child that you’re interested in them by letting them lead the interaction and giving them your full attention.If your schedule is packed, schedule playtime just like your other important commitments.
Turn off your phone and the TV before you spend time with your child. Electronic distractions can make it harder for you to connect with each other.

, No two kids are alike, even at an early age. Tailor your interactions with your child towards their unique personality and needs. By accepting your child on their own terms, you give them the message that you’ll love and care for them no matter what.For instance, if your child is timid, encourage them to try new things and reassure them when they are nervous. Don’t criticize them for their shyness or set restrictive rules that will make them feel even more fearful. Criticizing will only reduce your child’s self-esteem. Avoid criticism as a tool of ""tough love.""

, It is important to let your child know that you notice when they do well. Be sure to praise your child for their good actions and let them know that you are proud of them.


For example, if your child gets a good grade on a test, be sure to tell them they did a good job and that you are proud of them.

, No matter how frustrated you are, never tell your child that you don’t want them or that you’re going to leave them. Saying something like this can do long-term damage to a child’s trust in you, as well as their sense of self-worth.If your feelings are about to get the better of you, step away and take a deep breath before you return. It’s better to postpone dealing with a problem than to say something you’ll regret.

, It’s hard to recognize and meet your kids’ needs when you’re sleep-deprived and stressed. Keep yourself healthy and sane by eating well, getting some exercise, sleeping at least seven hours every night, and sneaking in personal time on a regular basis.Don’t be afraid to reach out for help, especially when your kids are very young. Ask your partner to help out with household chores more, or see if a friend will watch your toddler for an hour so you can have some downtime.
If you’re struggling with depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition, seek treatment right away. Children are very perceptive, and they may think it’s their fault when your mood is “off.”
Avoid allowing yourself to become agitated. This is usually a sign that you need to take care of yourself.

"
"
Behave in a predictable way.,
Create household rules and expectations.,
Set appropriate limits.,
Use positive discipline.",How to Raise a Securely Attached Child3," Build your child’s trust in you by letting them know what you will be doing and when. Create everyday routines, so that your child knows what to expect in various situations.For instance, you could create one routine for saying goodbye when you leave for work, and another for greeting your child when you come back.

, Make sure your child knows what is expected of them at home. Establish a regular schedule so that your child can anticipate what will happen over the course of a day.Some parents use a picture schedule that shows children the activities of the day like bathing, dressing, cleaning their room, and eating meals.

, As your child gets older, give them more autonomy to explore their world. Encourage your child to try new things while setting limits that keep them safe.For instance, you might let your three-year-old play outside with a friend independently, but keep an eye on them from a distance to make sure they’re all right.
Don’t try to keep your toddler with you all the time. Independence and confidence are signs that your child has a healthy attachment style.

, When you need to discipline your child, be firm but empathetic. Respect your child’s dignity, and give them a chance to correct their own behavior. If your child is calm enough, talk the issue through and ask them to help you find a solution.Don’t be unnecessarily harsh with your child, but don’t shy away from disciplining them when it’s necessary. Overly permissive parenting can actually damage your child’s attachment to you.
Don’t use criticism as a form of discipline.
Emphasize to your child that you will always love and care for them, even when they misbehave.

Give your child a chance to love.",How to Parent Effectively," Children learn a great deal about how to act by watching their parents. Children, especially young ones, think their parents are more or less infallible. They see their parents as being supremely intelligent and powerful - basically incapable of making bad decisions. Do your best to live up to this idealized image. Before you lash out or blow your top in front of your child, think about the example you're setting. Embody the traits you wish to cultivate in your child: respect, friendliness, honesty, kindness, tolerance, and many more. Do things for other people without expecting a reward. Above all, treat your children the way you expect other people to treat you.


Children also look for role models at school, among their friends, and in the media. Some of these things you can control, others, you cannot. Know that, though your child may have multiple role models, you have a unique privilege in that you are a near-constant presence in his or her life. Make the most of this privilege.;
, When you have a child, the most important duty you have is ensuring his or her physical well-being - feeding, clothing, and housing him or her well. This and countless other responsibilities require you to spend time working so that you're able to provide for your child. However, once these necessities are assured, it's very important to invest your remaining time in your children themselves. Never lose sight of the fact that, in the balancing act between your family and your work, your family should always come first.


With so many demands on your time, it's often difficult for parents and children to get together for a family meal, let alone spend some quality time together. Children who are not getting the attention they want from their parents can act out or misbehave because, to them, negative attention is better than no attention at all. Many parents find it mutually rewarding to pre-schedule time with their child on a regular basis. Create a ""special night"" each week to be together and let your child help decide how you will spend your time.
Look for other ways to connect with your child, even when you can't be present - put a note or something special in his or her lunch box, for instance.

, Though your children should obey you, you can't expect them to do everything you demand simply because you, as a parent, ""say so."" Children want and deserve explanations as much as adults do. Parents who (at the very least) attempt to calmly reason with their children give them a chance to see why certain rules and restrictions are good for them. Make your expectations clear. If there is a problem, describe it to your child, express your feelings about it, and invite your child to discuss solutions with you. Be sure your child understands the consequences of his or her actions.


It bears mentioning that, even in the best cases, from time to time, your child will flat-out disagree with you about certain rules and decisions. Don't back down - you have an obligation to explain and discuss your rules, but not to acquiesce.

, If you frequently feel ""let down"" by your child's behavior, honestly assess your expectations. Are you expecting reasonable things from your child? Is your child capable of doing these things? Conversely, is your child more capable than you expect him or her to be - in other words, is s/he not being challenged? Don't be afraid to change your parenting goals, provided you keep your values consistent and sensitively explain your motives to your child.


As your child ages, s/he changes. Over time, you will have to change your parenting style - sometimes gradually, sometimes abruptly. Be ready and willing to face this change - just because your child isn't always a cute little baby doesn't mean s/he is less deserving of love and respect.

, Let's face it - we are all imperfect parents. We have strengths and weaknesses as family leaders. This is OK. Rather than agonizing over your shortcomings, recognize your abilities and vow to work on your weaknesses. Try to have realistic expectations for yourself, your spouse, and your children. You don't always have to have all the answers - be forgiving of yourself and your child will learn to forgive, too.


Try to make parenting a manageable job. Focus on the areas that need the most attention rather than trying to address everything all at once. Recognize when you're burned out. Hire a babysitter and take time out from parenting to do things that will ensure your happiness as a person (or as a couple). Focusing on your needs does not make you selfish. It simply means that you care about your own well-being, which is another important value to model for your children.

, If you have more than one child, as they grow, their needs and abilities will naturally diverge. Older children will be more independent and need less supervision, while younger children will need extra help and supervision. This is natural. Still, make an effort to spread your affection evenly among your children. Even if, for instance, you find that your younger children take up most of your time and attention, try to periodically let your older children know that you love and appreciate them just as much.


Never arbitrarily give one child more gifts, affection, or punishments than another. Children will pick up on your prejudices very quickly and may grow to resent you, or, worse, the ""favorite"" child.

, As an effective parent, you are responsible for guiding your child with a loving, corrective influence. Just as you are imperfect, so is your child. How you acknowledge this imperfection and express your corrective guidance makes all the difference in the world. When you have to confront your child about a mistake, avoid excessive blaming, criticizing, or fault-finding, which undermine self-esteem and can lead to resentment. Instead, strive to nurture and encourage, even when you are disciplining your child. Use every mistake as an opportunity to teach your child something new. Make sure he or she knows that, although you want and expect better, your love is available no matter what.

, Discipline is necessary in every household. The goal of discipline is to help children gain a sense of respect for others and self-control. Establishing house rules will help children understand your expectations and develop self-control. You may want to have a system in place: one warning, followed by consequences such as a ""time out"" or loss of privileges. Use these rules to punish bad behavior and encourage good behavior.


Be fair, but consistent. Don't cave to your children just because they're cute or throwing a fit. Doing so teaches them that they can misbehave without consequences. In fact, it's important to make sure to punish children when they make a scene, simply to demonstrate that it won't get them what they want.

, Parenting isn't just about pointing out the mistakes your child makes - it's just as much about lauding his or her triumphs. Have you ever stopped to think about how many times you react negatively to your child in a given day? For many, it's far too much. Make a point of finding something to praise every day - even something small. Be generous with rewards, but don't spoil your child - your love, hugs, and compliments can work wonders and are often reward enough. With positive reinforcement, you will soon find more of the behavior you would like to see.

, Eventually, your child will have to make the transition to living away from you. This transition is far, far easier for the child if s/he has some idea of how to work. It's absolutely essential to ensure children learn how to apply themselves. From grade school to college to the working world, success depends on being able to tackle ambitious problems with a sense of self-duty. By providing your child with this early on, you do him or her a great service in the long run.


Basically, you need to help your child learn that, to get the things they want, they need to put in effort. For instance, to get an allowance, s/he needs to complete chores, to get a new toy, s/he needs to do well at school, and so on.

, It's easy to forget that children have virtually no experience to draw on. They're doing everything in their life for the very first time. You, however, have years and years of experience to draw on. When your children are unsure of what to do, whether they're dealing with their first crush or applying to college, be there for them as a mentor and as a resource. Give your child the help s/he needs to make life's difficult decisions.


However, never do hard things for your child. Children must learn the value of perseverance, which is nearly impossible for them to do if their parent is willing to, for instance, do their homework for them.

, From time to time, even the best-behaved children will act out and require discipline. When the time comes to discipline your child, talk with your husband, wife, or partner before you make any major decisions. Decide on a fair, fitting punishment together. Then, and this is crucial, – be sure to agree that you will both enforce the punishment equally. If one of you is ""softer"" than the other when it comes to punishments, your child will quickly learn to exploit this knowledge.


If you are a single parent, you'll be the sole source of authority for your child, so it's extra import to be consistent with your rules and punishments. Stick with the punishments you set, and never let your child see you as a pushover.

, You can love, encourage, and praise your child to your heart's content, but, as its name suggests, true self esteem comes from within. For self esteem to develop, a child needs to earn his or her own respect. S/he needs to feel that s/he's good at certain things - be it sports, academics, music, theater, or anything else - and that this skill came from within, through talent and practice. To this end, try to give your child the opportunity to excel in his or her talents. If s/he has a talent for music, help purchase an instrument, for example. If s/he is good at sports, let him or her try out for whatever teams they want. Every child deserves the chance to be good at something.

, Your words and actions as a parent affect your child's developing self-esteem more than anything else. Praising your child's accomplishments, however small, will make him or her feel proud; letting your child do things independently will make him or her feel capable and strong. By contrast, making belittling comments or comparing your child unfavorably with another will make him or her feel worthless. Use your words and actions to teach your child that proper behavior and achievement are sources of good, positive feelings.

, When it comes to your child's self esteem, actions speak louder than words. Make sure that your actions reflect your loving views toward your child. For example, if you praise your child for his or her courage in taking on a lead role in the school play, but then don't even make an effort to actually see the play, you've shown that you don't value your child as much as you say you do. Parenting is just as much about loving your child as it is about demonstrating that love. This doesn't have to mean giving extravagant gifts - simple gestures are better than the most expensive toys.


Adults are busy people. From time to time, it's inevitable that you'll miss one of your child's concerts, recitals, games, plays, etc. As long as you express your sincere regret to your child and put in a genuine effort to make it next time, you're still demonstrating your love for your child.

, French author George Sand (real name Lucille Aurore Dupin) famously said, ""There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved."" The instructions above have focused mainly on how to love your child. Children are capable of expressing their affection from a young age - welcome and cherish this affection. As time goes on and your child grows, however, be sure to let the love between you deepen. Mostly, this depends on your being present in your child's life and being emotionally available to him or her. If you make sure to spend time with your child and communicate openly with him or her, your child's love for you will naturally mature. S/he will learn to support you when you're feeling down and to give your love back when you need it. Parenting a child is the most serious investment you'll ever make, but, because of your child's ability to love, it's also the most rewarding.

You should get documentation that will show a judge your reason why you can’t pay. Begin by identifying the reason you don’t have a job or why you don’t make enough to pay child support:


medical illness
disability
layoff
imprisonment
other reason;
, If you have been sick or have become disabled, you need proof. You should get all relevant medical records from your doctor.If you have applied for disability, then find a copy of your application. You can submit these documents to the judge.

, People who have been laid off should find the copy of their termination notice. You can submit this to the judge as proof that you have lost your job. If you’ve only had a reduction in hours, then you should get a copy of whatever notice you received, whether it is a letter, bulletin, email, etc.


If you don’t have paper documentation, then you might be able to get an affidavit from your employer explaining that your hours have been cut. An affidavit is a written statement someone signs in front of a notary public., If you’ve been imprisoned, then find copies of the judgement against you. You should contact your lawyer, if necessary. Because you are in prison, you will probably need the help of family and friends or your lawyer to get the necessary paperwork.

, You need to prove to the judge a significant change in circumstances.You must meet this legal standard in order to modify your child support. Whatever your reasons for needing a modification, you should find documents that you can show the judge.


The worst thing is to go into court with nothing but your own testimony. Judges have seen a lot of people come through their courtrooms with a hard luck story trying to get a reduction in child support. You will appear more believable if you have paper documentation.

, If you lost your job but can still work (e.g., you aren’t disabled), then you should be actively seeking a new job.Keep detailed notes of all the jobs you have applied to, including the dates, and whether you have received an interview.


Hold onto any rejection letters or other communications from the employers you have contacted.

, Many states have a formula they use to determine whether a change is sufficiently substantial to warrant a child support modification. For example, in Florida, the change must result in a $50 change to the child support award or a 15% change, whichever is greater.For example, if you pay $200 a week in child support, then you can only seek modification if you could lower your child support to $150 a week.
You should use your state’s child support calculator to determine whether the change in your income is sufficient.If you need help analyzing your situation, then you should contact a qualified family law attorney for a consultation.

, You have to continue to make child support payments until the judge agrees to modify your child support. Only the judge can change the amount.If you stop paying, then your back payments will be called “arrears,” and you may accrue interest on the unpaid amount.


Try to borrow money from friends or family, if you have to.
However, you probably shouldn’t put the payments on a credit card unless you have a very low interest rate. The interest rate for unpaid child support in most states is 10% or less.Most credit cards charge more in annual interest.

, You can always reach an agreement to modify your child support on your own. You should call up the other parent and explain your situation. This might not be easy—especially if you think the other parent won’t agree to the change. Nevertheless, you should ask.If the other parent agrees, you can write up a stipulation and submit it to the judge for approval. You should explain what the new payment amount will be and how long it will last. Your court should have a printed form you can use.For example, if you are in jail for a year, then you can agree to reduce or suspend payments for a year but then start again as soon as you get released.

, The other parent might not agree to a modification. In that situation, you’ll need to draft a different motion and ask the judge to reduce your child support payments. The court may have a printed, fillable form you can use. Stop in and ask the court clerk.

, In order to ask for a modification, you typically must complete the same detailed financial forms that you completed before the judge set your original child support order. You should ask the court clerk to make sure you have everything. In order to complete this form, you will probably need the following information:gross income from all sources
itemized deductions from your gross income
other deductions from salary or wages
weekly expenses, such as rent, utilities, food, insurance, and transportation costs
lawyer fees (if any)
value of your real estate
value of your motor vehicles
value of any insurance policies, such as life insurance
amount in your savings, checking accounts, and money market accounts
debts

, Once you’ve finished the motion and related forms, you should make several copies. Take the copies and the original to the court which issued the original child support order.Ask the court clerk to file. The clerk can stamp your copies with the filing date.


You may have to pay a filing fee. If you can’t afford the fee, then ask the clerk for a fee waiver form., You need to send the other parent a copy of your motion, along with a “summons,” which you can get from the court clerk. Since you can’t serve notice yourself, be sure to have someone arrange service on the parent.


For example, you can have someone 18 or older who isn’t part of the lawsuit hand deliver the motion on the other parent.
In some states you can have the sheriff or constable make delivery., You also need to get a hearing date from the court clerk.Each court handles this process a little differently. In some courts, you will schedule the hearing when you file your motion. You will also have to tell the other parent of the day and time.


However, in other courts, the court clerk will schedule a hearing at a later date and notify everyone.

, You want to look clean and neat. Make sure your clothes are freshly laundered and pressed. However, you should avoid looking too good. You want to convince the judge that you don’t have a lot of money to pay your child support.


You should avoid wearing jewelry, for example, since a judge might wonder why you didn’t pawn your jewelry to make your payments.

, As the person bringing the motion, you will go first. Remember that you need to convince the judge that there has been a substantial change in your circumstances.It’s probably not enough that you find paying child support burdensome. You should prepare by doing the following:


Provide a short summary of what has changed in your life. Keep it to a few sentences. You won’t have a lot of time to talk to the judge.
Write out your strongest three arguments for why child support should be modified.
Organize your documentation. For example, if you have become disabled, then put your medical records first, then any proof of qualifying for disability payments second. This is a logical, chronological order.

, On your hearing date, the clerk will call your name and you and the other parent will move to the front of the court room. Be sure to speak clearly and slowly so that the judge can hear you.

, The judge might ask you questions. You shouldn’t interrupt the judge but let them speak. When answering, remember to get to the point and try to answer the judge’s question directly.


Always remember to call the judge “Your Honor.”, The other parent also gets to argue why the child support should not be modified. You must stand quietly and listen. Don’t interrupt and don’t raise your hand as if asking to speak. You will have a chance to respond.When the other parent stops talking, ask the judge, “Your Honor, can I respond to that?”

, At the end of the hearing, the judge should make a decision on your motion. If you win, then the judge should enter a new order stating what your new child support obligation will be.

Plan individual time with each child.,
Don’t allow interruptions during your time with your child.,
Don’t be ‘fair’.,
Set punishments based on the child.,
Be cautious.",How to Parent Children with Opposite Personalities1," One of the most important steps in parenting your opposite children is to plan time individually with them. Since they are different, they might have little in common and not enjoy the same music, movies, or activities. You can spend time with each child exploring their interests and building your parental bond with them apart from their sibling. Some things you can do together include:Going to dinner together and allowing them to pick the restaurant
Taking them shopping or to see a film of their choice
Exploring their individual interests like horseback riding, comic books or video games
Spending time assisting them with their homework or school projects.;
, When you are spending time with your children, it is important that they feel valued. Don’t get on your phone or on social media during this time. Don’t allow your other children to interrupt either, unless it is an emergency., Remember that different children have different needs. Rather than setting out to spend the exact same amount of time with each child per week, think about what your child needs from you. One of your children might be very independent and need only minimal attention, while the other might be more dramatic and require more. Think about what your child needs and give them that rather than developing a one size fits all model of time and affection.Perhaps you have one child who responds well to physical touch and affection and another who prefers to have their space. Respect and attend to both children based on their personalities.
Have a conversation with your child about their needs. Check in with them regularly to make sure they’re okay.

, Just as your children will need varying amounts of affection and time, they will also need punishments that are tailored to them. For instance, grounding a child who is extroverted and who has a lot of friends will be much more impactful than grounding a child who is an introvert and a loner. Determine what punishments will be most effective based on your child and implement those.


Timeouts and revoking phone privileges tend to work on children of all personality types, however.
Other potential punishments could include an increase in chores or community service. These types of punishments can work for all types of children.

, Setting different rules for your children and treating them differently can lead to resentment. One sibling may feel excluded if you hold different standards for your children. Keep this in mind as you consider how to parent your children.

"
"
Don’t consider one behavior as better than the other.,
Praise them for their unique traits and accomplishments.,
Don’t overemphasize their differences.,
Don’t compare them.,
Enforce standards of respect.",How to Parent Children with Opposite Personalities2," Perhaps you and one of your children seem to get along a lot better than you and another one. You might have a child who is reserved and studious, and another more outspoken one who you butt heads with. Rather than praising your child for being reserved and encouraging their sibling to follow suit, reflect on the benefits of both personality types. For instance, your outspoken child is more likely to be social, extroverted, and steadfast in their beliefs and less likely to be treated unfairly by others., In order to respect your children’s differences, praise them for their uniqueness. Perhaps you have a child who is very messy but also very creative and artistic. Praise them for the art they create and hang some up in your house. If your other child keeps a very neat space or makes good grades, praise them for that as well.Keep in mind that it is important to look for commonalities as well. Praise each of your child’s unique abilities, but also be mindful that differentiating them too much may lead to resentments.

, Though you certainly recognize the ways that your children are different, don’t overemphasize them. Focus on your children’s individual characteristics and parent them based on those. Avoid saying things like “these two are complete opposites!” in front of your children., Making comparisons between your children is a good way to pit them against each other and to instill bitterness in them for you. Focus on their strengths and try to avoid chastising them in front of their sibling. Also don’t compare them to others, or in front of others.You can however make comparisons if you are drawing upon similarities of the two. For instance, perhaps they both keep neat rooms. You can comment on the mutual cleanliness of their spaces.

, Make sure that you and your children are being respectful in the home. Though your children may be different, don’t allow name calling. Maintain respect of your spouse in the home, and also model good behavior to them."
"
Help them compromise.,
Remind them of the importance of their relationship.,
Give them enough personal space.,
Teach them basic problem solving skills.,
Encourage them to spend time together.",How to Parent Children with Opposite Personalities3," Perhaps one of your children wants to watch one movie and your other child wants to see another. See if they can work together to come up with a movie that they both want to see. If not, allow one to see the movie they want and the other to pick the following week.Teaching your children how to compromise will be very useful to them later in life. It is an important life skill.

, The sibling relationship is one of the most important relationships that they will ever have. They are the only other people who have you as a parent and have the same upbringing. Long after you are gone, they will only have each other to remember their childhood and you as a parent. Remind them of this and encourage them to spend time together, bond, and get along. Having regular family time can be a good way to go about this. Go on family outings, camping trips, and visit theme parks. This will ensure time to create lasting memories and bonding experiences.

, In order to further affirm their individuality, give them their space. If possible, give them their own rooms. If not, then help them to establish boundaries in their room so that they can both enjoy and decorate their spaces., As siblings, it will be important for them to employ conflict resolution skills like taking turns, sharing, and communication. Step in when necessary to help them use these skills and then rely on them to continue their use later.Perhaps, though your children have differing personalities, they don’t fight often. This is great, but you can still teach them these valuable skills.

, Though your children are different, they likely still have some similarities that they can draw upon to create fun memories and experiences together. Give them a monthly budget to use to do activities or go to events together. Encourage them to choose things that they both enjoy rather than taking turns deciding.


Avoid forcing your children to spend time together. They may not want to spend too much time together due to differences.

Prepare the bath with lots to do.,
Look at household items.,
Cut down on bubble baths.,
Try fun ways in washing hair.",How to Maximize Time in the Tub," Make the area like a playground instead of a war battlefield. Get bath finger paint to draw in the water or bath crayons to draw on the walls. For older kids, invest in cheap tablets which transform into small sponges of different shapes, animals, or objects. These tablets aren't safe for babies, for choking hazards and the sponges rip easily.;
, You don't have to invest in a great amount of things to get your little one in the mood for baths. Search for plastic bottles and Tupperware - but know that you may be drenched yourself, so wear comfortable clothes during bath time.

, Try to avoid scented products as much as possible. Like adults, chemicals, scents, and dyes can contribute to irritation, which can lead to UTIs (urinary tract infections).

, Shampoo and water drizzling down into the eyes drives kids nuts and makes bath time stressful. Put a poster of their favorite character on the ceiling of the bathtub and tell them to look up and wave ""Hi"" to them. You can also invest in a foam visor to keep water out of their eyes.

"
Teach your child how to be a good host.,
Put away the toys your child doesn’t want to share.,
Talk to your child about being a good guest.",How to Plan Your Child's First Playdate1," Your child will likely not understand the concepts of good hosting unless you teach them. Explain that good hosting helps guests feel welcome. Playdates are more fun when everyone feels like they are wanted there.


Good hosting begins with greeting the guest at the door. It also involves sharing toys, food, and drinks, and including the guest in all activities. It may also mean not doing what your child wants to do, but doing what the guest wants, instead.;
, Children often have one or two items they don’t want others to play with. Put those toys in hiding to prevent any fights or hurt feelings at the playdate. The guest won’t be tempted to play with them if they aren’t in sight.


Have a talk with your child a few hours before the playdate to give them time to think about what they don’t want to share. This gives them a chance to decide what they really want to keep to themselves. Also, explain that these toys should be kept away. Tell your child they are fair game if they bring them out and that the guest will be allowed to play with them., Teach your child to be a properly-behaved guest before you drop them off at a playdate. This includes saying “please” and “thank you,” listening to the parent, and helping with cleanup. They should also understand that it is their friend’s home, so there may be different rules than at yours.


Talk to the parent after the date to get feedback on how it went. Consult with your child about the other parent’s concerns before the next date occurs to possibly prevent any issues from popping up next time."
"
Select an appropriate time for the date.,
Be selective about guests.,
Choose the right amount of guests.,
Decide on the activities ahead of time.,
Get the scoop on any food allergies.,
Make a plan for any incidents.",How to Plan Your Child's First Playdate2," When planning the playdate, choose a time of day when your child is normally energetic. You should also determine how long you want the playdate to last. Playdates that are too long or too short leave everyone upset and grumpy. Tell the parent the pickup time when they drop off their child.


Two hours is an ideal amount of time for a playdate. This is just enough time to have a lot of fun without the children getting tired of each other.Ask the other parent about their child's schedule as well. Try to find a time that works best for you, your child, and their friend.

, In order to establish a good pattern for playdates, you want to be sure you extend invitations to the right kid(s). Choose someone your child is fond of and with whom they have been known to play nicely.


Avoid aggressive children or those who tend to cause a stir on the playground. You want the playdate to go as smoothly as possible, so choose a child that best suits your own child's play preferences and temperament.

, A successful playdate is all about the guests, including how many there are. One guest is great, but two is a recipe for disaster. One person will likely feel left out.


If possible, try to keep younger siblings away from the playdate. Allow your older child to play with their friends instead of also having to entertain their brother or sister. Occupy your younger child or schedule their own playdate., Plan out the activities you choose to include in the playdate ahead of time. Make sure they are age-appropriate. Planning ahead of time allows you to set up before they get there so you don’t take up time during the date.


Inform the parents ahead of time of your planned activities so they can dress their child appropriately. Don’t forget that meeting at a playground or park is also an option if you want to spend time outside and don’t want to deal with cleanup. , Ask about food allergies, sensitivities, and dislikes before the date. Doing so can prevent any medical problems or fussy eating during the playdate.


If possible, inform the parent of your planned menu before the playdate. Try not to take offense if they disagree with your plans. They may have strict dietary guidelines for their children or they may not want them to have something they normally wouldn’t. , When you have extra children in your household, you have to be proactive about fights, meltdowns, illnesses/injuries, and even potty accidents. Talk to the parents ahead of time to find out about each child's quirks and temperaments. Have a plan in place to take kids to an urgent care center for illness/injury and/or contact parents in the event of a fight or meltdown.


Ask parents to bring extra underwear if a kid has a history of bathroom incidents.

"
"
Invite the parents to stay.,
Be on time.,
Monitor, but from a distance.,
Gather your guest’s belongings ahead of time.",How to Plan Your Child's First Playdate3," Extend an invitation to the parents to stay for the date, particularly if it is the first time their child has come over. It may put them at ease and opens the door for you to stay at their home if your child goes over there for a date. In addition, it may help their child feel safer and less shy.


Offer a tour of your home if you aren’t prepared to spend some one-on-one time with the parent. This tour may be used in lieu of having your own playdate. This may be acceptable for the parent, or they may be adamant about staying. It’s best to be prepared for either option., Always be mindful of the time when picking your child up from their first playdate. Coming late is disrespectful and may ensure your child isn’t invited over again. Stay in the area or leave extra early if you have a habit of being less than punctual.


Offer to drive the child home from your playdate if a parent is often late picking their child up. This prevents you from having to wait around on them and making you late for other activities you may have planned that day., There’s almost nothing worse than a parent who hovers during a playdate. However, it is still your job to manage the children. Intervene if you notice any disagreements or unsavory behavior.


Jump in by offering a snack if things start to go downhill. This provides a break for the kids and fills their tummies. Chances are they will get along again when snack time is over., Don’t wait until the parent comes for pick up to find all your guest’s gear. Get it together before it’s time to go home. This allows for a smoother transition when it’s time for the date to end.


Have the kids play outside while waiting for the parent to come. Being outside already may prevent any meltdowns over the date ending, as they are already outside and will just simply have to walk to the vehicle."
"
Make a list of your child's most needed items first.,
Pick a suitable area in the car for the underseat drawer.,
Realize that you'll want to keep this emergency kit in the car.,
Tailor the underseat area to suit the season first.,
Tailor the drawer to suit the time of day when the most travel will be done.,
Tailor the drawer to suit the child's age.,
Find a suitable container for your kit.,
Beware of supplies that expire.,
Stock only small amounts of things you'll need.,
Look for quick cleanup options.,
Pack any other accessories you might need.,
Gather all the necessary items now on your emergency kit list.,
Find the largest items, such as pants or jackets.,
Order your items roughly from largest to smallest.,
Grab the diaper back or backpack.,
Start packing your bag.,
Look for the most convenient places in the bag to store appropriate items.,
Purchase and put into the bag a hanging car freshener.,
Close up the bag or backpack with the zipper or fastening.

,
Attach the pacifiers, using their clips, to the diaper bag straps.,
Stash the bag or backpack into the drawer in your car.",How to Pack a Car's Underseat Drawer for an Infant or Toddler Child's Emergency Needs," These items will change over time, and they may depend on the season, too. Make sure to include a diaper or two, a small unopened package of baby wipes, some burp cloths, a pacifier or two (with an attached pacifier holder), baby bibs, diaper rash cream, diaper pins (if cloth-diapering), changing mats, a first aid kit, a bottle warmer (if needed), and 1-2 extra shirts, pants and socks.


The list of things may grow over time. As you shop for baby items, think about what you could place in the bin that won't go bad in six months. Remember, this drawer is for emergencies only.;
, Make it easy to reach, so that you can grab items from the drawer easily when you need them. Make sure the drawer isn't in the driver's way; most often, these drawers can be located underneath the passenger seat of the car or in back of the driver's side. Look for seatback pockets (if available); they can sometimes carry some of these necessary items. If nothing fits as to an emergency underseat drawer, you can pack a secondary ""emergencies only"" diaper bag or backpack with the necessary items.


Avoid keeping these supplies in the trunk. Items stored there will be too hard to reach in an emergency.

, The idea of this pack is that you won't take it in and out of the house like your regular diaper bag. All these emergency items should remain in the vehicle, so don't plan to include items that you need inside regularly.

, Is this summer or is this winter? Clothing can be a major consideration here for what will fit and what you will need. Will you need a pair of shorts, or will you need a pair of two of thermals? Is it so cold that you need to bring a blanket, or do you need to stick with light clothing because of the heat?

, Will you need daywear or is most of your travel doing to be done at night? Do you need any blankets, blanket sleepers, or onesies?

, Although a baby's emergency kit will probably include diapers, a toddler's might not, once they're potty trained. Change the contents as needed.

, Some of the items can be stored directly underneath the seat, but others are best kept in a bag or carrier. Try using a medium-sized backpack or a secondary diaper bag.

, Look for things that have no expiration date or won't expire for a long time. Formula and any food items, for example, expire at some point, so if you're going to keep them in your emergency kit, you'll need to restock these items once they go bad.

, This is just an emergency kit, not a lifetime's supply. Figure out how many of each item your kid might need on your average trip, and don't pack more than you need.


Change the set of diapers in the drawer to suit your baby's size. Children tend to outgrow diapers every few months (and some even sooner than that). Keep up with the times to ensure your child will still fit into the necessary clothes when they need them. Check the drawer regularly to ensure the items are still current and they will still fit in a pinch. Once items are used or outgrown, replace them immediately.

, A spit up rag made from a cloth diaper or from ripped fabric shirts or towels makes for a great cleanup option. Also, look to keep some baby wipes and baby bibs on hand, as well as one or two disposable absorbent mats (such as those made by Huggies Goodnites that are available at most grocery stores in the US).

, For example, you might want to include a small writing pad of paper and pen. If the child has a toy or second favorite teddy bear, it's okay to pack one of those into the bag.


You might also want an extra USB auto-adapter cord or an extra car charger in the drawer.

, Put them all in a pile. If you have a clean laundry basket, that can be a great temporary storage location as you assemble the kit.

, Place them on an orderly pile. You may end up placing the very thickest items aside to pack outside the drawer, but ideally you'll fit everything in your kit, with the bulkiest items on the bottom of your drawer.

, Your smallest items are likely to be the ones you'll use the most often, too (like diapers, pacifiers, baby bibs, changing mats, baby wipes, bottle warmer and first aid kit).

, Place it next to your piles of emergency items.

, Try to put the larger items in first and then the smallest things (such as the diapers) on the top of the bag.


Don't put away the pacifiers directly into the bag; you'll add them to your kit later.

, Stash the baby bottle warmer in the cup/bottle holder, if your bag has one. Put the first aid kit in an outside pocket. Baby bibs and changing mats can generally go into the side of the main part of the diaper bag.

, These keep the clothes and items seeming fresh.

,, Never just stuff the pacifiers into the bag itself, as loose items like this can get lost very easily.


Put a clean Ziploc bag over top of the pacifier to keep it fresh until it needs to be used. The Ziploc bag isn't going to completely close, but if left untouched it will close most of the way and keep the pacifier clean.

, Now you're ready for whatever your baby or toddler needs!

Set aside regular one-on-one time.,
Let them help you.,
Talk on their level.,
Teach social and emotional skills.,
Demonstrate how to relax.,
Remain positive with your child.",How to Parent an Energetic Child1," By giving your some of your time to your child you will be setting the stage to build a healthy relationship. This relationship will help you guide an energetic child through life. It also gives you the tools necessary to teach your child to control their energy.Choose something that you and your child enjoy doing together. For example, you could designate one night a week as a movie night, or you could set aside one evening a week to take a hike together.;
, Energetic children often demand a lot of your attention. Rather than pushing their needs aside when you are busy, give them tasks to help you. If they are interested in spending time with you, they will help. If they would rather do something else, they will go play and allow you to finish your task.If you are trying to clean your living room and your child continues to need your attention, give them a job to do. You could say something like, “I’m very busy right now, we can talk when I’m finished. If you’d like to help me, you could do the dusting. That way, I’ll be finished sooner.”

, Talking to your child is always important, but this holds especially true if you are parenting an energetic child. Use words and phrases that they readily understand. Also, you should physically get down on their level to have a conversation. This keeps their attention on you for an engaged conversation.Avoid metaphors such as “You are walking on thin ice.” Your child may take this literally and be very confused.

, When your children understand what is expected of them and how to express themselves, they will work to conduct themselves accordingly. Teach your child social courtesies such as using please and thank you. Give them tools such as conversation and taking a walk to process strong emotions., There are many relaxation techniques and practices that help give you and your child a sense of calm. Engaging with these practices with your child will not only teach them how to relax but let you bond together over a common habit. You can try:

Yoga
Tai chi
Deep breathing
Meditation
Nature walks

, When correcting your child, keep the conversation as positive as possible. Make constructive criticism and discuss the behaviors that you want to see more of. Focusing on what a child should not do does little to teach them what they actually should do.For example, saying, “You shouldn’t run in a parking lot,” is less effective than telling your child something like, “You should always walk carefully in a parking lot.”

"
"
Warn your child before transitions.,
Give them choices.,
Keep a routine.,
Choose your battles.",How to Parent an Energetic Child2," Highly energetic children can become engrossed in playtime or other activities. Suddenly being told to stop what they are doing will jar them and often make them upset. Instead, you can give them a notice a few minutes before it is time to move to a new activity.For example, you might say something like, “You have five minutes of playtime left. Then we will get ready for bed.”

, Children of all ages struggle with the balance of control between themselves and their parents. Giving your child choices will help them to feel in control of their lives. This will make transitioning from task to task much easier. Your child will also be able to stay on task more effectively if they have some say in what they are doing.For example, you could offer your child a choice between bathing before dinner or after dinner. This is a win-win. Either way, they take a bath, but they get to choose when.

, Energetic children are easily stimulated. This stimulation can be overwhelming when they aren’t sure what to expect. To help your child be prepared for their day to day life, keep a steady routine to the best of your ability. Things like a regular bedtime, regular meal times, and consistent naps will help your child stay grounded through the day., Most parents feel that retaining parental authority is important, and ‘losing’ a battle undermines that authority. To avoid getting into a contest of wills with an energetic child (who may have much more willpower than other children of the same age), make sure that you aren’t picking insignificant battles. However, when you do need to intervene in your child’s behavior, don’t hesitate to do so.For example, if your child is mixing different colors of Play-Doh together, it might be worth letting them continue playing. In contrast, if they are rubbing said Play-Doh into the carpet, you should probably intervene.

"
"
Eat healthy, well-balanced meals.,
Designate play areas.,
Enroll them in high energy activities.,
Expect calmness in short bursts.,
Limit screen time.,
Provide your child stimulation.",How to Parent an Energetic Child3," Hunger and changes in blood sugar levels can make your child feel fidgety, grumpy, or bored throughout the day, and these emotions may be responsible for disruptive behavior. Try to feed them balanced meals with whole grains, fiber, fruits, vegetables, and proteins. Try to avoid added sugars, trans fats, and processed foods.

It is especially important that children get a good breakfast. Eggs, fruit, whole grain toast, or oatmeal for breakfast can help your child feel full until lunch time.

, Energetic children are notorious for making a mess. They often go from toy to toy and activity to activity without stopping to clean up or take a break. You can contain some of the chaos by creating designated play areas. In the play area, your child can dispell some of their energy.It is still important to teach your child to clean up the area when they are finished playing.

, Energetic children usually need a good deal of physical activity to manage their energy levels. Enrolling them in a sport or other extra curricular activity can give them an outlet for their energy. Anything from scouting (Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts) to soccer and martial arts could provide your child an outlet for your energy. They will also build other life skills to help manage their energy, such as socializing with peers., A characteristic of nearly every energetic child is the need to move. Instead of demanding that they be still for extended periods of time, give them opportunities to move around and burn off some energy in between short spurts of being still. This could be as simple as letting them stand up and walk around the room every 10-15 minutes (depending on age).You can also discuss this with your child’s teacher for better results at school. Children learn better when they are comfortable and focused.

, Screens are both stimulating and captivating for children. Mentally, the screen will stimulate your child, but in order to watch they usually remain relatively still. When the screen goes off, you may notice that your child has a burst of energy that can last from minutes to hours. To combat this, limit screen time to less than two hours per day and break that time into smaller segments., When you are in a situation that your child cannot get up and move around, you should bring something to keep their interests. This will help them stay distracted from their need to move around. It will also keep their minds engaged and focused on something they enjoy.For example, you could bring a toy to a wedding ceremony and allow your child to play quietly while the ceremony proceeds.
During extended road trips, the two-hour screen time could be reconsidered to give your child more time with a tablet or game for entertainment.

Recognize the context of Indian parenting.,
Shift your focus.,
Reconsider your practices.,
Let your children be children.,
Stop pressuring your kids to fulfill your unfulfilled dreams and expectations.",How to Love Your Child (Indian Culture)," While the West has evolved parenting models based both on the latest findings and cultural values, Indian parenting has largely remained retrograde in its approach.
, Parenting in India is still not child-focused. While there certainly is growing awareness about the fact that children are unique and precious individuals, parents still tend to view their kids as extensions of themselves. This causes serious problems, since children inherit the maladjustments of their parents and immediate family., Indian children are succumbing to the pressures of conforming to obsolete and inhuman models of discipline, education and overall behavior. There are increasing reports of depression and other stress-related syndromes among very young children. Of late, pre-teen suicides, brought on by unrealistic expectations of parents and the school system, have been on the rise.{{}} It’s nothing short of an ongoing and accelerating tragedy., Indian parents expect their kids to withstand the stress of competition and performance expectations. In the process, they rob them of their childhoods. They must learn to view their children as individuals in their own right, with their own personalities and aspirations., Help children express their unique talents. As parents we can neither indulge or neglect our kids, but rather provide them with kind and loving discipline."

Just be with your kids, don't ""Parent"" them.,
Play with your kids.,
Talk to your kids every day.,
Wear them out.,
Change their diet.,
Stop raising your voice.,
Have someone you can call any time you're feeling stressed.,
Stop correcting your kids, unless it matters.,
Be patient with your kids.,

Coach your kids when they find something they love.,
Give your kids their own space and respect it.,
Develop a routine to allow yourself a parenting break.,
Do play dates.,
Hire a sitter regularly.,
Enlist help when you go out.,
Stop hovering.",How to Love Your Kids," Lots of parents get intimidated by the role they have to assume. When you have a child, there's a big pressure to be a Parent with a capital ""P."" Instead of worrying about what that means, define the role for yourself. Being a parent doesn't mean you have to raise a perfect kid, or be a perfect person. Just be yourself.


Instead of focusing on the burden of being a parent, focus on the opportunity. You get to hang out with strange little humans you created each day. You get to talk to a child seeing the world for the first time. You're lucky.;
, Get down in the dirt and talk to your kids about what they're doing, even if it looks like they're poking an acorn with a stick they've just drooled on. Learn to play Xbox. Keep up with all the weird TV shows they want to watch. Learn about what makes them tick.


Just ask them questions about what they're doing while they're playing or pretending, or say, ""What's that?"" Get them talking. Be there for them, if they ask questions. Take your kids seriously.
Use your play as a bargaining tool to get something done. ""I'll play with your for the next 15 minutes, and we can get your room cleaned up, ok?"" Works a lot better for everyone than yelling.

, Studies reveal that children who are spoken to more while they're developing have a higher success rate and a track-record of happiness than kids who are spoken to less.Point being, talk to your kids. Listen to your kids.


Just talk, even if they're not speaking yet. Especially if they're not speaking yet. You don't have to talk to them about little kid things, either. Tell them about what happened to you at work.
Listen to what they have to say, even if it doesn't make a whole lot of sense yet. Encourage your kids to speak when they have something they want to say.

, A kid who is quiet and tired is a kid that's easy to love. Kids who have had a busy day tend to be a lot more manageable. Good for everyone. So keep your kids busy with activities and things to do, instead of just plopping them down in front of the TV.


Take your kids to the park regularly to let them play. It'll be an adventure for them, and you'll let them run out their energy.
Ever heard the phrase ""like a baby at the mall""? Any time you can do a quick sensory-overload experience, your kids will be tired out afterward. So, take them shopping. Take them to the store. It might be a stressful hour for you, but you can nab thirty minutes of nap-time later.

, Some studies have shown that diets heavy with processed food and artificial dyes are tied to an increased risk for ADHD. While it's hard to verify how true this is, it can't hurt to cut processed and refined sugars from your kids' diet, and increase their intake of fresh fruits and vegetables.


Sometimes, when kids are acting up, it's because their blood sugar is low. If your kids are acting up, give them a healthy snack. Snack time is an easy way to give your kids healthy food. Feed your kids some cut-up apple slices or a handful of nuts. Make ants-on-a-log. Something nutritious.

, If you want your kids to quiet down, speak to them with a quieter tone of voice and make your home a quieter place. Being louder won't help anyone, but will make kids louder., Sometimes, things can get pretty hard. You're trying to make dinner or get something important done, and your kids won't stop screaming or fighting with each other. Yikes. If you're at your breaking point, it's good to have someone to call and talk it out. This can be such a lifeline.


Call a close friend or sibling who has kids to talk it out. There might not be any solution to things, but just talking to someone else can be a big relief. Tell them what your kids are doing that's annoying you. Just let it out.
Ultimate irony? Parenting never stops. Call your parent and talk it out if you're having trouble with the kids. Let them offer a willing ear.

, Your job as a parent isn't to be an endless source of wisdom. Let them figure some things out on their own, and make their own mistakes. Let your kids scrape their knees.


When your child is building with blocks, don't offer suggestions about making the statue stronger. Don't show them how to build a better statue. Support them and show an interest in what they're doing. Build your own statue, if you want to do it right.
Try to give your kids the benefit of the doubt when it comes to advice. Their music will probably sound terrible to you. Their favorite movies will probably be insufferably bad. Like your's probably did to your parents.
If your child is doing something dangerous, react calmly but firmly. Be honest with them about the consequences of dangerous actions.

, Real talk: Kids can be a handful. You can still love your kids and parent them well and say that out-loud. But learning to be patient with your kids and allow them to behave as kids will help you love them more. Expect that they will get on your nerves. Expect that they will act like kids. Things will go a lot more smoothly.


Pick your battles and be the bigger person. Don't let your kids sucker you into getting irritated. Talk to them, or give them something else to do if they're getting on your nerves.

, Discipline needs to happen swiftly, calmly, firmly and consistently. Only discipline your kids when it's necessary and do it the same way each time.


Take a step back any time you feel yourself getting extra-angry. If you feel like you might be disciplining your child because you're angry, or because you're frustrating with something else, just sit quietly for five or ten minutes. Talk to someone if you need to.

, Encourage your kids to find passions and pursue those. Painting, basketball, football, soccer or whatever they like to do. Encourage them, and then learn everything you can about their passion and help them in their journey.


Coach them in something they love, not something you love. Always wanted to be a world-class soccer player but never had the skills? If your kid is into it, great. If your kid wants to play guitar, don't force them into something else.

, It's essential for each of your children to have something that they're responsible for, and something that they can call their own. If you can let each of your kids have their own bedrooms, it's an ideal situation. Let them make decorating decisions and take care of their own space.


If you don't have room for each of your kids to have their own bedroom, it's still important for each of them to have their own space. Give your kids an area to call their own, or let them have a small pet that is their pet. Give your kids responsibilities.

, Every parent needs a break in the action. It's very helpful to work some kind of break into your daily routine, to let yourself rest and relax from your parenting duties. It doesn't have to be elaborate or complicated.


Make a rule that any time your kids see your reading your favorite magazine, or picking up a book, they can't disturb you for fifteen minutes. Let them know that if they are, they can have a snack after.
One word: Baths. If you've been taking care of kids all day, take 15 minutes for a soak at the end of it. Well-deserved.

, Strike up a deal with other parents to take your kids off your hands for a couple hours in the afternoon, and volunteer to the do the same at regular intervals. Giving yourself a break from parenting is essential to loving your kids and being able to spend time with them after being refreshed and rested.


If your kids are older, or too old for playdates, give them some free time on their own. Let them explore the neighborhood. Give them some freedom.

, A few hours away at night can be such a blessing. Make a point of regularly hiring a baby-sitter so you can give yourself the chance to go out and have some fun with your partner, or even by yourself. Give yourself a reminder of what life was like when you didn't have kids.

, If taking your kids into public is difficult, bring someone along to help. It can make it a lot easier on your, and a lot more fun to go out if you know you'll be able to spend time with a friend, loved one, or family member. If you dread a big shopping trip to the store with your kids, bring some back-up.

, Sometimes, it can be more stressful than loving to be a parent. If you're constantly worried about your kids, working to make sure that they're successful, it might be better to loosen your grip a little. Take a step back and stop hovering. Let them live their own life and make mistakes. They'll be ok.


A new parenting philosophy called ""Free-range kids"" is popular in some areas. It involves giving kids more freedom than we traditionally think of as being appropriate. Would you let a child under ten ride the subway alone? Or skateboard in another part of town unaccompanied? Some people do. Teach your kids the essential safety rules they need, and trust them to behave smartly.

Begin to slow things down after dinner.,
Establish a set of activities before bed.,
Get your children to bed.,
Be kind.,
Stay firm.",How to Make Your Children Go to Bed Earlier1," Experts suggest that all stimulating activities should be avoided after eating. Children should also avoid eating big meals close to bed time, and they should not have any caffeinated drinks.Caffeine is a stimulant that makes it difficult to sleep, and going to bed on a full stomach can be uncomfortable because of acid build up. Eating and drinking right is the first step towards bedtime., This should include the normal bedtime preparations, such as taking a bath or washing hands, brushing teeth and getting into their pajamas. There are other activities you can try however, that will help close out the day. Thirty minutes is a good amount of time to spend on these activities.Try reading a story to your child.
Listen to some quiet music.
Have you children help their stuffed animals to bed.
Try coloring for a little while.
Play with a puzzle.
Have your child lay out his or her clothes for the following day.
Call his or her grandparents and say goodnight.
Talk with one another.

, Warn your children that bed time is in five minutes, but you can give them the option to go immediately. Make sure their bed is ready for your children with their favorite blanket or toy and tuck your children in so they are comfortable. These steps will help your child know its bedtime.Try to maintain a comfortable temperature in the bedroom, somewhere around 72 degrees Fahrenheit.

, Your child may ask for several things at bed time, and you should not be worried about fulfilling their requests because the first few are probably legitimate. As you continue to develop your nighttime routine, try to work your child's demands into the nighttime procedure. If your children expresses fears at bed time, you should reassure them that there is nothing to worry about.If you child is scared of the dark, turn off the lights and sit with him or her until their fears are overcome.
You can also use a nightlight.

, When you say goodnight and walk out of the bedroom, you need to mean it. If your child calls to you after you have left, wait a while to respond so that your child knows it is bedtime. If you child wakes up at night and comes to visit you, calmly walk him or her back to their bedroom and explain that it is still bedtime."

Know who to call immediately if accidents occur.,
Have a first aid kit nearby.,
Put together your own first aid kit.",How to Make Your Backyard Safe for Children," Be sure to set rules and boundaries about what is safe and what isn’t. This standard should be applied to anywhere that your child plays.


For younger children, rules may include always being able to see an adult or staying in one section of the yard. Older children may have rules about how high they can climb and which parts of the yard are off limits.;
, If there are open areas of your yard, be sure your child knows the boundaries and knows not to go outside those areas.


If your child doesn’t understand the rules, have them play in an entirely different part of the yard and keep an adult or older child with them at all times.

, Check for hazards such as fallen tree limbs, animal remains, or other dangerous objects like nails or broken board. This is especially important to do at the beginning of each season. Make sure all areas of your backyard are maintained and safe for your children.


If needed, get on your knees to see things from a toddler’s view to make any safety changes.

, Don’t let your children play around the lawn mower, even when it isn’t on. You should also store gardening tools and chemicals out of children’s’ reach to avoid a dangerous injury—gardening tools may look like toys to kids, but make sure they know the tools are unsafe and only for adults to use.


Items to keep out of your child’s reach include the saws, pruning shears, mowers, and power tools. Chemicals that must be kept in a safe childproof place include fertilizers, weed killers, swimming pool cleansers, disinfectants, insecticides, pesticides, fuels, and cleaning materials.
Consider building a shed that you can store these objects in and then lock so that your children cannot accidentally put themselves in danger.

, Public playgrounds are subject to laws and inspections, and your home playground should be inspected in a similar way. Check the play structure periodically for anything out of place, such as rough boards or loose guardrails.


Covering the area under the playground with a shock-absorbing material, such as sand, mulch, or rubber will help children avoid injuries when they fall or jump from the structure.Protect against potential hazards by making sure all protruding bolts are covered, tripping hazards such as rocks or tree branches are removed or trimmed, and all platforms and walkways have guardrails that your child can’t easily fall through. Openings between guardrails posts should either be smaller than 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) or larger than 9 inches (22.9 cm).

, Swings are one of the most dangerous areas on a playground—don’t put more than two swings in the same section of the playground and make sure the seats are made of soft rubber, not wood.


Many injuries come from children getting hit in the face or other body part with a swing, and those injuries can be mitigated with a softer material.
Consider avoiding connecting ropes or similar items to a play structure as they pose a risk for strangulation.

, The play structure’s platforms and slides should be less than six feet tall for older children, and shorter than four feet for preschoolers and toddlers.Tree houses are safer the closer they are to the ground and should be less than than 10 feet (3.0 m) in the air.


Before letting your children play on extra hot days, check the temperature of the slides and swings because they can get hot enough to burn skin. Simply touch the areas and see if they are hot to the touch.Monitor children as they play to make sure they are staying within their abilities. The general rule of thumb is that children should only play or climb as many feet tall as they are years old. For example, a five year old should only climb five feet safely.

, Pools are one of the most dangerous areas for children, as drowning is a leading cause of death for children under five. Protect your children by installing fences that are at least four feet tall around the entire perimeter of the pool area.You should also have a self-closing and self-latching gate with latches that are out of the reach of children.
A pool alarm can also be installed that will alert you whenever anyone enters the pool gate or gets in the water. To find the safest combination for your home, contact a local pool safety specialist to install fences and gates that adhere to local regulations.

, Always supervise children who are in and around the pool or hot tub by paying attention to their movements. Have your phone with you and keep rescue equipment easily accessible in case something happens.


When they aren’t in use, always cover the pool and hot tub with a hard cover that won’t buckle if someone gets on it. Soft covers can trap water and lead to drowning if a child wanders onto the covered pool.
The hot tub temperature should never exceed 104 degrees to avoid the risk of an elevated body temperature, which is especially dangerous in children. Always check the water temperature before children get in and have an adult with them in the pool.

, If your backyard contains treated wood in the fence, deck, or picnic table, have it checked for arsenic, a chemical that increases the risk of cancer.


Arsenic is much more prevalent in older items, as its use has been phased out since 2003. Arsenic test kits can be purchased for around $20 at home improvement and landscaping stores. Most tests can provide results in less than 15 minutes.If your items are at risk for arsenic, either replace the old wood with new wood or another material, or seal the wood at least once a year. Don’t allow your children to play on rough wood surfaces, as arsenic splinters can be dangerous.
You should also keep kids away from the soil around wood structures and avoid storing toys under a wood deck, as arsenic can leak onto things beneath it.

, Small children often put things in their mouth, so make sure there aren’t any poisonous plants in your backyard, such as poison ivy, Oleander, or Lily of the Valley.


For a list of common poisonous plants in your area, contact your pediatrician, local poison control hotline, or call the nationwide poison control at 1-800-222-1222 if you are in the United States.Teach your children never to eat berries, leaves, or anything else from plants, even if they don’t think it’s poisonous. If you see your child put something in his mouth, immediately take it out and watch your child for signs of unusual behavior before calling their doctor or poison control.
If you have pesticides or other fertilizers sprayed on your yard, make sure your children don’t play outside for 48 hours after the treatment.

, Keep children away from the barbecue or grill, especially right after it has been in use as it can be very hot. Explain to your children that the grill area is off limits or install a barricade, such as a screen or concrete wall to block your child’s access to the grill.


Always stand by the grill when cooking and store propane tanks in the garage away from children. Do not store propane in the house.

, Trampolines can be fun to use but can also cause serious injuries. To avoid these injuries from occurring, create trampoline rules and make sure that your child, and every child who comes over to your house, knows the rules. You could even consider writing up the rules and posting them near the trampoline. Your rules could include:


Only one child jumper is allowed on the trampoline at a time.
Your children must be supervised at all times, regardless of their age. It is recommended that children under six should not be allowed to use trampolines because they are more prone to serious injuries.

, The mat and net should not have holes. The springs should be intact and securely attached at both ends.


Always use safety padding on the frame to avoid injuries.
Make sure that the area around the trampoline is free from hazards like walls, fences, play equipment, or garden furniture. Also, there should be an overhead clearance to avoid objects like clothes lines, trees, and wires., Keep important numbers in an area where you can access them easily. These numbers should include:


Emergency numbers.
Fire numbers.
Poison hotlines.

, Accidents happen so it is important to be prepared for them to occur. Part of being prepared is always having a first aid kit where you can readily access it.


Make sure that you regularly check the contents of your first aid kit as some of the items may expire. Show your whole family where the first aid kit is kept and explain how the contents are used.

, Here are some of the necessary things that should be included in your first aid kit:


Self-adhesive bandages in different shapes and sizes
Sterile gauze pads and rolls
Adhesive tape
Scissors and tweezers
Elastic bandages to support strained muscles
Antiseptics like hydrogen peroxide or individually wrapped antiseptic pads
Hot water bottle and ice bag
Thermometer—a digital one makes reading the temperature easy
First aid manual
Analgesic, such as acetaminophen
Antacid or stomach acid reducer
Anti-diarrheal product like loperamide
Anti-itch product like calamine lotion
Antihistamine for allergies (Antihistamine-containing creams are not recommended as they can cause skin irritation which will make the original skin problem worse.)
Sunscreen for sunburn remedy

Make simple dishes.,
Present food in a fun way.,
Serve a DIY dinner.",How to Make Weeknight Dinners Less Stressful when You Have Young Kids1," To avoid stress at suppertime, stick to kid-friendly foods that you know your children will enjoy. Choose plain meals that don’t have too many ingredients or seasonings. Try basic ideas such as:


Chicken nuggets
Macaroni and cheese

Spaghetti and meatballs

Mini pizzas;
, Presentation is a good way to get your kids interested in the meal you are serving. Try different cutting techniques, plating methods, or color schemes to get kids interested in food. For instance, try stacking the different parts of your child’s dinner instead of serving it side by side on a plate (e.g. serve a row fish sticks with French fries stacked across them perpendicularly, then top them with green beans). Other ideas might include:Using cookie cutters to make food into shapes
Making miniature foods (e.g. mini pizzas, single-serve shepherd pies)
Using a mandoline to cut vegetables into waffle cut or matchstick pieces

, Make suppertime fun and interactive for your kids by making a do-it-yourself meal. Cook the basic ingredients and have your kids customize and assemble their own plate. For instance, create a pasta bar by making cooked pasta, sauces, and toppings and letting your children choose their own meal combination.This concept could also work with a DIY taco station, or by having kids customize pizza that you then cook for them.

Have a lights out time.,
Play hide and seek.,
Have a racing game every night.,
Try a twist on ""Simon says"".,
Implement a reward system.",How to Make Your Children Go to Bed Earlier2," Set a quiet mood in the house by turning the lights off early you can even have a candle light dinner. Follow this with a dimly lit bath time when your children prepare for bed. After bed time preparations, hand out flashlights to your children and have a story time in bed. All of this helps create a sleepy atmosphere in the house and can help your children fall asleep sooner., Try hiding all of your children's nighttime gear around the house; hide his or her pajamas on a coat rack, his or her toothbrush in the food closet, and his or her toothpaste in the refrigerator, for instance. Your child will have fun running around the house looking for all his or her nighttime gear, and it will help to get him or her ready for bed sooner., Tell your children that the last one into bed each night has a number of tasks to do: turn off all of the lights in the house, lock all of the doors (make sure to have an adult double-check the locks), and close all of the blinds. Make sure your children do not fight or cheat. This activity will help your children want to get in bed sooner by tiring them out!

, Simon says is a game where a person instructs someone to do something by saying ""Simon says..."" before the command. If the person does not say ""Simon says"" before a command, it is not valid. Before bed, say ""Simon says find your favorite pajamas"" and ""Simon says brush your teeth"". Go through the whole nightly routine like this to add some fun to bed time. Games such as this will help reduce your child's unwillingness to go to bed.

, Each time your children go to bed at the time you specify, give them a star. When a child has achieved five stars give them a gift, something like a candy bar or small toy. This will add incentive for the children to go to bed when you tell them to.

Realize the difficulties and understand that you are not alone.,
Remember why sleep is important for children.,
Encourage sleep.",How to Make Your Children Go to Bed Earlier3," Getting your child to fall asleep earlier, or fall asleep at all, can be difficult. It is a struggle that all parents go through at one point or another, however. Medical professionals stress the importance of sleep for all age groups, so it is important that your children get to bed at a reasonable time., Experts note that the proper amount of sleep helps children fight off illness, think clearly, avoid mood swings, and even helps them grow. Some studies suggest that less sleep may result in obesity. So when you have to put your children to bed earlier at night, remember all the positive effects of sleeping. It is important that you know how much sleep you children should be getting as well.One to three month olds should sleep 10.5 - 18 hours per day.
Three to eleven month olds should sleep 9 - 12 hours per day.
One to three year olds should sleep 12 - 14 hours per day.
Three to five year olds should sleep 11 - 13 hours per day.
Five to twelve year olds should sleep 10 - 11 hours per day.
Twelve to eighteen year olds should sleep at least 8.5 hours per day.

, Doctors suggest that sleep be prioritized, and not just for your children but for the whole family as well. Children today have very busy schedules loaded with activities. However, do not be afraid of missing out on one activity in favor of an extra 15 or 30 minutes of sleep. Sleep could have greater long term benefits.

Plan a weekly menu.,
Make slow cooker meals.,
Make use of leftovers.",How to Make Weeknight Dinners Less Stressful when You Have Young Kids2," Planning a menu for the week will help to save time and allow you to shop for ingredients ahead of time. Have your children give their input by asking them for three meal ideas, and slotting in at least one of their ideas during the week (e.g. tacos on Tuesday as suggested by one child, and spaghetti on Thursday for another). Make meals fun by having theme nights (e.g. ""Pizza Party Friday"")., To optimize your time and still make savory, well-balanced meals for your family, use a slow cooker to prepare dinner. Meals often cook in the machine for between four to ten hours, depending on the type of food and heat setting selected. As a general rule, foods that cook between 8-10 hours are more flavorful and tender as a result of the slow warm up period. Try recipes like:


Pork chops
Fried chicken
Chicken tacos
Pulled pork

, To make the most of your money and save time on food preparation, use leftovers to make creative meals. Be sure to use leftovers within a few days and throw out any food that you suspect might be spoiled. Some interesting meals to make with leftovers might include:


Fried rice
Ham and vegetable soup
Turkey and stuffing casserole
Baked macaroni and cheese

Reduce distracting background noise.,
Create a suppertime soundtrack.,
Remove clutter.,
Set the table.,
Make cleanup easy.",How to Make Weeknight Dinners Less Stressful when You Have Young Kids3," To create a low-stress environment during dinnertime, remove all of the background noise that might distract your kids during the meal. Make sure that the television is turned off, cell phones are put onto silent mode, and that no phones or other electronic devices are brought to the table. Establish a rule that no one answers the phone during dinner, and turn down the ringer if necessary., To create a fun, relaxing mood, play music in the background while you eat supper. Have each of your children choose a relaxing song that they enjoy to add to a regular suppertime playlist, or purchase an album of relaxing children’s music to play. For instance, look for the album “Kids Relaxation Music” by the Kiboomers, available on iTunes for $9.99., Clutter can be a distraction and create a sense of disorder. Make sure that all loose, out-of-place items are removed from your dining area, particularly toys, which will steal your kids’ attention during mealtime. To make this simple, have a storage chest or bin in the room to quickly clear all clutter out of sight before it’s time to eat., Setting the table before dinner is a good way to organize your dining space for the meal. Get kids involved by teaching them how to set the table. To start, show them each item (e.g. dinner plate, drinking cup, fork and knife, napkin) and have them place it as you describe where to put it. You can also put down one place setting and have them prepare the rest, using the first as a guide.Do not let very young children (e.g. under eight years old) handle breakable items without supervision.

, To make after-dinner cleanup easier, minimize your mess by pre-soaking pots, pans, or other cookware before sitting down to eat. Empty the dishwasher or dish rack so that it's clear when you're ready to wash dishes after dinner. Use easy to clean place settings (e.g. plastic place mats that you can wipe with a damp cloth) and minimize the number of utensils, bowls, and measuring cups you use while cooking."

Don’t push picky eaters.,
Offer different choices.,
Shop with kids.,
Involve kids in dinner preparation.",How to Make Weeknight Dinners Less Stressful when You Have Young Kids4," Young children like familiarity, especially with foods, and often refuse to eat new things. Forcing a child to eat something they don’t want will interfere with them learning how to manage their own food consumption. Introduce new foods along with other options so that your child can choose what they want to eat., Offer at least once food item that your child likes at suppertime, but do not cook multiple meals at once. For instance, if you make pork chops and fear your child won’t eat one, offer other side items with the meal (e.g. baby carrots, bread). Let your child fill their plate with whatever foods they want to try, and don’t push if they refuse your main course., Avoid complaints about dinner by letting your kids be involved in the process of planning it. Shop with children to allow them to choose items to be included in the meal (e.g. choosing carrots instead of cauliflower). When you serve supper, point out your kids’ contributions to dinner and remind them that what they are being served is what they chose., To get kids excited about their meal and to give them a sense of responsibility, involve them in the preparation process. Depending on their age, give them simple tasks to complete as part of the kitchen routine. Even very young children can stir ingredients or sprinkle seasonings onto other ingredients.Complete potentially dangerous tasks, like chopping vegetables, prior to inviting your children into the kitchen to help cook.

These items will not only keep your children busy, but they may also help him break the ice and make new friends., Consider what kinds of activities your child will be participating in and what kinds of supplies are provided. For example, if the camper will be outside all day has very fair skin, sending a bottle of sunscreen in the care package would be smart. If there is no electricity in the cabins, consider sending a flashlight. If you know your child will be swimming every day, maybe surprise him with an extra bathing suit.

While it's okay to tell your child that you miss him, make sure to keep things positive and remind him of all the fun he will have at camp. Remember, you don't want your letters to make him homesick.For a personal touch, send some photos along with your letter. If your camper has younger siblings at home, they can send some drawings.
Send pre-addressed envelopes (if they are young) and extra stamps so he can write back to you.

, Make sure to check with the camp so you know exactly how it needs to be addressed.

Spending time with your children as a group will enable you to spend more overall time with each child. It’ll also help you develop a healthy family and group dynamic through positive interaction.


Don’t favor one child.
Focus on team or group activities that do not pit children and you against each other. For example, if you have young children, try building Legos, Duplo, or Lincoln logs. Avoid sports or winner-take-all activities.
Provide an example of how your children should treat each other. Reinforce the idea that they need to take each other’s feelings into considerable. For example, if one child is mean to another, stop them and say “would you like someone to treat you like that?”;
, You should also spend time with your kids’ individually as often as you can. By reserving time for each individual child, you’ll let them know you love them and you’ll further your individual bond.


Short activities that take no more than five or ten minutes will go a long way in making your children feel special. Consider short games, walks, or just having a brief conversation.
If you can, reserve a substantial amount of time – several hours or even a day – once a month or so to spend with each child. You might consider camping, having a picnic, or going canoeing.
Engage in an activity that you and your child both enjoy., While spending time with your children is important, you should also show them affection while spending time with them. Kind words and physical contact will enhance any time you spend with your children. Also, be sure to make eye contact with your children when you are talking to them or when they are talking to you.


Hug your children when appropriate. When you’re saying good bye to your child for a long or short amount of them, hug them.
Say things that demonstrate your affection for them. For instance, say “I love you” or “I care about you.”
Pat your children on the back when you’re proud of them., Perhaps nothing makes a child feel more special than when adults listen to them. By listening to your kids, you send them the message that you are interested in what they think and what they care about.


Pose questions to your children to get them talking. For instance, ask them what they liked at school that day.
Pay attention to your children when they share random thoughts with you. Stop what you are doing, face your body toward them, and make eye contact to indicate engagement.
Never brush aside what you think are nonsensical statements or words from you children. Put the effort into understanding what they say, respond to them, and let them know you are engaged with them.See if you can repeat back to them what they are trying to say so that they know they've been heard.

, You should also spend some time sharing your personal experiences and ideas with your children. By sharing your experiences with your children, you’ll help create a bond with them and make them feel more special.


Tell them stories about when you were a kid.
Let them know what interests you.
For older children, let them know that you, too, have had insecurities but love yourself unconditionally.
Share stories with them about what your life was like before they were born., Also, build an understanding of who their closest friends are. Spend some time learning about your children as individuals. By learning about what they like and what they’re strong at, you’ll know more about your children and will grow a stronger bond with them.


Make an effort to learn what your children are interested in.
Ask your children what they like to or what they’d like to do for fun.
Schedule a meeting with your children’s teachers to find out what they excel at or what they struggle with., Another way to make your kids feel special is to display things that represent them.

Display pictures of your children at work, in your wallet, or elsewhere.
When displaying work or photos, make sure you represent all of your children equally.Also, let them hear you recognize and compliment them to other people, even your other children as long as this is done equally.

, You should also consider taking a role in your children’s activities. By taking such a role, you’ll not only be able to spend more time with your child, but you’ll send the message that you care about them and what they are interested in.


Volunteer as a coach for your child’s little league team.
Volunteer to help out with Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts.
Volunteer as a chaperon for your children’s school field trips., Whatever your family organization, you’ll likely have other people who are important in your children’s lives and have an interest in their wellbeing. Because of this, it is important to cooperate with anyone who plays a big role in your kids’ lives. By cooperating, you’ll create a more loving and stable environment and make your kids feel special.


If you have a traditional family unit, make sure to work with your partner to raise and care for your children.

Cooperate with grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins or others who have an interest in your children.Keep them abreast of your child's schedule of activities so that they can attend when they are able. This will help the child feel that they have a strong support system.

, Another way to get your kid to feel special is to know their friends and friends’ parents. By getting to know the parents of your children’s friends, you’ll send the signal that you are an active part of their social lives.

Love your child despite your relationship with your ex.,
Be racially inclusive.,
Respond to their needs uniquely.,
Avoid comparing.,
Spend time separately with each child.,
Allow them to solve their own disagreements.,
Assess your words and behaviors.,
See a therapist.,
Enjoy your children.",How to Love Children from Different Relationships Equally," Developing relationships in any kind of family system can be stressful and put additional stress on you, your own children, step-children, or your significant other/spouse. For instance, your child, stepchildren, ex, or extended family members may not be too keen on your new blended family situation or your new partner. Maybe your new partner does not understand the type of closeness and bond that you share with your own children. Some family members (stepchildren and/or partner) may feel undervalued or left out of the family. Yet again, it could be that as a new step-parent you are unsure about your role in this new family setting. To develop great relationships in any family dynamic, recognize and acknowledge the key relationships involved. In a blended family the following are some of the key relationships you may see:

The relationship you have with your new partner.
The relationship you have with your own biological children.
The relationship your partner has with his/her own children.
The relationship you and your partner have with each other’s children.
The relationship you and your partner may have with your ex partners.
The relationship of extended families with you and all your children combined.
Finally, the relationship you all have when together in your family unit.;
, If you have kids from multiple partners, the relationships may differ significantly. One child may see their other parent frequently while the other may not. Recognize how their other relationships may affect them. While there’s nothing you can do to change the other parent’s involvement, assure each child that they are loved.


All children want and need their parent’s love, support, care, and gentle guidance. Realize that when families are blended, some children may feel scared of losing their special bond with their primary parents. They may be frightened that there could be a lack of attention and love, or feel that they are just not that important to you anymore. This is the time for each parent to emphasize to all children that no one is forgotten, and everyone will be loved and cared for regardless of any changes within the family.
Consider how the children relate as half-siblings. Children can become competitive amongst each other if one child sees both parents and the other does not.
If the other parent is less involved, say, “I know you see your other parent less frequently, but know that they still love you very much.”

, If your child lives with their other parent most of the time, make the time you spend with them really count. Treat them just as you do your other children. Give them the same affection and tell them they must follow the same rules. Avoid making your child feel special when they visit, as this can make them feel outside the family and not part of it.Tell them that they must show respect, kindness, and help out just like the other kids do.
While you may assign the children chores, they might have fewer chores if they also complete chores at their other home.

, If you’re upset at the child’s other parent, don’t take it out on the child. Even if the child resembles the parent, remember that the child is a separate being. The child deserves to be loved and not held accountable for another person’s actions. Your children are equally deserving of love.


Remind yourself that the child deserves your love regardless of any estranged relationship you and your ex may have.
For example, if you have a child from a previous relationship and a child in your current relationship, don’t hurt your first child as a way to get back at your ex or hold a resentment toward your ex through your child.

, If you have children of different races, make sure that each child feels included. If one child experiences discrimination, talk to all children about discrimination and how it can affect your family. If even one child is a different race than the others, talk about how discrimination can hurt everyone in the family and that it’s important for all children to stick up for one another.


If you notice tensions in your family, make sure you are giving each child attention and love. Be an example for your children to follow by loving each child individually.

, Tune into your children’s needs and respond accordingly. Your children are likely different from each other and that means you will likely love them differently. For example, one child may struggle with missing their other parent more than another child. You may need to give more comfort to this child while their sibling may not be affected at all. Be aware of each child’s needs and meet them.Sometimes, one child will be needier than another. While you may give help or assistance to the one, make sure you give reassurance to the other.
You may go to one child’s soccer games and the other child’s chess tournaments. Whatever you do, show your support for your child’s interests and love them for their own uniqueness., Parents can sometimes instigate sibling rivalry without even realizing it. This can be magnified when children are step-siblings or half-siblings and can affect their feelings of self-worth. Praise each child’s efforts and successes equally. If you find yourself comparing your children, stop yourself and find another way to say it.Avoid saying things like, “Be more like your sister” and instead say, “Who has their seatbelt on? I see Alice has hers on, good job. Do you have yours, Jason? Good job.”

, Realize that you and your stepchildren did not choose each other. Perhaps you have clicked with one another naturally, or perhaps there is still an uncomfortable tensions that neither of you know how to respond to. Spending quality time to develop a strong and healthy relationship with your stepchild will help lead to better relationships overall within the entire family and with your new partner. Have a special relationship with each child. Do different activities together separately from other children. Spending one-on-one time with each child can help increase your bond together and show each child that you love and care for them.A step-child may be more resistant to warming up to you, but stick with it and show them that you are willing to create a relationship together.Show interest in your stepchild’s life and spend time asking how their day was. Help your stepchild out in practical ways, such as by driving them to meet up with friends or to an after-school activity, helping them with their homework, or teaching them how to cook dinner with you.
Choose one-on-one activities based on the child’s interests. For one child, you may want to go to a museum while you may want to attend a sports game with the other.
Support your partner's approach towards disciplining his/her own children, but do your best to let your partner be primarily responsible for managing the rules and boundaries. This is something that you and your partner and all of the kids should discuss before blending your families so that everyone is fully aware of how things will function in this new family unit. Finally, be consistent with any set rules and boundaries.

, Understand that stepsiblings may not feel as close to one another as biological siblings do, but this depends upon their ages, their personalities, how long they have known each other prior to the family blending, and their current and prior environmental experiences. Realize that it is perfectly normal (blended or not) for children to feel jealous, have arguments, and to compete with one another. Conflicts will arise, and it is quite normal for these conflicts to be more intense in a blended family. Children often fight, especially half-siblings and step-siblings. They may come straight to you to solve a problem. Instead of being the judge, jury, and executioner, tell them to solve the problem on their own. This way, no child will feel like they are being treated unfairly or unjustly by you. It also helps them to build problem-solving skills on their own.Say, “I know you are upset at each other. What do you think should happen? Figure out a solution together.”
It is important for everyone in the blended family to work together and develop expectations and rules about respecting one another. Keep this in a place where it is visible to everyone at all times, such as on the refrigerator.
Express fairness across the board. For instance, the rules and expectations should be consistently the same, and appropriate for each age group.
Ensure that all children within the home have their own beds and spaces to go to if they need time to themselves, but also encourage them to have fun together as well (i.e., playing games together).

, Kids are often concerned with what’s fair, whether it be splitting the candy bar exactly in half or getting the same amount of time watching television. It’s almost impossible to treat two unique individuals entirely equally and fairly at all times. When you interact with your children together, pay close attention to the amount of attention you give each one. Notice how you speak to them: do you praise one more than the other or favor discipline toward one? Be aware of your own actions and how they may affect your children.If you notice unfair treatment, take note and correct it. Hold your tongue when you want to give criticism or focus on balancing the praise you give to each child.
Whether your decisions are equal or fair, it’s up to you, not your children, to decide., If you have a relationship with a child that is much more difficult than the others, therapy may be beneficial. Some parents feel deeply upset about differing feelings for different children, especially if one child is much more difficult than the others. If you’re struggling to be fully loving to all children, a therapist can help. You may wish to attend individual sessions, family sessions, or sessions with you and your difficult child.Find a therapist by calling a local mental health clinic or your insurance provider. You can also get a referral from your physician or a recommendation from family and friends.

, Look forward to spending time with your children. If you need to improve a relationship with a child, bring some fun and enjoyment in. this can help you have nice experiences together and build memories both of you look back on fondly. Whether it’s your biological child or a step-child, find time to play together or read a book together. Make sure you do fun activities with each child.Think about what kind of play each child enjoys. One child may enjoy playing with blocks, so get down on their level and build with them. Another child may enjoy coloring, so grab a coloring book and join them.

Ask your kids if they want a dog.,
Make the long-term commitment clear to your children.,
Take your children to meet dogs.,
See if your kids interact well with dogs.",How to Know if Your Kids Are Ready for a Dog1," If you’re thinking about adopting a dog as a family pet, it’s important to check with your children early on. Many dog breeds have long lifespans, and may be with your family for nearly two decades. Ask your children if they would like to have a dog around the house. If your children do want a dog, make sure that they know the major responsibilities associated with raising a dog, including: providing food and water, and walking the dog and cleaning up after it.If they are interested but worry about dog attacks or poorly behaved dogs, you can explain that the dog your family would adopt would be well-trained and well treated.
If your kids are worried that they’ll be responsible for taking care of the dog, explain that the entire family will share dog-care responsibilities, with individual chores split fairly between individuals.;
, Children are naturally impulsive; may be excited about adopting a dog one week, and forget about the idea the next week (or have moved on to wanting a cat, a fish, a snake, etc.). Sit down with your children and make it clear to them that adopting a dog is a long-term commitment. Children need to understand that, once adopted, a dog will be part of the family for 10–20 years, and will need frequent care during this time.Also let kids know that, if they fail to follow through on necessary chores, the family may need to get rid of the dog.
Don’t threaten your kids with this option; avoid saying “If you’re too forgetful we’ll get rid of the dog!”
Instead, explain to kids that they play a necessary role in caring for the dog: “We need you to help take care of the dog, and if you don’t do the chores we ask you to, we might have to find another family to care for the dog.”

, A great primary step to see if your children are ready to care for their own dog—or to help care for a family pet—is to watch the children spending time with a dog.Ask your friends and see if any of them has a well-behaved dog that enjoys children. Alternately, call or visit your local pet store or animal shelter and ask if there are any child-friendly dogs that your kids could socialize with.


If your friends, pet-store owners, or animal-shelter owners advise you that a specific dog is snappy, ill-tempered, or dislikes children, keep your kids away from the dog.

, Once you’ve found a friend or pet-store owner who will allow your kids play with their dog, let your children pet the dog and interact with it. Give the kids treats to feed the dog and a toy to throw for it; see if they enjoy spending time with the dog.It’s a good sign if the kids enjoy the experience, treat the dog well, and are enthusiastic about having a dog of their own. Encourage your kids to be gentle with the dog, and make sure that they don’t quickly become bored with the animal.
If your kids are hard to control or overly excited around the dog and show behaviors like pulling the dog’s ears or tail, chasing the dog, or otherwise abusing the animal, your children are likely not ready for sharing the responsibilities of owning a dog.

Provide healthy foods for your children to snack on.,
Set a good example for your kids.,
Prepare alternatives that are healthier than junk food.,
Tell your children the disadvantages of eating too much junk food.,
Keep your kids from looking at/watching advertisements.",How to Keep Your Kids from Eating Too Much Junk Food," Healthy snacks include baby carrots with ranch, pieces of cheese and fruit. Having healthy snacks for your children satisfies their hunger without them eating unhealthily.;
, Avoid eating junk food in front of them; this will make them eat it too. Only eat unhealthy foods (and let your kids eat them) once in a while.


You should also avoid buying junk food and storing it in your home. Buying less healthy foods will only cause your children to make a beeline for the refrigerator so they can get these foods.

, For example, prepare a healthier version of chips by baking them, rather than using a deep fryer.

, Explain the health consequences and other ways it may affect children's lives, such as lack of concentration, moodiness, and lack of self confidence.

, TV commercials and advertisements about junk food and junk food restaurants will only encourage your children to eat more junk food, and not to choose healthier options.

Assess your children’s age and behavior.,
Gauge if your children can complete the chores they already have.,
Do not adopt a dog specifically for your child.",How to Know if Your Kids Are Ready for a Dog2," Children can be loud, poorly behaved, and demonstrate excessive levels of energy, which could scare or anger a dog. Some of this has to do with the children’s age and development level: older children can be more mature and understand that animals need to be treated quietly and gently. Younger children can be well-behaved around dogs as well, but need to understand that a pet dog is not a toy, but a living animal that they need to respect.If your children are poorly behaved or difficult to manage, you may need to wait to adopt a dog until they develop emotionally and behaviorally., You can evaluate if your kids are ready for the responsibilities of dog ownership by watching them complete chores around the house: for example, sweeping and dusting, washing dishes, watering plants, and other age-appropriate tasks. If your children complete these age-appropriate tasks efficiently and without needlessly complaining, they’re probably ready to help care for a dog.A good rule of thumb: if your children can remember to brush their own teeth twice daily (without being prompted or reminded), they are ready for the chores that come with dog ownership., Regardless of your child’s age, you should not adopt a dog and insist that only your children care for it. Caring for a family dog can be used to help teach kids basic responsibility skills, such as time management and chore completion. However, a dog should be a family responsibility, not an individual responsibility. Give your children age-appropriate chores to help care for the dog, but never give children sole dog-care responsibility.Younger children are naturally forgetful and mentally undeveloped, and will forget to complete their chores. If they’re responsible for tasks like feeding a dog and giving it water, the consequences for their forgetfulness could be serious.

Adopt a kid-friend dog breed.,
Plan to assign your children reasonable amounts of chores.,
Find out if your children have an allergy to dogs.",How to Know if Your Kids Are Ready for a Dog3," Some dog breeds—those that are mellow, friendly, relatively low-energy, and have an even temperament—are behaviorally better suited for spending time around children. Depending on the size of your children, they may also be at risk for being bowled over by an over-excited large dog. Breeds including the bulldog, beagle, newfoundland, and golden and Labrador retrievers are loyal, mellow, and should get along well with children.While weimaraners and vizslas are loyal and fun breeds, they can also have high levels of energy and require plenty of space to run and exercise, so should not be kept cooped up with young kids.
Boxers and bull terriers are fun and playful breeds, which make them an ideal choice for being around energetic kids.

, When considering adopting an animal for your family, it’s important to clarify to children that they’ll be partially responsible for caring for the animal. If your children are consistently bad at managing the household chores they already have, they may not be prepared for helping take care of a dog. Take stock of your children’s age and maturity level, then let them know the types of dog-related chores they will be responsible for.Kids younger than 4 aren’t ready to help care for a pet yet.
Kids from ages 4–8 can help brush and groom the dog (with adult supervision).
Kids from ages 9–12 can feed and water the dog daily.
Kids from ages 13–17 can help perform the same tasks as adults: walking the dog, picking up the dog’s excrement, helping train the dog, and attending obedience classes if necessary.

, Dog allergies vary in severity; mild allergies result in minor skin irritation, and severe allergies can be life threatening. It would be distressing to adopt a dog and find out afterwards that one or more of your children have a serious allergy.If one of your more children are allergic to dogs, consider adopting a different breed of pet: for example, a cat, a bird, a lizard, or fish.


Schedule an appointment with your children’s pediatrician. Let the doctor know that you’re interested in adopting a family dog and would like to have an allergy test run on your kids beforehand. Doctors provide these tests often, and the tests consist of placing a small amount of allergen in your children’s skin.

Write your birth plan so that it is short and to the point, and easy to read.,
Be sure to keep the language you use in your birth plan clear enough for others to understand.",How to Write a Birth Plan for a Natural Birth1," Try to limit your birth plan to roughly one or two pages in length, as it should only consist of your birthing preferences. You don’t need to tell your medical staff or caregiver how to do their job, they are trained professionals in their field. You do need to tell them the specific preferences you have that you feel are necessary during your birthing process.;
, Clearly state the things that you want. It is also important to be more assertive than you otherwise would be with the language you use. You want to make sure that your preferences are clearly laid out.


You don’t want to use words like, “I could possibly” or “Maybe.” You want to make sure that you are using definitive phrased such as “I will want.” This type of language will help your caregiver to understand that you have been very clear in your preferences, thereby preventing surprise requests during the labor and birth.

"
"
Include specifications related to a natural birth, such as the fact that you do not want any type of medications or an epidural during your labor.,
Do research about other people’s birth plans and inquire about what may have helped them develop theirs, however, remember that your birth plan should be personalized to your specific needs and made for you.,
Review your birth plan with your caregiver or medical staff before you go into labor.,
Leave room for unexpected things that may occur during your labor.",How to Write a Birth Plan for a Natural Birth2,"


It is common for women who want to have a natural birth to not use any type of medical interventions that would be considered artificial. In the end, it is up to you to decide if you would like any of these interventions used such as fetal monitoring, heart rate monitor, etc.
Most women use different techniques during their labor to help them cope with the pain of having a natural child birth. It sometimes helps to practice breathing exercises before hand and to include in your birth plan the type of breathing exercises you would like to use during your labor. It can also help to create a comfortable environment for when you are giving birth, such as bringing a couple things with you that remind you of home like a picture of your family or making the room more relaxing by dimming the lights.
Include things that intimidate you or scare you about birth, as these are helpful for your medical staff to know. For example, If you have a fear of large needles, including that information in your birth plan allows your caregiver to use a gentler approach when informing you about the need for needles. Although this may not seem like a necessary thing to put in your birth plan, it can really help your caregiver or your medical staff to get to know you and by doing this it can make you feel more comfortable about the entire birthing process.

, You want to understand everything that you write down so that if you are asked about it during your labor, you will know how to answer. No matter how well-meaning a friend’s suggestion about playing classical music may be, if it is not important to you, do not include it in your birth plan.

, This is important because you may not be your usual self on the day your labor begins. You want to make sure to go over the plan before this day so that everyone is on the same page. It may even be a good idea to have your caregiver or medical staff sign the birth plan so that you feel confident that they agree with your plan and will follow your specific instructions.

, Think about these different scenarios while writing your birth plan. Consider things that you may need during your labor or what to do if your labor is going slowly or if it is going faster than you may have thought it would.


Being flexible during your labor is also important. Go into your labor knowing that it is okay if you don’t get to do everything you wrote on your birth plan. Some women who have been through labor will tell you that they were able to do everything on their birth plan and that their labor went exactly as expected. Go into it knowing that this may or may not be the case for you during your labor, and be prepared to make changes as necessary.
It is also important to think about what to do if something happens that would be considered a worst case scenario. It is not pleasant to think about something bad happening during your labor, but you should consider the possibility before hand so that you know what you want done if the situation does arise.

Don’t put off writing your birth plan.,
Remember to pack your birth plan in the labor bag that you will be bringing with you to the hospital or birthing center when you go into labor.",How to Write a Birth Plan for a Natural Birth3," Look at it as one of the many things that you will experience during your pregnancy and labor that you may not get to experience again. Writing your birth plan should not be just another chore that you have to complete.


Get your family or your partner involved. Bounce ideas off of your family or partner and let them join in the experience with you. Take their suggestions, but in the end, remember that the experience you have should be the one that you choose, not anybody else.

, You don’t want to forget your birth plan at home because doing so can cause added stress for you. You don’t want to have to verbally explain everything that you took the time to write down. You want to have it in front of your caregiver so that you do not experience any additional stress trying to remember all of the details that are so important to you.

Make a list of possible conflicts.,
Show your kid the list.,
Make a compromise.,
Post the rules.",How to Live with Your College Kid over Summer Break1," Examples of issues that are possible sources of tension are use of the car, curfews, food, cleanliness/household responsibilities, money, working and rules for inviting people over. Sit down and make a list of issues to discuss. Next to each item, write down what you are willing to negotiate.For example, you could write, “Curfew: you don’t have to have a curfew, but I expect you to tell me where you are and what time you plan on being home.”;
, Do this within the first week of your kid’s arrival. Once they are settled in, sit down with your kid to explain the list to them. Give them time to look over it. Encourage them to write down what they are willing to negotiate and to add any new items they can think of.For example, you may want a 1 a.m. curfew, but your kid may point out that they are used to not having one and do not think they should have one just because they are home.

, Go over the updated list with your kid. When there is a disagreement about a rule, try to be flexible. Remember, if you try to enforce old high school rules on your kid, then they are more likely to resist. Try to come to an agreement that you and your kid are both satisfied with.For example, if they disagree with the idea of having a curfew, then compromise by telling them that they must check in with you to let you know where they are and what time they will be home.

, Do this once you and your kid have come to an agreement about the rules. Type them up and post them somewhere visible, or give them a copy. This way, no one can say, “I didn’t agree to that.”You may need to update the rules as the summer progresses and new situations arise.

Recognize the sources of advertising for your children.,
Limit your own television and Internet time.,
Do not give your child a smart phone until they are 14 or older.,
Follow the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics.,
Talk to your children about advertisements.,
Buy a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) and record programs ahead of time.,
Install child safety blocks on your television and Internet connection.,
Purchase television seasons and movies, rather than watching them on the TV.,
Make television and Internet devices a privilege, rather than a right.",How to Limit the Effects of Advertising on Children1," These include television, computer games, movie previews, magazines, the Internet, email junk mail and billboards. Once you have a good understanding that advertising is almost everywhere, you can keep an eye out for harmful sources in your child's life.;
, For many families, this means no television during meals and refraining from watching a lot of television when the kids go to bed. They may see television as something they want more, if it's on, but they are not allowed to watch it.

, Since kids cannot recognize the goals of advertising, withholding a smart phone will make them less likely to look at advertising when they are away from home and spend their money.

, They suggest that parents limit television and Internet in the following ways, in order to limit contact with advertising:


Do not allow children under the age of 2 to watch any television. Studies have shown that infants and young toddlers cannot tell the difference between the actual show and the advertising.
Limit kids over the age of 2 to watch between 1 and 2 hours of television programming per day. You should choose the programming for its educational value, if possible. Kids between 3 and 6 do not understand that advertising is aiming to sell them something. Kids up to 12 years of age may view advertising as entertainment.
Do not keep television or Internet devices in children's or teenager's rooms. This outlet allows too much unstructured television time and not enough time for creative and outdoor activity. By the age of 12, most kids can understand the aim of an advertisement, but only after they are 14 do they understand the concept of a marketplace, cost and other values related to advertising.
Try to choose programs on public television stations because there is often less advertising.

, Tell them that they are not true stories about the product, so that they understand that they should be wary about things they hear on television or see on the Internet.


Ask your older children what is being advertised. Then, ask them what strategies are being used to advertise the product. Common strategies include bribes, claims, promises, games, a famous person or cartoon character, special effects, repetition, music, stories and jokes.

, Watch television with your children so that you can make sure you fast forward during the commercials.

, Restrict their access to the sites and channels that you have vetted and that appear educational. Block websites that focus on advertising, rather than on content, such as Facebook, until your child is over 14 and you've spoken with them about advertising on the Internet.

, DVDs usually contain little or no advertising. You may want to fast forward through previews, but you will not need to worry about commercial breaks.

, One way to limit exposure is to raise kids to understand that TV and the Internet are not the go-to source of entertainment. Make TV time one of the first things to take away, if a child acts up.

"

Treat them like an adult.,
Let your kid decompress.,
Set realistic work expectations.",How to Live with Your College Kid over Summer Break2," Instead of being an authoritative adult, listen to and respect your kid’s decisions, ideas and opinions. Additionally, try to avoid doing everything for them and spoiling them.For example, let them make dinner for themselves a couple nights a week.
If you are discussing an important topic, listen to what they have to say and then give them your opinion.

, Try to avoid bothering your kid about household and work responsibilities once they get home. Instead, let your kid take it easy for a week. This will allow them time to unwind from the stress of finals, as well as time to adjust to the changes of being home again.For example, instead of bothering them about sleeping in, let them sleep in the first week they are home.

, Don’t expect your kid to get a full-time summer job or a paid internship right away. Give them time to find work that they like and want to do. Let finding work be their responsibility.Also, be aware that today many internships are unpaid. However, they look great on a resume. So try not to give your kid a hard time for not finding a paid job or internship. Instead, be supportive and congratulate your kid for their effort and motivation.

"
"
Give them a warm welcome.,
Accept them for who they are.,
Spend some one-on-one time with your kid.",How to Live with Your College Kid over Summer Break3," Once your kid arrives home, let them know that you are happy they are home. Simple gestures like cooking their favorite meal or cleaning their room for them before they get home will relay the message that you are happy they are home. Keeping the pantry and refrigerator stocked with food while your kid is home is also a nice gesture.Focusing on the positives will help set the tone for the rest of the summer. This way you can ensure that your summer is as smooth and relaxing as you imagined.

, It is highly likely that your kid has changed, at least a little bit, since they went off to college. Instead of criticizing their new lifestyle or identity choices, be accepting of them. And try to avoid bombarding them with tons of questions about their choices. Instead, wait for them to come to you to talk about these things.If you are uncomfortable with some changes, try to remember that some behaviors and attitudes last while others don’t. Unless it is something very serious, like drug use, it is not worth getting hung up on.

, It’s normal for your kid to want to spend time with their old friends. However, ask them to save some time for you as well. This way, you can get your much needed alone time with them before they head back to college.For example, plan a weekend trip with them to a favorite destination, or plan a trip to a waterpark or an amusement park.
If you or your kid do not have time for a trip, then make dinner plans once or twice a month, or catch a movie.

Learn the correlation between children watching television and childhood obesity.,
Shop with children around the perimeter of the supermarket.,
Teach children good diet habits.,
Take packaged foods out of their outer packaging when you get home.,
Do not let your children get involved with food rewards programs.",How to Limit the Effects of Advertising on Children2," Children who watch more than 4 hours of television a day are more likely to be obese. This means that children are both susceptible to junk food ads and they are less active.


The American government has pressured advertisers not to advertise junk food during shows geared toward children who are 12 years old or younger. However, the pledge that these companies made does not extend to popular family television shows that air during the evening.

, This is usually where the fresh food is located. In the inner aisles, there is candy and other foods that are packaged to appeal to children, with bright colors, cartoon characters and illustrations.

, Have conversations with them so that they know why they do not eat advertised junk food. Teach them about the food groups and moderation of sugar and fat, so that they know how to make good food decisions despite the advertising.

, This will limit the amount of time children spend looking at cereal boxes or other packaging that is aimed toward their demographic.

, Many junk food companies are offering ""rewards"" for people who buy a lot of their products. These sites encourage children to spend money on unhealthy purchases to receive gifts.

Fill up buckets, scoop the water with your toddler's shovels, watch leaves flow down the road, or run around, splashing through the water. Consider putting a rain poncho or a rain coat on your child so that they don't get sopping wet. Make sure that your child wears rain boots if you don't want wet and muddy feet (though you can let your child play in the water bare foot and in a swim suit, as long as the temperature permits and you are not out to long)!;
, Take your child to the local indoor playground, a gym, or the YMCA. If that is not practical or possible, let your child take a bath full of splashing, bubbles, bath toys, pots and pans, bath markers/crayons, plastic dolls, glow sticks, animal-shaped sponges/washcloths, bath clings, and great scents. Your toddler could also take a shower if they are comfortable with it. Punch a pillow, throw beanbags, run in place, bang on drums, have a jumping contest, just get rid of all of that extra energy!

, Place the following things in the rainy day box with everything new:new crayons, stickers, paints, and paper, new Play-Dough, a new stuffed animal and accessories, a few new books, a new recipe to make and supplies for it, a new toy, a new DVD, a new music tape.

You can also put some puzzles or messy food such as yogurt or pudding to play around in on your toddler's high chair tray. Sit your child in a gated playpen with at least 10 new, favorite, or old toys and books. Hang a mobile over the changing table to look at and attach a pinwheel to the side with tape to watch and play with, under adult supervision.

, Sweep the floor together, wash the tables, water the plants, make beds, set the table, wash dishes, clean the playroom, and make a meal.

, Play on some online learning websites for toddlers, let your toddler play on appropriate apps on your phone or IPad, watch a little TV (no more than an hour). Let these be a lifesaver but, don't use these for over 1 hour (60 minutes). You don't want to get your toddler addicted.

, Try to read books, dim the lights, have a snack of milk and cookies, sing songs, and lay down. You are definitely going to need a break but don't make a child nap more than usual!

, Give your child the bed sheets and let him/her make forts with them, tents, and houses. Try to throw rolled up socks or balls into a laundry basket. Hide a stuffed animal or doll in the house to find. Place dry rice inside a small, plastic tub for your toddler to mix around and sit in.

, Read a lot of potty books, watch some potty movies or videos from online, sing along to a potty CD, and print out a potty coloring page to color.

Look for disrespectful behavior.,
Notice how your child interacts with their siblings and friends.,
Recognize what's ""normal"" behavior for your child.,
Determine what constitutes ""problem"" behavior for their age.,
Talk with teachers.,
Have a conversation with other authority figures.",How to Know if Your Child Has an Attitude Problem1," A child with an attitude problem will probably disrespect your authority, or the authority of other adults like teachers. Watch out for small indicators of disrespect like eye-rolling and door-slamming, as well as bigger problems like talking back and breaking rules., It’s normal for kids to squabble now and then, but if your child always has a hard time getting along with their siblings and peers, then that’s cause for concern. Stay on the alert for bullying behaviors like teasing and pushiness. In addition, notice whether your child struggles with social skills like sharing and compromise.A child who is constantly aggressive to their siblings may indicate attitude problems.If you have an older child or teenager, pay attention to the way they talk about their friends, even if you don’t see many of their interactions.

, At certain ages, children and adolescents commonly test the limits. This can appear to be an attitude problem when it's actually a normal aspect of development. For instance, toddlers and preschoolers may talk back or throw tantrums to see what they can get away with. Teenagers might break the rules you set in an attempt to assert their individuality. These behaviors don’t mean you’re doing anything wrong as a parent.
You should still correct negative behaviors, even if they’re part of a normal developmental stage.

, Take your child’s age into consideration when determining if behavior is problematic. Although some testing of limits is typical, you should be cautious if your child has trouble controlling their emotions, managing their impulses, or correcting behaviors after being disciplined.For instance, if your 10-year-old has explosive outbursts and tantrums when she doesn't get her way, this may indicate a problem.
Similarly, if your teen seems to impulsively lie to you, even when caught, this may be proof of a more serious underlying problem.
Having an attitude problem may also be a sign of internal discomfort that your child can’t verbalize. If your child is having discomfort, then they might be acting out because of that.

, Beyond parents, teachers are the other adults who generally have the most contact with your child. Reach out to your child's teacher(s) to see if they have noticed a problem with their attitude.


You might say, ""Ms. Hannah, I'm noticing that Billy is talking back a lot at home. Are you having any trouble with his behavior at school?""
Getting an understanding of your child's behavior on a global scale can help you recognize if any acting out is contextual, or if they are having problems in many areas of life., Coaches, school counselors, youth leaders and other adults who know your child can fill you in on how they act when you’re not around. For example, if your child is on a sports team, then you could ask about how they interact with other members of the team, or even observe them yourself. If you’re worried about your child’s attitude, make an appointment to discuss their behavior with some of these people.


You might say, “I’ve noticed some undesirable behaviors at home and wanted to get your take. Has anything happened lately that caught your eye?”

Consider whether your child could have a learning disability.,
Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of ADHD.,
Be on the lookout for signs of mental illness.,
Consider the prospect of bullying.",How to Know if Your Child Has an Attitude Problem2," Undiagnosed learning disabilities like dyslexia can make an ordinarily well-behaved kid seem to have a bad attitude at times. A child with a learning disability might be a chronic underachiever at school, which can be mistaken for laziness. They might also refuse to participate in classroom activities that are difficult for them.If your child struggles with reading, writing, or math, discuss the problem with their teacher and ask the school to evaluate their abilities.
Problems with organization and memory can also indicate a learning disability.

, A child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) might have a hard time listening and following directions. This can make them seem badly behaved, even if they don’t intend to be.


A child with ADHD may frequently neglect their homework and chores. , Conditions like depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder are sometimes mistaken for an attitude problem in kids and teens. If your child has been acting out of character lately, consider whether their unusual behavior matches the symptoms of a mental illness.Unusually withdrawn behavior, extreme mood swings, and aggressiveness or defiance are a few behavioral red flags that could indicate a mental illness.
If you are worried about your child’s mental health, take them to the doctor. Don’t jump to conclusions about your child’s mental health. It is important to seek professional help for them if you suspect a problem.

, If your child is being bullied or abused at school or somewhere else, such trauma can contribute to a change in attitude. Children who are bullied may also suffer from isolation, anxiety, depression, or mistrust. Any of these variables could be playing a role in your child's emotional and/or behavioral functioning.You might sit your child down and talk to them about bullying. Say something to the effect of ""When I was in school kids often picked on each other. Have you ever been picked on at school? Have you ever witnessed bullying?""
Consider your child’s relationships with siblings, family members, and friends as well. If they are experiencing stress sin on of these areas, then they are more likely to develop problems.

Stay calm when your child talks back or disobeys you.,
Set consequences for poor behavior.,
Set a good example.,
Be patient.",How to Know if Your Child Has an Attitude Problem3," Take a deep breath and keep your cool, even if you feel angry or hurt. Avoid shouting at your child or saying something you’ll regret later. Keep your reply level-headed while making it clear that their behavior is not acceptable.For example, you could say something like, “We don’t talk like that in this house. Try again in a politer tone of voice.”
If you overreact or raise your voice, your child will get the message that you aren’t in control of the situation.
If you’re too angry to handle the situation calmly, take a short “time-out” to cool down before you talk to your child.

, Tell your child what will happen if they behave with a bad attitude, and enforce your rules. Your child will be more likely to take you seriously and adjust their behavior if it impacts them directly.Choose logical consequences. For instance, you might decide that if your tween refuses to stop texting at the dinner table, they will lose their phone privileges the next day.
Invite your child to help you come up with consequences for negative behaviors. They’ll be more likely to think the rules are fair if they helped make them.

, Your kids learn from you, so show them what a good attitude looks like. Pay attention to your own behavior and be aware that your child may pick things up by watching you, such as a negative attitude. Treat other people with courtesy and respect, and maintain a positive outlook whenever you can. Avoid complaining excessively or speaking rudely.If you have a negative attitude yourself, don’t be surprised when your child picks it up from you.

, It takes time to unlearn bad habits and replace them with good ones. Praise your child when you can see they’re working hard to improve their attitude. Avoid getting angry if they slip back into old habits – instead, remind them about what kind of behavior you expect from them.It takes three weeks to create a habit. If your child has had an attitude problem for a while, allow at least this long for them to adjust their behavior.

Explain the birth mother's decision.,
Emphasize that you love your child and will never give her up.,
Keep communication open.,
Expand on the story as the child grows older.,
Be supportive to connections with your child's origins.",How to Tell a Child He or She Is Adopted," Many people who work with adopted children recommend casually using the word ""adoption"" as early as possible, so it does not sound strange. You can do this before the child knows she is adopted, or you can be open about the adoption from the beginning.
, Do not wait until the child is an adolescent, as this is more likely to cause long-term resentment and anger. Past that, there is not universal agreement on when to tell the child. These guidelines can help you make the decision:If you adopted the child after the age of two, or if his ethnicity is obviously different than yours, tell him as soon as possible. He may already suspect and worry.
Many parents and experts recommend telling the child right away, being open and honest about the adoption and how happy they are about the decision.
Whether or not the child knows from a young age, be prepared for an in-depth conversation when the child is ready, often at four or five years old. Some experts prefer to wait until six to eight, but by this time some children will already have doubts.

, Never lie to your child about the story of her adoption. You can limit the explanation to facts appropriate for the child's age, but keep the story truthful and consistent. Your child will ask questions later on, and may feel betrayed if the new information contradicts what you've said in the past., One of the most common questions an adopted child asks is ""Why did my birth mother give me up?"" Make sure your child knows his birth mother loved him, and was not a bad person or trying to abandon him. Describe the situation in terms appropriate to the child's age. (For example, ""she wasn't married and couldn't take care of a baby on her own."")

This is one of the main worries for children between the ages of five and seven.Avoid using the phrase ""she gave you up because she loved you"" with young children (although you should emphasize the love part). This can give a confusing message when you say that you love your child too., This is another common concern of young children. Tell your child she is a part of the family that you will always care for, that you are very happy you adopted her, and that you love her., Your child should feel welcome to ask you more questions about his birth family, or about adoption. Give him your full attention and make an effort to answer his fears or curiosity. Many children will have a strong emotional reaction later on, even if they were calm when they heard the news.

If the answer is not appropriate for the child's age, say ""That's a hard question"" and give a shortened or simplified version, without lying. Do not say ""You'll find out when your older,"" which could cause resentment.

, When your child is seven to nine years old, she is usually ready to handle more difficult information, such as that her birth mother is dead, or that she was a teenage mother. This also predates the teenage years, when communication becomes more difficult.She will likely start this herself by asking more detailed questions about what her birth family was like.

Make it clear that you were telling the truth before. For example, you may have said the birth mother was too sick to care for the child, and later you tell the child she is dead. Connect these stories by saying ""Your birth mother was sick, and then she died.""

, At the ages of nine to twelve, most children are worried about fitting in. Your child may become sensitive to facial features that look different from yours, and ask questions about his birth family.Making contact with the birth family is often not possible or a good idea, but you can form a connection by learning about that family's culture. On your side, it's important to remember that your child is not rejecting you when he expresses this curiosity. Support his efforts to understand his origins.

It's up to you to decide whether you can make contact with a biological parent or sibling in a way that's safe emotionally and physically. Keep in mind that your child will be able to make the decision himself as an adult. If you want to supervise this effort, you may want to allow it while he is a teenager.

, If you can manage funds for grocery shopping, sports and recreation activities, tuition and the other expenses that come with children, your work expense reports should not be complicated.

, Solutions are essential when it comes to dealing with problems as a parent. Approach work problems with the same creativity, motivation and flexibility.

, As a parent, you know that the world is larger than your office or your company. Be humble and empathetic to others.


Promote work and life balance at your company, especially if you supervise other employees who are parents. Permit them to leave early or come in late when there are school functions or child care issues that need their attention.

, Set a good example for your colleagues, the same way you do for your children. Arrive at work on time, work hard, treat others well and always meet your deadlines and fulfill your responsibilities.


Mentor other parents in your office, especially if they are new to parenting or to the company. Help them to recognize the skills they learned as a parent, and put them to use at work.

, When things get stressful at work, think about how you handle a preschooler who refuses to get dressed or a child who will not eat vegetables.


Use positive reinforcement, consequences and other methods of behavior modification that you learned as a parent.

, Ask them what it feels like. If they are stuck, ask things like, does it feel bumpy or smooth? Hot or cold? Soft or hard? This can be a learning experience if you include simple (but fun) activities in your pumpkin patch adventure.

, If they get stuck, ask things like, what colour is it? Is it big or small? Is it tall or short? This is another fun learning activity!

, If you don't want to bring a big pumpkin home, ask them to select a small one.

, Ask them questions about their trip, and ask them how they want to decorate their pumpkins.

Find some good water bottles at the store, and buy them for your kids.,
Do some water activities together.,
Share some fruits that are high in water.,
Teach them about water safety.",How to Teach Your Kids the Importance of Water," Especially when it's hot outside and they're getting sweaty, ensuring that they are well hydrated is a very essential factor. A water bottle is also a good option when you don't have access to water glasses or a cooler.

Try buying a stainless steel bottle over a plastic one. This is a better choice because, one might absorb and swallow a toxin, and that toxin was filtrated into the water. Drinking from a plastic bottle can also result in the catch of a disease called bisphenol-A (BPA for short), and it can lead to different types of cancers, problems with productiveness, diabetes, and stunted growth. However, stainless steel bottles were made from 18/8 food grade steel. This steel does not contain holes, and is pretty much the same as the material you see in cooking equipment and silverware. It is the safest replacement when you intend to stop drinking from plastic bottles. Be sure to have your kids take along a water bottle with them at school. Yes, they can get permission from their teacher(s) to leave the classroom for the water fountain, but it is important to them to stay hydrated while they are learning. This also keeps your kids from having to take several trips to the water fountain, thus making them less thirsty and not miss out on a lot of good learning.






Ask your kids each what their favorite bottles are (a bottle has a cool design, decorations, etc), and see if you can find that bottle at a store. They will definitely be more absorbed with water if drinking from a favorite water bottle. Try picking a favorite water bottle yourself and buying it, so the kids are better encouraged to do so. This will also teach them the importance of drinking water with a sample.






You can also try allowing your kids to add some ""toppings"" into their water bottles, including berries and a slice of orange...whatever they like! This will make the water more tasty for them.

;
, Doing water activities is entertaining, effective in teaching your children about the importance of water, and will definitely cool everyone off during the summer! Swimming is refreshing and gives you good exercise, but you should try some other activities as well, such as walking in an ocean or river, or even canoeing!

, Even though a glass of water is good and keeps you adequately hydrated, there is enough water in some fruits you consume, too!

Try cutting and eating cantaloupe, which is a light yellow-orange melon in the cucumber family. It is refreshing, has about 90% water, and also has a good amount of Vitamin A, which can help get rid of dry skin. It also lowers stress levels, has a good amount of Vitamin C (Vitamin C works in the parts of your body that have soluble water, and functions as a stimulus to your white blood cells), and is good for smokers (because the effects of smoking are turned backward, and you have a lower risk of getting emphysema or other diseases in your lungs like that). A watermelon is another good choice. It consists of over 90% water, is high in protein (and the seeds consist of a lot of it), lowers your blood pressure and problems with your arteries, and can even improve metabolic syndrome (some medical disarray that makes the risk of coronary artery disease, Type 2 diabetes, and some kind of stroke, go up).Try eating some strawberries. They are a very good choice because they have approximately 92% water, don't have many calories (about 54 per cup), have a lot of fiber, and can even help with short term memory (this is done by 100% in approximately 8 weeks by the anthocyanins). Strawberries can also lower the risk of cardiovascular (heart) disease, which is caused by the flavonoids they have (which make the color and flavor in strawberries). , Make sure that they know what to do when they swim too deep, to always swim while an adult is watching, to make sure that a lifeguard is always there, and how to prevent themselves from drowning.

Teach your child that charity is not only about money.,
Let your child understand the long process and the effectiveness of charity.,
Bring the child to various places around the world where people are living in harsh conditions.,
Discuss with the child about how important charity is.,
Tell your child that you should feel good about helping others and the victims who are helped would always be happy to help you too.,
If the child is still negotiating, ask your child to live a life like people in developing countries (but obviously not supplying your child with unclean water etc.).,
Once the child has understood charity, ask them in what ways they can contribute.,
Ask your child to spread the knowledge with his or her friends and tell them how much you have contributed to charity.,
Explain to them why you should not live a life like them.",How to Teach Your Children About Charity," It is about helping a victim with anything such as donating blood, spending time with others, giving people presents, giving people education etc. so they can learn.;
, Tell them what it does to people and how much people from all over the world appreciate it. Do research and provide your child with the evidence about what the money from charity has went to so they can understand the truths of what it does.


Always tell them that if charity does not do anything, then why are people still constantly donate their money and time to people when they are negotiating with the phenomenon.

, You should tell the child to ask them what charity has done to them so they would understand the concept. Bring them to places where charity has turned into something good helping others.

, Tell them that they are lucky enough to have a happy life and then tell them how different their life is compared to a homeless or an orphan's life. It should give them a much better understanding.

,


Tell them how much it means to a victim. Without help from other people, they might suffer dramatically and tell that they need you.
They might also think: 'Why won't the people work for themselves' or: 'It's their own problem, not mine'. Remember that they just cannot work or they do work but they are paid less than $2 USD per day or they don't even get any funds. Ask your child is he/she wanted to work in the fields all day in places where there are dangerous animals and places where the sun is unbearable. Also, it is not their fault, it the way the world is organised.
For example: A person might not be educated because the place they are in lacks education therefore making it hard for them to find a suitable job.

, Don't wash the dishes and tell them to or don't let them have snacks. Remember not to make the punishment to harsh; it is just teaching your child!

, They can contribute by giving their old clothes, shoes, toys, helping an elderly or victim with jobs such as washing the dishes or even money or giving blood to other people. You can also tell your child to give in a toy to a child in need of support hand-to-hand.


Ask your child if he/she wants to compare life with a victim.

Take advantage of breaks to play.If you watch television as a family, make commercial breaks active time.,
Interact with your child and the screen.,
Play together with your children.,
Model the behaviors you want to see.,
Purchase games that encourage movement.,
Act out scenes in real life.,
Change up your home environment.,
Understand the risks and benefits of screen time.,
Set limits for screen time.,
Use screen time as a reward.Reward good behavior with screen time.,
Notice signs of too much screen time.",How to Use Screen Time to Encourage Physical Play," Hold a contest to see who can do the most pushups or situps. Have special activities that you do as a family when breaks occur in screen time.


For example, have your children create a dance together or an art project during breaks, then show it off at the end of the show.
Have challenges your kids compete for during breaks. For example, say, “Who can hold a handstand for the longest time? Who can do the most yoga poses before the show comes back on?”;
, This is especially good if you have a young child. Use screen time to encourage language development and motor skills.Interact with your child about what is happening on the screen. For example, if you are drawing together, ask your child to get the blue marker or to talk about what your child is creating.


Create a dialog and talk about themes. Exchange ideas and describe concepts for your child, similar to how you would interact with a book. If your child is playing a game, say, “Wow, you jumped over that green monster!” or, “Why do you think that happened? How did you do that?”

, Participate with your children during play time.Whether with a screen or not, actively engage what your children’s activities. You can play group games on phone applications or participate in 2-player video games that encourage movement.


Playing together with your children helps you to bond and enjoy the experiences together.
Create a weekly game night with your family. Even if you don’t have board games, lots of multi-player games are available through video game consoles and phone applications.

, Children learn a lot from modeling their parent’s behaviors, especially in early childhood. If you spend a lot of time watching television or being on the computer, don’t be surprised if your child chooses similar activities.Encourage your child to play by playing yourself and playing together with your child.


Spend some time engaging in play after school. For example, jump on the trampoline with your children or take the dog for a walk. Minimize your own screen time.

, Many video games require active participation as part of the game. Buy your children video games that they can interact with on a physical level to get your child moving and fit.For example, purchase video games that encourage learning music with an instrument or that require movement and physical activity. Use your child’s love of video games to encourage play and activity.


Some video games are specifically designed to encourage physical activity and fitness. See which ones appeal to your child. For example, try Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), wii fit, and Winds of Orbis.

, Draw inspiration from tv shows, video games, and applications to act them out in real life. Use the characters from screens and bring them to life in other ways. For example, your children can use characters from a video game to create a play or an obstacle course outside.


Encourage your children to dress up as the characters and act out scenes with their peers or siblings. For example, if your children enjoy superheroes, allow them to wear costumes and use their superpowers in their own play.
Let your children put their own twist on their play and create new scenarios for the characters, such as running through the jungle (the yard) or confronting new foes (like your pet cat).

, Make play appealing for everyone in your home. Rearrange furniture and purchase some inexpensive equipment outside.Instead of arranging the family room around the television, arrange it to encourage discussions or play. Place the television in a smaller room or somewhere with less focus in the home.


Make your television secondary to play. Or, have your room set up to encourage active games rather than sitting games. For example, clear space in your family room for dancing games.

, Screen time has some benefits, such as engaging children with technology. Interacting with technology is a large part in many adult’s lives, and it’s important for children to begin to enter this world as they develop. Educational programs and applications can help your child learn skills and gain knowledge. Screens also allow for your children to communicate and have relationships with friends and family who live far away.However, some children become glued to screens all day, which can impact emotional and social well-being.Over-exposure to screens can potentially affect a child’s ability to concentrate.

, Children under the age of two should not have any screen time. For children between the ages of two and five, screen time should be limited to one hour per day.Try setting a rule to limit screen time to one or two hours per day, depending on your child's age. Most importantly, enforce the rule.Create rewards for following the rules, and consider having incentives for less screen time. Possible rewards can include more allowance or fewer chores.


Follow your own rules involving screen time. For example, your children may be upset if you limit their screen time but spend much of each night watching television or surfing the internet

, For example, your child may come home from karate practice and be allowed 15 minutes of screen time. This can get your child excited to do activities and then also be rewarded afterward.


Let your child “earn” screen time by doing certain activities. For example, say, “Once you finish your chores, you can watch one tv show” or, “You can play on your tablet after dinner. Before dinner, you can play with your toys in the toy room.”

, Children who spend a lot of time in front of screens tend to have a higher obesity rate, lower levels of physical fitness, and problems with mental and social development.Too much screen time can negatively affect your child’s overall health and well-being.


Your kid may have too much screen time if they are sad, lonely, isolated from friends and family, or withdrawn.

Encourage your kids to discuss the characters afterward.,
Talk about who you think showed integrity.,
Talk about character in everyday life.,
Remember to model character.,
Discuss appropriate behaviors.,
Hold up characters in other situations.",How to Use Movies to Help Kids Build Character," While some younger kids are more mature, generally, you don't want a story line that will go right over their head. Similarly, you don't want to lose older kids by showing them movies that are too simplistic. Try to pick something that works for the age the kid is at.For kids two- to seven-years old, make sure the story is fairly simple, and that plot supports the idea you're trying to get across, as it needs to be glaringly obvious. Also, while animated movies will do the job, kids may learn more empathy from seeing live people.
For kids eight- to nine-years-old, you'll need to follow similar rules. However, humor works really well with this age group, as long as it's not making fun of the trait you want to build. Also, a character's actions should be connected to consequences, but it should primarily be showing positive examples of the trait.
For kids over nine, it's time to start letting things get more complex. Tweens and teens can handle more complex characters and plot lines; when a movie is too obvious, they're likely to dismiss it. Also, the movie should have characters they can see themselves in.;
, While different people will define character differently, you should have an understanding of what you're trying to teach as you pick out movies. That way, as you choose, you can decide on movies that emphasize the traits you want. For instance, one definition of character considers character to be made up of the following six traits: citizenship, caring, respect, fairness, trustworthiness, and responsibility. Once you have an understanding of the traits you want to teach, you'll need to work on finding movies that exemplify those traits.While some movies might emphasize several of these traits at once, others may focus on a single trait.
Do some research on what defines character, and also think about what traits you'd really like to emphasize with your children. Of course, what you emphasize can change in relation to what's going on in the child's life.

, As you're choosing movies for your kids, watch them first to see if they exemplify the traits you want to develop in your kids. You could even take a few character notes so you're ready to ask your kids questions later. Also, evaluate them to see if they're really something you want your kids to be seeing.


If you're not sure where to begin, try using an internet database that lists movies by traits of character, such as this one: http://www.teachwithmovies.org/ethical-emphasis-index.htm.

, When building character, it can help pick movies with characters your kids can identify with. That means picking movies with characters that are like them in some way. For instance, it could be the movie stars a girl just like your daughter or a boy who is a bit shy like your son. If they're able to see themselves in the character, the lesson may stick better.

, One way to help them engage with the movie is to have them think about what they'd do in the character's place. This exercise forces them to consider what the character is going through and how they might react in a similar situation. Role-playing can help children empathize with others, as well.You can even have an ""intermission"" for the movie when you stop and think about these questions (perhaps under the guise of refilling popcorn or going to the bathroom).
You could say something like, ""Gee, Princess Anna is faced with a hard decision. What do you think she should do?""

, As the movie plays on, if something bad happens, ask your kids questions that can open a conversation about morals. It's another form of role-playing, but one that can help your children analyze why characters did what they did or what might have happened if things had been done differently.For instance, you might ask something like, ""Who do you not like in the movie? What did they do that made you not like them? How do their actions affect other people in the movie? How would you feel if you were treated that way by someone? How might they have acted differently to do better?""

, Once the movie is over, spend some talking with your kids. Get them talking about who showed character in the movie. You could even ask them how they could show similar character in everyday life through their actions.For example, you could say, ""Who do you think showed the most character? Why do you think so? What did she do that showed character?"" Of course, your kids will need to understand character a bit first. You could simplify the questions by asking about a specific trait: ""Who do you think showed trustworthiness in the movie?""
You could also ask, ""How do you think you could be like Anna in your everyday life?""

, For younger kids, especially, you could discuss who you think showed the most character in the movie, though you don't have to use those exact words. Rather, just discuss the good they did in the movie, and why it was good.You could say, ""Marlin proved that he loved Nemo because he went across the whole ocean to find him. Isn't that an incredibly caring thing to do?""

, While movies can help you teach kids about character, it won't stick unless they already know where you stand. Try incorporating discussions about character into your everyday discussions, based on things that happen in you or your kids' lives, what's going on in the news, or what they see on the television. You can also bring it back to the movies they've been watching, to emphasize the lesson.When situations come up, try to talk through them. For instance, if you see someone on television who got a community award, discuss the traits that helped get that person there. You could say, ""See that person on television. She got an award for volunteering at the food bank. It takes a very caring person who's concerned about others to work that hard to benefit the community. What a good person, sort of like that movie we watched the other night.""
It's also important to talk about people who's character you admire. For example, you might talk about why you believe Martin Luther King, Jr. had strong character.

, Your kids follow what you do, so if you're not modeling strong character, they will notice. They'll notice when you respond with kindness, when you stand up for justice, and when you prove yourself trustworthy. For young children, try talking through your actions, such as saying, ""Today, I showed respect to my boss by replying a respectful manner, much like the character did in the movie we watched.""The simplest way to show character is to live a life where you show others respect, out of love, and admit when you've made a mistake.

, Kids may not understand something like you telling them to be ""kind."" That's too abstract. You have to tell them what a kind action would be in the situation, so they understand how to act. It can help to point back to how a character acted in a movie.""For example, you can help your kids learn responsibility by giving them chores around the house. If they complain, tell them being responsible means doing things you have to do even when you don't want to. You could give them example, such as, ""Sometimes, I don't want to cook dinner because I'm tired. However, I do it because I try to be responsible.""
You could also teach them how to be caring by asking leading questions or telling them directly. For example, if a sibling is sick, ask them, ""What would you like from your siblings if you were sick? What can you do to help them feel better? What would Anna do for her sister?""

, You can also use characters as an example when you're trying to emphasize what a good action would be in that situation. Kids can identify with how the character acted and may implement a similar action in their own lives.For example, if you're child is having trouble with being caring with siblings, you could say something like, ""You know, Anna cared deeply for her sister, and she worked hard to try to be there for her sister. What do you think Anna would do in this situation?""

Practice consideration.",How to Teach Values," Kids look to the adults in their lives as role models, and the earliest lessons they learn about developing values tend to come through imitation.


If you say one thing but do another, you can easily send your kids mixed signals.
For instance, if you want your kids to learn cooperation and compassion, you might encourage them to share their toys. If they see you take something that belongs to someone else or refuse to share a resource of yours when needed, however, they can easily come to doubt the importance of those values.;
, Talk about what life was like for you when you were the same relative age as your kids. Discuss the difficulties and triumphs you had in developing your current value system.


Make sure that the stories you tell are true and avoid exaggerating any details.
For example, try telling your child about a time when you were tempted to cheat on a school assignment. If you resisted the temptation, explain your reasoning and how your honesty was a positive influence. If you didn't resist the temptation, explain any negative internal and external consequences that followed.

, If your values are derived from a religious faith, for instance, teach that faith to your kids. It is important for them to understand where your values come from when learning why those values are important.


It can be especially helpful to expose your children to a community that holds the same value system, like a church. Doing so can provide them with even more role models.

, You cannot—and should not—completely shelter your kids from outside influences. You should, however, be aware of the other influences acting on your child's development. Both good and bad values can be taught to them by others.


Others who play a big role in influencing your child might include relatives, teachers, coaches, friends, and friends' relatives.
Ask about the beliefs and values that these individuals hold dear.
You do not need to completely prohibit your kids from interacting with someone whose values differ, but talk with your child after he or she spends time with that person to make sure that the negative influence isn't rubbing off.

, When your child breaks the rules or ignores a value you've set down, demonstrate that the behavior is unwanted by issuing a fair punishment for the misdeed.


The consequences need to match the crime. For instance, taking the last piece of cake when it belonged to someone else in the family is a less serious offense than cheating on a test at school, so the punishment for the former should be less than that issued for the latter.

, Your kids will not be able to learn values from you if you neglect them. Spending time with them demonstrates how important it is to care for others, and it also gives them a chance to learn from your example.


Oftentimes, children who misbehave from a young age do so for the sake of gaining attention. If you demonstrate that positive behavior gets just as much attention as negative behavior, if not more, then the positive behavior will seem more appealing.

, Growing up is difficult. There are many things your kids will have trouble figuring out as they grow, and they will inevitably make some mistakes. Let them know that they have your unconditional love so that they feel comfortable turning to you for advice when they wrestle with matters of right and wrong.

, When you talk to your kids about values, ask them questions that really make them think about the topic. Avoid spelling things out for them. The lesson will be more firmly fixed if they are allowed to reach the conclusion on their own.


For example, instead of saying, ""He should not have lied to his friends like that,"" ask, ""Do you think what he did was wrong?"" or ""How do you think he should have handled the situation?""
Asking your kids a question can trigger a conversation about values. It also forces them to mull over important issues, and the conclusions they draw are more likely to last longer than conclusions drawn for them.

, Listen to your kids' doubts, concerns, struggles, and questions. Stay firm, but keep an open mind. Questions are a good sign that your kids are thinking about the matter seriously.


If your child questions a value you have taught from a young age, try to stay patient and calm about it. Exploding at him or her will usually make the child want to rebel even more. Discussing the matter calmly will make it easier for a child to accept your opinion as valid.

, You need to stand as an authority figure, but at the same time, you also want to talk about values in a comfortable, casual setting that will keep your kids at ease. Most people—especially kids—are more receptive to information shared during a conversation than information thrown at them from a soapbox.


When your child does something wrong, briefly explain what was wrong and issue an appropriate punishment. Do not begin preaching about why the action was wrong while everyone is still angry and upset, though.
Instead, wait until both you and your child have calmed down. Rather than fixating on your disappointment, talk about the wishes you have for your child and how you would prefer to see your child demonstrate those values in the future.

, Many values are personal and need to be developed internally, but you can set expectations and rules governing the outward display of values. Set these expectations fairly and make sure that your kids are clear about what they are.


The desire to please one's parents by meeting their expectations is a fairly instinctive one. If you set high expectations that include meaningful values, your child will most likely aim to reach these expectations.

, The more often you talk about the beliefs and values you want to pass down, the more natural those values will seem. Frequent conversation is a good way to keep the topic on their minds more consistently.


It's important that these conversations take place when your child behaves well or behaves in a neutral manner. If you only talk about values when he or she misbehaves, the topic can easily take on a negative connotation.

, Let your kids know that you love them. Tell them every day. When children know that they are loved, it is easier for them to understand that your expectations and the values you are trying to teach are ultimately for their benefit.


Showing love is very important, but even if you constantly show your kids love, you also need to speak words of love to them on a regular basis.

, Morals and values have been conveyed through stories for centuries. Read with your kids or introduce books to them that convey the types of values you are trying to instill.


At a young age, fairy tales can be an excellent choice.
While kids are still in a formative period, the best books are those in which the boundary between right and wrong is clearly defined.
Books that discuss morally gray topics should be saved until after an adolescent has already developed a strong moral foundation.
Regardless of the book, it's best to read through it together or to have a thorough understanding of it before your child picks it up. Doing so will make it easier for you to discuss the contents of the book and any questions it may raise about values.

, Limit the types of movies, television shows, and games you allow your kids to view. It can also be a wise idea to limit the amount of time your kids spend with these forms of entertainment.


Even positive media sources are not as valuable as active learning opportunities. Kids learn more through hands-on experience than they do through passive observation.
Make sure that most of the media your kids view demonstrates positive moral values, especially when a child is under the age of 7 or 8. Studies indicate that kids who watch such shows are more likely to be respectful than those who regularly watch violent material.Restricting controversial material once a child reaches adolescence should be done with some caution, though. It is better to discuss why the behavior or content of a show is bad than to simply prohibit the child from watching it without any further discussion.

, Encourage your kids to do community service and other forms of volunteer work. Better yet, make it a family affair by volunteering alongside them.


Among other things, volunteer work can encourage generosity, responsibility, and compassion.
One idea might be to volunteer your help for an elderly neighbor. Encourage your kids to mow that neighbor's lawn or go with them and deliver some home-baked treats.

, One of the most basic, classic ways to start building values in your child is to assign daily and weekly chores. Be clear about the chores your child is responsible for and how much allowance he or she will receive in return for completing them thoroughly and punctually.


Chores teach kids about the importance of responsibility and the benefits of hard work.

, Encourage your child to join a sports team. If he or she isn't interested in sports, look for other team activities worth joining, like a debate team, yearbook committee, or trivia team.


Teamwork is the most obvious value being taught here, but joining a team can also encourage kids to learn about values like dedication, responsibility, and humility.

, Sit down with your child and make notes for your loved ones from scratch. These notes can be “thank you” notes, holiday cards, or “thinking of you” cards.


""Thank you"" cards teach gratitude.
Holiday cards and ""thinking of you"" cards teach consideration and kindness.
By hand-making the cards, you can also encourage creativity.

, Challenges are an unavoidable part of life. Encouraging children to face controlled challenges while they are still young can instill in them the values and ethics they need to make it through the uncontrollable challenges of adolescence and adulthood.


Consider planting a garden with your kids. Gardening can be a challenging task, but it can teach kids about perseverance. If you plant edible crops, you can also teach your kids about self-reliance.
In a more general sense, you can encourage your kids to do things that don't come easily. Encourage a shy child to approach new kids on the playground. Encourage a temperamental child to calm down instead of exploding when something goes wrong. When your kids manage to do something that is difficult for them, praise them for it., Look for ways to encourage your kids to think of the circumstances and feelings of others. Many values can be developed and strengthened once a person learns empathy.


At a young age, you could flip through a magazine with your child and ask him or her to identify emotions based on what the pictures show.
At any age, you can play the ""buddy game"" with your kids. Put the names of everyone in the family into a hat. Everyone should draw a name at the start of the day, and throughout the rest of the day, each person should look for ways to do something nice for his or her randomly selected ""buddy."""
"
Be selective about the parenting books and blogs you read.,
Choose one or two people to ask for advice.,
Don't listen to marketing.,
Take the time to be fully present.,
Don’t second-guess yourself.,
Focus on what your body is telling you.,
Know that all your child really needs is your love and care.,
Educate yourself on established safety guidelines.,
Be open to advice in situations you’re unfamiliar with.,
Be open to advice from authority figures.,
Take your instincts about discipline into consideration.",How to Trust Your Parenting Instincts," There are as many parenting styles as there are parents, and if you try to follow every piece of advice you come across, you’ll quickly become confused and discouraged. Listening to too much advice can drown out the voice of your own intuition. Find just a few good parenting resources that resonate with you, and leave the rest.For example, many parenting books are meant to be inclusive of all sorts of issues and concerns. Many times they suggest taking conservative routes, such as buying all organic fruits and veggies. If you can't afford this, or your other children developed just fine on regular produce, continue to do what you think is best for your family.
Try to identify the source on which these resources are based to determine their credibility to you. It is fine to read the opinions of others, but know if these are based on personal experience or research and science.;
, If you’re nervous or unsure about your parenting abilities, it’s natural to seek out advice from other people. Trying to follow everyone else’s advice about how to raise your child is a certain way to suppress your own parenting instincts, though. Pick one or two people you trust, such as your mother or a close friend, and go to them for advice when you’re feeling lost.If you have a close friend who seems to have it together in the parenting department, call on her for tough-to-answer questions. You might say, ""Jennifer, you are my role model when it comes to parenting... What's you opinion on letting the baby self-soothe?""
Know how to firmly decline unsolicited input or pressure from people you didn't choose. Have a brief sentence prepared so that you don't get pulled into a discussion you don't wish to be a part of. You could say, ""We're following the instructions of our doctor,"" or simply ""I'll keep that in mind"" and discuss it no further

, With all the commercials and advertisements for the latest gear, you might feel like you have to purchase all the right things to take care of your baby correctly. While it’s true that you’ll need a few essentials, know that it’s OK to keep things simple. Your love and attention are more important for your baby’s health and development than any bassinets, clothes, or wipe warmers could ever be.Some parents pride themselves on purchasing the latest gadgets for their children; however, there are usually lower-budget alternatives that work just as well. Visit a store and ask an employee explain the features of different products, or compare different options using online reviews or consumer reports.

, To get in touch with your instincts, practice being in the moment. Turn off the TV, put down your phone, take a deep breath, and focus on what’s happening around you.If you’re an overwhelmed, sleep-deprived new parent, taking time to focus on the present moment might feel like a tough task sometimes. Remember that just a few minutes of mindfulness a day can help you develop your instincts.
For instance, if you breastfeed your newborn, don’t use that time to check your phone or work on your to-do list. Instead, pause for a moment and focus on the experience of bonding with your baby.
Mindfulness is also a great coping skill for postpartum anxiety and can help your baby attach firmly to you — benefitting them for life., You are the primary expert on your child, so don’t feel like you have to make all your parenting decisions based on other people’s advice. Your first instinct is usually correct. If you feel like your baby is sick or your older child is hiding something from you, you are probably right.In some cases, your family members or doctor may tell you that what your child is experiencing is common; however, if you feel deep down in your gut that something is wrong, it's better to trust your instincts. Get a second (or third) opinion to be sure., If your mind is getting in the way of your instincts, listen to your body instead. Notice how you feel when you make various parenting decisions. Do you feel calm and sure? Do you have an uneasy sensation in your stomach? Your body’s signals will rarely steer you wrong.If you have made the decision to breastfeed, for example, but you suffer from unbearable pain and engorgement, you may choose to revise your decision. It may be difficult to decide to bottle-feed your baby, but it's also a good thing to listen to and trust your body.
The state of your body is important to the baby feeling safe and secure. Consider re-evaluating any decision that is creating a lot of physical or emotional pain for you or your baby.

, Issues like what to feed your child, how to dress them, and when to put them down for a nap might seem important now, but they won’t make or break your child’s future. There are many valid approaches to parenting, and as long as you follow safe practices and have your child’s best interests at heart, your child will probably turn out fine., There are some circumstances where it’s essential to listen to the experts (such as the American Academy of Pediatrics or comparable entities in other countries), regardless of what your intuition is saying. Put your child’s safety first and follow the safety guidelines that doctors and other child experts have recommended.For instance, to reduce the risk of SIDS, it’s extremely important to only put your baby to sleep on their back.
Car seat safety is another area where it’s better to be safe than sorry. Avoid buying secondhand car seats, which may have been damaged in a crash.
Guidelines for childcare are revised and change often, so revisit these periodically.

, Following your parenting instincts doesn’t mean you have to know what to do in every situation. If you’re not sure how to handle something, there’s nothing wrong with consulting a baby book, a more experienced person, or your child’s doctor.


For instance, if you think your baby is sick but you’re not sure if it’s serious, don’t hesitate to call the doctor.
You may find that your instincts develop more once you’ve had some practice handling a particular situation. For instance, after several months of feeding your baby solid foods, you’ll probably have a better idea of what is best for them and what they will like.

, If your child’s doctor, teachers, or other authority figures are advising you to do something, consider whether they might be right, even if their advice goes against your instincts. Think about why they are giving you this advice, and try to identify the reasons you feel hesitant to take it.This is especially true if multiple people are giving you the same advice.
However, just because doctors and other experts are often right doesn’t mean they always are. Keep in mind that you know your child best. If you have a foreboding sense that there is more to their condition than what meets the eye, dig deeper. Sometimes, this may entail being at odds with your partner or family members in order to do what you think is right. Even if you are wrong, you'll feel better after getting a second opinion.

, Discipline is a tricky subject for many parents. Some parents find it difficult to scold their disobedient child, while others’ first instinct is to react too harshly in exasperation or disappointment when their child misbehaves. If you think your instinctive discipline style might not be optimal for you or your child, consider learning different, more effective ways to discipline.If you're unsure in this area, consider consulting a child/family therapist. This doesn't have to be an option just when a child is struggling — it can be utilized to help you get comfortable with effective parenting techniques.

Do not tell them that their bodies are bad.,
Do not scare them with dire health warnings.,
Never criticize your child's weight or size.,
Measure progress in terms of healthy habits, not numbers on a scale.If your child learns that ""lower weight always is good,"" this may pave the way for dangerous eating disorders such as anorexia.,
Don't describe foods as ""good"" or ""bad."",
Keep rules consistent among family members.,
Avoid yo-yo dieting or self criticism, especially in front of your child.",How to Talk to a Child About Their Obesity1," If they feel ashamed of their bodies, they may start to hate them, and not want to take good care of them. A healthy relationship with one's body should not involve hatred or shame.;
, If you tell them that they are going to get diabetes, be incredibly sick, or die, you could end up with a terrified child. Living in constant fear of a horrible future isn't good for your child's emotional health.


You don't know what their health will be like in the future. Don't try to make predictions.

, Studies show that people who get fat shamed end up getting fatter, suggesting that this change involved depression, emotional eating, poor self-esteem, increased stress, and avoidance of exercise.Criticism won't make your child healthier.

, Instead, praise your child for the things they do: eating a healthy snack, going swimming with their sister, or spending lots of time playing outside. This encourages them to keep doing these healthy things.

, Placing value judgments on food can give children an unhealthy relationship with eating. Instead, emphasize balancing a diet, and controlling portions of fattier foods to a moderate amount.


To encourage healthy eating, explain how they benefit from a certain type of food, such as ""fish are good for your brain"" or ""eating enough protein helps you grow tall and strong.""

, If your obese child doesn't ever get dessert, while his naturally thinner sister can eat as many cookies as she wants, this is unfair to both children. Any health initiatives should be taken together, as a family, and should apply equally to everyone.


Avoid imposing too many rules too quickly. This can cause children to rebel. Instead, focus on introducing new changes one at a time, at a pace that feels relaxed and not like a punishment., Following trendy diets or hating on your body is unlikely to help you, and it can warp your child's ideas about healthy eating.Instead of signing up for the latest fad diet or complaining about the size of your thighs, try making small lifestyle adjustments, such as the ones in the next section.


It's okay for your child to see you enjoying a controlled portion of dessert.
Worry less about the size and shape of your body, and instead focus on treating it well through healthy eating and exercising habits.

Teach about intuitive eating.,
Make kid-friendly healthy meals.,
Eat together as a family.,
Limit screen time.,
Take walks with your child.,
Make sports a family activity.,
Offer to sign your child up for physical activity.,
Focus on progress, not perfection.",How to Talk to a Child About Their Obesity2," Children copy what they see, so if they notice you adopting healthier habits, they're likely to try it out for themselves too. Start doing any new thing that you want your child(ren) to do, and after they see you doing it for a few times, they're likely to try it out for themselves.

, Stock your pantry and fridge with nuts, berries, string cheese, applesauce, fruit cups with 100% juice, and other snacks that are healthy and easy to grab.


Keep bowls of fruit in the fridge, so people can grab some when hungry.
Buy less cookies, chips, etc. These should be treats, not frequent snacks, for all family members.

, Intuitive eating means eating when you are hungry, not eating when you are full, and listening to what cravings are telling you. Encourage your child to listen to their stomach.When considering a second helping, people should pause and listen to their stomach. You can model this out loud, such as ""I'm thinking about whether I should have more. My stomach still feels a little bit hungry. So I should have a little bit more, and be done once I'm full"" or ""I don't feel hungry for everything on my plate. So, I'll put the rest in the fridge, and eat it later when I'm hungry.""

, Your own choices will affect your child's health, so work on making healthy meals, and keep the takeout and restaurant food to a minimum.


If you are a very busy parent, you can buy frozen healthy meals to heat up for your child, such as Lean Cuisine. Find out your child's favorites among these.
If it is not enough calories for your child, encourage them to supplement with a healthy snack, or a small dessert.

, Your entire family will benefit from enjoying at least one meal per day together, where you can talk and eat without distraction. # Control dessert sizes. Children of all ages and sizes can enjoy a reasonable amount of dessert. Try serving your child to ensure that they are eating a moderate amount. Or, if your child is serving themselves, ask ""What's a good amount of cookies?"" and let them consider it.


If your child is still hungry afterwards, explain that that's enough cookies/ice cream/cake, show them the healthy snack options, and ask what sounds best to them.
Try desserts that incorporate fruits, such as banana splits, berries with whipped cream, or strawberries dipped in chocolate sauce.

, While there's nothing wrong with learning on the internet or playing a game to relax, you don't want your child spending most of their childhood in front of a screen. Make screens one aspect of an active, balanced life. Try to limit eating in front of screens.


If your child is going to eat in front of a screen, give them a controlled portion of food (e.g. a medium-sized bowl of chips, not a big bag of chips). This way, they can't accidentally eat too much. If they really are hungry, they'll have to stop and get up in order to get more.

, This is a low-stress activity, and offers an opportunity for you to give your child some positive attention. Let your child choose when to turn around; you will probably start small and build up to longer and longer distances., Get a basketball hoop or volleyball net if you can, and have some balls available to toss around at any time. Say ""I'm going for a walk"" or ""I'm going to shoot some hoops"" and ask who wants to join you. Your child(ren) should have lots of opportunities to exercise in fun, relaxed ways.


Some children enjoy competing, while others find it makes sports stressful. Non-competitive sports may be a lot more fun for an obese child, so consider having your family not keep score.
Non-sports exercise activities can include dancing and playing with pets.
Keep the atmosphere positive and non-critical, so your child associates exercise with having fun.

, Some children blossom in organized sports. Consider volleyball, soccer, basketball, swimming classes, et cetera. Others may fear public humiliation, and would be better off without it.If your child says yes, see how it goes.


Obese children may get bullied or excluded in sports, which can damage their mental health, and make them start hating exercise. Check up on them to see if they are enjoying the sport. If they don't, talk about why, and allow them to quit if they want to. They can exercise at home, where they won't be criticized for it.

, Your family doesn't have to transform to a family of health nuts overnight. Instead, work on making changes in routines that benefit everyone. It's okay to have bad days, and eating one fast food meal won't make everyone become mortally ill. If you're getting exercise together on 40% of the days instead of 20%, that's a victory. Your goal isn't to be perfect, just better.


Focus on realistic goals, such as eating a fruit or vegetable with every meal, or substituting soda with water or 100% fruit juice.Try asking each of your children to set a health goal that feels reasonable to them.

If you're too busy one day, try making up for it with extra time on the next day or the weekend.

, Compliment your child on their skill with soccer, swimming, or running. Try to expose them to pictures of overweight and obese kids having fun exercising. This will make them feel more positively about exercise, and want to do it more.

, Tell them that they have beautiful eyes, strong arms, or an adorable smile. Treat their body as a wonderful part of them, not a burden. If they love their body, this can motivate them to take good care of it.

, Obese children are likely to be bullied. Explain that bullying is wrong, and is the fault of the bully for choosing to be mean. Teach them the phrase ""I'm okay, they're mean"" to repeat to themselves if the bullies are getting into their heads.

, Watch for...


Secretiveness about eating
Calorie counting
Over-exercising

, Limit exposure to media, which only defines a very narrow percent of the population as ""beautiful."" Help them choose well-fitting clothes that they like to wear, so they can feel good about how they look when they leave the house.Tell them that people of all sizes can be attractive, and that your size and physique don't determine how awesome you are.

, Tell them things that they did well, related to their health, talents, personality, interests, et cetera. Make it clear how much you love them and are proud of the good choices they make every day.

Build a relationship with your child.,
Set firm boundaries.,
Encourage patience.,
Teach specific skills.,
Teach appropriate emotion control.,
Encourage a positive outlook.",How to Teach Children to Become Resilient1," Creating a strong relationship with your child helps them develop resilience. Children are more confident and independent when they feel secure in their relationships with the adults in their lives. They feel loved, accepted, and protected, which helps them to deal with adversity.To build a relationship with your child, interact with them in a positive way each day. Avoid constant criticism, yelling, or ignoring them. Even if you are busy, take half an hour out of your day to talk, spend time with, or interact with each of your children.
Give physical affection, such as hugs and kisses. Smile and laugh with them.
Comfort your children when they are experiencing negative feelings.
Listen to what your children have to say.;
, Understanding that there are boundaries in life that you must adhere to helps build resiliency. Set rules and boundaries for your children. The most important thing is to hold to those boundaries, even when your child is begging that you break them.For example, if you set a limit on the amount of television your child can watch every day, then don’t allow them to watch more if they ask for it.
If your child wants candy or ice cream before dinner, say no. If they throw a tantrum, don’t give in and reward the negative behavior.
Say, ""No. You know that there are no sugar snacks before dinner"" or ""You have watched your two hours of television. You cannot watch anymore tonight.""

, Another way to teach resilience is to help your child learn patience. Many kids are used to getting what they want, when they want it. When this does not happen, they throw tantrums. Getting what they want as soon as they want it can extend into adulthood, which may cause problems in jobs or when trying to achieve a goal. Instead, try to help your child learn patience.For example, don’t always entertain or distract your children. When you are on a long car ride, encourage them to be patient and find ways to amuse themselves. As you wait at a restaurant, don’t give them a cell phone, tablet, or handheld game. Instead, encourage them to wait with the family and participate in conversation.

, Your children will need various skills to get through life. They will need certain skills to help them in situations where they are struggling or weaker than others. One specific skill they need is to learn how to make friends and interact socially with others.Look at your child and help them develop specific skills in their weak areas that they can use to overcome their challenges.Children should be taught how to think about others and understand where they are coming from. They need to be taught how to be friends so they can be a friend to someone else.
For example, a child who has trouble talking to others may be taught how to introduce themselves, start a conversation, or talk to someone. A child who is quiet in class may be taught how to ask questions about their homework or make a point about something covered in class.

, Part of resilience is learning to embrace and experience your emotions in a proper way. Children should be encouraged to express and feel their emotions. However, they should be taught that emotions are just emotions and not an excuse for a tantrum. When your child experiences emotions, help them learn what they should do in response to those emotions.For example, if your child gets angry because you cannot go to the park today, you should let them know that is okay. You may say, “I understand how you feel. It is okay to feel upset when you really wanted to do something.”
If your child’s emotions turn into a tantrum, you need to explain that the behavior is not appropriate. For example, “I understand that you are upset we are not going to the park. It is okay to be upset. However, it is not acceptable to throw a tantrum.”

, Teaching your children how to remain positive even when facing challenges helps teach resilience. When facing a tough situation, help your child avoid feeling hopeless or like this situation is the end of the world. Remind them that they will move past this and this situation is only temporary. Help them learn how to stay positive even through the bad times.For example, you may say, “I know things are hard right now and you feel things will never get better. However, remember that every day is a new day. Soon it will be months from now, and this will be a memory. Stay positive that you can get through this.”
It might help to remind them of a past challenging situation that they got through. This can show that they have gotten through this before, and they can do it again.

"
"
Refrain from over-protecting your children.,
Teach your children self-control.,
Avoid always reassuring your child.,
Allow your children to make mistakes.",How to Teach Children to Become Resilient2," One thing that inhibits a child’s ability to learn resilience is to be overprotected. While it is important to protect your child and keep them safe, let them have some independence that aligns with their age. Making everything seem dangerous and scary can lead to anxiety and lack of independence.For example, you may not want to let your child ride their bicycle outside because there are environmental factors that pose dangers. Your child may fall off the bicycle, have to cross the street, come in contact with a car, or even get sunburned. Instead, teach your child the proper skills for riding a bicycle. For example, they shouldn’t ride in the street, they should look both ways before crossing the street, and they should pay attention as they ride.

, Self-control is an important skill that helps a child be resilient. This helps the child develop inner strength and deal with their emotions and thoughts. Self-control and self-regulation help children learn how to deal with disappointments, failures, and frustration in a healthy way instead of an emotional tantrum.Help your children learn how to manage stress. Teach them how to control their breathing when they get upset by blowing up a balloon in their bellies. When they inhale, they blow up the balloon and can see it expand. When they breathe out, they deflate the balloon as their belly flattens.
Tell them to think of something happy, like their favorite animal or favorite place.
Teach your children to think before they act. For example, they should know that hitting, snatching objects, or throwing a tantrum has an effect on others and on themselves. Help them learn actions have consequences, so they should think about their actions.
For example, you may say, ""You are upset. Close your eyes and think of your favorite pony to calm down"" or ""You cannot hit someone because you are angry. Instead, why don't you jump up and down?""

, Many parents try to answer kids’ questions with reassuring statements. If asked something like, “Is this going to hurt?”, the parent may respond, “It’ll be fine! It won’t hurt at all.” Instead of giving your child blanket reassuring statements, use questions to help your child come up with ways to deal with challenges.For example, if your child asks, “What if I hate everyone in my class?”, you may say, “That may happen. Let’s figure out what you can do if that is the case.” If your child asks, “Will I fall off my bike and hurt myself?”, you can respond, “Maybe. How will you deal with it if you fall off your bicycle?”

, Part of being resilient is learning to deal with failure. Some parents may want to make sure that their child is not failing so they do their homework for them, make a big deal if they get in trouble, or force the child to do things they don’t want to to avoid negative consequences. Instead, allow your children to make mistakes sometimes to learn about the consequences. Learning that failure is real can help them make better decisions in the future.If your child has a project due the next day and hasn’t done it, don’t do it for them. Let them get the bad grade so they will learn what happens if they do not complete their assignments.

"
"
Encourage your child to problem solve.,
Ask ""how"" questions.,
Set goals.,
Let your child figure out things on their own.,
Encourage your child to keep trying.",How to Teach Children to Become Resilient3," Part of being resilient is being able to solve problems and face challenges when they arise. When your child is nervous about something or faces a challenge, don’t tell them to give up or walk away. Instead, work with them to come up with a solution or a way to overcome the nerves.For example, if your child is nervous about going away to visit their grandparents, instead of telling them to stay home, help them to come up with ways to overcome homesickness. If your child is struggling with a subject in school, help them to come up with strategies to improve, such as using more effective study skills or asking the teacher for help.
You can say, ""How can you improve your performance in that class?"" or ""How do you think you can get used to being away from home at night?""

, How questions encourage problem solving skills and creative thinking. When your child does something, ask them “how” they will fix it or address it instead of “why” they did it. The “why” is not important because the deed is done. The “how” of how the child will deal with it, both now and in the future, is more important.For example, if your child is struggling with a subject in school, ask them, “How will you improve your grade?” If your child is having problems with friends at school, ask, “How can you deal with those people?”

, Help your child learn how to achieve goals by learning goal setting strategies. Teach your children that no goal is going to be achieved immediately. Show them how to break goals down into smaller steps so they can notice progress even if the goal hasn’t been achieved yet.Explain to your child there is a difference between short term and long term goals. Tell them that they can have a long term goal that may take years, but make short term goals within the long term goals. For example, if they are trying to learn to play the guitar, the long-term goal may be playing an entire song. Short term goals may be learning to read the music, learning a few bars, or learning to play the chorus.
Help your child understand that sometimes, you make a mistake or get off track from your goals. A setback doesn’t mean complete failure. Explain how to be resilient when they experience small missteps by getting back on track and refocusing on their goals. Tell them, ""If you get away from your goal, that doesn't mean you have abandoned your goals. Get back on track so you can achieve your goals.

, When your child is struggling with something, your first instinct may be to help them or do it for them. Instead of that, let the child figure out how to do it themselves. This helps your child improve problem-solving skills and independence, while helping them understand that no one is going to do things for them.For example, if your child is having trouble putting on their clothes, don’t put on their clothes for them. Let them figure it out. You may give them tips to put them on the right track.

, Another part of resilience is to keep trying even if things get too difficult. Some skills take a long time to master, and it can get frustrating as the child learns. They may feel like they want to give up. Instead of letting them give up, help them learn how to keep trying even if they are frustrated and how to keep going when things feel difficult.For example, you may encourage your child by saying, “I know it’s frustrating, but keep going! You are doing well. I know you can do it if you keep practicing.”

Set a goal for the conversation.,
Remain calm.,
Ask what they already know.,
Stick to the facts.,
Answer their questions honestly.,
Make use of teachable moments.,
Keep it age-appropriate.",How to Talk to Kids About Alcohol1," Before you start speaking with your child, establish what you hope your child will get from the conversation. Do you simply want to educate them, or are you concerned that they may be experimenting with alcohol? Knowing what you want to communicate to your kid will make it easier to set the tone and pick your topics., It can be easy to get nervous or even upset when you’re talking to kids about alcohol. You may feel anxious about what to say and how to say it without making them defensive. You might also feel angry, scared, or disappointed if you’re having the conversation in response to an alcohol-related event. But, getting upset will make it hard for you to communicate effectively. If you remain calm, the conversation will go much more smoothly.Take a few deep breaths to calm yourself before the conversation.
Keep your voice calm, confident, and relaxed. There’s no need to raise your voice

, Kids can surprise you with what they know that you didn’t know they knew. In order to make your talks about alcohol as effective as possible, find out what they already know before you get too far into the conversation. It doesn’t have to be an interrogation, but getting this information can help you decide what you need to talk about in particular.For instance, you could tell a group of middle schoolers something like, “I’d like to talk to you about alcohol, but I don’t know where to start. Could you help me by telling me what you already know?”
Or, for example, you might ask a group of teenagers, “What issues do you all talk about when you discuss alcohol?” This helps make your talk seem more like a conversation and can help facilitate a respectful back-and-forth.

, Although you want to express the seriousness of alcohol use and abuse to kids, you don’t need to exaggerate or embellish to get your point across. Research statistics and other information about alcohol and share this information with the kids. Presenting the facts about alcohol will make your conversation have more credibility.


For example, you can refer to resources like the CDC webpage on underage drinking at https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/underage-drinking.htm or HelpGuide.org’s website at https://www.helpguide.org/harvard/the-dangers-of-teenage-drinking.htm.
Avoid statements like, “Alcohol ruins your life.” This isn’t always the case. Instead try, “Alcohol can lead you to make decisions that you may regret.”

, Kids are naturally curious and may have questions about alcohol use and abuse. They may also want to know your opinion (not just the facts) or about your experiences with alcohol. Kids are also great at telling when adults aren’t being completely honest with them. This can cause the kids to lose respect for you and, as a result, ignore what you’re trying to tell them about alcohol. Keeping in mind the ages and maturity of the kids you’re talking to, be as honest as you can when answering their questions.For example, if your four-year-old asks if you drink alcohol, you might say, “Yes, every now and then I do.” However, you might answer your 14 year-old, “Yes, I have a glass of wine with dinner and on very special occasions I may have a bit more.”
Or, for instance, if a child of an alcoholic parent asks you about their parent’s drinking, you might say, “Yes, your mom does have some issues she’s working on. She loves you very much and doesn’t want alcohol to get in the way of that.”
Having an open, honest discussion about your experiences helps make what you're saying more real and relatable for your child, rather than coming off as an encyclopedia of negative facts.

, Not every conversation about alcohol has to be a long discussion, nor does it even have to be planned. You can have effective talks with kids about alcohol when the topic naturally arises because of the situation.These teachable moments are a great way to have multiple, natural-feeling talks about alcohol.


For example, if you’re watching the news with your kids and a report comes on about a drunk driver, you might say, “Drinking can slow your reaction time. Do you understand how alcohol affects your body?”
Or, for instance, if you’re driving your kids somewhere and pass a billboard for an alcohol treatment facility, you could say, “There are lots of places and ways that people can get help for problems with alcohol. Do you know some of the ways?”

, An effective conversation about alcohol with kids of any age will be factual, honest, calm, and balanced. However, your approach to the conversation should change depending on the age and maturity of the kids you’re talking to.For example, if you’re talking to high school kids about alcohol abuse you might mention effects like cirrhosis of the liver. But with elementary kids you might just say that it can damage your body.
You may also want to have more frequent conversations about alcohol as the kids get older and their exposure to it increases.

Model appropriate screen time usage.,
Distinguish between good and bad electronic choices.,
Create limits with them.,
Figure out balance.,
Don't reward kids with screen time.,
Discuss psychological consequences.",How to Teach Kids About Moderation1," As a parent, there's no better way to send a message than by actually practicing what you preach. Your kids will respect your authority much more when you limit your own screen time. Don't go overboard with media and technology so that your kids appreciate these sources of entertainment in moderation.


It may be nice to set a family rule of a certain time period when everyone can use technology for entertainment purposes. Otherwise, you should try to have fun as a family with other forms of entertainment like books, puzzles, and board games.
Don't get caught by your kid pouring over your Facebook or Twitter feeds during breakfast. And, don't binge-watch an entire television series on a weekend either. Using technology in a healthy way will trickle down and influence your children's choices.Keep in mind that since you are the one who can provide your child with access to technology, such as a tablet, you can also control how much they get to use it.
Be sure to avoid giving your child a tablet or other electronic device as a way to get them out of your hair.
Consider your child’s age as well. The younger you allow your child to use technology, the more dependent on it they will be.;
, Of course, today even education has become integrated with technology. Set some clear guidelines with your children about which types of media are approved outside of the typical screen-time window.


This might include using the computer for school research, logging onto a math application to build better division skills, or watching a movie for a report. Plus, reading on Kindles and tables should be acceptable, also., Ask your children how much “screen time” they think is appropriate. You can then work together to come up with an acceptable time. By giving them input as to how long they are able to play, you may stop them from wanting to play all of the time.


Setting strict limits and forbidding them to play during certain times may cause them to want to play more. But by allowing them to do so in moderation, you may stop the temptation to play because it is forbidden.However, you may want to be flexible sometimes and allow more screen-time. For example, if you're going on a long family vacation, it may be a lifesaver to have sources of entertainment to bring with you in the car.

, Electronics shouldn’t be the only part of your child’s life. Give them other activities to engage in. When they have other options besides just electronics, it’s not a big deal when they aren’t able to use them.


For instance, enroll them in sports, clubs, or music lessons. Giving them opportunities for other activities makes them realize that everything is best when done in moderation.

, If you use technology as a ""treat"" kids will automatically view it more positively, and want it more often. When your kids do well in academics or extracurriculars, find healthy ways to recognize their good work. Try making that particular child's favorite dish for dinner or going on a family outing to the park instead.

, Experts suggest that screen time exceeding three hours a day can affect a child’s mental well-being. Spending all this time playing video games or looking on the internet can cause them to miss out on educational and social activities. It may also expose them to violence or situations that are inappropriate for them, thus causing negative behavioral effects.


Contrarily, children who play for less than an hour a day are typically happier than children who don’t engage in electronics at all. Pointing this out just solidifies how moderation is best.However, keep in mind that your child might not understand this concept. Try providing them with experiences so that they will have something for comparison, such as going on a technology-free camping trip or doing something else together that does not involve electronics, like miniature golfing or hiking.

Teach your child coping skills.",How to Stop Your Child From Masturbating in Public," Everyone needs time alone, children included, and this kind of private time is when masturbation is generally appropriate. However, if they decide to masturbate right in front of you or in front other others, the behavior needs to be curtailed. With an increase in privacy, the inappropriate behavior may decrease.Ignore it at bedtime. If you catch them masturbating at bedtime or when they are alone in the bathroom, you should not punish them, and should just leave them be instead.
Remember that masturbation does not necessarily mean that your child will become sexually active with another person soon. It is just a sign of personal body discovery.
Until inappropriate behavior in front of others has been addressed, provide your child with some privacy at home, but continue to supervise them in front of other children.;
, When you are in public, you might not want to address the behavior directly as this will call even more attention to it. However, you can distract your child to snap them out of it and shift their focus to something more appropriate. If they are younger, you might use a game to do so. If they are older, then you can ask them a question or ask them to do you a favor.You might say “Can you go get me a few napkins?” or “Can you get some gum for me out of my purse?”

, Providing a younger child with a blanket or stuffed animal can be a great way to occupy their mind and their hands to distract them from masturbation. This can also help to soothe children who are anxious or who have any developmental disabilities., If you are close to your home, you might want to send your child to their rooms so that they can be alone and have their privacy. Perhaps you are at a neighbor’s home with your child and they are old enough to walk home on their own. If so, send them home and have a conversation afterwards.If they are too young, then go home with them and have a conversation then.

, Your child might be masturbating in public when you are with them or when you are away, such as when they are at school. If your child is masturbating at school, then you should work to provide them with some solutions so that they can dissipate the desire and wait until they get home. Connect with their teacher to see how they are performing at school and if they have any concerns.Do not directly ask about masturbation because you do not want to embarrass your child or put their teacher on alert.
You might say something like “I wanted to just check in on how Henry is doing lately in your class. Do you have any updates about his grades or his behavior that I should know about?”
If his teacher tells you that he has been masturbating in class, thank them and let them know you are working with your child and to call you if it happens again.

, If your child has any additional caregivers including before or after-school program instructors, babysitters, nannies, or any other form of additional support, speak with them about the situation. Ask them for updates on your child's actions, and let them know how you want them to handle any inappropriate situations.Consistency is important, so any other caretakers should be on the same page regarding handling your child's masturbation.

, Masturbation may occur more often in children who are looking for comfort or pleasure. To help curb that behavior, try to provide your child with a well-rounded set of activities they can turn to when they are seeking enjoyment, and help bolster their confidence so that they can provide themselves with other forms of comfort.Allow your child to try a number of different hobbies and activities. Finding some that they truly enjoy can help keep them engaged and boost their self-esteem.
Let your child know that they are capable, valued, and accepted in your home. Create a warm, supportive environment to help bolster your child's confidence.

, Don't confront them harshly or in a way that might make them close up or feel shame. If they're very young, it is likely that they don't realize what they're doing or what sexual implications it has, so being understanding and gentle is key to how they'll view their sexuality in the future. It will also make them more likely to have discussions with you in the future about sex rather than turning to others or keeping secrets.Remember - don’t shame them or make them feel guilty for masturbation; simply explain to them that doing it in public is problematic.

, You will want to address the action immediately when it happens, but you shouldn’t have a serious conversation about it in public. Simply tell your child to “stop” or distract them from the behavior. When you get home, have a conversation with them in private about what they did and why it is inappropriate.


Say something like “Jeremy, your body is yours and you can touch it if you want, but there are some areas that you should not touch unless you are alone in your room. Don’t do that again when you are away from home. Do you understand?”
Don’t raise the issue in front of others. You don’t want your child to feel humiliated in public.

, The actions that they're actually taking aren't a problem, just the location. Let them know that it's not appropriate to expose or touch their private parts in public or around other people.Compare it to other things that should be done in private, like bathing or using the restroom.

, Rather than focusing on what they shouldn't do, turn the discussion to what they can do. Explain to them that if they choose to masturbate, they can do so in a private area such as in a bedroom or bathroom., With older children, this talk might lead to more questions about sex and sexuality, so be open to hearing questions and providing honest answers about the acts and your family values surrounding them. With younger children, you might want to talk to them more about their private parts and how they function.


With younger children, don't get more intense than they're ready for; be honest, but keep it simple. For example, you might just say, ""Touching there is okay, but it's not okay to do that in class or when other people are in the room at home. Do you want to go to your room to take a break and do that?""
Think about who would be the most effective person to talk to your child. Some children may respond better to the parent of the same gender, or may be more willing to engage with the parent to whom they are closer.

, If you notice your child masturbates constantly, to the point where they injure themselves, tries to make other children masturbate, or if you suspect someone has taught them to masturbate, call a pediatrician or therapist. Sexual abuse may have occurred and could be the root of the problem.


Note that repeated urinary tract infections may also be a sign of excessive masturbation and potential ongoing abuse.

, After having clarified when it is appropriate to masturbate and when it is not, should your child choose to act out of these boundaries, you must take away certain privileges. Doing so will reinforce to them that masturbation in public is not okay and will curb that bad behavior.Consider taking away their phone or TV privileges.
Say something like “Amy, you know we have talked about masturbation. It’s okay for you to do in your room, but it’s not okay to do at school. Since you did that today, I will need you to give me your phone for a few days as punishment.”

, Some children masturbate out of a desire for physical contact, a desire which is not always sexual. Hug your child more, sit by them on the couch when you watch TV, and just be a bit more physically affectionate in general. If they begin to touch themselves near you, however, ask them to go to their room or to the bathroom., As you are setting boundaries with your child, also set boundaries with yourself and allow them their privacy. Once you have explained to them the appropriate spaces for them to masturbate, be sure to not enter into any of those spaces without knocking first.

, This process is likely new both for you and your child. Be firm with them but be gentle and supportive, as well. Remind your child that masturbation is okay in private and tell them that they can always come to you with questions or if they just want to talk., Some children may turn to self-pleasuring behavior as a means of coping or tension release. Teach your children how to communicate their feelings using emotional terms such as ""sad"" or ""angry,"" and let them know that there is nothing wrong with having hurt feelings, as long as they are able to vocalize them.Practice proper coping in your daily life, especially when your child is around, to help them better understand how to properly deal with emotionally stressful situations.

Explain the difference between use and abuse.,
Explain the effects of alcoholism.,
Talk about impaired decision-making.,
Discuss help for alcohol abuse.",How to Talk to Kids About Alcohol2," Sometimes when adults talk to kids about alcohol, we don’t distinguish between responsible adult alcohol use and alcohol abuse. For example, we may tell kids that drinking caused someone harm without explaining that it was excessive or irresponsible drinking. Understanding the difference between use and abuse can help kids recognize it when they, or someone they know, has a problem with alcohol.Explain that, for adults, drinking doesn’t necessarily mean the adult is abusing alcohol. For example, you might say, “Adults sometimes drink alcohol, but drinking alcohol is not the same as having an alcohol problem.”
Or, you might tell them, “In some cultures, having an alcoholic beverage with your meal is normal. People that do this aren’t abusing alcohol.”
Talk to them about what it means for an adult to abuse alcohol. For instance, you could say, “An adult is abusing alcohol if they are drinking a lot and it’s causing problems in their life.”
You should also explain that, even if they don’t get drunk, drinking before you’re legally old enough to do so is ALWAYS a problem. You could say something like, “Any time a kid drinks alcohol it’s considered alcohol abuse.”

, Part of effectively talking to kids about alcohol is letting them know the impact it can have on people in the short-term and the long-term. When you have talks with them about alcohol, talk about how alcohol abuse can damage your body, relationships, and more. Explain that alcohol abuse doesn’t just affect the person that is drinking, but can also impact that person’s family and friends.For example, you might say, “People that have problems with alcohol abuse may also have problems at work because of their drinking. They may have trouble completing their work or even showing up for work.”
Or, for instance, you might say, “Adults that drink and drive may hurt themselves or someone else if they have an accident because the alcohol is slowing their reaction time.”
You may also want to explain that alcohol abuse can cause people to stop spending time with the people they care about or even do things to hurt them.

, Kids may have the impression that drinking makes you sociable and fun, but may not understand that it impacts judgment. Talking to kids about the way alcohol influences decisions can help them understand some of the consequences of alcohol abuse.


Explain that alcohol can give you a false sense of courage and lower your inhibitions because it affects the part of your brain responsible for self-control.For example, you could say, “Drinking can make you do things you wouldn’t normally do because it affects your decision-making.”
Tell them alcohol also impacts coordination and reaction time. For instance, you might say, “Drinking alcohol can cause you to react slower when you’re driving and you could get a ticket or be incarcerated for DUI.”

, In some cases, kids are dealing with an alcoholic family member or other similar situation.When you talk to kids about alcohol abuse, make sure you also talk to them about ways to cope with someone abusing alcohol. This conversation might include information about how to talk to someone about their alcohol abuse or what to do if a parent, or another loved one, is abusing alcohol.


For example, you might say, “There are meetings and support groups that you can attend to help you deal with it if someone you care about is abusing alcohol.”
Or, you might tell them, “One way to let someone know you’re concerned about their alcohol use is to tell them that you you’re worried about their drinking.”

Discuss binge drinking.,
Talk about handling tricky situations.,
Practice saying ‘no’.,
Talk about the effects of alcohol on kids.,
Talk about help for underage drinking.",How to Talk to Kids About Alcohol3," Often when kids drink, they end up binge drinking because they are trying to feel the effects of the alcohol, but don’t realize just how, when, or how hard the drinking will effect them. By the time they are ‘feeling the buzz’, they may already be close to the point of alcohol poisoning. Explain to the kids what binge drinking is and how it can harm them.For instance, you may want to say, “Binge drinking is when you drink a lot of alcohol at one time. It can cause serious problems, including death in some cases.”

, Sometimes, older kids may find themselves in a situation where alcohol is or will be present. This may also, unfortunately, be true for younger kids, as well. When you talk to kids about alcohol, make sure you talk about underage drinking and how to deal with it if and when alcohol is present in a situation.For example, you could tell them, “You can always leave any situation if you feel uncomfortable, whether its because of alcohol or anything else.”
Or, you might say, “In situations like parties, you should always make your own beverage and keep it with you. You can also cover your cup with a napkin and stick a straw through it to make sure no one ‘spikes’ your drink.”

, Kids often give into peer pressure to do things like drink before the legal age because they aren’t sure how to say ‘no’. When you discuss underage drinking, also take the time to give the kids some examples of how to turn down alcohol. The more practice they have saying ‘no’, the easier it will be for them to do if and when the situation actually occurs.For example, you could role play various situations with the kids saying things like, “No, I’m not thirsty,” “I don’t like the taste”, or “I don’t drink.”
You can also encourage your kid to keep a bottle of soda or water with them at parties. Other kids will be less likely to offer a drink to someone who already has one, and if they do, your kid can always say, ""I already have a drink.""Present the kids with different scenarios. For example, you might role play someone offering them a sip of a wine cooler or even, a friend trying to force them to drink.

, Although you may have already talked to the kids about the effects alcohol can have on a person in general, you should also talk to them specifically about the ways it can harm kids. Understanding how it can impact them may help them think twice about underage thinking.For instance, you might explain that it takes less alcohol to poison a kid than it does an adult.
Or, you might talk about the effects drinking can have on kids’ grades and social life. For example, “Underage drinking can interfere with you making good grades. Some people might decide not to hang out with you if you’re drinking, too.”

, It’s important to talk to kids about how they can avoid underage drinking and to build up their confidence in handling situations with alcohol. It’s also important, though, to discuss what kids should do if someone they know is participating in underage drinking. Knowing when and how to get help for a peer that is drinking can help the kids cope with the situation and may help a kid with an alcohol problem.Let the kids know that they can talk to their teacher, coach, parents, or other adult they trust. For example, you might tell them, “You can always talk to Coach if you think a teammate is drinking.”
Explain that this isn’t snitching or being a tattletale. You could say, “When you tell an adult, you aren’t trying to get your friend in trouble. Even if they get upset, when you tell an adult, you’re helping your friend.”
Tell them that they can tell the adult something like, “My friend was drinking beer at a party. Even though it was the first time he did it, it has me worried. Can you help me?""

Create structured meals.,
Give free access to treats on occasion.,
Talk to them about the consequences.,
Explain why eating a variety of foods is important.",How to Teach Kids About Moderation2," It’s difficult to learn about eating in moderation if you’re allowed to have whatever you want, whenever you want. Because of this, offering food only during structured meals allows children to eat healthy food their parents make them, and when they’re actually hungry. When left to their own devices, children often choose the same foods and may eat when they’re not hungry, just upset or bored.


Choose a specific spot in the home that is designated just for eating meals. Keep this area away from the television and prohibit any games or devices at the table. This allows them to pay attention to their bodies while eating and can prevent them from over-indulging., Many parents take the route of teaching moderation with sweets by giving small portions of them. But, this typically causes a child to want more. If they feel deprived from them, they may always feel like they need to have them. This negates the lesson you are trying to teach about moderation.


Instead, allow them to indulge in whatever they want, once a week. This allows them to feel like they’ve had as much as they wanted, which will likely satisfy them until it’s time to indulge again.
For instance, you could place a small bag of candy on the table and let them eat as much as they want. But once they’ve had their fill, that’s it. No more until next week. They won’t feel deprived and will be less likely to feel that they need the treats.You may also want to provide your child with access to healthier treats, like dried fruit and yogurt. These will provide healthy, filling nutrition, while also seeming like a sweet treat.

, Relay to your kids what happens when they eat too much candy and sugar. If you explain to them the health consequences of indulging in too much sugar, they may refrain from wanting candy so often.


You could tell them about how too much sugar can cause them to gain weight, expose them to diabetes, and cause other health problems. Explain to them, however, that sugar in moderation is perfectly fine.You may also want to avoid buying unhealthy foods because this can send mixed messages to children. Buy the foods that you want your children to eat and avoid buying junk foods.

, The body needs a variety of different types of food in order to stay healthy. Explaining what foods can help with what function of the body is helpful when trying to get children to eat certain things. If they know how the food can help their bodies, they may be more apt to eating it.


For instance, you could tell your child that they need to eat certain fruits and vegetables so they can see better. Carbs like oatmeal and brown rice give them energy so they can have more fun.
Putting it in terms that they understand and that are ultimately advantageous for them can encourage them to eat foods they may otherwise not like.You can also try turning this into a fun game to help keep your kids engaged and prevent them from tuning you out.

Avoid making alcohol a “forbidden fruit.” Open and honest communication with your children is best.,
Set a good example.,
Don’t hide the effects of a hangover.,
Discuss the dangers of alcohol.",How to Teach Kids About Moderation3," When people are told they can’t have something, they only want it more. Such is the case with alcohol. Always forbidding your children to drink alcohol may make it more appealing. Instead, some experts suggest allowing older adolescents to have a few sips here and there.


For example, you may want to allow your teenager to have some of your adult beverage so they can see that it’s not such a big deal. Giving them access to a little bit here and there may stop them from going overboard when they are old enough to legally drink it.However, keep in mind that there are mixed views on this subject. Some experts argue that introducing alcohol early can lead to binge drinking later on, while others believe that it can help the child to develop a responsible relationship with alcohol., Your children and teenagers are always watching what you are doing, whether you realize it or not. As such, you should set a good example for them by only drinking in moderation. When they see that you have alcohol occasionally – and not in excess – they will be more likely to drink in moderation as well.


If you do drink too much, try not to make it seem like you are having an amazing time. Glorifying being intoxicated will only encourage them to want to do it themselves. Instead, talk to them about the dangers that people can get into when they’ve had too much to drink, such as getting arrested and putting themselves in unsafe situations., Let your children see how horrible alcohol can make you feel the next day. Talk to them about the headache and nausea you have. Being honest about this may teach them the negative effects of too much alcohol.


If you don’t want your children to see you in this condition, make sure you at least talk to them about how you felt when you are better. Tell them exactly what happened to you and why it did. Let them know if they drink too much alcohol, they will likely experience the same symptoms., Drinking alcohol in excess has lots of dangerous consequences. Explaining them to your children may help them realize how not drinking in moderation can ruin their lives.


For instance, explain how alcohol can become addictive. You can discuss how the constant need can ruin their lives and use up all their money. Be sure to also talk about the health effects of drinking too much, such as liver damage. Being completely open about the potential consequences may stop them from drinking in excess."

Take a general class to cover as many areas as possible.,
Look for age-specific classes.,
Search for classes for divorcing parents.,
Seek out classes that satisfy court orders.,
Take classes for parents of children with developmental issues.,
Look for classes that address behavioral problems.",How to Take Parenting Classes1," Choose this option if you're a new parent or need a refresher on developmental stages. Subject matter covers everything from caring for infants to dealing with issues as kids progress through school. You'll also learn the latest practical research in childhood development., Choose this option if you need intensive training to care for infants, toddlers, tweens, and teens. You'll learn about dealing with issues like colic, the “terrible twos,” puberty, and preventing teen pregnancy. Many classes involve parent-child engagement either in the classroom or through at-home observation., These classes are often mandatory but helpful in making the difficulties of divorce a bit more tolerable. Classes address the needs of the child(ren) and the parents. Some jurisdictions hold different classes for custodial and non-custodial parents.

If your marriage had a history of abuse, drug use, or other factors that endanger children, a judge might order you and your ex-spouse to take this parenting class to maintain custody., If a judge believes you're not a fit parent, you'll have to produce a certificate of completion to maintain or regain custody of your child(ren). Do your research carefully. Not all classes meet family court requirements. Ask your family court judge for a list of approved classes in your community., Choose a class specific to your child's issue (autism, physical disability, etc.). Depending on the severity of your child's issue, you may receive training at home. Some health departments offer these classes for free., Choose the class that focuses on your child's age and behavioral issue.

Make your child’s first appointment.,
Determine when your child must return for their next visit.,
Make appointments every six months.,
Make appointments early in the day.,
Bring your child’s medical history.",How to Take Your Child to the Dentist1," Your child should first see the dentist either when their first tooth appears or by the time they turn one.This visit is meant mostly to talk with parents and help your child get accustomed to the dentist’s chair., Ask your the dentist about when the next appointment should be. Generally, if your child has transitioned from sucking on a bottle to using a cup and does not eat at night, you can wait another full year before returning.


Help your child transition from a bottle to a sippy cup. Sucking on a bottle for a long period of time can be harmful to your child’s teeth. The sugars in the liquid can diminish the enamel in your child’s mouth causing a condition called bottle mouth.Discourage the use of a bottle for long periods of time.

, By the age of two, you should start taking your child to the dentist every six months. Frequent visits to the dentist at an early age helps children get accustomed to the procedure and helps combat any oral problems that may develop., Try to schedule an appointment earlier in the day when your child is more alert.This is especially true for younger children and toddlers who might be cranky in the late afternoon.

, Whenever your child has an appointment with a new doctor, be sure to bring their medical history. This will let the dentist know of any past conditions that may affect current care.Remember to tell the dentist about any thumbsucking habits, teething, and bottle use.

Get help.",How to Talk to Kids About Tragic Events," When you are talking to a child about a tragic event, try to keep it to just the basics. The child does not need to understand the exact details of the event, especially if it is gruesome or horrific in nature. Instead, limit the explanation of the event to something manageable and understandable to the child. As long as the child can understand what has actually happened, there is no need to tell them too much.For example, if a family member is in a horrible car crash that killed a number of other people, just tell the child that the family member was hurt in an accident. There is no need to tell them about all the deaths.;
, After a traumatic event, you may not know how the child is dealing. Ask the child how he or she is feeling. See if the child has any questions about the event or about his or her personal reaction to the event. You want to make sure the child knows you are there to answer any questions or address any concerns about the event.


Ask the child at times he or she might be most likely to talk, such as before dinner or after playtime., Although you want to keep the information simple, you don’t want to belittle the intelligence of the child. Even children as small as four can gather contextual clues about a tragic event. Instead of talking down to the child, give them enough information for the child to generally understand the situation so as to not cause confusion.


For example, don’t phrase your reply as if you are brushing the child’s concerns off. Avoid saying “A bad thing happened somewhere away from here, so it doesn’t matter.” Explain exactly what happened if the child is curious, but do so in a way the child can understand., The child may be very curious as to why a traumatic event has occurred. If it is a natural disaster, explain to the child that these things happen from time to time because of weather or other natural reasons. If it was a traumatic event caused by human actions, explain that sometimes people do bad things but that it isn’t all people.


Never blame a cultural, racial, or ethnic group of people for a traumatic event. This will only teach the child to be weary, and possibly prejudiced, of that group of people., When you approach the child to talk to them about the trauma, make sure you bend down to where you are level with the child. Trying to speak to the child indirectly or talking down to the child’s level from your full height can make him or her feel as though you do not care.


Instead, take a deep breath and talk to the child directly. Squat down, sit down, or pick the child up so you are face to face and can have an honest conversation where you look directly at each other., When you are discussing a traumatic event with a child, make sure you let the child express his or her feelings about the situation. You want to make sure that the child feels safe and secure enough to tell you about his or her feelings so that the child can process the event. Tell the child that it is okay to express emotions about the event and to not keep them inside.


If the child has a hard time expressing feelings in words, try having the child draw, paint, sing, or write down his or her feelings., If the tragic event is something that is locally or nationally publicized, try to avoid letting the child see any media coverage of the event. Televised and written news reports will often have graphic images and sound bites that may show the child more than necessary.


This includes social media and online sources of new as well.
If the child is older and may be able to handle the news, still be cautious. Record the new program or watch the online video ahead of time to make sure the contents are not too much for the child to handle.These events can include large accidents involving numerous people, natural disasters, and targeted attacks.

, If the child is deeply affected by the traumatic event, try to have something good come out of it. Help the child take a proactive approach by writing letters to those affected by the traumatic event or writing thank you letters to those who have helped with the trauma. Explain why these kinds of things are helpful and encourage the child to do them.


You can also explain the heroic actions of the people involved, such as emergency services, everyday people who helped in the trauma, or volunteer organizations who have help with the traumatic event. This will help the child see that good things can come out of bad events., A traumatic event that affects a child may also affect you. Don’t be afraid to let the child see you cry or show outwards signs of sadness or grief. This will help the child understand and acknowledge his or her own pain.


Although it is helpful to see your emotions, ‘’’never’’’ let the child see you lash out in anger. Avoid screaming, kicking, or yelling around the child. The violence in this type of reaction can cause the child to be even more upset and scared by the event than before., Each age group of children need particular types of care in everyday life, and talking to children about traumatic events is the same way. Despite being five years old and younger, preschool aged children can be quite perceptive. When dealing with children of this group, make sure you reassure them with physical signs of support, such as hugging them, holding their hands, or picking them up. This shows outward signs of comfort that will make talking to them easier.


Also verbally reassure children of this age group by telling them they are safe and that you will be there for them.
Try to speak in a calm, reassuring voice, which will help them stay calm as well.Even small events can affect children of this age, such as power outages or loud storms. Make sure to reassure them that everything is going to be okay., Children in the preadolescent stage of life may understand much more about traumatic events than younger children. Depending on their age or level of maturity, these children may need different types of care. Try to give the level of care based on the specific child’s needs.


Younger school aged children may require similar care to preschool children, but older children may have more questions or be exposed to more information at school.
If the child is being exposed to more outside information about a traumatic event, try to calm their fears. You may even need to have a more in depth, targeted conversation if the child is extremely concerned or curious about a particular event.
Make sure that you reassure the child in any scenario to ensure the child feels safe and protected., Children in their early and late teens are already going through hard changes in their daily lives. Adding a traumatic event into the situation may be difficult for the teen to handle. Talk to teens with openness and honesty. They will likely understand more about the event and be exposed to multiple sides of the event.


Make sure you let them know you are open to talk and listen to their concerns and fears.Teens may be reluctant to talk, so check in with them on occasion to keep the lines of communication open., Children with disabilities will need particular consideration in times of trauma. Despite your child’s age, you should make sure you speak to their mental level. Your child’s situation will vary depending on their personal needs. Just make sure you match your child’s specific needs when discussing traumatic events with them.


This may mean speaking at your child’s developmental level, not the developmental of their peers.
For autistic children, the necessary steps to talk and comfort the child will be different depending on the child’s needs and history. Make sure you tailor your discussion to the child’s needs and do what you can to comfort them.Encourage calming stims, and give them some extra time to relax.

, There are certain physical and emotional behaviors that may signal residual effects of the traumatic event. If the child’s sleeping patterns change following the traumatic event, there may be something going on with the child. Difficulty falling or asleep, trouble waking up, and increased nightmares is a common effect of traumatic events on children of all ages.


Returning to bed wetting at night may also be a side effect of traumatic events, especially for preschool or elementary aged children., Children may suffer a change in emotional state after a traumatic event in an attempt to cope with the event. Uncontrollable anger, depression, and sadness are common emotions shown after a traumatic event. Children may also become withdrawn or distant.


Young children may also become extra clingy or needy during these times.Children of all ages may also undergo emotional and social regression, where they act and react more immature than their actual ages., Some children will have a physical reaction to a trauma. This is because their emotional worries are pushed down or not dealt with, which then manifests itself as a physical reaction. These reactions include:


Muscle aches
Chronic headache
Noticeable increase or decrease of appetite
Extreme lethargy
Generally feeling unwell, Teens often react to traumatic events by trying to hide in alcohol, tobacco, or illegal substances. Directly following a trauma, keep a close eye on your teen or older adolescent to make sure your child has not turned to outside substances in order to cope with the traumatic event.


If you are worried about this, talk with your child about it and let them know there are other, less harmful ways to cope., All of these reactions are normal and should not cause alarm at first. However, if your child exhibits these symptoms for longer than two to four weeks, there might be cause for concern. If you are worried about the child’s mental talk to your pediatrician or a mental health professional.


Keep a close watch on your child if your child has a history of trauma."

If the course material doesn't cover a specific issue you're dealing with, bring it up in class. Never hesitate to ask the teacher or facilitator when something is unclear or needs explaining., Many parenting classes provide handouts and other materials. Use the handout as an outline and fill in any explanatory information in the margins. Jot down any questions that come to mind during the lesson. Take notes with a pen or pencil, rather than a computer, to help the material sink in better., Pay attention to their stories and how they handle parenting situations. Even if it's an issue you haven't encountered yet, listen actively. You might encounter that issue in the future, and having knowledge beforehand will help.

Evaluate the office.",How to Take Your Child to the Dentist2," Unless your dentist works with children, you should find a child friendly dentist’s office.Pediatric dentists go through two or three years of extra training in order to work with children. They understand physical and psychological development, and are especially prepared to work with kids., Talk to your friends or family members who also have children. They may be able to recommend a good pediatric dentist in your area.Reach out to parents. If your child is in school, or you take them to any interactive activities, talk to the other parents who are there. Try saying, “Hey Jill, I’m looking for a nice children’s dentist for Ron. Do you know of anyone?”

, A pharmacy in your area is likely to have the contact information for many doctors. Ask for a few contacts and call their offices. After you talk to the receptionist about their location and hours you can determine which one might be most convenient for you.Approach the pharmacist and say, “Hello, I’m looking for a pediatric dentist for my child. Would you be able to give me the contact information for two or three dentists in this area?”

, Use websites like aapd.org or mouthhealthy.org to search for a dentist near you.Also consider checking on your insurance company’s website. Some insurance companies give easy access to in-network doctors via the web.


Try calling your insurance company if the information online is inadequate. You might be more successful if you get someone on the phone to provide a contact.

, Once you make an appointment with a new dentist, take time to reflect on the experience. Were you treated well? Did the dentist explain the tools and procedures to your child? Was the office decorated in a way that is inviting to children? Was the dentist patient and kind?"

Remind them that gossip can hurt feelings.,
Tell them that gossiping is a form of bullying.,
Let them know gossip could cause trouble.,
Let them know they may be gossiped about, too.",How to Stop Your Child from Gossiping1," Bad news typically spreads faster than good news does, and gossip usually isn’t good. Rumors are often made to hurt someone and their reputation. Let your child know that the subject of the rumor will likely hear it and probably become hurt.

Repeat back to your child the gossip they’ve spread and make it about them. Ask them how they would feel if they were the subject of the rumor. Let them know that a good rule of thumb about gossip is to ask themselves if they would be hurt if that was said about them, before they speak the words to someone else.;
, Your child may not understand the damage that gossiping can do. They may think that because they are just words, they are harmless. Let them know, however, that saying bad things about others behind their back is just as bad as saying it to their face. In fact, let them know that it is even worse.

Rumors are usually lies. The person doesn’t have a chance to defend themselves when the talk is taking place behind their back. They would be able to clear up the lies if they knew about them. Instead, the rumor continues about that person, possibly changing and becoming worse. The result is damage from which the person may not recover., Repeating something you hear can cause arguments, tears, and even physical altercations. Remind your child that even if they think they are helping someone by telling them what they said, doing so may make things worse.

For example, if they tell their friend what someone said about them, it could cause the friend and the other person to get into a fight., Kids who gossip are more likely to have gossip spread about them. The kids who they gossiped about might retaliate and spread their own rumors. Additionally, kids may feel uncomfortable around yours for fear that they will gossip about them, which may create its own rumor.

Avoid telling them that they will become unpopular if they gossip. In reality, kids who gossip tend to gain popularity and seem to have closer relationships with their friends than those who don’t."

Start including yourself in the mix by setting aside time and money each month to pamper yourself. How you do this will depend on your budget and circumstances, but take a moment each month to look over your calendar and schedule in some ""me-time.""This might translate to finally using that gift card your mom gave you to the local spa, or playing a round of golf with the guys. Get a manicure, a haircut, or buy yourself that new article of clothing you have been coveting.
Scheduling in me-time doesn't have to drastically shake up your normal schedule. Join a gym that has childcare services. Plan a playdate where the kids can go crazy with each other while a group of parents gossip over coffee.;
, Believe it or not, lots of children are sleep-deprived. Of course, tons of parents are, too. While it may start off as a battle, setting an earlier bedtime will benefit your children and you. Not only are children more alert when they get a good night's sleep, but sleep supports physical and mental health, too.Plus, when your children go to sleep earlier, you can get some much-needed rest, also. But, before you do that, create a blissful wind-down routine that you can look forward to. Play soft music as you prepare for bed. Light some scented candles. Pour yourself a glass of wine. Run an indulgent bubble bath. Read a novel in quiet. Putting the kids down early can be a treat for everyone.
Keep in mind that your child’s bedtime and bedtime routine will depend on their age. For example, a young child might enjoy it if you read them a bedtime story, while a teenage may benefit from 30 minutes of quiet reading time before bed that is observed by the whole family. Talk with your child’s pediatrician or check out some books to find age-appropriate advice on bedtimes and helpful routines.

, Mindfulness is the practice of being present in the moment. Cultivating a mindful outlook can lower your stress levels and help you enjoy your day-to-day tasks more.For instance, when you’re cooking or driving, don’t let your mind race ahead to the next thing on your to-do list. Just focus on the job at hand.
Keep in mind that mindfulness takes time and patience to master. It is not something that comes naturally. Start out with short mindfulness exercises to build this skill. Over time you will find yourself living a more mindful existence.

, Designate two or three 15-minute intervals during the day as “me-time.” If you use a planner, schedule your personal time just like you would any other appointment. You’re more likely to stick to your plans if you commit to them beforehand.During your ""me-time,"" you might listen to some soothing music, enjoy an indulgent dessert, do a quick workout, or simply sit on your back porch and watch the sun set. Avoid doing anything productive during your alone time. This time is meant to be restorative and relaxing.

, Having kids can make it more difficult to focus on your relationship. Schedule a regular date night with your partner, or get up half an hour earlier to have coffee together in the mornings before the kids are awake.Make sure that your partner prioritizes your special time, too. You might say, ""Hey, I feel like we don't spend much time together during the week. How about each night, after we put the kids to bed, we sit out on the deck and chat for a few minutes? I'd really love to give you more of my undivided attention.""

, Spending time with friends can be a fun way to recharge. Hire a babysitter so you can have an occasional afternoon out, or plan activities with family friends so that all your kids can play together.Call up your best pals and say, ""How about we create a weekly girls' (or guys') night? We all need a break from routine...What do you think?"" You could go out for dinner on this night or stay in and watch movies or football and eat popcorn. It's up to you.

, Gratitude is a powerful mood-lifter. When you’re in the habit of being grateful for what you have, you’ll feel less stressed and more grounded.Try writing a few lines in a gratitude journal every night, surrounding yourself with positive reminders, or just expressing your appreciation to the people in your life more often.
To maintain an attitude of gratitude, you may need to start distancing yourself from people who are critical, ungrateful, or otherwise harmful for you to be around.

, If you’ve been used to taking care of everybody else’s needs, you might feel selfish for thinking about yourself. Don’t feel guilty – you need care just like everyone else. Practicing basic self-care keeps you healthy and in a positive frame of mind, which makes you better able to fulfill your responsibilities.Hold yourself to the same standards as you would a friend. You wouldn’t expect a friend to be able to do things for other people all day without taking a little time out to rest, so cut yourself some slack, too.
Practicing self-care will also help to teach your children that they are not the center of the universe, which is a very important lesson. It will also increase the chances that they will practice self-care as adults.

, Don’t say “yes” to requests you know are going to run you ragged. It’s OK to have limits in place for how much you’re willing to do in a day. Make self-care a priority, and honor that promise to yourself.Let's say you are asked to head up the yearly fundraiser at your kids' school. You might decline the request by saying, ""You know I really enjoy fundraising, but I have a lot on my plate right now. Is there anyone else you can ask?""
If you get overwhelmed by your to-do items, then you can also try making your to-do list for the day and then cutting it in half. This will help you to do see that the world will not end if you don’t do everything.

, You might not be able to keep the house looking immaculate and put an elaborate dinner on the table every night, but a few cobwebs and a simple meal never hurt anybody. Lower your expectations a little. It’s OK for things to be imperfect.Keep in mind that people make their memories around things that are made, not things they have, such as accommodations or possessions.

, Hire a babysitter for a few hours a week, ask a family member to take your kids to the park, or see if a friend would be willing to pick up groceries for you. For many parents, seeking help from others is essential for maintaining a good balance between family life and personal life.You might say, ""Hey, Carla, I've been super stressed with work. Can I bring the kids over for a play-date this weekend so I can have a few hours to myself?""
You might even consider setting up regular appointments for help, such as from a housekeeper, gardener, or babysitter.

, Being efficient with your time can help you find time for yourself. Adopt a good morning and evening routine to make the day go more smoothly and free up time later on.In the morning, start a meal in the slow cooker, so you won’t have to spend an hour on dinner after you come home from work.
In the evening, help your kids set out their clothes, backpacks, breakfast cereal, and anything else they’ll need to get out the door quickly the next morning.

, Exercise keeps your body fit, rejuvenates your mind, and lifts your mood. Aim to get at least thirty minutes of activity every day.Consider getting up early in the morning to fit your workout into the day.
Look for exercises you can do with your kids. Younger kids might enjoy doing an exercise DVD with you. Hiking is a good choice for older kids.

, Sleep is crucial for your well-being, so don’t neglect it. Make it a priority to get at least seven to eight hours every night.If you feel like you don’t have time for a full night of sleep, examine your activities and see if there are any--like watching TV or surfing the internet--that you could cut back on to get more rest.
If you have a hard time falling asleep, try creating a calming bedtime ritual for yourself. Turn off your electronics and spend a few minutes reading, taking a warm bath, or writing in a journal to unwind.

, The foods you eat have a big impact on your mood. When you’re busy, you might feel tempted to choose convenient or comforting options, but many of these foods aren’t very nutritious and will make you feel worse in the long run. Instead, opt for a diet full of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains.Avoid refined sugars and white flour. These foods can cause your blood sugar to spike and then crash, resulting in low energy and mood swings.

, Many parents will forgo annual appointments with a doctor or will not go to see a doctor when they are sick. This is not good for you or for your kids, especially if something happened to you. Make sure to see your general practitioner at least once per year for an annual exam and any time you are feeling sick."

Conquer nighttime together.",How to Stop Kids from Being Afraid of Monsters1," Ask your child where she thinks the monsters are — under the bed, in the closet, and so on. Then look for the monsters together, and show your child they don’t exist.You don't want to just say, ""There's nothing there; go to sleep,"" nor do you want to encourage the fear by pretending the monsters are there and you can remove them. The best way to tackle the fear is to actually show your child that the monsters aren't real and they have nothing to fear.;
, The darkness of the night allows imaginations to run wild. Spend some time with your child in his room at night and find the shadows, scary shapes, or things that might be frightening from his perspective. Then, with each find, slowly explain and show why it is not a monster. If your child can physically determine what he sees is not a monster it will give him more comfort to go to sleep.Enter your child’s room at night, with the night lights or a lamp on low light on and look around the room together for monsters. If your child claims to see a monster, show him that it is just a shadow of the chair, desk, or lamp. Nothing to be afraid of.
Lie in bed together and listen for monster sounds. Ask him to identify which sounds he is afraid of. Whenever you hear it, tell him exactly what the sound is so if he hears it again, he will know what it is.
Get down on your knees so that you are eye level with your child. See what he sees from his angle. Then explain what he tells you finds scary. If you can, change the location of things that can be mistaken for monsters, like furniture, or remove clothing from a hanger. Do it while he watches and then show him how the environment changed.
Install night lights to provide some comfort so your child can see what is around him.

Offer ways to stop spreading gossip.,
Have them avoid the subject.,
Encourage your child to make friends with kids who don’t gossip.,
Set consequences to gossiping behavior.",How to Stop Your Child from Gossiping2," The easiest way to shut down gossip is to not spread it. Tell your child to simply keep it to themselves, even if they believe the rumor is true.

Give them examples of what to say when they hear gossip. For example, they could say, “That’s none of my business” or “I’m sure there’s a perfectly good explanation for that.” Other kids may eventually stop coming to them with gossip if they don’t spread it., Your child may feel like they don’t have a choice about whether they hear gossip or not. Explain to them that they actually do. They have options other than sitting and listening to what the person says.

For example, they could say to the gossip-spreader, “I don’t want to talk about this. Let’s change the subject.” They could also simply walk away from the conversation if they feel it is heading in that direction., If your child finds friends who don’t gossip, chances are they won’t gossip either. Kids often feel closer to others when they share these juicy bits of information “in confidence.” However, these disclosures may end up floating around to many other kids.

Let your child know also that so-called friends who gossip to your child are also likely to spread gossip about them. People who create and spread rumors often can’t be trusted, which is another reason why making friends with those who don’t gossip is a good idea., If your child is aware of your no-gossiping policy and you still find out they have been doing it, you will need to enforce some consequences. Decide how to address the situation based on the severity of the gossip.

For example, if you learn your child has been spreading rumors about a teacher at school, you might forbid them from hanging with possible negative influences. You might also require that they write a letter of apology to the teacher.
If the situation is less severe, such as telling a sibling that two neighborhood kids are secretly dating, you might just tell them to stop.

"
"
Tell them not to share their secrets.,
Suggest trusted sources for sharing.,
Encourage them to speak out.",How to Stop Your Child from Gossiping3," Unfortunately, kids usually aren’t the best secret keepers. They are often quite loosed-lipped, despite what they may say. Advise your child to keep their secrets to themselves, or else they risk having everyone know about them.

Additionally, tell your child to keep their friends’ secrets to themselves. If their friend trusted them enough to share that information, they should respect them and not tell others about it., If something is bothering your child, they may look to other children for support and help. But telling other children could result in gossip, exposing your child to torment and teasing. Instead, tell them who they can trust to speak with about the issue.For example, you can tell them to talk to you, other relatives, the principal, their guidance counselor, or their teacher. The chances of resolution and having their information stay confidential is more likely if they confide in a trusted adult., Your child could stop gossip before it starts by speaking up to the people who are intending to spread it. Tell them to tell their friends to stop if they believe they are going to start spreading a rumor. Encourage them to find other friends to bring along during the confrontation, as it may make more of an impact and help them feel more comfortable. They can say, “I know you’re about to start gossip. It’s going to hurt the person and it’s wrong, so I don’t think you should.” You may also consider having your child tell a principal or teacher about the potential future gossip to prevent it from getting out.

Give your child a sense of control.,
Give your child a companion.,
Talk to your child about what will make her feel safe.",How to Stop Kids from Being Afraid of Monsters2," The more in-control your child is over her nighttime environment, the less likely it is she will be afraid of monsters. Recognize and reward your child when she faces her fears, like when you investigate the closet together. Try doing this together every night and, as she becomes less anxious, have her search the closet on her own, but while you are still in the room. Practice building bravery slowly and gradually.

When your child successfully faces her fears, praise and encourage her bravery. For instance, you could say something like: ""Whoa! You are so brave! You checked that closet all by yourself; I bet you could handle any scary situation!"" or ""I'm proud of you for spending the whole night in your own room!""It may be helpful to come up with a plan for what to do if you aren't there, such as when your child wakes from a nightmare. This plan might include teaching your child calming techniques, such as breathing deeply (ask her to imagine filling her lungs like a balloon, then let the balloon deflate), or visualization (she can imagine she is somewhere else that is calming and soothing, such as floating on a cloud., Your child can use a stuffed animal as a tangible reminder that he is safe. Tell your child to squeeze or stroke the animal when he is scared and focus on how soft, warm, and safe the stuffed animal is. This helps teach your child to self-soothe.


Assign the animal a job: to remind your child that monsters aren't real. Tell your child that, whenever he is scared, he can touch the animal to remind her of what is real. He can say, ""This stuffed animal is real. Monsters are not real.""
It may also be helpful to use visualization again. Your child could imagine that mom, dad, or an older sibling is right there in the room with her.

, Instead of focusing on the monsters, focus instead on what will make the child feel safe. A night light? Leaving the door open? Brainstorm with your child to find a solution that will not encourage her fear.

"
"
Discuss reality and imagination.,
Acknowledge Her fear.,
Talk to a therapist.",How to Stop Kids from Being Afraid of Monsters3," Use a safer example than monsters. Find something your child created or enjoys and take a moment to discuss the difference between imagination and reality.During the day, have your child draw pictures of the monsters he imagines at night. Then, take time to discuss it with him to help demystify the monster.
If your child enjoys drawing special or funny cars then take time and draw a silly one that could never exist and ask your child if they ever saw such a crazy car. Take time to explain how you used your imagination to draw the car. Then explain the same concept to them with the monsters.

, Ignoring, devaluing, or extinguishing your child’s fears about monsters will only let your child believe that something is wrong with her. If you belittle her fear, most likely she will still believe in monsters and will no longer talk to you about it.Refrain from saying things like ""Big girls don't believe in monsters,"" or ""Don't be a baby,"" or ""The Boogie Man will get you tonight if you don’t go to sleep."" Instead, relate to your child by explaining that you once believed in monsters too, and that eventually she will conquer her fears, too.
Watch movies like Monsters, Inc. or read books such as Happy Monsters that would be helpful in alleviating the fear of monsters. If there is any part of the movie or book scares her take time to discuss it with her.
Role play as monsters. Either you or your child is the monster and have fun with it. Use masks or costumes to make it more real but make sure your child is in complete control and laughing. This should be a fun exercise to give your child a different perspective, not a scary one.

, If you child’s nighttime fear and anxiety of monsters becomes too severe or manifest during the daytime, then it might be time to get a psychological evaluation to better identify and treat your child’s fears.Be clear about the difference between fear and phobia. If your child is only afraid of monsters at night when you turn off the light and shut the door, it is most likely fear. If your child refuses to go into the bedroom or gets anxiety when the sun goes down, it is probably a phobia.
Fears last a couple of weeks or even a few months, but if your child’s fear lasts longer than six months and continues to get worse, don’t ignore the issue or it could damage your child’s psychological development.
Studies have demonstrated that children who have severe nighttime fears often suffer from daytime anxieties, impulsivity, or abnormal attention control. If these fears or anxieties begin to disrupt your child’s normal daily activities, then you should contact your pediatrician or child psychologist.
Be aware that this can happen to a child at any age, even an infant.

Discuss fears in the daytime.Oftentimes, your child will be unable to express her fears when she is still scared.,
Create a reward system.,
Take your child to therapy.",How to Stop Nightmares in Children," The warm water also makes your child’s temperature rise artificially. The contrast between her bathtime temperature and the temperature of the room can help induce sleep., Make sure your child has enough blankets and pillows to feel warm, protected, and comfortable.Close the windows and curtains if possible. While having her favorite stuffed animal nearby is great, avoid crowding her bed with too many toys. She could feel a less familiar one in the night and become scared.

, Whether a blanket or a stuffed animal, having an object that makes your child feel safe is important. If she can cling to her object when she wakes, she can calm herself. Aim for something soft and preferably washable.Some parents purchase two or three of the same items so that one is always available.

, Before your child goes to sleep, read a few children’s books. This will help her become calm. Avoid any graphic or scary stories that might upset her. Also, avoid scary TV programming. Focus on creating a mood of happiness prior to sleep., If you are religious, have your child say her prayers before sleeping. She can express any concerns she might have and ask for good dreams. This is also a good time to find out what is troubling your child. If you are not religious, consider having your child make wishes. For example, she could wish for sweet dreams or a fun day in art class tomorrow.

, If your child fears the dark, having a soft nightlight can help. When she awakens, she will see her room more clearly. Alternatively, you can leave her door open to allow light to infiltrate her room.Having glow in the dark stars or stuffed animals also could work.

, Do not brush off her fears. Instead, ask her what she dreamed about. Knowing the content of her dreams will help you address her fears. If she cannot speak well yet, try to understand as much as possible., Cuddle with her and hold her close. Let her know that the dream was not real. Emphasize safety. Let her know that she is safe in your home. The doors are locked and you are watching out at all times.Share with her positive stories. Talk about her favorite place to play or one of her best friends. Return the evening’s emotional tone to a pleasant one.

, Walk or carry her back to her room. It is best if she can fall back to sleep in her own bed. Give your child her security object. Although you can stay with her for a little while, it is best for her to fall asleep without your presence. She needs to learn to cope.Although you might wait for her to fall asleep a few times, do not do this regularly or even on two consecutive nights. Then she will learn to repeat her behavior.Generally, encourage your child to stay in bed. It is better for you to respond to her crying than for her to run to you. Helping her calm down in her sleep space will make it easier for her to return to sleep., Help your child learn how to respond to bad dreams. When she wakes up, explain that she should look around her room and realize where she is. Emphasize bravery and share stories of when you overcame a fear. You also can read her books about children who overcame their fears.Useful options include:


Can't You Sleep Little Bear? by Martin WaddellWhat a Bad Dream by Mercer MayerThe Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark by Jill Tomlinson, During daytime, for example at lunch, talk about what scares her at night. Come up with solutions to her concerns. For example:


Perhaps she is worried something is in the closet. Go and look inside the closet to see what is there.
She might think the tree outside her window is a monster. Teach her to say: ""it's just my favorite oak tree that I love to climb."" Alternatively, you could close the curtains or re-position her bed.

, For every night that your child stays in bed, put a sticker on a chart. Once she fills the chart, give her a special treat. Tell her how proud you are of her. You might buy her a toy or take her to her favorite restaurant. You can decide the treat beforehand so she has a goal to reach., If none of your efforts work and nightmares plague your child, seek professional help. A psychologist or therapist who focuses on children can help you. It might be that your child has fears that she cannot express to you. A therapist can work with her one-on-one to find solutions.

Find a location for your meetings.,
Decide when and what time you will meet.,
Attract members.,
Hold your first meeting.,
Build momentum.,
Promote your support group in the community.,
Consider setting up a website.",How to Start a Single Parent Support Group," You can have an online group, or one that meets in person.


Remember that there are already several online resources for single parents. You can join established groups including Parents Without Partners and Single Parents Network online. A group that meets in person would likely be more meaningful for single parents.;
, A single parent support group might offer to provide resources, information and support to parents who are raising children without a partner.

,


Talk to the single parents you know, and ask if they would be willing to help you get a support group started. Talk to other parents at school, on the soccer team and at the daycare where you take your kids.
Work with your initial group of founders to divide up responsibilities. Put one person in charge of meeting logistics, and another in charge of publicity.

, Many support groups meet at churches, libraries, community centers and hospitals.


Look for a place that will not charge you for the space. A conference room or a basement will often accommodate any size group.

, Most support groups meet once or twice a month. Since most single parents work, an evening or weekend meeting might be best.


Set your first meeting for a time and day that works well for you and your first members. There will always be scheduling conflicts for some members of the group, especially as it grows.

,


Publicize your support group by hanging flyers, posting ads in community newspapers and free online sites such as Craigslist.
Use word of mouth. Single parents often know other single parents. Talk up the group any time you get the opportunity.

,


Set an agenda, but keep the meeting flexible. Allow everyone to introduce themselves and talk a little bit about their experiences as a single parent.
Discuss the mission of the group and ask members what they are hoping to get from the support group.

, As the single parent support group grows, invite speakers that might have great information to share and dive deeply into the issues that face most single parents.

, Make sure your local Parent Teacher Association (PTA) shares information on your group, as well as local schools and community organizations.

, This will allow your support group to share information with people who might be interested in joining. You can also post information and resources that are beneficial to single parents.

Encourage body acceptance for your child no matter what.,
Help your child learn to like how they look.,
Support your child when they are self-critical.,
Remind your child that weight doesn’t affect happiness.",How to Support Your Child's Body Image1," A positive body image stems from your child knowing that healthy can look many different ways, with different shapes and sizes. They don’t have to look a certain way to be healthy or attractive. Remind your child of this often so it becomes ingrained in their mind.For example, you may say, “Healthy does not mean skinny or super buff. Being healthy is based on positive eating choices and regular activity, not a certain weight.”
You may also point out examples of different body types that are healthy. Even discussing the different ways athletes’ bodies look depending on their sport can show how healthy and fit can look differently.;
, Children often develop low self-esteem or bad body image because they are dissatisfied with how they look. This may stem from issues related to puberty, not looking like others, or another reason. Children who are dissatisfied with how they look often compare themselves to peers and people on television. Support your child’s body image by helping them like the way they look.Tell your child that people they see in the media are not realistic portrayals of people.
Say to your child, “You are unique and wonderful just as you are because you are you. The way you look is great because it’s you.”

, Many children will criticize themselves because they are insecure and compare themselves to their peers. If this occurs, support them and remind them that there is nothing wrong with them the way they are.If your child says something like, “I’m fat and ugly” or “Why would anyone like me?”, remind them how they shouldn’t criticize themselves. Say, “I know you feel that way, but those feelings are not true. Instead of focusing on feelings that make you feel bad, focus on the things about yourself that are positive.”
Remind your child not to compare themselves by saying, “No two people are the same, so you will not look or act like someone else. That is perfectly fine. You are just as important as someone else.”
Remember that children learn this type of thinking from hearing other people talk like this, so it is important to avoid saying these kinds of negative things about yourself or others around your child.

, Negative body images and low self-esteem can occur when someone links their happiness or success with their weight or size. Instead, help your child learn that being happy and successful in life doesn’t have anything to do with your size.Tell your child that happiness is based on many different things, such as enjoyment of life, relationships with others, a career they enjoy, and other things.

"
"
Focus on your child’s qualities and abilities.,
Praise your child’s positive qualities.,
Encourage activities that make your child feel good.",How to Support Your Child's Body Image2," Instead of emphasizing your child’s physical appearance, focus more on your child’s qualities, characteristics, and abilities. This can help support your child’s body image by helping them create one based on their entire person, not just their looks.Emphasize the importance of abilities like being good at school, participating in sports, or playing an instrument. Let them know that their qualities, such as humor, inquisitive nature, and kindness, are things they should be proud of. These things make them a worthy person.
Tell your child, ""You are so kind. This is such an important quality"" or ""I love that you are inquisitive and ask questions. Let's find ways to answer your questions together.""

, Focus on your child’s positive qualities, not their faults. Praise your child for their qualities, talents, and looks. Make sure the compliments are sincere and not fake. Making your home a positive place helps support their body image by making them feel secure, safe, and good about themselves.Never tease your child for their faults or perceived weaknesses. This encourages a negative body image.
Tell your child, “Your hair looks nice today,” “I’m proud of the score on that test,” “Your dancing is looking great,” or “That was a really kind thing you did for our neighbor.”

, Letting your child get involved in activities where they feel good about themselves helps promote a positive body image. Trying new things, interacting with peers, and doing something they enjoy and may excel at can help your child feel good about themselves.Even if your child isn’t great at the activity yet, they can still develop a positive body image through hard work and practice.
Ask your child what they are interested in and encourage them to try new things. These activities can range from sports to music to art to volunteering.
For example, let your child take piano or guitar lessons, dance lessons, martial arts, or painting classes.

Teach your child how to use positive affirmations.,
Prioritize positive, healthy living in your family.,
Avoid negative self-talk around your child.,
Modify the language you use at home.,
Include your children in healthy eating choices.",How to Support Your Child's Body Image3," Positive affirmations are when you say something nice about yourself. The goal of affirmations is to change your thinking so that you see yourself in a more positive light.Teaching your child how to use positive affirmations can be a great way to help them think more positively about themselves.

Try teaching your child to say things like, “I love my curly hair!” or “I am looking so cool in my new outfit!” Affirmations should always be in the first person (using ""I"").
Model positive affirmations for your child as well. Allow your child to see and hear you saying nice things to yourself to provide them with a model for positive self-talk.
Have your child stand in front of a mirror when they use positive affirmations and make sure that you model this behavior for your child as well.
Encourage your child to use an affirmation every day, such as while they are getting ready in the morning or before heading off to school.

, To help support your child’s body image, you should set an example by making healthy choices for your family. Model healthy eating and include physical activity into your life. This helps create healthy habits that lead to a healthy body image.


Encourage your child to choose healthy foods and activities for the family. This helps them be an active part of the family’s healthy living.
For example, cook balanced meals with multiple vegetables, healthy grains, and lean cuts of meat.
Set aside time each week for physical activity. Go for hikes or bike rides on the weekend together, and ask your child to choose physical activities they want to do with the family.

, If you are talking negatively about yourself or others, you are not supporting a healthy body image for yourself or your child. Watch what you say around your child so you don’t inadvertently teach them negative habits or bad body image patterns.Talk about yourself in positive terms. Refrain from things like, “I’m so fat” or “I hate everything about myself.”
Don’t talk negatively about others, either. Avoid saying, “She’s let herself go” or “She looks so fat.”

, You can support your child’s body image by using positive language and eliminating certain language from your home. When you talk about other people, don’t use words like “fat” or “skinny,” which can lead to issues with your child’s body image. Focus on healthy instead of skinny, fat, or diets.Talking about people based on their size or looks just teaches your child that looks are the most important thing about a person. It also teaches them to do the same thing to other people and themselves.

, Your children will feel more positive about their bodies if they are involved in making the choices. This helps give them some control over their nutrition and teaches them how to make their own healthy choices later.


Take your child with you to the grocery store. Encourage them to choose vegetables, fruits, healthy grains, and lean cuts of meat they like.
Remind your child that they don't have to like every vegetable and fruit. Try new things together to find vegetables and fruits you both like.

Don’t compare your children.",How to Stop Older Kids from Being Bad Influences on Younger Siblings," Perhaps the first and most important step in ending any negative influencing is to set household expectations of your children. This will include any rules and regulations that you might expect them to abide by when they are in your home. Children need a great deal of structure in order to understand appropriate behavior so give that to them by clarifying the rules.Set up a chore schedule for them so they know when and what they are required to do.
Set the same household rules for all children, but perhaps give a bit of flexibility for older children on bedtime and telephone use. You may have to explain to younger kids that privileges are gained with age and maturity – tell them that they can look forward to this flexibility some day, too.;
, In addition to having set rules in your home, you will need to make sure that your children are aware of these rules and have a standard of behavior to also follow for when they are out of the house. Set aside some time to have a family discussion of these rules. Write them down and have all of your children sign.Set rules for how they should behave at school as well, such as “no talking back to the teacher or talking in class.”
This will help ensure that your older children are being good influences both away from and while at home.
Discuss these rules from time to time. This will ensure the rules are ingrained, and will let you tweak things as the children grow and face new challenges.

, If the breaking of these rules has no consequences, your children will likely not take them very seriously. Communicate to them the punishments that will be enacted should they act out and enforce them even if your child is remorseful or you want to let them off the hook. Set punishments that are age appropriate and fit based on the wrong your child committed.For instance, grounding a 15 year old will have a different effect and is a more appropriate punishment than grounding a 6 year old.
Make sure to not show favoritism when one child acts out; this will foster negative relationships among siblings if they feel unfairly treated by parents.
Don’t enforce the rules while you’re emotional. Instead, wait a while and be sure that you feel calm and composed.

, You may feel that your older children are having a negative impact on your younger ones. However, the negativity could be coming from both parties. When you can, observe them quietly to see where the source of the negativity is coming from.


Don’t eavesdrop on them, however. Just listen casually. Don’t ascribe blame to your older children without fully understanding their dynamic.
Listen to both sides, too. Children need to feel heard and understood, and this will help you determine if some of their needs aren’t being met and if this is in some way fueling conflict.
Keep in mind that the more time an older sibling cares for a younger child, the more likely they are to influence behavior. For instance, if you’re worried about an older child’s impact on the younger, avoid using them as a baby sitter.

, In trying to assess and improve your children’s dynamic, you will need all of the support that you can get. Talk to your spouse, partner, or whomever their parent is to assist you in enforcing rules and setting boundaries. If the children feel that the rules are bent by one parent or caregiver, they will likely not respect the rules as a whole.


Avoid bickering or arguing with one another in front of the children. This will undermine your authority.

, Though it might seem awkward or sometimes frustrating to have very serious talks with your children, remember that it is your responsibility to steer them in the right direction. One tool that you can use to create a more comfortable and natural environment to chat is to use the scenes in TV and movies to spark conversation.For instance, if a scene depicts drinking or alcohol and your older child has encouraged your younger one to partake in that, you can show them the potential harm in a safe, non-judgemental way.
TV and movies often show the dangers of certain behaviors that your child may not have considered because they see their older siblings doing it.
You might start by saying “did you notice how badly drinking alcohol affected her life?”

, Though you certainly want the best for your child, avoid lecturing or preaching to them. Kids tend to blank out if they feel that a message is being constantly repeated to them or if it is told in a stressful or anxiety producing way. Avoid repeating yourself and being judgemental, as well.Instead, come to your children calmly and compassionately about issues. Speak to them peacefully without yelling.

, Talk to your younger children and explain to them the importance of being your own person. Though they undoubtedly look up to their older sibling, remind them that they are not perfect. Talk to them about their own personal strengths that you would like to see shine through more to counteract any negative influences, whether from their siblings or from others.Say “I know that you look up to your older brother but you must remember that sometimes he makes bad choices, choices that you don’t have to make. You are a very good person and I want to see more of that. Don’t let other people change you so much that you don’t recognize yourself.”
If you have siblings of your own, relate how you felt (and feel) about them. This goes for younger siblings, too. You can share with older children how your younger siblings interacted with you and perhaps emulated you.

, Talk to your children and impart wisdom to them, but make the conversation a truly mutual dialogue. Give them the space to talk and air their thoughts and concerns, as well. Make time to talk to both your younger and older children individually to assess any things going on that you might not be aware of.


Encourage your child to share their questions and concerns no matter how uncomfortable, and promise to listen without judgement. Watch your reactions at these times and be sure not to panic.
Avoid interrupting them, talking over them, or only listening to respond. Listen to understand them and their lives better.

, You may think that your older children are having a bad influence on your younger child, but if you look more closely, you might find that their friends are the true culprits. Take some time to get to your your children’s friends to see the kinds of influence they are having on them.Talk to your children about the importance of choosing good friends and how we often become like those around us.
Have them invite their friends over for dinner. You might also check out their friends’ social media accounts if they are public.

, Talk to your older children about the importance of their role in their sibling’s life. Tell them that even if they are not aware of it, they have a great influence and their younger sibling is watching them and modeling their behavior after them. Let them know of any changes you have seen in their younger siblings.


You might start the conversation by saying “Lately I’ve been noticing that your sister has been acting out, similarly to how you have been doing as well. You may not know, but she wants to be just like you. Keep in mind that you are her role model and work to be a positive one in her life.”
Be sure to say that good behavior rubs off just like bad behavior! It’s not just the poor choices that younger siblings will emulate.

, Encourage your children to talk to each other in healthy and positive ways. Have family dinners together and encourage conversations between the two. Monitor and correct any negative communication between the two, like insults, nagging, or snarkiness.Say things like “So did you see your sister’s play at school today? What did you think?”

, If you do not want your children to yell, insult, or be rude to one another, then do not display these behaviors to your children, your spouse, or to others outside of your household. Your children will not take you seriously if you are being hypocritical. Work to be the kind of person that you hope your children will be.


Show kindness to them, be respectful of others, and maintain your responsibilities.

, Encourage your children to spend positive and constructive time together. If your child asks you to help with their math homework, but their sibling is good at math, ask them to help instead.It’s important for siblings to have activities together – time that is “theirs” and something both look forward to.


You can also purchase tickets for them for a concert or for the movies.
Consider giving them an allowance per week for them to spend sibling time together.
You might also consider giving them a task and have them work together to complete it. This is an old and effective psychological tool for building rapports in relationships.

, Sometimes, your older children might be a negative influence because your household contains some negative influences. Eradicate any drug use, alcohol abuse, violent movies or games, and unnecessary loudness. Work to create peace in your home so that your siblings will feel more peace with each other.Often, this sort of behavior stems from conflict between parents. Parents should take a hard look at their own relationships with other adults in the house and be willing to seek help.

, Though it might be difficult, avoid making comparisons between your children or putting them down for not measuring up to the others. Don’t pit them against one another by making them feel competitive or inferior. Remember that all of your children are unique and are special in their own ways. Work on loving them for those.Make a list of all of the things that you love about your children individually.

Reward good behavior.",How to Set Boundaries for Your Kids1," Make sure your kids know what the rules and boundaries are and that you will enforce rules you set.Start giving kids rules at a young age. Have a clear bedtime that is non-negotiable when they are young. Once they can understand rules, make it clear that your rules must be obeyed.
Consider having house rules. Talk to your children about the rules of the house and consequences if those rules are broken.
Be explicit and direct about rules about things like bedtime, video games, and cleaning up after yourself. Don’t assume they know all the rules about behavior.
Involve your kids in the setting of rules and boundaries. Children will feel more ownership of rules if they helped develop them.
If you have older kids who are rebellious, sit them down and establish clear rules. Even if you have not established rules before, it's important to be clear to them what's required as long as they live under your roof.;
, Rules are only good for managing behavior if they are followed. Make sure that you are doling out consequences when rules are broken. Don't be inconsistent with your consequences or threaten consequences that you cannot perform.


Consequences should be proportionate to the offense. Children shouldn't be grounded for three weeks for not eating their vegetables. Make sure the consequences are only as severe as the offense; otherwise, children may start rebelling from overly strict rules.
Consequences should also be consistent. If the rules are explained fairly and directly to children, they should know what consequence to expect. Rules that are not enforced every time appear to children like rules they do not have to follow.
Don't threaten consequences that you cannot or will not follow through on. Children will begin to think that you will never punish them. Be direct with consequences and always follow through.

, Make sure your boundaries are regular and not arbitrary. Children will notice if your rules seem to change or don’t always apply.


Keep the same rules all the time. Children like consistency. Important rules, especially those regarding behavior, should always be enforced so kids get used to them.
Don’t let your frustration get the better of you. If you feel like you’re being inconsistent about the rules with your children, take a moment and think before you speak or act.
Be flexible. Sometimes, you may adjust boundaries and rules depending on the situation. Tell your children that this is an exception (like summer), but does not change any rules.

, They must know you are serious about boundaries. If they disobey, they should know there will be consequences.Give a warning. If your children are not obeying your rules, warn them before doling out consequences for misbehavior.
Act clearly and decisively if any rules are broken again. Don’t let your children get away with any rule-breaking, since they may not respect your boundaries.
Praise your children for things they are doing right. Positive reinforcements often works better than negative reinforcement., Make sure your body language tells them that you love them, but still makes your expectations clear. Remember how much bigger you are as an adult than a child so as to not scare them.


Maintain a neutral facial expression. If you are talking to your child when they have crossed a boundary, don’t be angry or upset. Be calm in voice, manner, and appearance.
Have open body language. Don’t cross your arms or be closed off. Make sure they know that you still care about them.
Get low next to them. Avoid using your size or height, since that may intimidate the child. Crouch down next to them while you’re talking to them.
Don’t ever be physical with a child if you’re angry. Any physical actions you take should always be done after careful deliberation. If you need to touch them to keep them safe, only do so enough until they can control their own movement and action.

, Children often respond to rewards better than punishment. Praise them for obeying boundaries.


Children like attention from adults. Give them positive attention for the things they are doing right to encourage them to keep doing so in the future.
Set rewards ahead of time. Make sure they know that their good behavior also has consequences.Don’t label children as “good” or “bad.” Let them know that their behavior is to be praised or blamed, but not them as people."

Refrain from becoming defensive.,
Determine the intent of the advice.,
Be honest about your stance on controversial issues.,
Consider the advice – it might be useful.,
Say, “Thanks!” Most of the time, the person giving you advice is just trying to help, albeit sometimes in a misguided way.,
Correct decades-old suggestions.",How to Respond to Unsolicited Parenting Advice1," Though it’s natural to feel defensive when people tell you how they think you should raise your children, this reaction can start an argument or lead to hard feelings. Keep in mind that you’re under no obligation to take anyone’s advice or change your parenting style to suit other people’s ideas.

Nodding, smiling, and redirecting the conversation is a better strategy for keeping the situation light with everyone’s feelings intact.
Avoiding a defensive reaction will also allow you to be receptive when people do have useful advice for you.
While it's important to avoid becoming defensive when getting advice from a loved one, it's acceptable to correct advice that comes from a complete stranger on the street. Have the courage to let the person know they're out of line. Let's say your little boy is holding a doll and a total stranger makes the comment that you are ""confusing him."" You might gently respond with ""I'm sure you mean well, but I won't base my parenting around comments I get on the street."" Give the person a warm smile and go about your day.;
, While some people offer parenting advice for self-serving reasons, others do it with genuinely good intentions. Understanding the reasons behind the act of giving advice can help you decide how to respond. If you know the person well, then you will probably have an easier time figuring out their intent.

For example, some people may give unsolicited advice simply because they like to be in control or feel that they are in the right.
Others may be sincerely interested in helping, but lack the social skills or emotional intelligence to pick up on verbal cues and body language that indicate that the advice is unwanted.
If you feel that the advice was given with good intentions, receive it graciously. You don’t necessarily have to follow the advice – just acknowledge it, and let them know that you appreciate their concern.
If you feel that the advice was given for self-serving reasons, you can still acknowledge the advice gracefully. Politely tell the person you are not interested in that type of feedback. Then redirect the conversation to another topic.

, When divisive topics arise, such as spanking or the breastfeeding vs. bottle-feeding debate, be up-front about where you stand. These are touchy and emotional topics for many people, and conversations about these issues can easily get out of hand or put people on the defensive.


Be firm about your ideas on these issues, lay out your reasoning if you want to, and make it clear that the subject is not up for debate with you. Simply respond with “This is the way we’ve decided to . We’d appreciate it if you would respect our choice.”, Unsolicited parenting advice can be annoying, but most of the time it comes from a place of good intentions, not disapproval. The people giving you advice probably just want to pass on a tip that worked for them or something they found useful, and it’s probably not their intention to make you feel criticized.


Before you decide how to respond, take a deep breath and consider what they have to say. While you don’t want to go around following any and every bit of advice you receive, it’s likely that some advice may actually be quite helpful. Screen the advice you get carefully, however, and weigh against the recommendations of your doctor., Making them feel like their input is appreciated is often enough to placate them and end the conversation.


If their ideas go against your own beliefs, there’s no need to actually follow them, but thanking the person is often the quickest way to put an end to the unwanted advice without hurting any feelings., Child-rearing advice is constantly changing as medical researchers and psychologists make new discoveries about early childhood development. Baby advice offered by someone who parented 20 or 30 years ago is more than likely outdated. If the person advising you is someone you’re close to, such as your own parent, educate them on the ways parenting advice has changed.Say something like ""Oh, Nana, that sleep advice isn't relevant anymore. Now-a-days they don't recommend letting babies sleep on their tummies. It's actually dangerous. I'll show you the info about it.""
If the older person won’t take your word for it, bring in the experts. Tell them you’re following a doctor’s advice, or show them recent studies that support your parenting choices."

Speak clearly and directly.,
Stay firm even when your child will be upset with you.,
Stay firm with kids throwing a tantrum.,
Learn to deal effectively with rebellious kids.",How to Set Boundaries for Your Kids2," Children need precise directions. Don’t let them think that you are uncertain when you are setting boundaries.Avoid ending sentences with questions. Things like “right?” or “ok?” can make your children think you are uncertain of what you’re saying.
Be direct about what you expect. Make it clear that you expect them to obey any boundaries that you set for their actions or behavior.
Let them know there are consequences for their actions. Tell them what will happen if they cross any boundaries you set for them.
Don’t yell or raise your voice. Speak in a calm and clear voice that will not upset your kids.

, Even if your expectations are clear, children will inevitably get upset with you when they are punished. Be prepared to deal with their emotions and to respond appropriately.Be prepared for their emotions. Seeing your child upset can be heartbreaking. Don’t let their emotions make you emotional and lose your cool.
Give your child space for their feelings and talk to them after they have let them out.
Don’t make them ashamed of their emotions. Children learn that certain emotions are not acceptable if they are punished for their emotional response.

, When children are throwing a tantrum, it's easy to get embarrassed and avoid doling out consequences for the moment. Make sure you still show them that misbehavior will not be rewarded.


Stay calm if you're in public. Putting on a smile can make your child calm down and show other people that you have everything under control.
If you're in public and your kid's throwing a tantrum, get them out of there. Often kids throwing a tantrum will calm down once they are in a different environment.Talk to them slowly and calmly. Let them calm down once you're in a safe environment.
Ask them why they are throwing a tantrum. Kids can be set off by small things. After they are calm, make it clear that such behavior is not acceptable.

, If your kids are rebelling against your rules, there's likely a reason. Talk to them about their actions and remind them of the consequences. Rebellious kids can often become free-thinking adults.


Kids may start to rebel as they get older. Older kids may think they don't need to obey boundaries or rules anymore.Involve rebellious kids in setting boundaries. Offer them the ability to decide boundaries if they start obeying yours.
Change boundaries a little at a time. Give them rewards like a later curfew if they are able to obey your incremental boundary changes.
Don't punish rebellious kids. It will make them want to rebel even more and is not effective at changing rebellious behavior.

Learn why your teen is rebelling.,
Respect your rebellious teen.,
Admire your teen's rebellious behavior.,
Protect against unhealthy rebellion.",How to Set Boundaries for Your Kids3," Teens that are rebelling may be doing it for a number of reasons. Talk to them directly and honest about their rebellious behavior so you can learn how to work with them.


Teens desire independence. Talk to your teen about ways to increase their independence while also respecting your rules. As they get older, many teens break away from their parents.Ask them about life at school, including friends and any romantic interests. Rebellious teens are often navigating a changing social world. New influences may be the reason for their behavior.
Teens desire respect. Ask them how they feel about the way you (and others) treat them. They are not quite adults, but may feel like they get the consequences of adults without the rewards.

, If your teen is rebellious, it may be tempting to have harsh and severe consequences. Instead, deal with your teen in a respectful manner. If you treat them with respect, they are more likely to reciprocate.Be respectful in your interactions with your rebellious teen. Treat them as someone capable and able of making their own decisions.
Use appropriate words and language. Don't accuse your teen of bad behavior. Instead, encourage them towards good behavior.
Have a clear, calm, and friendly tone. If you sound accusatory, your teen will pick up on that.
Listen to them. Don't assume you know what they are going to say. Take in their point of view and consider it.

, Teenage rebellion may be frustrating, but it's actually a good thing. Healthy rebellion means that teenagers are growing into adults capable of forming their own judgements.


Rebellion means your teen is preparing to leave your home. This is a good thing, since this means they are increasingly capable.
The opposite of rebellion would be staying at home all the time and refusing to leave, which is not a healthy behavior. Your teen should not be increasingly dependent on you.
Work on transferring more and more life responsibility onto the teen. Give them a safe environment to act at being an adult.

, Unhealthy rebellion can lead to negative behaviors such as drug and alcohol abuse or irresponsible sexual activity. Talk your teen about any of these behaviors and their dangerous consequences.


Talk to your teen about the dangers of drugs and alcohol. Make sure they know how to behave responsibility if they are offered either.
Ask your teen about sex. It may be uncomfortable, but it's important that they have all the facts and can make an informed decision.
Teens are impressionable and can be persuaded to engage in unhealthy behavior. Talk to them about their friends and significant others, especially if any are new to their circle when they start to rebel.
Make sure that your teen is comfortable talking to you. Keeping an open line of communication is the best way to guarantee teens will engage in healthy, not unhealthy rebellion.

Realize that clear boundaries make children feel safe.,
Recognize that children learn skills from boundaries.,
Know that boundaries let kids learn how to be free.",How to Set Boundaries for Your Kids4," Children feel good when they have clear expectations and rules. It makes things feel stable and secure for them.Keeping steady routines lets children know what to expect. Setting boundaries lets children know what time they have to go to bed each night, wake up each morning, and expectations for their behavior.
Having clear boundaries makes the world predictable for children. It reduces the amount of uncertainly in their lives.
Unclear boundaries create anxiety for children. Without boundaries, the world seems unpredictable and can make children anxious. Anxious children often struggle more in school and later as adults.

, Children can learn how to be responsible, have control, and gain the ability to choose by adhering to boundaries. These skills are essential to being successful later in life.Children learn responsibility from clear boundaries. You won’t be around to tell your children to be responsible, but clear expectations will make them learn how to be responsible for their actions and choices.
Clear boundaries also teach children about control and choice. By having boundaries that have consequences when crossed, children learn that they can control what happens to them through their own choices.
By not doing what they want immediately, but instead obeying rules, children learn delayed gratification. Delayed gratification can teach kids to plan for their goals and help them to achieve them.
Clear boundaries help kids learn to respect others. Children are very egocentric. Boundaries teach them to be less self-involved and think about how others may feel about their actions.

, Clear boundaries give children the comfort and security to explore their own freedom.Boundaries tell kids what's safe and what's not. That means they can explore what they like on the ""safe"" side of the line.
Children learn how to be independent from boundaries. Pushing against boundaries is frustrating, but normal. They can learn about their own values based on pushing against your rules and boundaries.
Kids learn about trust and consistency from boundaries. They can explore their own values about being trustworthy based on your rules.

Select a standard response.,
Use light humor.,
Acknowledge advice without committing to it.,
Quote your doctor when someone challenges your methods.",How to Respond to Unsolicited Parenting Advice2," Dealing with unsolicited advice is easier if you have a go-to response that gently ends the conversation. Choose a response that’s direct, but kind. It’s always safe to cite your pediatrician’s advice. If the person advising you has children, you can also steer the conversation away from you by asking about their kids. Depending on the situation, you might try saying something like the following:“Thanks! We’ll ask his pediatrician about that.”
“Interesting. Is that what you did with your children?”
“I appreciate that you’re trying to help, but I’m not looking for advice on that topic.”

, Humor is a good way to defuse a potentially tense situation. A humorous reply is a low-key way of shutting down unwanted or inappropriate advice without seeming unfriendly or rude. Avoid being too sarcastic, though – sarcasm can come off as hostile, so keep it pleasant.Try something like “Gee, I’ll have to keep that in mind the next time I’m covered in poop!”

, You can graciously accept unsolicited advice without taking on the responsibility of actually following it. Even if you don’t want the advice, try to accept it graciously, without acting insulted. Recognize that the advisor was probably trying to be helpful, and validate their efforts. For example, try saying one of the following:

“Wow, those are some really great ideas! I’ll have to keep that in mind.”
“Thanks, that’s really helpful advice. We may try that along with some other things. We’re still figuring out what works best for us.”
“Thanks, that’s some really great information. You seem to really know your stuff, and we definitely appreciate you trying to help. We’ll take it into consideration.”

, People may argue with others’ opinions, but they will rarely argue with a doctor’s advice. If someone won’t stop nagging you about your parenting methods, or if someone gives you advice you know is outdated or flat-out wrong, end the discussion by citing your doctor’s instructions or by saying you’ll have to consult your child’s pediatrician first.For instance, you might say “Hmm…our doctor advised us against doing that,” and quickly change the subject.

Educate yourself first.,
Choose your battles.,
Avoid touchy topics around certain people.,
Ask your own questions.",How to Respond to Unsolicited Parenting Advice3," You’ll have an easier time responding to unwanted advice if you’ve done your research ahead of time. Reading up on the latest parenting news and advice will give you the confidence that you’re doing what’s best for your baby, and if people try to tell you to do things differently, you’ll be able to back up your parenting decisions with facts., Often a debate isn’t worth the time or energy it requires. Save your sanity and decide ahead of time which issues you want to stand your ground on and which aren’t as important.


Many minor disagreements aren’t worth more than a nod and a “Thanks, I’ll think about it.” If your parents, in-laws, or other loved ones have different ideas than you about parenting, but those ideas don’t go against any of your strongly held convictions, consider humoring them when they’re around to keep family peace., If you know that you and your sister-in-law are never going to agree on a certain parenting issue, avoid the topic when you’re together. There’s nothing to be gained from an argument when neither person is going to change their mind.


If someone else brings the topic up, don’t engage – try to redirect the conversation to something neutral instead. For example, someone says “So, are you going to breastfeed?” If you know this will start a heated debate, simply say “Speaking of breasts, I can’t believe how large mine have gotten! I always thought that was exaggeration…”

, People who take it upon themselves to give you parenting advice are usually doing it because they want to help you, not annoy you. Have some real questions of your own lined up to make the advice-givers feel useful.


For example, even if you don’t need help with feedings, perhaps you’d love some advice on getting your baby to sleep through the night. Say “Gee, thanks! Although I’m not too worried about feedings, I’d like to hear your take on developing a good sleep schedule.”"

Say “no” in a clear, firm tone.,
Provide a brief explanation.,
Ignore any whining or crying.,
Give the child some space.,
Follow through on your “no.” Though you may be tempted to go back on your “no” and give the child what they want, resist this temptation.,
Let the child know there are consequences for their behavior.,
Outline your expectations for the child moving forward.,
Inform the child of your rules.,
Adjust the limits over time.,
Consider a compromise, but on your terms.",How to Say No to a Child and Mean It," Start by saying “no” in a tone that is clear, firm, and in control. Raise your voice so the child can hear you but do not yell or scream when you say “no.” Yelling and screaming can teach the child that shouting and raising your voice is okay, especially when you say “no.” Rather, you should appear calm, collected, and assertive to the child when you say “no.”You may also make a serious facial expression when you tell the child “no” and maintain eye contact with them. Try not to laugh, smile, or smirk at the child. You want to convey with the tone of your voice and your body language that they are acting inappropriately.;
, You may follow up your “no” with a short explanation on why they cannot have something or doing something. Keep the explanation simple and brief. You do not need to go into elaborate detail or provide too much context for your decision. But giving a one sentence explanation can help make your “no” a learning experience for the child.For example, if the child wants a candy before dinner, you may say, “No. You will spoil your dinner if you have a candy now.” Or if the child wants to play with a breakable object, you may say, “No. You cannot play with this object, as it is important to me and I will be sad if it is broken.”
A brief explanation may be beneficial for older children, as they tend to demand a reason for your ""no."" Older children may respond to your ""no"" with a ""Why not?"" or ""How come I can't do that?"" Providing a brief explanation can help them understand the reasoning behind your ""no"" and more readily accept your ""no.""

, The child may not enjoy hearing the word “no” and your refusal could lead to whining and tears. Try not to be swayed by any anger or frustration being directed at you, as the child will get over the issue in time. Once they get over the shock of hearing “no”, they should eventually calm down and move on.If the child starts to talk back to you, you may say, “I am done with this subject and am not talking about it any further.” This will make it clear you are not going to be swayed by the child.

, If the child starts to get upset, you should step back from the situation and give them some space. You may allow the child to go to their room or retreat to another spot in the house to whine or cry alone. You can then take some deep breaths and calm down on your own. Try not to run after the child or be swayed by their anger.You may wait several minutes to an hour to allow the child to calm down. Leave them alone and let them come to you once they have gotten over your “no.”

, Do not simply say “no” and then agree to the same request from the child later on. Try to stick with your “no” and follow through on your command. For example, if the child asks to have candy for dinner the following night, you may say, “What did I say last night? My answer is still ‘no’ and will always be ‘no’.”

, If the child disobeys your “no” and does what they want anyway, you should reprimand them for their behavior. This will teach them that there are consequences for your actions and that you do not take disobedience lightly.For example, perhaps the child decides to play with a sentimental object that belongs to you, despite your “no”, and breaks it. You should then reprimand them by telling them you are angry and upset. You may say, “I am disappointed that you disobeyed me and played with the object anyway. I am upset that you broke it and do not appreciate your disobedience.”
You should then not allow them to enter your room without your permission or near your personal items so they understand there are consequences for their actions.

, You should be clear about how you expect the child to act moving forward so they can learn from their mistake. Give them the opportunity to do better next time by outlining your expectations in a clear, firm way. This will allow the child to improve their behavior moving forward.For example, you may tell the child who broke one of your personal items, “Moving forward, I expect you to ask me before you touch any of my personal items and to ask my permission before going to my room. I also expect you to respect me when I say “no” to you.”

, Setting limits and rules for the child will ensure they have good moral judgement, understand social decorum, and learn the value of “no.” You should let the child know of your rules for them early, or as soon as they can tell the difference between a “yes” and a “no.” This will ensure they understand your expectations and are not surprised when they are not allowed to do something or have something under your supervision.For example, you may tell the child that you have clear limits and rules around dinnertime. You may tell them they must come to dinner clean, washed, and hungry. No candy or sweets before dinner is allowed and they must set the table so it is ready when dinner is served.

, As the child gets older, you may adjust your limits and rules to fit their age. You may need to add to the limits and rules, such as new limits around a curfew for an older child, or a new rule on sleepovers. Consider the limits and rules you have set for the child, and adjust them so they are suitable for the child as they grow.You may also be able to have more of a dialogue with the child as they get older and discuss their rules and limits with them in a more detailed way. You may still say “no” when necessary, but you may also provide more context for your reasoning and have more of a discussion with the child about your logic when they are older in age.

, Depending on the age and personality of the child, they may come back to you with a desire to compromise on your “no.” Though you still want to appear firm and in control, you may decide to consider a compromise on a rule or limit. Do this on your terms and still within the limits of what you think is right. Do not simply give in or compromise every time the child asks for one. Instead, be selective and make reasonable compromises with the child.For example, you may not want to compromise on allowing candy before dinner. But you may compromise allowing the child to have candy as a snack earlier in the day. This may then allow the child to have candy without spoiling their dinner. Your “no” still stands, but the child also partly gets what they want.

Learn something together.,
Consider your child's preferences.,
Take your child to show, concert, or story-time.,
Celebrate birthdays and other big events.,
Travel with your child.",How to Spend Time with Your Child," If your child has trust and faith in you, it will make your whole relationship better. If you can assume good faith in your child, your child is more likely to feel comfortable spending time with you and trust you in return.;
, If your child is ever being bullied, then understand that it is not his/her fault. Always fight for your child's rights. While discipline is important, it's even more important that you realize you are your child's number one advocate. When they're in trouble, help them find their way out. When they need support, support them. These actions build trusting relationships that last a lifetime.

, Never scold them just because you are annoyed or frustrated. Apologize if you overreact. Lead by example, and discipline in ways that avoid punishment for punishment's sake. Encourage and support them in making better choices. Avoiding a punishment and fear-fueled approach to discipline will improve your whole relationship with your child and increase the likelihood that he or she will want to spend time with you, now and in the future.

, Need to go to the grocery store? Bring him/her along to the market. Ask your child to help you pick items off the shelf, put them in the trolley, pack them, and carry the bags home. Include your child in the shopping and errand decisions, and talk to him/her about what you're doing. Make the whole even a little sweeter by letting him/her pick out a few treats at the store, too!

, Do it often, and make it fun. Look for all opportunities to laugh and enjoy each other's company. Do a silly dance while you're helping your child in the bathroom, sing a song with him/her while you're driving to the market, and spend a few minutes on the playground swings with him/her after school. At home, get down to their level to play - turn away from the TV, the computer, or your phone and engage in one-on-one play with your kid. You might be surprised how much fun it can be.

, Take the time to read together - it's great for their learning, and it's great for bonding. Whether you have a baby or toddler or a school-aged kid, reading to him/her or having him/her read to you is a great way to spend time together. If you've got a tablet/computer-happy modern whiz kid, then consider an e-book on your Kindle or iPad, but either way, spend that quality time together, reading for a few minutes at least once a day.

, Look to their interests and build on them. Start with simple drawings and paintings, and then follow their lead. Are they really into horses? Paint some horses, cut them out, and glue on yarn for the manes and tails. Is your child asking about winter and snow? Make some paper snowflakes, build some play dough or clay snowmen, and construct a winter wonderland. There are no right or wrong projects to do - and arts and crafts can be quick activities that take 5-10 minutes, or multi-day projects that you work on together over time. Let your child's creativity lead the way!

, Some parents opt to avoid TV altogether - and that's totally okay. But if you do turn the tube on from time to time, then opt to watch with your kid. Don't just turn it on as a distraction or to keep your child busy. Make some time to sit and watch your favorite cartoons together, or have a movie night where you watch both your favorite Pixar movies or Harry Potter films. Pop some popcorn, order some pizza, and turn it into a bonding opportunity.

, When your child shows an interest in something totally foreign to you, it may be tempting to redirect them towards a hobby you're more familiar with. Don't! Jump in and join them in their exploration. If your kid is into the idea of playing guitar, sign up to take guitar lessons together. If your child has to learn a new language at school, pick up the textbook and learn the basics alongside him or her. It's a great reason to talk - practice your foreign conversation skills!

, Do activities that are fun for him or her, not just for you. It's important to get on your child's level - both actually (physically bend down and get on the floor to play!) and developmentally (play with age-appropriate toys, and don't be afraid to be silly!). Does your child like the Ninja Turtles? Then dress in green and spend some time being Michelangelo to your kid's Leonardo! Does your child like playing princess and dress-up? Then get ready for a princess makeover.


Don't forget their meal and drink preferences, too. Don't expect your child to love the same crepe cafe or salad bar you do. While being healthy is important, it's also important to indulge a little from time to time, especially while bonding. Go for some fast food on occasion, or get an ice-cream together. They'll remember and appreciate the treat!







, You can start small, especially with young kids who might not be ready for big events. Attend story-time at the local library, or a magic show at the local community center or kids' theater. Then work up to a really special event. There are plays, musicals, and other stage productions aimed at the preschool crowd, and for the older kids, a mainstream musical or concert can be great fun. If your child is old enough to want friends along, bring them, too. Just remember to make sure it's an event your kid will want to attend!

, Throw a party for your kid's birthday and significant achievements. You can go big and invite all your family and friends, or you can keep it small and intimate, with immediate family. But recognize the milestones in their life, and be with them to mark those important occasions.


Even better, ask them exactly how they want to celebrate, and make it memorable. If your child is into fairies, host a Tinkerbell-themed birthday party where you all build fairy houses together from gardening and craft supplies (invite kids and their parents, for bonding opportunities all around!). If your child is a sports fan, commemorate their good grades with a trip to see the local football or basketball team play their big rivals. Whether it's a local league or a national match-up, you can make it memorable and fun.

, Take your child to the park, a vacation spot, picnic spot, beach or other places he/she likes. Show them new sights, and enjoy fun activities together. Disneyland and other theme parks are always great go-to travel destinations, but you can find kid-friendly attractions in almost any city.


Avoid vacations where you plan your whole itinerary around adult-friendly events and attractions, like museums and art galleries. It's great to expose your kids to some cultural sights, but in spending time with your child on vacation, it's also important to consider what activities will result in memories they cherish. You want them to enjoy the trip, too - not just throw tantrums or resent being dragged along to venues they couldn't care less about.

Immunize your child.",How to Reduce the Risk of SIDS,"



SIDS is not a catchable illness. There is a common misconception that SIDS is an illness which your child can catch from another baby or from yourself, but this is not true. Don't listen to anyone peddling a home remedy or home vaccine for SIDS.

The cause of SIDS in inherently unknown. By definition, the cause of SIDS is unknown. Since it is unknown, it is very difficult to prevent. However, many cases of SIDS later are evaluated and a cause is found, and the common problems that cause infantile death can be easily dealt with and prevented.

The usual source of infant death in these situation is suffocation. Suffocation is one of the most common sources of infantile death in these situations. This will be the main danger that you try to avert. There are lots of ways to prevent suffocation that are discussed in the later sections.

Some children may be biologically at risk. Even if you do everything right, you may not be able to completely protect against SIDS. Studies indicate that some children may be biologically prone to SIDS.This is a good reason to make sure that your baby gets regular doctor's visits and that you stay extra vigilant and pay attention to your child's behavior and health.

The chance of SIDS occurring drops dramatically after 1 year of age. SIDS is usually defined as infant death that occurs before age 1, and certainly cases of sudden, unknown infantile death after age 1 are increasingly uncommon. You can be less vigilant after your child turns 1, and allow them comforts like stuffed animals in the crib (so long as the are developing normally, physically).

This is because when your child is very young, they do not have the muscle strength to react to and protect themselves from problems like being smothered by an object. As long as your 1 year old is strong and moving confidently (especially while they sleep), they should be able to protect themselves.

;
, You should never sleep with your baby in your bed. Your bed poses a number of significant dangers to your baby, such as being crushed or smothered. However, a number of studies have concluded that your baby is much safer if they sleep next to you, so that you are more aware of and are better able to recognize when your child is suffering. A tandem or bedside crib that puts your baby right next to you is best.

, Ensure that cribs meet the current safety guidelines set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.


All wood railed cribs should have slats no more than 2 3/8"" in width, which means you shouldn't be able to pass a pop can between the slats.
Do not pick a crib with cutouts in the head board or foot boards. A baby's head could slip through the cuts outs and get stuck, causing injury or death.
Purchase a crib with stationary sides, not drop sides. Many recent infant death's have been attributed to getting caught between a mattress and a crib's drop side. If you have already purchased a drop side crib, contact the manufacturer for assistance in obtaining necessary parts to change the drop side to a stationary side.

, Having soft items increases your child's chances of being suffocated. Keep the crib clean and remove as many items that may cause breathing problems as possible.


Do not place stuffed animals or other objects in the crib and do not give your baby a pillow. Flat heads can be dealt with in other ways.






Make sure all mattress are firm, and that they fit tightly into the crib, leaving no gaps that baby could slip into.






Use only a fitted sheet. Make sure the sheet fits snugly over the mattress and that there is no broken or stretched elastic. If there is broken or stretched elastic, the sheet may slip off the mattress and bunch around baby's face, increasing the risk of suffocation.






Don't use blankets with your small baby. Instead, use sleep sacs if you are not swaddling, in order to keep your baby warm and safe. While it may be fun to have that cut throw and those adorable stuffed animals to decorate the crib with, you should remove it from the crib when baby is sleeping. As your baby gets older, you will be able to leave one small stuffed animal in the crib to entertain him/her during crib play, but for now safety is more important.






Pass on the crib bumper. If you feel the need to keep the crib bumper on the bed, make sure it is tied down well, and consider removing it from the crib when baby starts to roll and move around. When a baby starts to roll, they can end up with their face pressed against the side of the bed and the crib bumper, causing their mouth and nose to be blocked.







, Your baby should always be placed to sleep on its back. This is because very small babies do not have muscles strong enough to inhale against their own weight. They will not be able to breath deeply enough and may suffocate. Sleeping on the back is especially important if swaddling.


While it is important that all infants get time to play on their tummies to strengthen arm and neck muscles, it is vital that babies are lay on their back to sleep. Infants cannot roll over and have a hard time turning their heads from side to side, so sleeping on their back helps keep their face clear of the mattress and bedding which may suffocate them. Remember the phrase ""back to sleep, tummy to play.""
If you feel the need to lay your baby on his or her side because they are not breathing well, it may be a good idea to discuss your concerns with your doctor or pediatrician.

, According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, recent studies have shown that pacifier usage, especially during the longest sleeping period of the night, is related to a decreased incidence of SIDS. While the exact reasons for this are still being studied, it can't hurt to give baby a pacifier if it might just save their life.


However, if you are breastfeeding, you should wait until your baby is at least 1 month old to offer a pacifier. Using a pacifier can make it more difficult for your baby to learn how to breastfeed.

, There is a lot of misinformation out there about the safety of swaddling. A long as you swaddling correctly, your baby is perfectly safe and often most comforted by a good swaddle. Always place a swaddled baby on their back (never their front or side). Never swaddle a baby's pacifier into their mouth, even if their special talent is spitting it right out the second they're asleep! You should also make sure that their hips can move freely, but as long as you are now swaddling them to a board (as is done in some countries), this is not really a problem.


Some people say that swaddling makes it harder for a baby to wake themselves and restart their own breathing, but studies have shown that this is not the case. Swaddling may even help prevent other dangers associated with new babies, such as preventing post-pardum depression by ensuring that you sleep properly. , Shaking your baby can lead to brain damage which can in turn result in your child's death. Babies are very delicate and it is important to protect their very sensitive neck structure. Even if your baby is crying a lot and you're having a really hard time, you should never shake your baby. If you are struggling, contact local organizations that can get you some help.

, Never smoke or let someone else smoke near your baby.This can impair their lung function and increase their likelihood of death. Wood smoke may also be a problem, so make sure all fireplaces and wood stoves are properly ventilated.


If you plan on going to a friend or family members house to visit and know that they smoke, call ahead. Ask them if it would be possible for everyone to smoke outside or in one room, away from your baby while you are visiting. If they are not willing to make concessions for the baby, consider asking them to come to your home for the visit instead. Remember that it is not a loss if you don't get to see them; baby's health and safety are more important.

, Overheating is another cause of infant death (as well as becoming too cold). Do your best to keep your baby at a temperature that feels good to you too. Check inside their blankets for being overly warm and do not over-do their bedding for the season.

, Take your child for regular doctor's visits and checkups, and see a doctor when you suspect that something might be wrong. Some cases of SIDS are related to genetic problems or other conditions diagnosed at birth. By being vigilant, you can help protect your child. If you do not have the money to take them to a doctor, you should be able to find local resources that can help you. Your pediatrician's office should have more information.

, Breastfeeding will not only give your child the vital nutrition they need, it will also help build their own immune systems and protect them from illness by supplementing with your antibodies. Don't feel bad if you can't breastfeed for some reason: it happens and you're not a failure as a parent because of it. But you should try as hard as possible to make it work.

, Another common cause of infant death is malnutrition and poisoning. This can happen unintentionally, so don't rule it out! Make sure you are feeding your child a doctor-approved diet that is well balanced. You should also make sure that items that could poison your child are kept safely away. Keep up to date on formula recalls and expiration dates as well.

, This is one of the most important parts of protecting your child. There is a lot of misinformation out there about immunizations but the experts all agree that the best way to keep your baby safe is to get them their immunizations on time. There has been a significantly increased rate of deaths and infections with preventable illnesses since parents started forgoing vaccines, and your child is at greater risk than ever.

Create family traditions around nature.",How to Raise Your Kids to Love Nature," You may think waiting until your child is old enough to enjoy nature is best, yet get them comfortable being outside and in nature from a young age. Allow a baby to crawl around in the grass, get them walking on trails once they’re comfortably able to walk, and expose them to nature and the outdoors as much as possible throughout their development. Make time in nature a normal part of life and not only for special occasions or certain activities.Some parents carry their children in a hiking backpack to allow their babies to tag along on hikes before they can walk.;
, Allow them to experience nature and the outdoors on their own terms. Give them time in nature away from playgrounds for them to approach it how they like. Let them explore their surroundings on their own terms and use their imaginations on how to interact with it. With their imagination, they might turn overgrown weeds into a jungle, rocks into lava, or a log into a balance beam.Experiencing nature on their own terms and in their own way can help kids appreciate nature in a way that’s meaningful to them.

, Nature provides lots of opportunities to use the senses. Have kids smell the flowers, taste local berries, listen to the birds sing, touch different textures of leaves and bark, and see beautiful sights around them. Get kids involved with nature by letting them explore on a multi-sensory level.Best of all, nature “equipment” is free. Get kids to climb on boulders, balance on logs, splash in lakes, and explore streams.Give children opportunities to use their senses and encourage them to use as many as they can!

, In the USA, the National Parks have a Junior Rangers program which inspires children to explore, learn, and protect the outdoors. Kids can become Junior Rangers by participating in activities and taking an oath to protect and share the parks with others. While this program is largely through the national parks, national monuments also participate in kid-friendly programs that are largely available throughout the USA.Visit national parks and lands near you or plan a vacation to visit national sites.

, Put a towel down or hang a swing in your backyard for your kids to enjoy activities outside. They can bring a book outside to read, play board games on the grass, have a picnic, bring their figurines to play under a tree, or paint. Bring your own activities outside as well and lead by example.Have your kids do their homework outside or do crafts outside.

, If you have space, plant a few plants and vegetables for your children to tend to and watch grow. Children will be excited about the growth of their plants and learn when plants are ready to be eaten. Children can learn to associate their garden with growth and food and make connections about plants and food.Choose some plants, flowers, and herbs and have your children plant them with you.
Some plants grow easily such as baby tomatoes and pea plants.

, Encourage children to look at clouds and learn about them. Talk about the different things you see in clouds and what they might be. At night, encourage children to look at the stars. Identify constellations and watch meteor showers, eclipses, and other events. Enjoy sunsets and sunrises and remind children that nature exists above them, too.Have contests for who can find the moon or identify what phase it is in.

, Children are naturally curious, so direct their curiosity to explore rivers, ponds, hikes, leaves, logs, and blooming flowers. Plant some flowers and speculate as to what color they might come up. Watch a bird fly and discuss where it might be going. Get them curious to their surroundings and what’s happening to the birds, plants, trees, and other animals.No matter what your children’s ages, they can experience the magic of frogs croaking or crickets chirping.

, If the weather in uncooperative yet you still want to engage with nature, grab some books and read with your kids. There are plenty of books about nature, plants, and animals. Read informative books about your local geographical area or read fiction books about children who enjoy the outdoors. Even if nature is not easily accessible, you can still inspire your child and help them learn about nature.For older kids, read “The Jungle Book” or “The Island of the Blue Dolphins.” To younger children, read “Little Cloud,”“The Giving Tree,” and “The Curious Garden.”
Keep field guides and outdoor adventure books in your home to inspire trips to national parks and other special places.

, Nature doesn’t have to exist only outside. Have your children pick up acorns, leaves, shells, and other items to decorate the home. Kids will enjoy collecting the items and putting them on display. Adding to the collection can become a family activity.For example, each child can choose one leaf to dry and press each autumn. Then, frame the leaves and put them in their bedrooms.

, Kids don’t realize how trees help with the air or how we rely on rain to water the plants so they have food to eat. Talk about how nature is necessary for everyone to survive, whether it be creating the conditions for plants to grow so people can eat or for creating materials to wear as clothes. Even though most food is bought at a grocery store, explain to your kids where their fruits and vegetables come from and how nature plays a part in growing them.Telling children how nature is a part of their everyday lives can help them realize how important is it to protect nature and appreciate it.

, Make as many positive associations with being outside in nature as possible. If a kid has a meltdown on a hike, have things available for their recovery so that they can turn it around and keep going. Control your own frustrations and help them cope with their ordeals.Bring along their favorite snack to eat or a comforting teddy bear if they start to feel tired or cranky. Take lots of breaks and make the breaks enjoyable by playing a game or taking silly photos.

, Kids get tired, exhausted, hungry, and thirsty a lot quicker than adults. If you’re planning an all-day outing at the park, a hike, or a camping trip, come prepared. Take some baby steps in preparing them for a trip by starting with one night of camping before going on a weekend camping trip. If kids start to whine or get cranky, pull out their snacks or take a break.For example, hiking a steep climb may be too much for a child who hasn’t done much hiking, and may affect their opinion of spending time in nature. Take steps slowly so your child grows to love the outdoors, not resent them.

, Choose an activity that’s easy to accomplish yet still feels special. For example, take a family walk outside on each full moon. Being out after dark can be exciting for kids and something to look forward to doing together. You can read a bedtime story outside, collect one stone or shell from each trip to the beach, or press a leaf each time you go on a hike.Have something easy to look forward to, such as having activities on the full moon or the first day of the month.

Allow your child to adjust to new situations in his or her own pace.,
Be a role model.,
Servants should be used for assistance in work, but should not have a role in the upbringing of the child.",How to Responsibly Up Bring Your Children in South Asia," This can be done by interacting with the child in ways he or she feels comfortable. You can read small & simple poems and stories to him with actions and gesticulations. Encourage your child to use his or her imagination to repeat the same to you in his or her own way. Give your child open-ended toys like building sets, clay mud, dough etc, with which he or she can build shapes and learn to use his or her imagination. As he grows, try playing challenging games such as word building and puzzles. As the child reaches the school-going age, he should be encouraged to write creatively by showing him a picture and allowing him to use his imagination to describe it. Another way to encourage the child is to provide him art and craft material including pencils, crayons, markers, paper, scissors, and so on. This will encourage the child to create something out of the ordinary. Encourage his creativity by appreciating his work and hanging his work on a wall. This will give the child a sense of achievement and make him more innovative.;
, However they do not know how to go about it. Here are some methods.

, It has been known that music can increase a person’s mental ability because it can stimulate the brain’s nerve endings. Children who are exposed to music and rhythm most likely have the inclination for such as they grow up.

, Sports apart from building a good physique also teach them to strategies and come out of the problem situations when they grow up.

,, As your child experiences many things through varied activities, he or she will gain knowledge which will increase his or her IQ. In all of these, the key to improving your kid’s IQ is to create an environment that will quicken your child’s brain potentials.

, Allow your child to play and mingle with kids of his or her age in the neighborhood or in school. It is through these interactions with others that she can develop her interpersonal intelligence. When they mingle with others, they learn how to get along with others.

, Having a good night’s sleep can improve brain functions to keep your child mentally alert. While the child is asleep, his mind is restoring whatever is not functioning well within its system.

, They are more comfortable with less nutritious but tasty junk food. It is not advisable to force the children to eat the food they do not like to eat. The parents have to travel halfway to find a solution by making them the food of their choice available at home and then slowly initiating them to nutritious food.

, The best way to deal with the homework problem is to not deal with it. Instead set a regular study schedule for the child before or after dinner as per his convenience, set a separate place for him. A separate study corner will give him ownership & encourage him to be more responsible. It is best to avoid distractions like TV or any other noise when the children are studying. It is advisable for the parents to work on their spreadsheets, projects or quietly browsing the internet to create a studious, or serious environment. Teach the child to plan his work in that scheduled time as per requirement. Guide him if necessary, but do not do his homework for him.

, This tends to make the child overconfident and lazy. Parents should instead concentrate on making the child work hard and regularly. Less intelligent students can also achieve extraordinary results with hard work.

, Wealthy parents often feel that their capacity to spend more will help their child excel in studies. They are unable to consider the natural constraints faced by the child and often pressurize the child, which is going far beyond what he can handle. Even parents who were less than average in their student days expect their child to excel. How can a child do extraordinarily when the pedigree is ordinary? Parents should be satisfied with the results if they are coming out of honest hard work. Unnecessary comparison should be avoided.

, Show respect for your child by accepting both his/her strengths and weaknesses. Strive to build a close relationship with your child by acknowledging his/her feelings and interests.

, Do not force your child to be in a social situation that he or she doesn’t want to be in. Cajoling your child into social interaction will only make things worse. Just wait for him/her to warm up to a situation.

, Make sure that you yourself have a healthy image of yourself. If you exhibit shyness yourself, then it would be hard for your child to overcome inhibition.

, Many working parents especially in India leave the child to the servants care, there is nothing wrong in it, so long as nurturing & molding of the child is done by the parents. Whatever their occupation, parents should have enough time for their children daily.Servants can be of assistance in the up bringing of the child.However they should not be allowed guardianship or to be foster parents.

Do not actively seek a relationship with your stepchildren.",How to Remain Sane with Stepchildren in the House," Keep chit chat shallow and in the present. Talk about what you are doing, and things in the immediate environment.;
, However, also demand your own space and expect respect in return for being respectful.

, Get involved and do this activity with them now and then.

, If your spouse does not discipline their own kids, or demand their respect for you, then refer to the next method, as you will never get the stepparent status you seek without your spouse's support.

, Only offer advice to your stepchildren when they ask for it, or when they talk openly to you about something.

, No matter what kind of a person they may be, this is an absolute. Kids always love their biological parent, and will always hold out hope that they will be a good person – even if they tell you otherwise.

, Plan activities for yourself, or for you and your own biological children, which will keep you away from home while the stepchildren are visiting.

, Let them know that you deserve to be happy and comfortable. If they are the reason the stepchildren can't, or won't, bond with you, then perhaps this will encourage them to make positive changes. If the stepchildren's biological parent is the reason they won't or can't bond with you, then your spouse should understand you, and love you enough to see that you are happy.

, If they are interested, they will eventually seek you out. If not, then you have not wasted your life's energy on the ungrateful.


If you must stay in the house while the stepkids are visiting, stay busy and engaged in various tasks or hobbies, preferably in a different part of the house.
Be kind if they need something such as a glass of water, or a bath towel, but leave the major questions and daily events to your spouse. If your stepchild feels like engaging you in a pleasant conversation, take part with a smile!
However, be aware of probing questions, and refer such questions to your spouse, as stepkids in this situation may just be fishing for information to bring back to their mother or father.

Implement a safe word as early on as possible.,
Know all the names if you don't already.,
If you find yourself living with identical twins and have trouble telling them apart, look at them thoroughly.,
Establish a routine firm enough for the children to know what they're counting on.",How to Raise Multiple Children," This safe word will act as an extreme command, when you can't handle all the children and the house is a mess. It's not unusual to be some sort of code word (e.g., Tapitapou, Bipibopi or other silly nonsense) a word from your actual language that conveys the adequate meaning (e.g., quiet, stop, silence time, timeout, etc.) or a sound that resembles what you need them to do, which works best with younger children (such as ""shush""). Teach them that whenever they hear this word, they are all to gather around you, sit down and shut up. (or whatever works for you) Then you'll be able to pass on instructions to the children or an important message.;
, Nickname differently children with the same forename and keep a list of all of them with you if you don't know it by heart. It may help (if you're any good at drawing) to make small sketches of the distinctive features of each child next to their name. If there are enough children to make this worthwhile and if all the children are at least five years old, you could implement a ""self-counting"" system in which you assign a number to each child, in order. When you yell ""self count"" you should hear child number one say ""ONE"", child number two say ""TWO"" and so on. If there isn't a perfect sequence, someone is missing.

, Surely there is a distinctive feature like a mole or their voice. If all fails, get them to cut their hair differently

, Set the raising time the same for all children and bedtime according to age, meals always at the same time and place and a basic structure for the day.


Service scale: It can be a blessing if you know how to do it right. Sit down with all of the children in a circle when you decide to establish it and tell them you are passing on to them a big responsibility. Together decide on which house chores should be handled by which children and when. You can, for instance decide that 14-year-old Sally is mature enough to do the laundry the first Sunday of every month, while 10-year-old Tony would be a better help if in charge of feeding the house pet.
Instill from the very start a tidy environment or soon you'll be living in a pigsty. Decide on how tough you want to be on them. You can demand that the common areas be free of personal objects but the cleaning of their rooms is on their judgement or you can be as tough as demanding their rooms impeccable and even make periodical inspections.
For the sake of organization, assign each child a colour (preferably their favorite) and make sure that each personal item that may be there a lot of (toothbrushes, combs, bath towels) is of the proper colour. If Sally's toothbrush is lime green, her bath towel, comb or even manicure items should be at least marked lime green. A good way to mark things is to make a small dot with nail polish. If the color desired is unavailable, make it white and paint over with a marker or paint.
Make sure each child has a specific place to be in common areas and a least a portion of a room only for him/her. If Tony knows his place at the dining table, he won't sit in Emma's place next to mom, which could make little 3-year-old Emma cry. Many people only think of the dining table, but the couch is also important as only one can get the best seat right in front of the screen. Limit this kind of fights with assigned seats.

Read to them.,
Teach them organizational skills.,
Help them learn proper time management.,
Explain the importance of concentration.",How to Raise a Well‐Rounded Child1," It is never too early to begin reading to your child. Reading with your child encourages language development, reading skills, and will help them succeed in school. Even if your child is too young to follow the plot of the story, they will pick up on the rhythm of the language as well as specific vocabulary.A recent study has also linked reading to behaviour. Children who are read to on a regularly basis are less likely to develop behavioural problems in school.;
, In order to succeed in school (and life), children need to develop strong organizational skills. For many young students, low grades are often more a reflection of poor organizational and study skills than intellectual ability. For instance, some students may forget to bring home their homework, or they can’t keep track of their research material. Foster organizational skills by:Creating a list of things they need to bring to and from school each day. Place a copy of the list at the door and in their school bag and have them check the list each day.
Asking your child how they keep track of their homework and come up with a way that will help them remember.
Shopping with them for organizational supplies such as notebooks, agendas, dividers etc.
Show your child ways to study effectively. Show them how to practice with flashcards. Encourage them to write notes as they read.

, Another essential skill for academic success is time management. Your child needs to be able to schedule enough time to complete an assignment by the due date. Many students struggle with procrastination and will wait until the night before to start an assignment. Try these tips:Keep track of their assignments on a monthly calendar.
Set aside time for homework each night and make sure your child sticks to the schedule.
Prioritize tasks that need to be completed sooner.
Encourage them to work and study ahead so everything is finished in a timely manner.

, Setting aside enough time to complete homework and other tasks is one thing, but making efficient use of that time is another. Help your child concentrate while working by removing distractions. For example, set up a quiet workspace with good lighting, and lots of space. You can also remove distractions by taking away their phone or tablet while they concentrate on their homework.If your child requests to have the television on while they complete their homework you could say ""Try working without any noise or distractions. You will probably be able to focus better and complete your work faster. Once you are finished you can watch television for an hour before bed.""
This will teach your child that they can work more efficiently without distractions.

"
"
Ask your child why they wish to quit.,
Avoid negative labels on quitting.,
Discuss alternatives to quitting.,
Draw a line.,
Make sure your child understands that you are still proud of them.",How to Respond when Your Child Wants to Quit1," It is important to understand why your child wants to quit something. Find out if the activity is too hard, if they are struggling to find balance in their lives, or if there are social reasons that they want to quit. Also, keep in mind that they may just find the activity unpleasant or boring.You could say something along the lines of “Why have you suddenly decided that you want to quit? I thought you always enjoyed this activity.”;
, Children learn by trying new things. If there is a stigma around quitting in your household, it will discourage them from trying new things and lock them into things that they do not like. This will limit their learning experiences and make it less likely that they find an activity that they truly love.For example, saying things like, “Once a quitter, always a quitter,” is not productive or true.

, Sometimes the desire to quit arises from difficulties in the activity rather than dislike of it. In this case, there may be ways to work through the problems and continue the activity. Have a conversation with your child about how to work it out so that they could continue the activity.For example, if your child wants to quit a sport because it doesn’t leave them time to spend with their friends, you could suggest continuing the sport but spending more time out with friends on the weekends.

, While autonomy is important, there may come times that you have to say ‘no.’ Children are not developed enough mentally and emotionally to grasp the severity or long term implications of every decision. In cases where the decision to quit will seriously harm your child’s future or well-being, it is your responsibility as a parent to make them push through. When this happens, it is best to give your child a reason that they can’t quit whatever activity is frustrating them. If possible, show them examples (e.g. statistics on the success of high school dropouts).


For example, if your child wants to quit high school, you should (almost) always say no. They are likely to be upset with you, but reassure them by saying something like “I know you think this will solve your problems, but I want you to have more opportunities in your future.”

, Even if your child does decide to quit, you should support them. This will show them that you are still proud of them, and you still love them. This support will give them the confidence needed to try another activity in the future."
"
Teach them empathy.,
Eat dinner together.,
Invite their friends over.,
Expose your child to diverse experiences.",How to Raise a Well‐Rounded Child2," In order to raise a well-rounded child you should foster and encourage the development of empathy. Studies have shown that well-liked kids have higher levels of empathy and can better understand the perspectives of other children. Empathy is the ability to value, respect, and understand the views of another person, even if you disagree. Here are a few suggestions for developing empathy in your child:Model empathy: Demonstrate that you empathize with your child. When you treat other people like they matter, your kids will pick up on this and mimic your actions.
Spend time caring for others. Demonstrate that you are caring and compassionate on a daily basis.
Allow your child to practice being empathetic. For example, provide them with opportunities to listen to others, ask them about conflicts at school and have them think about the experiences of their classmates.
Apologize when you are wrong. Your child should learn how to take responsibility if they have done something wrong. Show them how to apologize and admit when they have wronged someone else.

, Eating dinner each night is an excellent way to demonstrate the importance of strong communication, and it provides a perfect opportunity to learn about your child’s day. You can show an interest in their life by asking: “How was your day?”, “Do you have any assignments coming up?”, “What was your favourite part of your day?” etc.


These types of conversations can help teach your child how to ask questions and show interest in the lives of other people and will help develop their social skills.

, It is important to foster the development of peer groups and friendships. Ask their friends to come over for dinner or for a sleepover. This will help them with forming close friendships with peers and will demonstrate that you value social interactions.Allow your child to have unstructured play time with their friends so that they can use their imaginations and creativity to come up with activities.
You could also take your child and their friend to see a movie or go to the mall.
Ask your child prior to inviting a friend over what they would like to do with their friend. If they are unsure, you might encourage them to do an activity where they have to work together, such as a puzzle, a group craft project, or an imaginative game.
Do not pressure your child to invite people over if they are shy. As long as they have a few friends, it is ok if they are introverted.

, Take your child out to interact with a wide range of people, cultures, lifestyles, places, and environments. This will help teach your child how to work with people who are different from them as well as how to be flexible and open-minded. You can:

Travel to different parts of the country and world
Take them to cultural festivals
Visit museums, libraries, and zoos
Volunteer as a family for an important cause
Try new foods and cuisines together
Go to the theater, a concert, or the ballet

Hug your child daily.,
Encourage your child to pursue their interests.,
Allow them to quit activities sometimes.,
Encourage curiosity.,
Praise their creativity.,
Praise their effort.",How to Raise a Well‐Rounded Child3," Showing your child affection through touch is an excellent way to create a loving and supportive environment. Studies have shown that physical contact, such as hugs and rubs, can help to reduce stress and anxiety among children. It is very important that you build affection into your relationship with your child. This will teach them the importance of close relationships and contact.That being said, there will be times when your child does not want to be hugged.
Ask them for a hug. This way you are respecting their personal space.

, A great way to ensure that you are raising a well-rounded child is to encourage them to pursue their own interests. Although success at school is important, it should not be the only thing that you place value on as a parent. Instead, allow your child to pursue and engage in a variety of activities. Your child may not excel at traditional classroom learning, but enjoy taking part in sports or other extracurricular activities.If your child demonstrates interest in a particular activity or hobby try and foster this by supporting them. When praising them, acknowledge their effort, hard work, and persistence rather than their results.
For example, sign them up for swimming lessons, or soccer camp. Alternatively, your child may be interested in collecting action figures or dolls.
Show your support by showing up for games, recitals, plays, and other important events. Your child will appreciate having you there to watch them.

, Although it is very important to teach your child the importance of commitment and perseverance, there are certain instances when it is okay to allow your child to quit an extracurricular activity. For instance, you shouldn’t force a child to remain involved in something that they truly dislike. Consider the following things when your child is thinking about quitting an activity:Your child’s age: If you have a young child they are likely involved in a variety of different pursuits and it will be necessary for them to make choices about which activities they would like to continue as they get older.
The cost: If your child is truly unhappy with a certain activity and it is costing you a lot of money, there is no point in putting yourself in a strained position financially.
The reason for quitting. Ask your child why they want to quit. Maybe they are injured or sick, or they have a mean instructor or coach.
Set guidelines before joining. For example, talk to your child about the value of commitment before the start of the season. If it is in individual activity you may suggest that they need to attend at least three sessions. If it is a team-based sport you may want them to stick it out until the end of the season.

, Curiosity is a key to creativity and opening your mind to new experiences. Individuals who are afraid of failure are often closed off to curiosity. If you want to raise a well-rounded child encourage them to be curious and ask questions. You can model this behaviour by saying things like “I was wondering about that” when they ask questions. This will enable you to help your child discover the answer.You can also set aside time for discovery and free play.
Encourage your child to look under rocks and explore their surrounding environment.

, You should encourage your child to be as creative or wacky as they can be without judgment. Ask them to come up with their own stories, and let them have plenty of time for free form, imaginative play. Even if their ideas are nonsensical, praise them for their creativity in thinking up such things.

Playing with dolls, pretending they are astronauts, or staging their own play are all forms of imaginative play.
Play pretend with your child. Hold a tea party together, or pretend to be a dragon that is guarding a treasure. This will encourage your child's creativity and strengthen your bond with them.

, Praising kids for minor accomplishments is not always productive and does not foster character development. Instead, you should praise your child’s effort. This will demonstrate that you value hard work, and effort over success. For example, say things like “You didn’t give up,” “you are getting better,” “you gave it your all.”If your child is involved in a team sport or group activity praise their teammates as well.
Complement their teamwork and camaraderie to reveal that this is an important character trait.

"
"
Encourage them to take part in physical activities.,
Feed your child a well-balanced diet.,
Ensure they get enough sleep.",How to Raise a Well‐Rounded Child4," Children and adolescents should get 60 minutes of physical activity each day in order to lead a healthy lifestyle. Provide your child with opportunities to engage in physical activity. For example, sign them up for dance classes, or a team-based sporting activity. Even hanging on the monkey bars or playing tag with friends counts as physical activity.Model healthy habits for them. This means that you eat healthy around them and exercise regularly so that they can see what a healthy lifestyle is like.
Take part in physical activities as a family. For example, go for a hike or bike ride together, or spend time playing at a local park.
Make sure that they do not overtrain in a single sport. Watch for fatigue, trouble sleeping, and lack of motivation.

, Children require plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, and protein in their diet. Because their bodies are still growing they should have more calcium than adults to help with bone growth. Ensure they get approximately 1,300 milligrams of calcium each day. In order to promote the development of a healthy diet:Introduce your child to a wide variety of foods.
Avoid eating too much fast food. This should be a treat, not a regular occurrence.
Monitor their intake of sweets, candies, and refined sugars.
Older children can help out with grocery shopping and cooking. Include them in meal planning, and teach them how to make their own food. This will foster healthy eating habits as they grow up.

, Sleep is extremely important to your child’s overall well-being and it will help them to stay focused throughout the school day. Sleep is also important to the immune system and can actually help to prevent illness. Children between the ages of 5 and 12 need approximately 10-11 hours of sleep each night. Some children will need more sleep than others. Here are some tips to help them get a good night of sleep:Set a firm bedtime and stick to the same time every night.
Create a bedtime routine. This will help them wind down from the day and prepare their minds and body for sleep.
Avoid foods and drinks that contain caffeine prior to bed.
Don’t allow a TV in their room. Make sure they don’t watch something scary before going to bed.
Don’t let your children do homework or play in their bed. Make sure it is reserved for sleeping. This way they will associate their bed with sleep and it will be easier for them to fall asleep each night.

Allow your child to evaluate the consequences.,
Insist that they fight their own battles.,
Allow natural consequences.",How to Respond when Your Child Wants to Quit2," Quitting always has consequences. Sometimes, these are good (e.g. relief). Other times these consequences are regrets and missed opportunities. Discuss the consequences with your child, but allow them to decide if the consequences warrant quitting or pushing through.For example, you might say something like, “Do you understand that if you quit, you cannot change your mind next week?”

, If your child does insist on quitting, you should insist that they discuss it with their teacher, coach, etc. Do not opt to have that conversation for them, and do not let them simply stop showing up. By having a conversation with the person leading the activity, they may find that they can work through the problem and continue the activity.You could tell your child something like, “I support your decision to quit, but only after you have had a conversation with your teacher about your concerns.”

, If your child chooses to quit an activity, allow them to feel the consequences. Consequences handed down by parents often seem random and misplaced to children. Natural and logical consequences are easier for children to understand, because they come as a result of an action (or inaction).An example of a natural consequence to quitting might be that the child no longer gets to see their friends at practice each night.
Remind your child that they chose to quit, and that these consequences come with quitting. You can say something like “We discussed this before you quit. I respected your decision, but now it’s too late to rejoin the swim team. You’ll have to wait until the next season.”

Understand your child’s interests.,
Allow your child to choose their activities.,
Try selected activities in short bursts.,
Frame each new activity as a trial.",How to Respond when Your Child Wants to Quit3," As a parent, you may accidentally project your interests onto your child. This can lead to pushing your child into an activity that they have little interest in. Instead, consider your child’s interests when discussing possible activities., Though you may direct your child toward activities that you think would be a good fit, you should leave the final choice up to them. This gives them a sense of control and responsibility. It also makes them more accountable to what they have chosen.When your children are too young to know what activities are available, present them with a few activities to choose from.

, If at all possible, avoid jumping into a new season without first trying the activity. Take a few sessions to start out, or attend a day camp centered around the activity. This way, your child has the opportunity to change their mind about the activity without having to quit it., By framing each new activity as trying something new, you give your child permission to form their own opinion of it. If they try it and like it, they can continue the activity. If they don’t like the activity, they can move on to the next one.For example, if your child wants a pet and promises to care for it, you could consider allowing them to dog sit for a neighbor or friend. If they change their mind about caring for a pet, you aren’t stuck with the pet. If they don’t, there’s a better chance that they will stick with caring for their own pet.

Learn how to say no.,
Find some alone time.,
Connect with your spouse or partner.,
Get enough rest.",How to Reduce the Stress of Parenting1," There are only so many commitments you can make and keep as a parent.


Be selective about the projects you agree to help others with. For example, volunteer to help with one PTA event instead of all of them.
Limit the activities of your kids as well. Children tend to be over scheduled today, which can increase their stress as well as yours. Instead of playing 3 sports in a season, ask each child to pick 1 sport or activity to dedicate themselves to.;
, If you are a working parent, protect your lunch hour as your own and spend it reading, walking or doing something else you enjoy. If you are at home with your kids all day, spend their nap times on yourself.

, If you are married or in a relationship, your other half is probably feeling some parenting stress as well.


Schedule a date night once a week, or if you cannot get out, watch a movie together once the kids are in bed.

, While 8 hours of sleep per night may seem impossible, not sleeping enough can increase your stress levels. Set a bedtime rule for your kids and yourself.

Design an obstacle course.,
Read your toddler some books.,
Encourage your toddler to sing and dance.,
Give your toddler a busy bag.,
Give your child some chores to do.,
Play dress up.,
Give your toddler time to play in the bathtub.",How to Keep an Active Toddler Occupied Inside1," Create obstacles with any available resources. You can let your child crawl under a table, jump over his potty, balance on a chair, hop over piles of pillows, or roll over your mattress.


This can help your active child to build his cardiovascular strength through jumping and running. It also helps to improve his balance.
Just make sure that you or another responsible adult is supervising your child at all times while they are doing the obstacle course.;
, Even if you have a very active toddler, most kids will be willing to calm down enough to be read a story.The trick is to reach for books that will encourage movement and play with your toddler.


Read books that include some active movements, such as Dr. Seuss’ ""The Cat in the Hat"", ""The Elephant and the Bad Baby"" by Elfrida Vipont and Raymond Briggs, ""We’re Going on a Bear Hunt"" by Michael Rosen and Helen Oxenbury and ""Would You Rather by John Burningham.""
For example, while reading Dr. Seuss’ ""The Cat in the Hat"", your active toddler can pretend that she’s balancing the things on her body just like the Cat does in the story or if you have twins or sibling toddlers; they can pretend that they are Thing 1 and Thing 2, playing and running about the house.
While reading ""The Elephant and the Bad Baby"", your toddler can pretend that she’s the baby riding the elephant and traveling all over the place.

, Allow your child to watch some shows that encourage singing and dancing.


As much as possible, use video CD or DVD’s instead of leaving your toddler to watch television programs with advertisements that play every 5 minutes. Some shows recommended are HI-5, Blue’s Clues and Elmo’s Great Adventure and the much beloved, Sesame Street.
You can skip television viewing altogether and just throw on a CD and have a song and dance party with your toddler. Apart from helping her develop movement and coordination, you also get to move and burn a couple of calories along the way.

, A busy bag is a simple bag containing activities that your toddler can engage in. Each bag has its own activity that your toddler can get busy working on. You can get really creative with these busy bags (your imagination is the limit) but rest assured, they’re super simple to make. Some examples are:


Place a small coloring book with crayons or colored pens inside the bag. When your toddler grabs a busy bag she can start coloring the books with her crayons.
For slightly older toddlers (3-4 years old) you can place their favorite puzzles in the bag, which they can solve on their own or with a little guidance from you.
You could also place little treats like a small pack of jelly sweets or a box of raisins into the busy bag.

, You can let your toddler pour herself a glass of water or make a bowl of cereal. You could also set her up at a sink and allow her to wash some plastic cups and dishes in some warm soapy water, or sweep the floor using a child sized broom.

, Dressing up can be so much fun for toddlers, especially girls. Even if you don't have proper costumes, you could allow her to wear some of your make up and let her wear mommy’s shoes. Pretend she’s an office girl, a teacher, a model, a doctor or a painter.

, If your toddler is a water baby and loves playing in the bathtub, then by all means allow at least 30 minutes for her to play (and get clean!).


Fill the tub with rubber toys and make colorful foams by adding food coloring to the bubble bath before mixing it in the water.

Call on friends and family members for help.,
Set up play dates.,
Hire a babysitter you can trust.,
Join a support group.",How to Reduce the Stress of Parenting2," Not only can the people close to you help with childcare, they can also be good listeners.

, Get together with other parents who have kids close in age to your own. The socialization will be good for you and your children.


Share stress management secrets. All parents feel some sort of stress. Try to get an idea of how others reduce the effects of stress on their lives.

, Whether you want to do the grocery shopping on your own, take a yoga class or spend a romantic evening with your spouse, having a babysitter your kids love on call can greatly reduce your stress as a parent.

, There are support groups available in most areas for all sorts of parents. These can be especially helpful for single parents, or parents of children who have special challenges such as disabilities like ADHD or autism.

Incorporate exercise into your day.,
Plan ahead whenever you can.,
Keep consistent behavior expectations and disciplines.,
Choose your battles.,
Stick to a routine.",How to Reduce the Stress of Parenting3," Whether you take a walk, use yoga, go swimming or play a sport such as tennis, exercise can reduce your stress and help you feel more energetic and positive.


Involve your children in exercise when you can. It sets a good example for them, and gives you some family time that everyone can enjoy and benefit from.

, Procrastinating, rushing and forgetting are all stressful practices, especially as a parent.


Write down all appointment dates and times in a calendar, or program them into your smart phone. Review the entire week on Sunday night so you know what is coming up.
Keep mornings on schedule by preparing for them the night before. Select the clothes you and your kids will wear the next day, make lunches and set the breakfast table.

, You will feel less stress when your kids know exactly what is expected of them and exactly how you will respond if they misbehave.

, Fighting with your kids can be stressful, so decide what is worth fighting over. For example, fighting with your 4-year-old about her desire to wear a Halloween costume in July might not be worth the stress.

, Keep your kids on a regular routine every day so they feel secure and you do not feel stressed. Knowing what to expect can keep everyone relaxed and focused on the day.

Do some block stacking and Lego play.,
Purchase edible finger paint and edible play dough.,
Make sensory boards or walls.,
Organize some sorting activities.",How to Keep an Active Toddler Occupied Inside2," Let your child build tower blocks and other fun sensory and educational structures using her blocks and Lego. Some stores have large Lego blocks for toddlers who are still developing their fine motor skills.

, To make an edible play dough, mix together a cup of flour, a tablespoon of baking soda, and half a cup of water with a pinch of salt.


When it all comes together, divide into 4 equal parts and start tinting with food color of your choice. Make another batch for additional pieces of play dough. You shouldn't encourage your child to eat the play dough, but at least you know it's completely safe if she does.
Edible paints are much the same way. Just mix about a cup of flour with 2 cups of water to make it thick and smooth. Add a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the consistency then divide into paper cups and add the food color of your choice.

, You can use regular cardboard for this or you can vamp it up and use a cork board or a wooden board that you can attach to a wall.


If your toddler loves textures, then place different cloths with different textures on the cork board. You can glue small portions of cloth to the board or you can use multicolored plastic embroidery hoops to display different fabrics (smooth, rough, silky, rubbery etc).
You can attach chains that go “clink” when touched; or use scrubbing cloths and brushes to demonstrate rough textures. You can also attach door locks or pad locks that your toddlers can manipulate with the keys to unlock.
Some other ideas for sensory boards include attaching different colored ribbons that your toddler can touch and play with, or different colored felt cloths in the shape of the letters the alphabet.

, Some fun indoor activities can include sorting. Get your child to sort things like her socks or a collection of plastic animal toys into different categories.


She can try matching loose socks with their pairs and then place them in different baskets according to their color (which can be a big help with the laundry!)
She could try sorting the plastic animals according to their type - farm animals in one pile, zoo animals in another, etc.

Use pipe cleaners for crafting.,
Make personalized mugs.,
Collect stones for painting.,
Make shapes and characters out of felt cloth.,
Use paper plates to make characters or monsters.,
Paint on windows using white board markers.",How to Keep an Active Toddler Occupied Inside3," Pipe cleaners are available at craft stores, they come in different colors and lengths that you can use to make different things from flowers, to houses, to cars, to shapes and letters, which you can then just glue on cardboard.


If you want, you can have these framed and hung on your child’s bedroom wall for decoration.

, Allow you toddler to draw on some white porcelain cups or mugs with colored permanent markers. Get them to doodle your name, their dad’s name, their own name, or even the pet’s name so it becomes personalized.

, Collect smooth stones of different shapes and sizes and ask your toddler to paint them. After the paint is dry, you can paste on a pair of wobbly eyes and attach pipe cleaners to make little critters out of these stones.

, Felt cloth is so versatile that you can use it as a base for a project or as the main component of a project.


You can cut out shapes from felt cloth, such us petals and leaves and stems to make a flower, or stars, moons and clouds to make an evening scene.
Only you and your child’s imagination sets the limit to what you can do.

, Just use pipe cleaners, felt cloth, wobbly eyes, some colored paper and let your imagination run wild.

, Toddlers can do this while it’s raining outside (or even on sunny days). Just make sure to let them know that they are only allowed to draw on the windows - the walls are off limits.


Make sure to only stock up on white board markers because the last thing you want is for your toddler to use permanent markers by mistake.

Use your parenting journal for any purpose that works for you.",How to Keep a Parenting Journal," If you are going to be the sole audience for your parenting journal, you have the freedom to write whatever you want.


Consider whether you will let your child read your journal when he or she is older. This might influence what you write about in your journal. If you will let your child read what you write, you might want to keep the journal positive, or be prepared to honestly discuss any negative or indifferent emotions you write about as a parent.;
, You might prefer a pretty notebook or a leather-bound volume. If you do most of your reading and writing online, start a digital journal.


Consider online sites such as Penzu or Daily Diary. They provide you with a private online space to keep a journal or a diary. You can download them to your own computer, print them out or continue contributing for as long as you want.

, A parenting journal is a good place to record first steps, first words and favorite foods.


Keep your parenting journal with your baby books, photo albums and other things that you use to capture the growth and development of your child. A journal will give you more space to explore how you feel at every stage.

,


Include how your child interacts with family members, neighbors, friends and school mates. Write about special relationships and bonds.

, Parenting can be stressful, and writing about the stress is a healthy way to deal with your emotions and challenges.


Write down what is happening when you feel the most stress, or when your child is acting out and not listening. This might help you identify patterns that can minimize behavioral issues in the future.

Plan your meals.",How to Involve Your Kids in Family Savings Goals1," Although your children will initially have little input on things like college savings, it is important that you include them in discussions about other savings plans. Whether you are planning to save for a small trip or a major vacation, get every member of your family involved in the planning. Including your children in the conversation will help them feel invested in whatever you are saving for.Have everyone gather for a family meeting at the kitchen table or in your living room.;
, As you talk about what you want to save for, calculate how much everything will cost. Let your children know what is and is not in your budget. Being honest with them will help your children develop realistic expectations and not be disappointed.Have a computer or phone handy so that you can quickly look things up.

, Once you have agreed on how much you need to save, discuss ways in which your children can help. Brainstorm ways in which you can save as a family and as individuals. Let your kids know that saving is a team effort and that everyone in your family needs to work together., Talk with your children about ways to limit your household use of things like water, electricity, and gas. Encourage your children to turn off the lights and other electronic equipment when nobody is in a room. Ask them to turn down the thermostat in the winter and raise it in the summer.If you have cable and internet, you might also talk with your kids about cutting back on your cable package or lowering your internet bandwidth.

, Each week, plan all of your meals ahead of time. Meal planning will help you stick to your grocery budget and keep you from eating out, which can be expensive. Before you go grocery-shopping, talk with your family about the meals that they would like to eat in the upcoming week."

Encourage assertiveness.,
Encourage her to silence judgment.,
Teach her to accept imperfection.,
Talk about personal boundaries regarding her body.,
Tell your daughter you believe in her.,
Model confident behavior.,
Accept occasional disagreement and anger.,
Listen.,
Help her work through issues with friends.",How to Raise Confident Girls," You want to make sure your daughter has a say in basic decisions. Let her call some of the shots around the house in regards to things like her schedule and eating habits. Allowing her to make small decisions early on will create a mindset in which she feels comfortable pursuing her own passions and interests.These choices do not have to be major decisions. However, letting her choose her own way will instill confidence at a young age. Allow her to pick out her own outfits for school, for example, and select what activities she wants to do after school.
Allowing your daughter to make choices will show her that she's a valued member of your household. It will give her a sense of personal autonomy that will instill confidence.;
, Many parents hope their children will follow specific paths in life. However, forcing your daughter to pursue certain interests is likely to encourage more insecurity than confidence. Confident people make their own choices, so allow your daughter to pursue her own unique interests.Take note of what your daughter shows interest in. Pay attention to what subjects she responds to in school and what occupies her time after school. Try to find ways to encourage her to pursue these things.
For example, say your daughter loves her English class and always spends time reading at home. You could enroll her in a writing course at a community center or buy her a library pass.
You can also try exposing your daughter to a variety of things to help her find her interests. Try taking a trip to the science museum, visit an art gallery, let her try dance classes, fix the car together, or volunteer at a shelter.

, You do not want to force your daughter down a certain path due to her gender. When your daughter is pursuing interests and passions, leave preconceived notions about gender behind. Do not try to discourage her from, say, joining the football team. Many girls do not want to pursue traditionally female paths, so make it clear she does not have to do so.Also, avoid providing only gender stereotyped toys for your daughter. Provide her with a mix of toys instead, such as toy cars, toy tools, and lego sets, as well as dolls and a play kitchen.


If your daughter wants to enroll in a sports team at school, allow her to do so. If she shows an interest in playing with trucks over dolls, do not force dolls on her.
Strive to get every family member on board. Oftentimes, for birthday parties and other events, guests will bring traditionally girly items if they don't know what to get. Give guests a little guidance if presents are expected, and tell them to cater to your daughter's unique interests over traditionally gendered toys.

, While you shouldn't push your daughter in school unreasonably, academic achievement can certainly help build confidence. The best way to encourage achievement is to simply show interest in your daughter's academic life.Make sure you keep up to date on how she's doing in school. Help her with homework assignments and organizing her school schedule. Show her basic study skills when tests and quizzes come around to help her do well.
You should also simply ask her about school when you have the chance. Inquire as to what her favorite subjects are, whether she likes her teacher, and other aspects of her academic life. By showing interest in school, you're showing your daughter it's important.

, Media can have a negative impact on a young girl's sense of self. Media often forces gender roles on young women, and can also inhibit autonomous thinking and creativity. During your daughter's early years, let her develop her own ideas about herself and the world. A confident person thinks for herself, and your daughter will be better able to do so without too much media influence.Establish firm rules and routines regarding media consumption. Have a set limit of how much time she can spend watching television, for example, and don't let her spend too much time online.
As she gets older, however, you will not be able to as easily control her exposure to media. She will be exposed at school, out with her friends, and other places. Try to worry too much about this. If your daughter has had the ability to think for herself early on, she'll be less influenced by media later.
Talk to your daughter when she is faced with these images as well. For example, while waiting in line at the grocery store, you might explain the magazine covers to her by saying something like, ""Honey, those pictures are not actually what women look like. They are enhanced, painted, and exaggerated. Real women aren't perfect and are beautiful because they aren't."" This may be even more important for women of color to explain to their daughters, especially if they are often faced with images of women who are white.

, You want to make it clear that your daughter has a right to define who she is. Many children, especially young girls, feel they have to be universally liked. Teach your daughter she should be a good person, but also her own person. It's okay to have traits that others don't love as long as she's true to herself.Always present a range of options for your daughter and allow her to choose. If gymnastics is a popular club for girls at her school, let her know it's okay to go down a different route if she wants. Allow her to pick clothing that expresses herself, and read the books that speak to her rather than going with what's popular.
Remember that it's okay if your daughter does pursue some things that are popular or trendy. This is a normal part of growing up and does not necessarily mean your daughter is losing her individuality. She may genuinely enjoy the most popular tween band or reading series.

, Young girls are often encouraged to be likable, to the point they don't assert their own needs. When raising confident girls, assertiveness is vital. Many girls grow up viewing being assertive as being aggressive. Make sure your daughter understands it's appropriate to assert herself and her needs.Tell her it's okay to let someone know if they're making her feel bad or uncomfortable. Teach her ways to express herself without being aggressive or mean in return.
For example, if someone is picking on her at school, tell her not to yell or tease back. Teach her instead to say, with a serious tone, ""I don't like the way you're talking to me."" You can even practice at home by role playing these kinds of scenarios.
Prepare her a little for sexism. Let her know people may sometimes look down on her for being an assertive woman, but make it clear that's their problem. She has a right to a sense of personal space and autonomy.

, Your daughter may face judgment for her unique interests, style, and passions. However, let her know everyone faces judgment but she should not let this hold her back. Make sure she feels she can define herself however she wants, regardless of what others think.Have her pick three words that define herself. Encourage her to pick whatever words she wants. You can say something like, ""If you're not thinking of how others may react, how would you describe yourself in three words?""
Then, ask her to talk about times she displayed these qualities, and times when she did not. This will show her she does not have to be showcasing all her skills at once. No one can be everything at once.

, Women are often put under particular pressure to be perfect. Girls often grow up seeing things in a black and white fashion. Your daughter may think she's either excelling or failing. Encourage her to see things in more nuanced terms.Allow her to express her vulnerabilities without judgment as well, but show her she can do so without tearing herself apart. Encourage her to open up when she feels she's screwed something up, but to talk it out productively.
Try to teach her to see herself realistically and without judgment. For example, if she says something like, ""I failed at that test. I'm an idiot,"" correct her. Encourage her to instead say something like, ""I didn't do great on that test, but no one's perfect all the time.""

, One of the most important parts of raising confident girls is encouraging a sense of bodily autonomy. Your daughter should know she has a right to define personal boundaries regarding her body without feeling guilt, so instill this sense in her early on.Tell your daughter she is in charge of her body. Ask her on occasion, ""Who is in charge of your body?"" and encourage her to enthusiastically reply, ""I am!""
Teach her it's always okay to say ""No"" to forms of physical contact, even from relatives. Do not push her to hug and kiss people goodbye if she's not comfortable. If other siblings roughhouse, let her know she doesn't have to participate if she doesn't want to.

, Your daughter needs to know you have her back and support her. A lot of support from others, especially adults, can instill confidence. Always support your daughter's decision and tell her you believe in her ability to succeed.Always tell your daughter you think she can achieve what she wants and help her along the way. If she wants to, say, enter the science fair, tell her you believe she can do a good job and assist with her project.
Successful people usually have cheerleaders early in life who tell them they will eventually succeed. Be your daughter's personal cheerleader and help her feel that she can be successful with time and effort.

, How you act in front of your daughter will teach her how to act. Make sure to model good behavior. Watch what you say and do. If your daughter hears you beating yourself up, she's likely to do the same. Try to have confidence in yourself if you want a confident daughter.Refrain from putting yourself down. If you miss a deadline at work, do not say something like, ""I'm so stupid. I can't believe I screwed that up."" Instead, say something like, ""Everyone makes mistakes. I'll try to do better next time.""
Avoid being too harsh about your body. Many girls develop body image issues, so if you're talking negatively about your own appearance, your daughter will learn to do the same.
Take compliments when they're presented to you. Thank people for speaking to your strengths instead of negating the comment.

, Women are often taught to be agreeable, despite their own personal reservations. Your daughter needs to know it's okay to disagree and express anger. If your daughter gets mad at you sometimes, or rebels against the rules, allow her to express this in an appropriate manner rather than punishing her.If your daughter doesn't agree with a particular rule, ask her why. Have a conversation with her about it instead of simply saying, ""Well, those are the rules in this house.""
Encourage her to express anger to others too. It's okay if she sometimes gets mad at teachers, boyfriends, and friends. Let her know anger is not something to be repressed, but a normal part of life.

, Your daughter should always feel she has a listening ear ready when she's going through something. Make time to talk regularly and validate your daughter's feelings rather than dismissing them.Create consistent times when you're able to listen. For example, always sit in the living room for a bit after dinner. Drive your daughter to and from school so she has a chance to talk if she wants.
When your daughter talks, listen more than you talk. If she's feeling something, acknowledge before giving advice. For example, say something like, ""I'm hearing you feel the teacher's grading system is unfair.""

, You want to make sure your daughter values her female friends rather than seeing them as rivals. If your daughter is struggling to navigate a female friendship, help her work through this. Make sure she knows how to manage conflicts so she can make strong female friendships throughout life.Discourage behaviors like gossiping and spreading rumors. If you hear your daughter gossiping with other friends, encourage empathy. Ask her to reflect on how she would feel to be on the receiving end of gossip.
Never dismiss mean girl tactics as an example of girls being girls. Make sure your daughter knows she should bring up her female friends rather than tearing them down.

Model responsible money management.,
Practice saving money.,
Give your children an allowance.,
Encourage older children to work.",How to Involve Your Kids in Family Savings Goals2," The best way to get your children to value saving money is by showing them how to do it. Show your children your family’s budget and talk with them about how you are planning for your retirement, their future college expenses, and other savings goals. Modeling responsibility will likely lead to similar behavior from your children., In order to teach your children how to save money, you should practice money-saving lessons. Teach them how to use coupons or help them start a lemonade stand. These things will help them better understand the importance of a budget and how to save money.For example, you could encourage small children to place their money in three jars: one for savings, one for spending, and another for donating. This will help them gain an understanding of how adults budget their money.

, With older children, you should consider giving them an allowance for completing household chores. This will help them become more responsible around the house and learn how to budget their money. Encourage them to save their allowance money for larger items like video games or bicycles., Once they are old enough, ask your kids to get a part-time job or do odd jobs around the neighborhood. Your kids can earn a little extra money by babysitting, mowing lawns, walking dogs, or shoveling snow. Encourage your children to put the money they have earned towards your savings goal.Do not force your children to put the money they earned towards their savings. This will make them resentful and less likely to want to contribute. Instead, remind them of the benefits of saving but allow them to make the final decision about their money.

Track your savings on a chart.,
Incentivize saving.,
Use a piggy bank.,
Play games.",How to Involve Your Kids in Family Savings Goals3," Keep everyone abreast of your family’s efforts to save money. Track your progress on a large chart and keep it in a place where everyone can see it. Once a month, count how much money everyone has saved and mark it on the chart. This will help remind everyone of your goals and keep them motivated.You can make a simple chart with some markers and construction paper.

, Whenever your child saves some money, you might consider rewarding them. You can reward them with a gift or match their savings. Positive reinforcement will help your child develop a good attitude towards saving and encourage that behavior in the future.Consider setting savings benchmarks and rewarding your children every time they meet an objective. For example, if your children save $50, you could have a family pizza party or make a special ice cream run.

, For younger children, a piggy bank can be a great way to make saving money fun. Placing money in the bank can be a fun game that helps them develop their saving habits. As your children get older, you can introduce more complicated piggy banks and savings systems., You can help your children learn about how to save money by playing games that encourage money management. Create a fun game that engages your children’s imagination and excites them about saving. You can also play traditional board games like Monopoly or The Game of Life.There are also a number of online games that will help your children learn how to save.For example, you might create a detailed story about how saving money helps the Hobbits get to Mount Doom. Every dollar that your children save gets Frodo and Samwise a little closer to destroying the One Ring and defeating Sauron.

Check with your pediatrician.,
Call your insurance company.,
Meet with all prospective therapists first.,
Verify the therapist's licensing status.,
Ask about experience.,
Inquire about emergencies and absences.",How to Hire a Child Therapist," You have been taking your child to him for years and both of you know and trust his opinion. He has a direct line to the experts in the field, and can recommend a child therapist that he not only trusts, but feels will be a good match for your child.;
, Once you have a few referrals from your pediatrician, it's a good idea to call your health insurance company to find out which of those referrals are covered under your plan. You don't know how long your child will need therapy, and it can get expensive if you are not helped by insurance.

, When making your phone calls, ask the child therapist if you can meet with her first before committing to bringing your child in for regular visits. If the therapist says no or claims to be too busy, then it's a good sign that she isn't the right fit.

, First, ask the therapist if he is licensed, then make a telephone call to the proper board to be sure. If you choose to go to this therapist, look for the license hanging on his wall.

, Since you have gotten referrals, you are assuming that the therapist specializes in children and adolescents. Before making your final decision, ask all of them how long they have been a child therapist, and choose one with a good amount of experience working with kids.

, You may not want to think about it, but in the event of an emergency, it's important to find out how the child therapist can be reached. In addition, ask her if there will be someone to cover when she is not in her office, such as during vacation periods or illnesses.

Spend quality time with each child.,
Set clear, empathetic limits.,
Ask them questions, and listen to the answers.,
Practice what you preach.",How to Improve Parenting Skills1," The foundation of good parenting lies in the relationship you have with your kids. If you never sit down and have one-on-one time with your children, you’ll find it challenging to relate to them, and vice versa. Devote at least one hour of quality time per week with each child.This time should be spent with positive interactions, such as cheering your child on as they build a fort or talking to them about their school week. Avoid using this time to correct or teach. Simply enjoy being together.;
, No matter how hard they may push against it, children thrive with structure. You can practice good parenting by setting limits with your child from a very young age. Limit-setting isn’t the same as punishment. In fact, you will use empathy to establish appropriate limits while still showing your child that you’re on their side.For example, you might set the limit that your child cannot play with his ball in the front yard. You might say, “I know you like playing with your ball in the front yard, but you get caught up in playing and run out into the street. It’s safer if you play in the gate out back.”
With this method, you are explaining the limit while still showing that you understand why your child wants to play with the ball in the front. By showing empathy for their feelings, they are much more likely to follow your directive.

, Starting out communicating with your children while they are young sets a positive tone for adolescence. A great rule-of-thumb is to ask three “you” questions each day. This teaches your child conversation skills while also helping you learn more about them and their experiences.You might ask, “What would you like to do for fun this weekend?” “What did you learn in school today?” or “What are you going to wear for picture day?”
Once you ask the questions, actively listen to their answers. Look for openings to take the conversation further and to keep them talking. For instance, you daughter says, “I don’t know what I want to wear for picture day” with a moan. You might say, “You don’t sound excited. I thought you usually enjoyed picture day.”

, Many parents go by the “do as I say, not as I do” principle. Such an attitude may lead to a confused child. Plus, your child may still end up following in your footsteps. Send the message that the limits you set are important by upholding them yourself.This includes all habits, from not bullying to not abusing drugs or alcohol. Instead set a positive example with healthy behaviors that you child will pick up from you.

Establish an allowance.,
Talk about essential spending.,
Show them how much items they want cost.,
Help them be creative with budgeting.",How to Help Your Children Build Their First Budget1," If you want children to budget, you need to give them some money to work with. Establish an allowance for each child. Many parents decide to give their child one dollar for every year they've been alive. For example, your five year-old would earn $5 a week. However, there are no strict rules. You could agree on a set amount for all your children, like giving all your kids $10 each week.Make sure you set rules regarding allowance. Let your kids know when they can expect to receive their money each week.
You can also make kids earn their allowance by doing chores.;
, If you want your children to figure out how to budget, let them know what essential spending is. Say something like, ""The first step to forming a budget is identifying where you need to spend money. This is stuff like bills and groceries."" From there, you can help your child decide what their essential expenses are.You can use your own budget as an example, as children are unlikely to have many essential expenses. Explain to them how much money you personally must set aside each week for things like food and bills.
From there, you can ask your child where they need to spend money. Ask them something like, ""Is there anything you need every week?"" Maybe your child always spends a dollar on a drink during lunch. Have your child subtract one dollar from their allowance.

, As children decide how to spend their allowance, talk to them about cost. Ask about the kinds of items they're hoping to buy and let them know the exact price. For example, if your child wants to buy a set of toy cars, say something like, ""Those are $5. That's about half your allowance.""Do this each time you're out and your child sees something. Over time, they will learn to remember their personal budget before buying an item.
For example, your child may want to buy a toy at the store, but realize they will not have the money for a drink at lunch the next day.

, Children may be frustrated at first with budgeting. They may want to be able to spend money more freely and get frustrated when money runs out. Teach them how to be creative and get by on less.Teach your child how to make due with what they have. For example, your child wants to do a specific craft project that calls for markers and poster board. You have markers, but no poster board, and your child agreed to only spend $5 each week on craft supplies.
Tell your child they could substitute poster board for cardboard and save their money. This will save some of their craft budget for more unusual supplies that would be hard to find a substitute for.

"
"
Soften intense reactions.,
Avoid over-functioning for the kids.,
Skip the nagging and praise positive behaviors instead.,
Learn how to handle parenting conflicts.",How to Improve Parenting Skills2," Children and adolescents are notorious for pushing buttons. Often, they do this to get a rise out of their parents. However, when you respond with anger, you teach inappropriate emotional regulation. Take a moment to collect yourself. Then, respond in a soft, empathetic way.For example, your son asks can he play the video game for the tenth time. Instead of exploding with “No, stop asking!” say “Tom, I know you like to play the video game, but the answer is still no. Your privileges were taken away for a reason.”

, Children and adolescents need some level of autonomy to learn new skills and increase self-efficacy. They can’t do that if you’re always doing everything for them. As a parent, it can be hard to give your child some space. But let them do the tasks they are capable of doing for themselves so that they can learn.Once you see that your toddler has tooth brushing down, let them do it for themselves. Resist the urge to take over when you’re feeling rushed.

, Reinforcement works for both negative and positive behaviors--whatever you give attention to increases. Instead of nagging your child about inappropriate behaviors, stop giving attention to them. On the other hand, when your child does something desirable, offer praise or encouragement.For instance, your child helps their younger sibling clear away their toys. You might say, “Wow, Henry! Thanks so much for being a good helper!”

, Bad-mouthing your spouse’s approach in front of the kids can give your kids an open door for playing you against one another. Respect your spouse or co-parent’s differences. Discuss disagreements away from little eyes and ears.Try to compromise based on who feels more strongly about what. If you are passionate about your children eating a plant-based diet, stick to your guns. However, if you don’t have a strong opinion about your children’s religion, then don’t fight your spouse about it, if they do.
If you both feel strongly about a subject, brainstorm ways you can meet in the middle."

Build a strong support system.,
Delegate when you can.,
Practice self-care.",How to Improve Parenting Skills3," It really does take a village to raise a child. You might count on a variety of other adults to help you with your child—teachers, coaches, child care professionals, and parents. But, oftentimes parents don’t really activate the available resources. Leaning on social support can help you fight stress and become an even better parent.Don’t hesitate to ask for help or advice when you need it. You might ask your child’s teacher, “Things have been a little rocky at home since the divorce. Do you mind keeping an eye on Talia to see if she’s adjusting okay?”
Social support also means spending time with other adults on occasion. Schedule in time to hang out with friends, host a family dinner, or plan a romantic date night with your partner.

, Sometimes, the best way to improve your parenting is to admit that you need help. Accept offers of help when friends and family ask to babysit. Hire that cleaner so that you can spend more of your evenings enjoying family time. Or, share the load with your co-parent so that you can have some time off every now and then., If you’re coping with chronic stress or other problems, it becomes even harder for you to be the doting parent your child deserves. In order to pour from your cup, there must be something in it to begin with. Fill your cup regularly by engaging in relaxing and nurturing self-care activities.You might get up early to have a cup of coffee or tea and watch the sun rise. You might sign up for an evening yoga or strength-training class. Or, you might steal an hour after the kids go to bed to watch a funny TV show.

Encourage your child to be content with what they have.,
Teach about need versus want.,
Remind them of their budget regularly.,
Set an example yourself.",How to Help Your Children Build Their First Budget2," Children may be eager to spend money, especially if you've just started giving them an allowance. In order to teach them to budget and save, try to teach contentment. When your child wants to spend money at the store, remind them to be grateful for what they have now.Encourage your children to strive for more in ways that don't involve spending more. For example, your child wants a new hockey stick. Tell them something like, ""You would enjoy hockey more if you practiced with your friends more often. Why don't you try to use your current hockey stick now and see if you enjoy playing more?""
Ask your children whether they really need items they want. Explain to them that ads work to create a sense of want. For example, say something like, ""I know those kids on the commercial are having fun, but they're paid to act like that. You could have a lot of fun with the toys you have now.""

, When young children are trying to budget, they may struggle to know the difference between needing something and wanting it. You should step in and help your child understand the difference between need and want so they can learn to budget effectively.Remind your child every dollar they spend on one thing is one dollar less from their weekly budget. For example, ""If you spend $2 on that candy bar, you will only have $8 left of your allowance this week. Do you really need that candy bar when we have treats at home?""
When you're in the store, have your child spend some of their own money on supplies for school. This can help teach them to budget for money they need. For example, you can have your child pay for their own pencils or pens.

, Throughout the day when spending opportunities arise, remind your child of their budget. This will help cut back on impulse purchases. For example, if your child wants to buy a stick of gum, ask them, ""How much of your food budget is left? That gum costs a dollar fifty."", Children look to their parents as models. Each time your'e shopping with your kid, show you're adept at budgeting. Say ""No"" to impulse purchases and make a list when you're shopping. If something is not a good deal, say so. For example, ""We could get this name brand cereal, but this one is much cheaper and has the same ingredients. This will help us save on our food budget."""
"
Have your child save up for something they want.,
Provide incentives to save.,
Take them to a bank.,
Make saved money visible.",How to Help Your Children Build Their First Budget3," A good project to help with saving is having your child save for something they really want. This will help them learn to save for longterm goals down the road. Help your child identify something they want, such as a new toy or something like horseback riding lessons. Sit down with your child and look over the costs. Help them figure out how much money to set aside each week to eventually afford the item.For example, say your child wants a remote control car that's around $30. They have $10 a week for an allowance.
Explain to your child that they can afford their toy in about six weeks if they put aside $5 each week.

, Children often need a nudge in the right direction as they tend to go for immediate rewards. You can do something that motivates them to save. For example, offer to give them 50 cents for every dollar they save., Many banks have workers who are willing to talk to young children about solid savings habits. Call your local bank and see if anyone would be willing to sit down with your kids and talk over practical savings. If your child has a large chunk of money they received, like $100 from a birthday card, you can even talk about opening a savings account.A savings account can be a good way to teach children about things like interest.

, Many children are visual learners. If you want you child to learn to save, put their savings somewhere where they can see it. Invest in something like a clear piggy bank or a big glass jar.One way to teach savings is to have your children pocket their spare change. Each time they get a quarter or nickel back, have them put the money in a jar. After a few months, take them to the bank to turn in their change for money.

,, It can be dangerous for your child to tell others that he is unsupervised after school.

, This is also the time to remind your child to double-check the lock on the door and to go over the safety rules you have in place.

,, If you don't have caller ID, consider something like two rings, hang up, and then immediately call back so that he knows it's safe to answer the phone.

,, Most emergency personnel are trained to check the refrigerator for this type of information.

, If they must stand on a stool or chair to access the microwave, you may want to consider limiting its use to prevent falls or burns from hot food.

,, This keeps your child occupied and allows for more time to enjoy each other's company when you arrive home.

Teach words that will be beneficial to your baby.,
Teach your baby through action and expression.,
Use your baby's sense of touch to teach words.,
Don't focus too much on a single word.,
Know that your baby's first word will reflect environment.,
Expose your baby to speech from an early age.,
Provide your baby with a running commentary.,
Demonstrate speech patterns.,
Demonstrate a variety of speech types for your baby.",How to Influence Your Baby's First Word," A baby’s first word is normally something that is important to them, such as “mama” or “dada”. Most babies’ words are repeated syllables and are fairly simple words. Keep this in mind when trying to influence your baby’s first word.


To say a real word, they must associate it with something—a baby won’t say “carrot” as his first word because he probably doesn’t know what a carrot is.
But he will say “mama” because his mom is always close by and he knows what the word means.;
, If you practice words with your baby but also teach them the words' meanings, it will help them learn to say the word more quickly. Babies typically understand objects and people before they understand words that describe relationships, feelings, or actions.


So if you are set on your baby saying a particular word, such as “dog” as their first word, surround them with that word. Sing songs and read stories about dogs, point out dogs on the street, and repeatedly build word association by saying the word “dog” whenever you show a picture of a dog.
This doesn’t guarantee that your child’s first word will be “dog”, but repetition and strong word association will significantly increase the chance.

, Your baby is more likely to choose their first word based on how useful or significant it is to him. For example, if your baby realizes how important milk is because it satisfies his hunger, he will be more motivated to learn how to say the word, so he can ask for it.


You can also influence your baby to use words like “bye-bye,” “good,” and “more,”, as these are other frequently used words that are useful for your baby to learn.
On the other hand, you should say the word “no” to your baby in moderation, otherwise he may latch on to it and use it as his first word - without really knowing what it implies - just because he hears it a lot and it is easy to say.

, For example, in teaching your baby the word “clap,” demonstrate how to clap and encourage. The same process goes with action words like ""hug"" or ""kiss"".


Aside from being familiar with the word, your baby will also learn that these words express appreciation (clap), and love (hug and kiss).
Focus on teaching your baby other words, along with their corresponding actions, as this will help with their emotional development, for example, “smile” for approval or happiness, and “wave” (to say hello).

, Babies have been shown to associate touch with words and often do better at speaking when they are being tickled or touched. Many babies can even improve their word association when they are being touched.


For example, touching a baby’s foot every time you say the word “foot” helps them understand what a foot is before they can even speak and can increase the likelihood of them attempting to repeat the word.
You can also play games with your baby and do word plays and finger games like “Where is Thumbkin” and “5 Little Pigs” to activate all of their senses. Even just talking as you rub their back or head will energize your baby and allow them to process what you are saying better.

, A baby’s first word is often unpredictable and comes when you least expect it. Parents can influence the first word in the sense of increasing their child’s overall speech development, but trying for a specific word is a little more difficult.


It's better to try to expand your baby's understanding of a wide variety of words using activities and examples, than to try to coerce them into saying one specific word.

, Most babies utter their first word between the ages of nine to fourteen months, though this differs from one baby to another. Your baby’s first word will depend on the type of environment they are in.


A baby's most influential environment is the one where he spends most of his time. - this could be your home, day-care, or playschool. Your baby’s first word is more likely to relate to the things that he sees and hears on a daily basis.
Additionally, at this stage of your baby's development he tends to imitate different kinds of sounds. For example, if you live near an airport where your baby always hears airplane; he likely to imitate the sound of an airplane. If you live on a farm, the baby is more likely to copy animal sounds.
If your family owns a dog and you spend a lot of your time playing and training the dog, the baby’s first word might be your dog’s name.

, Even before babies begin to speak for themselves, they can understand when a person is speaking words to them.


From a very early age, they can understand the difference between words and babbles or other incoherent sounds. Babies can begin to categorize things by word, even if they don’t understand what the words mean.To help your baby along, start speaking to them from a very early age and expose them to as much speech and vocabulary as you can.

, Start by having everyday conversations with your baby. Tell them what you are doing and give them a running commentary of your day.


For example: “I’m washing the dishes. Now I’m getting lunch ready. I’m eating a sandwich”. The more your baby is exposed to speech, the more likely he is to start talking at an early age.
You can also ask your baby questions and wait for a response. Even though your baby isn’t going to talk back to you anytime soon, it gets them involved and shows them how speech works.

, Talking in “baby talk” can help you connect with your child, although its effectiveness in helping develop language is sometimes questions. However, most experts agree that baby talk, or talking in a higher pitch than normal, is beneficial in the sense that it helps capture the infant’s attention.People also speak more slowly when using baby talk, which helps the baby better discern speech patterns and leads to their own language experimentation.
Baby talk is also helpful in that it helps a baby feel more comfortable in their speech testing, and often leads to language development at a younger age.
Holding a conversation with your baby by speaking to them and then waiting for them to respond (even if it's just nonsense) helps the baby transition from babbling to forming real words.

, This will naturally occur during their early months, but can be an even more powerful learning tool if parents make a conscious effort.


Simple conversations, such as holding a one-sided conversation with your baby, teach the child how their parents speak to them. You should also try modelling a conversation between two people by having your baby in the room for a conversation between you and your spouse.
A large group conversation can also teach a baby the different cadences and nuances of speech. Include older children in the conversations as well, so a baby can see how adults and children speak differently.
In most cases, the baby will notice that the child's speech is different from the adults and will pay more attention.

Before you can begin to help your child, it's important that you try to understand their problem so you can relate to them and understand what they need a little better.


Drugs increase the level of dopamine in the brain, which triggers feeling of pleasure. The brain wants to repeat these feelings of euphoria, which is how the drugs become addictive.
Because of chemical changes to the brain, the person finds it very difficult to quit even when he is ready to do so. These changes to the brain also impair the person's perception of their own behavior and makes them think that they are in control of their problem.
Over time, drug intake becomes as essential for the person as eating and drinking - their cravings start to dominate all other areas of their lives. Long-term use leads to issues like cognitive impairment, poor judgment and irrational thoughts.;
, Don’t wait for the things to settle down on their own, if you suspect that your child has a drug problem, it's important to intervene as early as possible and get them the help they need.


Signs that your child may have a drug problem include: behavioral changes, sleep disturbances, secretive behavior, demand for privacy, dropping grades, hostility, angry outbursts, absence from home with places, new friends
Try to talk to your child and get them to admit that they have a problem. Rather than being angry, let them know that you are there for them and just want to help them get through it.

, If you find that your child has a problem with drugs, be aware that you won't be able to solve the problem just by making your child go cold turkey. There are other issues that need to be addressed:


Your child needs to change the way he thinks about himself. His friends and company should be changed. The friends and group that he is keeping presently might be a major reason behind his addiction and hostility.
Your child's stress management skills need improvement. You will need to find healthy ways for your child to handle their stress, rather than turning to drugs.
Make sure your child's free time is spent in some useful activity. Give him a task or project to complete. Hopefully he will learn how to gain satisfaction from hard work and effort, instead of looking for instant gratification.
Encourage your child to change their lifestyle and preferences. Help them to make new connections and abandon old ones that support addiction.

, Denial is the first and foremost thing that is encountered by families when they try to get their teenager through a drug abuse problem. In order to help your child to overcome denial and deal with their addiction you have to follow some simple steps:


Seek counseling for your child from a psychiatrist or through a counselor at a rehab center, as they can address the specific problems associated with seeking treatment.
Help the child realize what his or her condition is before and after using drugs. This will help them to understand how necessary it is to seek treatment.
Help the child to accept the challenge to change and encourage them to lead a normal and healthy life. Remind them of the dreams and goals that they had before the drug problem and push them to get back on this healthy track.

, There are many worries which can make the child reluctant to receive treatment or get through the treatment successfully without relapse. You have to consider the following factors in order to address this:


You child may be apprehensive about the mode of treatment and how it will affect them. This is essentially fear of the unknown and it is completely normal and understandable.
Your child may believe that they are unable to control their urge to take drug, which can limit the effectiveness of treatment.
Your child may be concerned about the management of withdrawal symptoms and whether they will be in a lot of pain.
Your child may also be apprehensive about leaving old friends from a circle that abuses drug.
Your child may be apprehensive about being socially isolated or being ridiculed by their peers etc.
All of these concerns need to be addressed if the child is to get through treatment effectively

, During the treatment, your child will pass through a lot of different phases. You have to understand the mood of your child. The detoxification, withdrawal effects and cravings are not easy to handle and the child may behave aggressively, become irritated easily or feel depression and anxiety. Deal with all these mood swings as best you can in order to help the child pass through the treatment process in a positive way. Some common ways to deal with mood swings and aggression are given below:


Do not argue excessively with the child, it can lead to mistrust and aggression.
Be assertive in conveying your point of view, but avoid being aggressive as it will not help them to understand your viewpoint.
Do listen to the child carefully and address his or her needs. This will help them feel like they are worth the effort.
Give hope and encourage the child frequently. This will motivate him or her for change.
Be patient and polite with the child, this is the time you can help them gain back trust which is usually lost during addiction.

, Cravings can lead to easy relapse during treatment. In fact, cravings are one of the most frequent causes of relapse. You can help the child get over the craving through the following ways:


Gain the trust of the child so that he or she will tell you when they are experiencing cravings and you can help them through it.
Keep him or her away from the company of old friends and places where he or she used to abuse the drug.
Keep them busy with a schedule, including activities which they like to help them think less about drug.
Help the child get regular exercise as this can help them to get over cravings.
Help them feel more positive about change.
Help the child to identify the long term benefits of getting through treatment without relapse, such as going to college.

, This is one of the major problems which children face when it comes to drug abuse treatment. The company which they kept while abusing drugs becomes very dear to them. It is quite hard to keep away from the memories of that time. Help the child get over these feelings and help them to get back in touch with a safer group of friends.


Help them identify how bad company can ruin their treatment.
Introduce them to new friends and peers of their age through positive activities.
Create a strong social circle around the child so that he or she does not feel alone or crave going back to the old company.

, Whenever the child shows signs of relapse immediately contact the consultant and rehab center so that counseling can be provided as son as possible. Remember that there are certain signs of relapse which you should look for when the child is passing through drug abuse treatment. The common signs are listed below:


Excessive cravings for drugs, which is manifested through physical signs of body aches and sleep problems.
Mood swings and aggression due to inability to take drugs.
Contact with old friends who used to abuse the drug too.
Complaints from school because of lack of concentration and attention .
Strained relationship with parents and siblings because of aggressive mood and inability to deal with drug cravings.

, Even if it seems as if all of your time is taken up caring for and worrying about your child, it's important to take some time for yourself. Make sure you are getting enough sleep, go for a long walk to clear your head or have a relaxing bath at the end of a long day.


If you are tired and worn out, you will have less patience in dealing with your child and may even behave aggressively or angrily with them, which is the last thing they need.
When you are in a calm, rested state of mind, you will be much better prepared to deal with your child. Being mentally and physically strong is important right now.

, It's very common for the parents of a drug-addicted child to experience overwhelming feelings of guilt and shame when they find out that their child has a drug problem.


If you are having difficulty living with these emotions and it's affecting your relationship with your child and/or spouse, it's important to seek the help of a counselor or therapist who can work through these issues with you.
Keep in mind that there is no point in torturing yourself with questions like ""where did I go wrong?"" or ""what could I have done differently?"" What's done is done. The important thing is that you are there for your child now, when they need you the most.

, When one of your children is going through a drug problem, it tends to take up most of your time and attention. However, it's important not to neglect your other children during this difficult time, as they also need your love and care.


They might feel forgotten or even envious of their addicted sibling who is getting all attention and love. They might even act out and start misbehaving themselves just in order to get your attention.
Therefore, it's important to try to maintain balance by spending time with each of your children individually.

, If you feel like your child's drug problem has caused problems between you and your spouse or forced you to drift apart, don't be ashamed to seek marriage counseling.


The marriage counselor will help you to work through your problems and allow you to understand that there is no need to blame each other or allocate responsible for all that has happened to your child.
The important thing is that you work through it together and provide your child with a strong support system.

Get some non-parent time.",How to Handle the Terrible Twos," You will want to start teaching your child good, healthy behaviors and responses to stimulus as early as you possibly can. When you see them developing bad behaviors, don’t let those behaviors slide or dismiss it as something that they’ll grow out of. Tell them that what they did was wrong or bad and then show them a better way to act.


You also want to always model good behavior, in order to help your child learn. When they catch you doing something “naughty”, let them put you in time out for a few minutes.;
, When your child does something right or well, you should reward that behavior. This is called positive reinforcement and teaches your child to associate good things happening with behaving well. If you focus on really using this kind of feedback most of the time, then your toddler should be much more inclined toward good behavior.


Positive reinforcement doesn’t need to be a treat like a piece of candy either (although you can do this sometimes). Positive reinforcement can be a hug, getting to sleeping in the bed with you, or getting to play their favorite game with you.

, The terrible twos are a normal part of child development that centers around testing boundaries and figuring out how to be an independent person. It is important that you use this time to set boundaries for your child and teach them that those boundaries are firm. If you do not do this, then your child is likely to have behavior problems for many years. Your child needs to know that when you tell them no or tell them to do something, you mean it. Negotiations means more arguments.


For example, let's say that you let little Jon have a dessert after finishing all his food. Now, he finishes almost all of his food except for a bite or two (probably the peas, right?). You should not compromise here and give him the dessert because he will try this again but finish even less of the food the next time.
Another example would be with bedtimes. Let's say that you have a rule that little Sara needs to be reading herself to sleep by 7:30 pm, right after finishing dinner and brushing her teeth. She should not be allowed to get distracted by her new toy that grandma brought over and interrupt her usual routine. The toy can wait until the morning, even if it means a tantrum now.

, One of the reasons why toddlers have such magnificent meltdowns at this time in their lives is because they have many feelings that they don’t know how to process or communicate. Imagine you had something making you really upset and you didn’t know how to fix it and you didn’t have anyone to talk to. You’d be pretty grumpy too! If you give your toddler a way to communicate their feelings and ask for the things they want, then they’ll be much better able to cope with these strong feelings.


Teach them the words for their most common problems and encourage them to say when they want something. “Are you thirsty? Are you hungry? Can you say ‘hungry’?”
One new practice is to teach toddlers sign language as early as possible. Even small infants can learn “baby sign”, which allows them to communicate when they’re hungry, tired, or want to play. Even for a toddler, words are very new and can be intimidating. Sign language is more natural and accessible and can significantly improve behavior problems.

, Many times when your toddler throws a tantrum, the reaction is because they didn’t get their way. This is another aspect of the normal desire to learn how to be independent. They should have choices and get to make those choices, since this helps them develop into confident, capable children. However, their choices are not always useful or good. Find ways and times when they can make choices, so that they feel like they have control in their life (even if they don't’).


For example, when they get dressed in the morning, give them the choice between two or three shirts that you pick out. Keep firm on the options that you originally give them. They’ll choose which shirt they want and you both come away from the discussion tear-free.

, One of the most important things you can do for your child at this age is to let them experience consequences. When they don't experience consequences early, it becomes difficult for them to realize that consequences are a normal part of life. By letting them understand cause and effect, you'll be setting them up for a lifetime of better decision making skills.


For example, your toddler refuses to put his shoes and coat on before going outside in the snow, let him just go outside. He'll be stuck in the car ride to daycare with cold, wet feet and will quickly learn that putting on shoes is the smarter idea and there will be no more fights in the morning over coats and shoes.
Another example is if your child is playing the ""Throwing my bowl down from the table is the best"" game. Instead of yelling at them and cleaning up the mess, make them clean up the mess every time they throw food over. They'll easily decide that that isn't nearly as much fun.

, It's tough to hear your child crying but a little crying can be really good for them, especially if they're faking (a common feature of tantrums). Toddlers are developing the skill to self-soothe: a crucial skill even for adults. When they become overwhelmed with emotions and you instantly make them feel better, they don't learn how to sort through those emotions on their own. By letting them cry for a little while first, they can start learning how to make themselves feel better.


For example, if they don't like the color bowl that you served their dinner in and they start crying, just ignore them. Let them cry. Put on some music or start singing to yourself to cover up the screaming and show them you're not bothered. As soon as they start to calm down, redirect them to a new activity or food item (like a cup of milk) to help them learn that life goes on.
However, if your child is crying because they’re scared or hurt, you should of course comfort them and show them that it’s okay because mum is here.

, You should never bribe a child to get them to do what you want. This teaches them a terrible behavior, which is that listening to you is negotiable. There will be many times when the temptation is strong but you should do whatever you can not to give in. Sometimes this means letting your child throw a tantrum in a grocery store and that's okay. The other customers will have a rough few minutes and go on with their lives but your child will learn good behavior for a lifetime.


For example, when they throw a fit in the store about wanting a candy bar, don't say that they can have cake when they get home if they stop crying. All this does is teach them that if they cry at the store, they'll quickly earn themselves a treat.

, When your child does do something bad, do not give them attention for that behavior. This teaches them that in order to get you attention, they need to be naughty. instead of acknowledging this behavior, even to yell at them, instead ignore them. When paired with hugs, kiss, and attention for good behavior, you child will quickly learn to behave.


A bad example would be: grabbing their hands and yelling at them for doing something wrong or making them sit next to you for misbehaving at church.
Instead, completely ignore them when they start tantruming. If you're at home put them in another room and then close the door. It doesn't need to be locked or slammed, it just needs to break contact. This will show the child that yelling is not the way to get your attention.

, Remember that to your toddler, the world is very big and pretty much 24/7 stress. Imagine how you feel when your boss makes a major change to how things work in your office. Now multiply that times thirty and imagine it happening every day for years. That's what it's like for your toddler. You have to be understanding and try not to overwhelm them with too many changes at once.


Introduce schedule, lifestyle, and home changes gradually. You should also try to keep to a routine. When you have a routine, your child knows what to expect as is better able to handle small and gradual changes, like learning to use the toilet.
For example, don't start potty training the same week they start at a new pre-school. In fact, waiting as much as a month before making another change can be necessary. Wait until they seem comfortable with one change before making another.

, If you have older children, you may be frustrated that your toddler doesn't do what the older child does or did. However, it's important to remember that your toddler hasn't learned those behaviors yet and won't be ready for them for awhile. Be ready to accommodate and work with their individual needs.


For example, your toddler will probably need to have a different bedtime routine than an older child. They will probably wake up earlier and should not be expected to quietly entertain themselves on a weekend morning while you try to sleep in.

, Another common trigger for tantrums in toddlers is issues with stimulation. When they get bored, they don't have the mental ability that adults do to keep themselves entertained. Be understanding of this and try to find ways to keep them stimulated while you're out and away from the toys that usually keep them occupied.


Keep a favored toy only for boredom emergencies, when you know you're both going to be stuck for awhile. This will keep your child entertained.
You want to avoid making them over stimulated too. Too much stimulation, especially right before bed, can be a bit much for them and lead to breakdowns. Having a bunch of your friends over, making a major scheduling change, or even letting them watch TV can leave your little one feeling lost.

, A lot of parents get themselves all twisted up in knots trying to be perfect. You get the image in your head from TV or magazines that there are certain things you have to do to parent right. But the thing is that life doesn't really work that way. Two year olds don't notice these little things and neither do well-adjusted adults. Just focus on loving you child.


Don't worry about Ava getting the velvet dress she got for Christmas dirty. Don't worry that your husband is looking slightly to the left in the family picture. Don't worry about making cupcakes for Ava's entire daycare class. These things can stand to be imperfect. What your child will remember happily when they look back on their experience of growing up is that you loved them and gave them hugs.

, When you have a toddler, you kind of have to shift your priorities around a little. You can't do everything. Some things will fall by the wayside, like your rock climbing class. Other priorities need to be adjusted because they don't mesh with life with a small child, like keeping your white carpets pristine. Just remember that keeping your child healthy and happy is what's really important right now. Carpets can be replaced but your child's first impressions of who you are and how you handle situations will stick with them forever.

, It's hard to see it now but when your two year old is sixteen and lighting the car on fire, you'll miss the days when they just had dramatic moments about putting a bowl on a table. If you learn to find the humor in the situation and embrace this time with your child, you'll have a much easier time staying sane.

, Find moms and dads that are also going through this same experience. When you have someone to talk to, someone who understands and maybe has even been through this before, you'll feel much stronger and stable. When you have a support network, you have people you can go to for help and that's very important for staying sane.


You can usually find groups for parents with young kids at your local community center but you can also find support groups online if you don't have the time to get out like that.

, Last but not least, you need some time to focus on not being a parent. It's easy to feel sometimes like that's all you are and all you can be, which can take a real toll on you mentally. Get some time away from your kids so that you can remember what it's like to be an independent person, just like your toddler does.


Spend some time with friends and do the kinds of things that you all used to do before you started having kids. Everyone can chip in to hire a few babysitters to take care of all the kids together, or you can make your own arrangements if your friends don't have kids.
You should also get some time with your partner and focus on loving each other being a couple, not just two people raising a kid. Go on a date or leave the kids with your parents for a weekend. This is very important for maintaining your relationship.

Go to school meetings.,
Visit the school website.,
Be a part of your child's school life.,
Advocate for your child's seating arrangement.",How to Help Your Child Succeed in a Large Class1," Going to events at your school can help you know what's going on in your child's classroom. Parent-teacher meetings are the most important example of these events, as the teacher can clue you in to what they've been teaching, if you're child isn't particularly talkative about school.Be sure to ask the teacher how you can help your child succeed. They're sure to have some suggestions.;
, Another way to stay informed is to look at the school's website. The website will clue you in to main events, so that you can connect to what your child has coming up and build on it. It will give you jumping off points for conversations with your child.Check out the teacher’s personal website for the class as well. Some teachers have websites where they post homework assignments, class schedules, and other important information for their students.

, In a large classroom, your child may feel like one of many, like they're not getting the attention they deserve. By showing up (when invited) at school, you can help give your child some of the attention they long for.For instance, you could help at classroom parties, go on field trips, and show up at school plays.

, If your child has certain issues, sitting near the board can be helpful. For instance, if your child has ADD, sitting near the teacher can be helpful. Additionally, if you child has hearing or vision issues, sitting up front can enable them to hear or see better. If your child has one of these issues, talk to your teacher about where your child sits.To get your child a seat near the front of the room due to a learning disability, you may need to provide documentation of your child’s diagnosis. Contact the school to set up an IEP or 504 so things like a front seat or extra test time can be arranged for your child."

Tell them what it means to be a good friend.,
Talk about what a good friend isn’t.,
Read books or watch videos about friendship together.,
Teach age-appropriate skills.,
Find teachable moments.",How to Help Your Child Become a Good Friend1," Perhaps the simplest way to teach your child how to be a good friend is to talk about it. Explain how friendships work and what it means to be a good friend. Parents often assume that their children will figure it out for themselves as they grow. However, many children can improve on their friendships if they are given the tools they need to succeed.


Let them know that being a good friend involves being kind to each other, helping one another out, being there, and remembering things like their birthday and their favorite foods and toys. Being a great friend also means including your friend in activities, having fun together, and supporting one another.;
, Discuss what a good friend wouldn’t do soon after you tell them what a good friend would do. They may not understand that another child’s bad behavior isn’t par for the course when it comes to friendship. Teaching them this can prevent them from being mistreated.


Discuss how good friends aren’t mean to each other, make fun of each other, leave each other out, or make them feel bad about themselves. Tell your child it is OK to stop being friends with someone who doesn’t treat them the way they should., Your child may have a difficult time grasping the concept of friendship if they learn about it just from you. Reading a book or watching a video about friendships and what it means to be a good friend may help them to better understand.Examples of books that highlight good friendship skills include Arnold Lobel's Frog and Toad series. However, many children's and young adult books focus on these themes.
You can find free videos on friendship on Youtube., The term friendship covers many different responsibilities, with new expectations added as children age. Be sure that you discuss friendship in a way that is understandable and relevant to your child.


For instance, smaller, preschool-aged children may need to focus on developing skills like sharing and being kind. However, older adolescents and teens may need to learn skills like loyalty and keeping their friends' secrets. Tailor the discussion to your child, and make it an ongoing education.

, Both younger and older kids may get a better grasp on friendship when it is applied to their current lives and experiences. Look for opportunities in everyday life to show your child how to be a better friend.Let's say your teen daughter starts hanging with a new group of popular kids at school. When you hear her discussing them, you might try to emphasize the importance of loyalty by saying, ""I'm glad you're making new friends, but you should also be sure to take care of your existing friendships. When's the last time you made plans with Holly?""
Make sure that you are not being over-controlling and intrusive with your teenager. This type of behavior can be annoying to a teenager.

Stay close when letting your child play alone.,
Find a safe chair to place your child in when getting rid of the high chair.,
Place your child in a bed when they start climbing out of the crib.,
Teach your child how to bathe before letting them do it alone.",How to Handle Growing Up Milestones1," Letting your child play in a childproofed room, such as their bedroom, without your supervision is an important milestone. When you decide to let your child do this, stay close by so you can hear if there is a problem. Let your child know you are right in the other room.This generally happens around a year and half to two years of age.
Be sure that the room is safe for your child and that there are no hazards such as cleaning products, sharp objects, or anything else that your child might get into.;
, Moving your child from the high chair is a big milestone. However, your child may not be big enough or physically ready to sit in a normal chair. You need to find a safe alternative for the high chair while in the transition phase.For example, if you have an adjustable high chair, you can make the high chair the same height as the table, remove the tray, and place the high chair right next to the table. You can still strap your child in, but they are able to eat from the table.
You may place a kids table near your dining table so the child can eat at a table like the family, but in a safe, child-sized chair.
You can also try using a booster seat in the dining room chair.
This generally occurs between ages two to three.

, Your child will be ready to move to a regular bed once they start trying to climb out of the crib. This may happen between ages two and three. Make sure to childproof the room before letting the child sleep in a regular bed.For example, fasten bookshelves and dresses to the wall. Move all cords to places your child cannot get to.

, Children generally start giving themselves a bath between ages four and five. This is also the age they start choosing clothes and getting dressed by themselves. When you do this, stick close by and check on them, especially when they are first starting out.Make sure to explain to the child how to properly take a bath. Show them things like how to wash their hair and rinse it while protecting their eyes.
Fill the tub for them at first to make sure the water isn’t too hot and the tub doesn’t overflow.
Give positive feedback so that your child will build confidence in grooming themselves.

Tell them you love them.,
Hold them.,
Gain interest in the things they like.,
Let them be themselves.,
Don't put them down; bring them up.,
Set guidelines, and stick with them.,
Don't give all of your attention to one child (if there is more than one).",How to Help Kids Feel Loved," This maybe seem obvious and redundant, but if you repeatedly tell a child you love them, it will become set in stone, and they will never forget it. Tell them you love them when they do something good, bad, interesting, funny, adorable, or just randomly. No time is a bad time to tell your child you love them.


NOTE: It's a good idea to tell the child you love them while scolding them, if you're mad, or if they're in trouble. A child can easily feel less loved when they are getting scolded at.;
, Holding a child makes them feel comfortable and less afraid, and it's a perfect way to show them how much you care. Brush their hair back, rock them back and forth, and repeat step one often.

, If you show them that you're interested in the things they like, they'll feel appreciated, cared for, and loved. Remember what they do, show it to people you know, and make a big deal out of it. If your child shows you a picture they painted, hang it on the fridge for everyone to see and tell the child how amazing it is and how proud you are of them.


NOTE: If you cannot become interested in the things they do, at least pretend you're interested. Children who do not feel appreciated can become depressed or scared to engage in new tasks, or they may give up the things they like because no one cares. Show them you care!

, If you try to control everything they do, they'll get the impression that you hate who they truly are. If they want to be something, let them! Let their imagination run wild. The more you show that you love the person they are inside, the more they will understand that they are appreciated and loved.

, Putting a child down about their creativity, intellect, or anything else makes them hate who they are. Bringing them up will make them proud to be them.

, If you skimp off keeping your guidelines and rules kept, kids may feel like they can get away with anything. They'll one-up you every chance they get. Loyalty with your rules in a nice way will show the child that you respect them and care for their safety.

, Focusing on just one child shows that you're playing favorites; one child will feel less loved than the other, and this can create conflict. Share the time with both.

Know what your child needs to accomplish.,
Make homework come first.,
Be available to offer help.,
Find the time to sneak work in.,
Show them how to study.,
Find a tutor for your child.",How to Help Your Child Succeed in a Large Class2," Every year, you child will be expected to learn certain things by the end of the year. If you know what those things are, you can work on them at home throughout the year. The school may have those objectives up on their website, or you can ask the teacher about it., If you indicate to your child that homework is important, it will help them make it a priority, too. Homework is important in a large class because it gives your child a chance to practice what they've learned, which they may not get to do in class.While your child may need a break (such as a snack) when they come home from school, have them work on their homework before any major play time.
Another way to help show homework is a priority is to make a study space just for them. Set up a desk with a lamp and supplies so your child has a place to work.

, If your child is in a large class, the teacher may not be able to offer as much individual help to each child. That means that your child may not get all their questions answered in school, so you need to be ready to jump in. That doesn't mean you should do your homework for them. Rather, you should just be there to help them understand the work, so they can figure out the answers themselves.You don't actually have to sit and supervise your child. Just be in the vicinity. In fact, you can be doing something else, like a (quiet) chore, so you're not just sitting there waiting., As a busy parent, it can be difficult to find the time to help your child learn. However, children are learning all the time, and you can sneak learning in any time you're interacting with your child. You don't have to set aside special time to ""teach"" your child.For instance, incorporate a nature talk on the walk to school, or talk about math when you're cooking dinner.
It can also help if one parent can rearrange their work schedule so that they are home in the afternoon.

, In a large class, the teacher may not have time to teach proper study skills, so you may need to step in. For instance, you can help your child organize information into units, as well as use memorization aids such as flash cards and mnemonic devices.You can also teach them how to review information before a test, including testing themselves to find out if they've actually learned the information.

, A tutor can provide your child with the individual attention and help that they might need, so this might be a good way to help your child succeed. Look for a tutor in your area or a tutoring center where you can take your child for appointments with a tutor.

Talk to your child's teacher about your child's abilities.,
Let the teacher know about changes in your child's life.,
Offer to put together a briefing.,
Learn the dress code.,
Enforce the rules.",How to Help Your Child Succeed in a Large Class3," If you know certain things about how your child learns, it's important to let your child's teacher know. It can also help to talk to the teacher about where your child excels and where they struggle. Even in a big classroom, having that information can give your child's teacher the information they need to assist your child.For instance, if your child is great at math but has trouble memorizing facts, that's good information for your teacher to have.
Talking to your teacher is especially important in a large classroom because your child's teacher doesn't have as much time to figure out each student's strengths and weaknesses.

, If your child has a major change, that can affect how they do schoolwork. Therefore, it's important to let your child's teacher know about these changes. Those changes can include things like moving, divorce, or a death in the family.If your child's teacher knows what's going on, it can help them understand why your child is acting a certain way and respond in kind, which is helpful when your teacher has many students to care for.

, Ask your teacher if you can put together a weekly email about what's going on in class. That way, you know what's going on, and you can also send out the information to other parents. In addition, that means parents won't be bothering the teacher as much with questions about the classroom.You'll need to get this information from the teacher. The best information is what the kids are learning (main topics) and how parents can help at home.

, Your child's teacher shouldn't have to spend time telling kids about the dress code. Try to make sure your child conforms to the dress code so that the teacher can spend more time on learning and less time on enforcing the code., It's also important to learn the rules of both the school and the classroom. That way, you can help to reinforce the rules at home. Reinforcing the rules is important because, once again, the teacher can spend more time on teaching and less time on discipline, at least with your child. Plus, following the rules should help your child pay attention better in class."

Be a good friend yourself.,
Demonstrate good friend behavior.,
Role-play what you want to see.,
Host playdates and gatherings.",How to Help Your Child Become a Good Friend2," Children learn a majority of their behavior from watching their parents. Help them become a good friend by being a good friend, yourself. When they see the friendships you have they may be encouraged to look for similar relationships.


Avoid talking negatively about your friends or having arguments with them in front of your children. Instead, behave the way you would like them to behave. Doing so makes it more likely that they will learn to become a good friend by watching you., Part of being a good friend is helping and having empathy for one another. You can show your children what this means by acting towards others in that way. Often children mirror their parents’ actions while growing up and it sets up frameworks for their own relations with others.For example, you can bring food to friends and family who are sick, cut the elderly neighbor’s grass, give money to a homeless person, or make someone a present, just because. These acts of kindness teach children empathy and selflessness: two traits of being a good friend., Your child may not know how to respond to certain situations with their friends. They can learn, however, when they see how you would resolve it yourself. A good way to show this is through role play.


You and your partner, friend, or older child can create the situations your youngster may encounter. For instance, if your child and their friend can’t agree on what to play with, set up a scenario in which you and your acting partner handle it. Focus on the positive scenarios rather than the negative, as you want to display the way you want your child to behave., Playdates can be a great way for your child to learn good friendship behavior, especially if they have trouble making friends. Having a friend come over to play or hang out with your child is an excellent opportunity to help them become a good friend. Monitor the date and make note of anything your child is doing that doesn't represent good friendship behavior.


When the moment is right, pull them aside for a teachable moment. Explain to them why good friends wouldn’t do what they—or the friend—did.
Try not to be too involved in their interactions, just peek in when you can or do so in a way that isn’t too obvious. Identify and correct the behavior immediately, instead of waiting until the friend leaves. The child may not remember what happened if you wait too long to address the situation."
"
Teach them how to join.,
Take their friendship style into consideration.,
Prepare them for the chance of rejection.,
Offer activities for them to engage in.",How to Help Your Child Become a Good Friend3," Shy or quiet kids may have difficulty summoning up the courage it takes to make a new friend. Perhaps they feel intimidated by joining a group or walking up to a potential friend and introducing themselves. Talk to your child about how to do this, as they may simply not know how.


For instance, you can tell your child to watch a group that is playing for a little bit to find out what they are doing. Once they’ve figured it out, tell them to think of something that the game may benefit from. Then have the child approach the group and suggest this new, fun thing that could enhance the game. There’s a good chance the other kids will want them to join if they take this route.You can also help them think of fun activities to invite others to join in and teach them to be pro-active rather than reactive.

, Your child won’t feel good about trying to make new friends if they feel uncomfortable with the situation. Take your child’s personality and friendship style into consideration instead of trying to force them to do something they don’t want to. They are more likely to feel encouraged about the situation if it is one they feel confident about going in.


For example, pay attention to what your child likes better: playing with individuals or playing with groups. Encourage them to then approach the situation that feels more comfortable. They are less likely to feel discouraged if they believe they have a good shot from the start., There’s almost nothing worse for a child when they finally approach a prospect and are told “no.” The truth is, however, it may happen. Preparing them for this possibility and teaching them what to do should it happen, can prevent them from becoming discouraged.


Let them know not to take it personally when they are rejected. Perhaps the child in question isn’t feeling good that day or may not want to share their friends or toys with them. Also explain that there are many more prospects. Tell them not to give up and to ask other kids if the first says no.Since not everyone may want to be friends, rejection is a great opportunity to help your child see different perspectives for why someone may say ""No."" Depending on your child’s age, it is helpful for your child to learn not to take things personally because of their natural egocentric tendencies.

, A teenager playdate is often nothing more than the kids vegging out in front of the TV together or laying on the bed chatting about what’s going on in school. A play date with younger kids, however, needs a little more direction and purpose. Help your child think of activities or games they want to play when they are hosting a new friend.


Have a variety of games and activities on tap just in case they find it difficult to play something they agree on. Also tell your child they will need to be flexible and to not get their heart set on one activity, as the friend may not want to play with the same things they want to."

Spend time together without parents.,
Communicate with your grandteen.,
Be interested in what interests your grandchild.,
Invite grandteens on vacation.,
Look at old photos together.,
Keep the tradition of shared hobbies.",How to Grandparent a Teenager1," When your grandchild’s parents are around the dynamic is different. One-on-one time is when you can create a deeper relationship and be more yourselves with each other. Because you're not the parent, your point of view is seen as advice and counsel rather than control and judgment., Teenagers often depend on their grandparents for advice on topics like peer pressure, bullying, and crushes, so it’s important that you keep those lines of communication open. This will not only improve the relationship with your grandchild, but will also make your grandteen feel more secure chatting with you.


Remember to not only talk about your own perspectives of the events in your grandchild’s life but listen to your grandteen's perspective as well.
Make an effort to understand your grandteen’s point of view and empathize with it. Sometimes that’s all grandteens want.
Go see your grandteen’s school or extracurricular activities like dance recitals and sporting events.

, Part of being a teenager is feeling misunderstood. A great way to alleviate that is to learn about what interests your grandteen and then learn as much as you can about the subject, particularly from your grandchild.


Relate these things to experiences in your own life. Be sure, however, that you do it subtly because teenagers have very sensitive antennae to how their situation is vastly different.
Do things that your grandchild likes to do, whether it’s going to the movies or going to a concert.

, You’ll have time to explore someplace new and create new, fresh experiences together. You can even allow your grandchild to invite a friend, thus creating the best of both worlds for each of you: your grandteen spends time with a friend while you spend time getting to know both children even better., Sharing memories is a great way to reinforce the life you have shared together. This of course includes people, places, and fun times such as birthdays and anniversaries. Plus, you have the added bonus of sharing the early life of one of your grandchild’s parents and laughing at the era’s unfortunate fashion choices.Be careful of overplaying this card. Doing it occasionally is great. Too often and you become that annoying grandparent who only wants to look at old pictures.

, Often a teenager’s fondest memories are activities shared with their grandparents as a child. Just because grandchildren have grown up doesn’t mean grandteens have grown out of their memories. Whether it was miniature golf, fishing, boating, or camping, keep doing it.


If your grandteen decides the old hobby is boring now, create a new one to share.

Use an allowance to teach money skills.,
Encourage your child to get involved socially.,
Gauge your child’s reaction to losing teeth.,
Help your child develop their hobby.,
Explain safety rules when your child uses a public restroom alone.",How to Handle Growing Up Milestones2," Giving a child an allowance is a milestone for their financial development. This may occur around age six. Start by giving them a small amount each week. You may want the weekly value to be roughly one dollar for each year of their age. Help them understand that the money should be saved and used on something they really want, not just spent every week.Get your child a piggy bank to keep their money in. Explain to them that each week they will get more money, and it stays in their bank. If they save it, they will have a larger sum of money.
Any time your child wants to make a purchase with their money, make sure that you discuss it with them so that it becomes a learning experience.

, Many children start making friends at a young age. However, past the age of eight, these friendships start to become more important and they find themselves becoming closer with certain friends. Help encourage your child to cultivate these relationships so they can develop socially.Encourage your child to take extracurricular classes, join a team sport, or get involved in volunteer work. This helps them meet people and develop social skills.
Get to know your child’s friends. Let your child invite them over to play or spend the night. Meet the friend’s parents so you feel comfortable letting your child go to their home.

, Children lose teeth between the ages of six to eight. Some many even lose them around five years old. For some children, this is exciting because the tooth fairy will come see them and their friends may have already lost teeth. Other children may get upset or scared. Gauge your child’s reaction so you know how to respond.If your child is excited, celebrate this milestone with them.
If your child is nervous or scared, remind your child that everyone loses their baby teeth. Tell them their new teeth will come in soon, though it may take awhile for the new tooth to grow.

, Between the ages of ten to twelve, your child will start to develop hobbies. They get interested in things, they become more independent, and they can think more about complex things. Due to this, your child may start to find hobbies. When they do that, support them and help them start to cultivate them.Teach your children that it is okay to try out different hobbies until they find what they really like, but that making a commitment to other people means that you cannot always quit immediately.


For example, your child may love acting, so take them to local plays and theater productions. If your child loves to draw, take them to art museums and encourage them to practice their talent.

, Children between the age of five to seven start to feel uncomfortable going into opposite-sex bathrooms. They will start to want to go into the gender-appropriate bathroom. When this occurs for your child, explain to them how to behave in a public restroom and how to be safe.For example, you should explain that no one should talk to them, touch them, or go into the stall with them. Tell them going into the bathroom is a private, solitary activity and they should go in, use the bathroom, and come straight out.
Explain about how to use a public restroom alone, like closing the stall door and washing their hands.
Stand right outside the door and wait for your child.

Start slowly when you leave your child alone.,
Reinforce hard work and smart spending with a job.,
Emphasize positive body image as your child enters adolescence.,
React positively when your teen starts menstruating.,
Be supportive when your teen learns to drive.",How to Handle Growing Up Milestones3," Around the age of 11 or 12, you may decide you can leave your child home alone. If your child is ready for this, start off slow. Only leave them alone for short periods of time at first, like 15 or 30 minutes. Increase the time away as your child demonstrates their responsibility.Be sure to discuss this with your child so that they understand they are earning independence and can also lose it if they violate your trust. Talk with them after time alone as well and make sure they feel safe.
Make sure you go over emergency procedures with your child. Go over emergency phone numbers and where they are posted, what is off limits while they are home alone, and touch on other safety rules.
Check on your child if you need to. Text them or call them just to touch base, but don’t smother them by doing it too much.

, As your child becomes a teenager, they start spending more money doing things with friends. Early teens, around 14 or 15, is a good time to make your child get a job. This will teach them responsibility, how to save money, and give them independence and pride because they work for their money.Your child’s age will dictate what kind of job they get. For example, if they’re 14, they may only be able to babysit, mow lawns, or shovel snow. At 15, some places will allow a child to work with a work permit.
Use this time to equate working hard with saving and making purchases. For example, if your child wants a $150 electronic device, explain how that it will take working 15 hours at $10 to save for that.
Be sure to pay attention to how your child is doing in school and consider whether their job is affecting their performance. Help your child to develop an appropriate balance between work and school because this will help them later in life.

, Adolescence can be a difficult time for your child. Their bodies are changing and they are experiencing hormonal shifts. They start to care about their appearance and peer pressure becomes a problem. To help with this, emphasize positive body image.Remind your child that adolescence is an awkward time that everyone goes through. Acne, hair growth, and developing body odor is normal. Teach them proper grooming habits to lessen some of these issues.
Talk to your child about realistic standards of beauty. Help them understand that what they see on television isn’t reality and they shouldn’t hold themselves to that standard.
Encourage healthy choices as your teen becomes independent and starts making their own choices. Emphasize how important it is to have positive friends, along with the dangers of drugs and alcohol.
Encourage your child to get involved in activities or sports. Help them get outside and stay active instead of staying inside all the time.
It is also important to lead by example, so make sure that you model good eating and exercise behaviors for your children.

, Starting their period is an important milestone in a young woman's life. Help her get used to this idea by not making her feel embarrassed or ashamed of this natural part of life. Encourage the whole household to not be squeamish or negative about this bodily change.


Teach your daughter proper technique for using pads or tampons. Help her understand good menstruation hygiene so she can stay clean and avoid any problems.
Encourage her to keep extra clothing in her locker at school until she learns how to manage her periods.
Consider doing something nice for your daughter at this moment, like taking her for a special treat like a dinner or a mini young adult shopping spree.

, Driving is one of the biggest milestones as a child grows up. It can be hard for parents to let go enough and trust their children behind the wheel. When you are teaching your child to drive, be their co-pilot and support them. Don’t hover, criticize, or make them nervous.Let your child experience all kinds of roads with you as they are learning. Take them through small town, on highways, through big cities with crowded streets, and even on the interstate. This helps you guide them and teach them how to navigate so they don’t have to do it on their own.
Be sure to have your child get their learning permit first so that they will get lots of practice before getting their license.

Turn off technology.,
Model good tech consumption.,
Create (or find) a kid-friendly outdoor space.,
Get to know your neighbors.",How to Get Your Kids to Play Outdoors1," Children between the ages of 8 and 18 spend an average of 7.5 hours a day using electronics and media such as TV, cell phones, computers, and video games.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that kids and teens should use media such as this for ""no more than one or two hours per day.""You can limit tech consumption by establishing a ""curfew"" for media devices, such as requiring them to be shut off before bedtime. Setting up scheduled times when your children are allowed to use media and technology, such as a ""video game hour,"" will help establish boundaries for proper use.Have a small box or shelf for your child to put his or her cell phone in before they go outside. This will encourage them to be more mindful about where and when they use it, and will make it easier for you to make sure they're actually getting the quality outdoor time they need.;
, You don't have to toss all your tech, but the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents create ""screen-free"" zones at home by taking actions such as turning off the TV at mealtimes and making sure that children's bedrooms don't have computers, TVs, or video games in them. If your children know there are other options for recreation than media consumption, they will be more likely to take advantage of them.

, If you have a backyard, you may need to spruce it up a little to make it fun for your kids to play in. Clear away overgrown brush and any poisonous plants and keep the yard mowed. Things such as swing-sets and sandboxes provide hours of fun.


If you live an urban area or don't have a yard, you still have options. find a safe, pleasant park or playground and make it a habit to take your kids there. You can even search the Internet for recommendations from people in your community. There are also online playground finders.

, Studies have show that adults who feel a sense of community with their neighbors are likely to spend more time outdoors for recreation and exercise, and this carries over to their children too. Parents who know their neighbors are also more likely to feel safe letting their children play outdoors.Getting to know your neighborhood can be particularly helpful if you don't have a suitable play area for your kids at your own home. In addition to the health benefits of outdoor play, allowing your kids to play at their friends' houses promotes social skills development, helps them learn teamwork, and relieves stress.

Understand grandteens are beginning their own life.,
Share a dinner.,
Avoid nagging your grandchild.,
Support your grandchild’s independence.,
Respect their opinion.,
Accept mistakes.",How to Grandparent a Teenager2," While still dependent on their parents, teenagers are in the nascent stages of finding who they are and moving off on their own into the world. Your grandchild is no different. Don’t forget that teenagers weren’t meant to cling to their grandparents like plastic wrap. Your grandteen would never be successful in the real world nor feel safe enough to move out.

, This is something adults do all the time. Go to an adult, sit-down restaurant with just the two of you and have a nice meal and a chat. You can also share a meal at home or even cook together. The key is to do it alone, without parents or other third parties. Just the two of you together sharing a simple experience can lead to profound changes in your relationship., This is something we do with children in order to get things done or to get a message across: repeat and repeat. We get so used to it that when grandchildren get older we continue to remind them of everything. For a young adult, this is nagging. You shouldn’t do it to an adult so you shouldn’t do it to your grandteen.


By not nagging you are giving your grandteen trust and respect as you would any adult.
Accept your grandchild’s appearance. Different generations experience different fashions and expressions of self and it is your job to accept these changes as part of your grandchild’s personality.Never mock or ridicule your grandchild as it is a negative interaction that will only widen the gulf between the two of you.
Compliment your grandchild in front of his/her boyfriend/girlfriend. Never tease or make fun of grandteens in these situations.

, Don’t make your grandchild feel guilty if he/she doesn’t want to do anything with you. It’s okay and it is part of growing up and separating. Making your grandchild feel guilty will only lower their self-esteem and cause an overflow of guilt that wasn't deserved.


It is understandable to feel upset or even mad that your grandchild does not want anything to do with you, but it is important to handle it in an appropriate manner and not to judge your grandchild.
Your job is to love and support your grandteen for who your grandchild are.If your grandchild has a date and does not want you involved then let the two kids go and have their fun. You have to respect your grandchild's space just as much as your grandteen has to respect your space.

, As children get older, their own perspectives on life become more pronounced and their reasons better thought out. Respect your grandchildren's opinions and even if you may not agree with your grandteens’ beliefs, you have to pay these beliefs respect.

, Growing up means making mistakes and that means your grandteen will make some. Sometimes your grandchild will make a lot of mistakes. Keep loving and supporting your grandteen because after all, your grandchild isn’t perfect and that’s what makes him/her the perfect grandchild.

Keep scrapbooks and photo albums.,
Hold parties and ceremonies.,
Seek professional help if there are difficulties.",How to Handle Growing Up Milestones4," One way to handle milestones is to commemorate the memories. You can do this through a scrapbook or an online photo album. This helps you and your child celebrate each milestone and be able to look back on them fondly.


Make sure that you are in some of the photos too! Your child will also want to see pictures of you as they look through these albums.
You may also want to collect keepsakes and mementos from the milestones, like ticket stubs, items that are firsts, or anything else you and your child would like to remember. You can place these things in a scrapbook so you'll have it forever.

, You may want celebrate milestones by throwing parties or arranging ceremonies. Birthday parties are very popular, especially at ages like 10, 13, or 16. You may also have a party or ceremony for any milestone you and your child thinks is important.


For example, you may have a small ceremony for losing the first tooth, a special treat when a daughter starts menstruating, or a party when going from elementary to middle school or middle to high school.
These parties and ceremonies can help certain difficult times, like changing schools or menstruation, into a positive experience instead of a negative one.

, You and your child may not face every milestone in a positive way. If this is the case, you may want to see a therapist to help you or your child deal with the different growing up milestones. A therapist may be able to help you or your child talk through your feelings and process difficult situations.


For example, if you or your child have trouble with the idea of growing up and getting older, a therapist may be able to help.
If the issue is relatively minor, then you can also read books and articles to get some ideas about how to approach it.

Model good outdoor behavior.,
Establish ground rules.,
Expect some resistance.,
Accept the mess.,
Teach your kids things to do outdoors.",How to Get Your Kids to Play Outdoors2," You may not have time to play every day with your children, but especially if your family is new to spending time outdoors it will help your kids to know their parents are actively involved. Short hikes, excursions to the local park, and geocaching are all family-friendly activities that help your kids understand that spending time outdoors isn't only healthy, it's fun!


If you live in a safe, walkable neighborhood, encourage your kids (and yourself!) to get exercise by walking to places like the library or school.

, The National Wildlife Federation recommends that you provide a daily ""Green Hour"" for your children: one hour daily of unstructured outdoor play.Make this time a part of your children's daily schedule. It may not be easy at first, but creating the expectation that your kids will spend one hour every day playing outdoors will help them see it not as a punishment but part of their normal routine.


Be consistent. It may take your children awhile to get used to the idea of living without their cellphones and video games for an hour or two, but be patient and be consistent with them.
Engage your kids in conversation about what they did outdoors and ask what they liked best. This will show them that you're interested in their activities (and help you make sure they're staying active and staying safe!).

, Your children may not want to go outdoors initially, particularly if it hasn't been part of their lifestyle before. You may need to be firm with them in enforcing a ""Green Hour,"" especially at first. Make it clear that this is part of their schedule, and don't give in to complaints.


If your children are reluctant to play outdoors, you could try motivating outdoor play by offering a trade: if they spend an hour playing outside, they can earn some TV or video game time. The more they play outdoors, the more likely they are to discover they actually enjoy it!
If the neighborhood is safe for walking or biking, send your kids on an errand. Having a specific goal to achieve may help them get used to spending time outdoors and will give them a feeling of accomplishment.
Create challenges. Get your kids outdoors by giving them specific challenges, such as a scavenger hunt or ""Survivor""-themed games like a relay race or balance activity. This type of structure will help them figure out how to play outdoors. Adding a reward, such as media time or release from chores, will make your kids even more motivated to head outdoors.

, If your kids play outdoors, they will probably end up sweaty and dirty, and they need to know that that's okay. In fact, studies suggest that getting dirty can strengthen children's immune systems!Give them some ""play clothes"" that it's all right to get filthy, and teach them how to clean up after themselves.

, If your kids have spent more time with a Playstation than a playhouse, they not even be sure of what their options for outdoor entertainment are. Teaching them how to do things like make daisy chains, jump rope, build snow forts, and collect fireflies will help them see the outdoors as full of fun possibilities in every season.Many nature organizations have websites with lists of activities. You can find a variety of fun ideas just by doing a few quick searches.You may also want to look for local classes to learn new skills at nature centers, museums, after-school projects, community centers, and more.

Convert chores to fun.",How to Get Your Kids to Play Outdoors3," If you live in a rural or suburban area with a yard, host a weekend campout! Invite neighbor children over, pitch a tent, and provide some fun games and activities such as sing-alongs, stargazing, and story time.


The National Wildlife Federation sponsors an annual ""Great American Backyard Campout"" that includes public campout events. If you live in an urban area or don't have a backyard, joining one of these events could be a good option., Get your children involved in planting and maintaining the plants as they grow. There are many websites that offer suggestions for kid-friendly gardens.You can even build fun projects such as a ""bean teepee"" (bean vines grown up long poles tied together) that your kids can use as an outdoor play space.


If you don't have a lot of outdoor space, you can still have a garden area! Try making a fairy garden, or planting a planter box with herbs such as rosemary and thyme that are easy to grow (and you can use them in meals!). If you have a little more space, you can grow a container garden.

, You can make a bean fort or bean teepee, or you can give your kids the raw materials to make their own forts. All you need are some old sheets, some long branches, and maybe some cardboard. Let your kids use their imagination to build a fun play space!

, There are many places online to find scavenger hunt lists, or you can make your own. Having a challenge will keep your kids occupied and give them a sense of accomplishment when they've finished the quest. This will work for kids who live in the city as well as those in rural or suburban areas!

, If your children like collecting stuff, send them outside with a bucket or basket to find items for fun craft projects. Seeds, pine cones, rocks, flowers, and leaves can all be made into fun crafts and gifts.

, In the summer time, turn on the garden hose, add some buckets and squirt toys, and let your kids go wild! Squirting some soapy water on a tarp will give your kids a homemade slip 'n slide for hours of fun.

, Give your child an inexpensive camera (either film or digital) and encourage them to explore the outdoors and take pictures of what they see. This will help them get more involved with and curious about their environment, and there are many kid-friendly cameras available for under $100.

, Toys like jump ropes, soccer and basketballs, and sidewalk chalk simply don't work indoors. They may tempt even reluctant children into heading outside.

, Chores such as raking leaves and shoveling snow may not immediately appeal to kids, but teaching them to see the chore as producing a reward -- like a big pile of leaves to jump in or the makings of a great snowman -- will encourage them to be active and responsible.

Teach them safety rules and then let them take charge.Older kids need to feel responsible and independent.


Check with your local city council to determine any regulations.

, Older kids and teens can use the GPS on their cellphones for outdoor activities such as geocaching, which may appeal to their budding need for independence.


Your child or teen could also keep a blog about his or her outdoor activities. Teens love selfies, so encourage them to take photos of themselves doing cool activities outside, or document their favorite outdoor adventures.Make sure to talk to your kids about responsible social media use.

, Older children and teens are particularly fond of ""hanging out."" Offer to drive your kids and their friends to a park, or encourage your child to go jogging with a friend instead of sitting on the couch.

, Both teenage boys and girls enjoy activities like basketball and bicycling.Basketball hoops are relatively inexpensive and can be set up almost anywhere. Having the equipment will encourage your teens to head outdoors.

Keep your judgments to yourself.,
Try not to take things personally.,
Offer support.,
Know when you should ""judge"" and take action.",How to Handle Friends with Different Parenting Styles1," One of the quickest ways to ruin a friendship is to judge your friend’s parenting style. Parenting is extremely personal and everyone does the best that they can. If you tell your friend—or others—that their parenting style is wrong, you’ll likely find yourself at least one friend short of what you had.


If you must say something, say it in such a way that is complimentary rather than critical. For instance, tell your friend, “I love hearing your stories about how much fun you have when you go to parties, but my teenager is easily influenced, so could we keep the wild stories between us? I think it’s great that you are open with your kids about your partying, but I’d rather my kid didn’t hear about it.”
Saying your peace in a non-combative, complimentary way gets your point across without being harsh or judgmental.Or you might show interest and say something like, ""Why did you choose to handle that situation the way you did?"" This may prompt them to think about their choice.;
, If your friend questions your style, do your best to not take it personally. Parenting is difficult and everyone has questions about whether or not they are doing it right. Chances are, they may be asking about your style because they want to implement it themselves.


If you aren’t able to let it go, talk to your friend about it. Say, “I value our friendship and I love that our kids are able to play together. But sometimes I feel like you are judging me when you question my choices.” There’s a good possibility that you are misunderstanding the intentions of your friend and talking it out can clear things up., If you’re upset about your friend’s parenting style, chances are, they’ve received criticism from others, as well. They may feel shut out and need you right now. If they acknowledge being upset or overwhelmed, you might ask, ""Have you ever thought about talking to somebody about all this?"" This may allow a counselor to intervene and help them with their detrimental parenting style, preserving your friendship. Try to be there for your friend, even if you disagree with their parenting methods.


Take your friend out to lunch, watch their children for them so they can have alone time, or simply just pick up the phone and reach out to them. Despite your differences, it will mean a lot to your friend to know that you are there for them when they are hurting., Despite your friendship, as a parent, you also want to be on the lookout for signs of neglect or abuse in your children (when they are in the care of your friend) and your friend's children. Sometimes, differences in parenting styles run the gamut of actions that are actually dangerous or harmful to children. If you spot any signs of mistreatment, have the courage to seek out the proper authorities.


If you notice either of your children acting especially fearful or withdrawn, flinching upon touching, acting too mature (e.g. taking care of the other children) or much younger (e.g. sucking thumbs) than their age, or having unexplained bruises, these could be signs of child abuse or neglect.
You can report instances of abuse/neglect by calling your local Child Protective Services (CPS) office. If it is an emergency situation, dial 911 or your local emergency department."

Allow your child to watch television or use other media.,
Encourage your child to do a solo, creative activity.,
Set up a contained play area for your child.,
Invite others over to keep your child occupied.",How to Handle Being Sick As a Mom1," Though you may try to avoid letting your child watch too much television or go on the computer too often, you may loosen up a little on these rules when you are sick. Putting your child in front of the television while you are ill on the couch can keep your child occupied and allow you to relax. You may also allow your child to play games on their iPad, the computer, or on your phone so you can lie down and recover.If you want to still interact with your child while you are ill, you may suggest that you both watch a television show or play a computer game together. That way, you can spend time with your child and get some rest.;
, To keep your child occupied while you are sick, you may suggest a solo activity that is creative and fun. Allow your child to build a fort in their room or suggest that they pick their favorite book and read quietly on their own. You may also let your child play with their toys in their room while you recover from your illness.If you have a little bit of energy despite your illness, you may try setting up a craft area in your child’s room where they can draw or color on their own for as long as they like.

, If you have a baby or a toddler, you may worry about keeping them occupied while you are ill and unable to move around much. One option is to set up a play area that is contained, such as a play pen or a fenced off room. Then, you can put your child down on the ground with toys and watch over them as they play on their own. Setting up an area for them to play can help keep them busy and allow you to rest without interruption.


If you have a very young baby that cannot crawl or walk on their own, you may need to pick up your baby periodically. You may try scheduling in some pick up time and then allow your baby to lay down on their back in the contained play area so you can rest.

, If your child does better playing with others, you may suggest they invite a friend over to play with. Allow your child and their friend to play in the yard or in your child’s room while you rest in your room. Provide toys, games, and books so your child and their friend can hang out together without bothering you.You may also suggest your child invite over a family member so they can spend time with them while you recover.
If your child has a friend who lives in your neighborhood, you may suggest they go over and play with them so you can rest at home alone.

Keep the kids away.,
Express your boundaries clearly.,
Back off from the friendship for a little bit.",How to Handle Friends with Different Parenting Styles2," Spending time with your friend sans kids may be necessary if you still want to stay friends but don’t want your kids to experience your friend’s type of parenting. Fortunately, it doesn’t have to be like this forever. You may be able to introduce your children back into the equation once you get over your main disagreements or when the kids get older.


You don't need to tell your friend you are making this decision, but if they ask you why your kids aren’t around anymore, don't lie. Gently explain that although you love your friend, you don’t necessarily agree with some of their parenting techniques.
Perhaps your child was frightened the last time you spent time together because of a punishment your friend delivered to their children. Be honest and upfront about your reasoning and if your friend is a true friend, they will understand., Discuss your parenting style when dropping the kids off for babysitting. Many parents instill the “when you live under my roof, you live by my rules” mentality. This also often holds true for when other kids come into their home. If this makes you uncomfortable, let your friend know about your concerns. However, if you instill this rule, you must be willing to abide by the same rule when dropping your kids off at their home.


When you leave your kids for a play-date or a sleepover, say to your friend, “It seems like you and I have different discipline styles. If my child misbehaves, please call me and I will handle the situation.” This allows you to still stay in control of the way your child is treated, while still letting them interact with your friend and their children., If the stress of your differing parenting styles has become too much, you may want to take some time away from the friendship. Scheduling fewer play-dates and reaching out less often may be what it takes to help your friendship get back to what it used to be. If your friendship is strong enough, your situation will pass and you’ll get back to the relationship you used to have.


If your friend questions why you’re not as close anymore, tell them, “I’m afraid our differences of opinion have put a strain on our relationship. I value your friendship too much to let this come between us, so maybe we can take a little break and see if we can can come to an understanding and compromise.” Although it may be awkward at first, there’s a good possibility you’ll become stronger in the end."
"
Let it go.,
Remember that there isn’t one right way to parent.,
Respond appropriately.",How to Handle Friends with Different Parenting Styles3," If your friendship is important to you, you may just have to let bygones be bygones. Understand that although you may not agree on the best way to parent, there’s a reason why you are friends in the first place. Focus your relationship on the things you two have in common and love about each other. Let these be the topic of your discussions, and be intentional about avoiding the area of parenting.


Just remember that you do things the way you do, and your friend does things the way they do. As long as no one gets hurt, allow the situation to stay the way it is., If there was a guidebook that answered every question parents have and offered all the right advice, parenting would be a breeze. Unfortunately, there isn’t, and parents have to do what they think is best at the time. Everyone makes mistakes and people do what they can according to their situations. Keeping this in mind may help you if you butt heads with your friends about parenting.


When you’re feeling frustrated with your friend, say to yourself, “They are doing what they think is right and the best they can, just like me.” Remembering that you’re not perfect either is a good way to keep yourself and your opinions in check.It may help to have this conversation with your children, too. Tell your children that different adults may have different rules, and that they should respect these rules when in their home or under their care. Tell your child that if they have any major objections to what the other adult did or how something was handled, they should come talk to you.

, Your friend shouldn’t criticize your parenting style, but if they do, the way you respond can send a strong message. Don’t become defensive and criticize right back. Instead, show respect, but also let them know you don’t want to hear their judgments.


For example, if your friend says something snarky about the food you feed your child, say politely, “I appreciate your concern and I’ll take what you suggested into consideration.” This lets them know you heard what they’re saying and gives you the opportunity to move on.If they make the comment in front of your children, then you need to directly address the criticism, as it undermines your authority to your children. Say something like, ""I know you do things differently, but this is how we do meals. You need to respect that.""

"
"
Be open-minded.,
Reinforce what works.,
Offer sound advice when you have it.",How to Handle Friends with Different Parenting Styles4," As much as you may want to stick to the ""my way or the highway"" approach, effective parenting often requires flexibility. What works for one child won't work for them all. Sometimes, good parenting means allowing others, including your friend with a different style, to help guide you. In addition, it also means listening to your children at times.


Rather than ruling with an iron fist, aim to consider the practices of others if they seem valuable. Take time every couple of months to re-evaluate your current parenting guidelines to add new methods and toss those that aren't working., A major aspect of learning from each other translates to being receptive to the suggestions of others. This doesn't mean that you have to implement each and every recommendation offered by your friend who has a drastically different style. However, it does mean that you should observe their style to see what works, and possibly consider adopting any useful strategies.Take the advice of a friend if their practices appear to be effective. For example, maybe your friend has this strange way of working her kids through a tantrum by asking them to draw a picture of what they are feeling, then explain it. You notice that however weird this seems, it works.
If you see strategies like this at play, be bold enough to admit that you don't know everything and consider trying it. A simple, ""Wow! That was really effective! I might have to try that some time"" can show your friend that you are watching and applauding her methods.

, Simply because you and your friend have radically different parenting styles doesn't mean you have to stay standing on one side of the fence or the other. In some cases, you may have helpful suggestions to offer. Be a friend and kindly share your advice.


You might say, ""Have you tried using visual timers like calendars or doing countdowns to help Aimee transition from one activity to another? I've found that it really works with Ryan.""
A polite suggestion every now and then will probably be well-received. Just refrain from chiming in with your comments on every parenting decision your friend makes. If you do this, you'll seem like a know-it-all, and even your practical suggestions might be ignored."

Modify your child's eating schedule.,
Put snacks within reach of your child.,
Prepare quick, easy meals.,
Do only the essentials when you are up and about.",How to Handle Being Sick As a Mom2," When you are sick as a mom, your usual routines may need to be tweaked and that's okay. If you have a baby or a toddler, they may be on a regimented eating schedule that keeps you on your feet. Try to modify this schedule slightly so you can have more time to rest, but your child still gets the attention they need. One day of a different routine will not be detrimental to your child, especially if it means you can recover and feel better the following day.For example, you may try feeding your baby every two hours rather than every hour so you can get some rest but your baby still gets fed. Or you may set a timer that goes off and wakes you up for every feeding so your baby still manages to stick to a similar feeding schedule.

, To make your life easier when you are ill, place snacks in bowls on the counter so your child can have them without having to ask you. Put out single serving snacks like juice boxes or yogurt so your child can grab them on their own. Tell your child to help themselves to snacks while you rest.You may say to your child, “Mommy is feeling sick right now and she needs to lie down. Can you help yourself to a snack when you get hungry?” or “Mommy isn’t feeling great and needs her rest. Take snacks when you get hungry and help yourself.”

, When you are ill, you may not have the energy to prepare elaborate meals for your child. Accept that this is the case and try preparing meals that are quick and easy to make. This may mean defrosting leftovers in the freezer or heating up leftover food from the night before. Having one meal of leftovers will not be detrimental for your child and will allow you to avoid stressing about preparing meals.If you do not have leftovers on hand, you may end up resorting to prepackaged meals for lunch or dinner. You may heat up a can of soup, pop some fish sticks in the oven, or warm up a frozen dinner meal.

, When you do manage to get up from the couch or your bed, try to focus on getting only the essentials done for your child. Think to yourself, what must I absolutely get done right now and what can I manage to do later? Try to address several important things when you are up so you can lie back down and rest without stressing out.For example, when you are up, you may fill your child’s snack bowl, change their diaper, and make sure they have enough craft supplies in their room for the rest of the day. This way, when you lie back down you can rest for a prolonged period of time without worrying about your child.

Arrange transportation for your child.,
Let your partner or spouse know you need help.,
Lean on family and friends.,
Get in touch with others in your community or network.",How to Handle Being Sick As a Mom3," If your child goes to school, you may be in the habit of picking up and dropping them off on a daily basis. Ask another parent if your child can carpool to school with them so you can rest in bed. Or see if a friend or family member can help you with the picking up and dropping off at school.If your child is involved in extracurricular activities after school like soccer, debate club, etc, they may need a ride home. Ask another parent or a friend to transport them for you while you recover. If you cannot find someone to help you, you may need to cancel their activity for that day.

, Though you may resist asking for help from others, do not be ashamed to do so when you are ill. Being sick happens to everyone and sometimes you just need another pair of hands to help you out. If you have a partner or spouse, let them know you are feeling ill and need them to pitch in. Ask them to help you with specific tasks throughout the day and let them do some of your chores or duties while you rest.For example, you may ask your partner to stay home for the day and help you take care of the kids while you rest in bed. Or you may ask your partner to pick up your children at daycare for you or drop off your child at an event so you can recover at home.

, Call your mother or father and ask them to babysit your child while you recover. Or ask your sibling if they would come over and watch your child while you rest in bed. You may also ask close friends to help you keep your child occupied when you are ill and to give you a helping hand.For example, perhaps you ask a friend to take your child out for a few hours on a fun outing so you can recover in bed.

, Be willing to reach out to other people in your life who could help you care for your child while you are ill. You may ask another mom you know if your child can go over to their house for a playdate or a sleepover so you don’t have to worry about keeping your child occupied at home. Or you may ask a neighbor to come over and take care of your child while you recover from your illness.You may feel uncomfortable at first with asking others in your community for help. But being honest about your illness and your need for help will often encourage others to pitch in and offer their time, especially if you are part of a close knit community or have a generous network of people in your life.

Bend down to their height and look them in the eye.,
Say, ""If you again, you are going to go in timeout/the corner/the chair/the step, etc..."" This is the child's warning.,
If the child exhibits the same behavior again, pick them up (if light enough) or take their arm and guide them to the place where the time out will take place.,
Bend down to their level and make eye contact to them and explain to them that they are going to be taking a timeout now and the reason for it.,
Walk away.,
Follow through.,
Ask for an apology.",How to Get Your Child to Obey You," You do not want to intimidate them, but you do want them to take you seriously. Make sure that they have actually exhibited the bad behavior. Do not punish or reprimand them for nothing.;
, He or she now knows what behavior you want him or her to stop and if he or she continues to do it, there will be a negative consequence.

, For younger kids, a corner or step is ideal. For school aged children and older kids, a chair or room is a better idea. Do not send them to their bedroom. That is where they sleep, relax, and play with their toys. The same room should not be used as a relaxation place and a punishment. Try a guest room or office or any room that the child has no interest in. This way, all their attention will be focused on what got them in time out and how they should change their behavior.

, Say something like, ""You after I told you not to so now you are going to stay here for minutes."" The proper allotted time for a time out is 1 minute per the child's age. It is usually helpful to set a timer.

, This is one of the most important steps. Go back to what you were doing prior to putting him or her in timeout. Do not stand there and babysit them and force them to stay in the time out. Do not say anything else to them. Answering them back is only giving them the attention they want from you. Instead of focusing on changing their behavior, they're focusing on getting out of timeout and/or getting you to talk to them.

, If the child gets out of time out, place them back there and restart the timer while still saying nothing (not even ""I'm restarting the timer now that you got out!""). No matter how many times they get up, do not let them go until they've sat there for the full amount of time without getting out. If you give in after the 5th or the 10th time that they've got out of time out, they will just learn that as soon as you get tired of putting them back, they are free to go instead of learning that there will be consequences.

, Once the child has sat there for the full amount of time, explain to them (while getting down to their level and making eye contact again) why they were in timeout. Then ask for an apology. Say something along the lines of, ""I put you in timeout because you after I told you not to. Now, you owe me an apology."" After they give you a sincere apology meaning they looked you in your eyes and said it in a genuine tone instead of whining, shouting, or mumbling it under their breath, give them a hug and kiss. After the timeout, go about your day normally and do not drag it on.

Stay calm.,

Develop a plan of what to do if they get lost.,
Never let your child be by him/herself and always keep them in your eye view.",How to Find a Child in a Shopping Mall," Assume the best, but get into action quickly. In many cases, it's probable that your child has wandered off or is playing hide and seek somewhere. Staying calm will help you to quickly assess what has happened, to canvass the options and to act with clarity.

, Children have really playful natures and malls offer lots of opportunities to have some fun. Have a look around the immediate vicinity, calling the child's name. He or she may just be around the corner playing with whatever they could get their hands on. Sometimes they may even hide from you for fun.;
, Your child may have just wandered to a near by candy or toy shop so always check there. If you check stores, tell the employees their about the missing child so they can keep an eye out.

, Look behind clothing racks, shelving, the back of displays, under chairs and behind things. Many children love hiding, while others are attracted to fascinating displays and try to ""get inside"" them or play with them.

, Sometimes, pretending to go home and saying ""bye bye"" can do the trick for the very young, causing them to come running out screaming not to be left behind.

, Once you find your kid, remember to tell him or her to not run off like that again, and to always stay within your view. He/she may even listen if you reward him afterwards.


Don't make a scene. You may be understandably upset but yelling and screaming at your child will terrify, not teach them. Keep calm and stay close with your child until you are able to speak calmly.

, After doing a quick look around (see Part 1) and not spotting your child, assume that quick action is needed. The first three hours after a child goes missing are vital in finding a child should anything untoward have occurred., Someone at the information kiosk or central management can speak on the loudspeaker to get your child's attention. Be prepared to provide a description of the child's clothing, hair color, eye color and anything else. Give the child's name, and any nickname that he or she prefers to be called by; this may not be called out to protect the child but it will be helpful to those in the actual search. The child's age will also be needed.


Show a photograph of your child on your cellphone or a real photograph from your purse or wallet.

, Go back to any places where you remember your child talking to someone or seeming very interested in what a person was doing. For example, if your child was fascinated by people putting up a window display or showing a smartphone to customers, these might be the stores to go back to and check again.


Ask the mall security staff to check all of the toilet facilities in the mall.

, They will need to know how to reach you (cell phone number) and that you aren't missing too. If they ask you to stay put, heed their advice. They are not obstructing you; they're trained in what to do and it may be best that you're available for questions and to be there when they bring back your child to you.

, While few people resent stopping to help find a lost child, it shows respect and appreciation to thank them for their help.

, Ask the mall staff to assist if needed; they will likely need to talk to the police anyway and many malls likely have a police alerting protocol in place after a set period of time searching.


Contact your spouse and any relevant caregivers to assist at this stage. You will need support and may not be in a fit psychological state to be left alone.

, They are never too young to learn how to stay safe.

, A child who knows and has practiced what to do upon getting lost. This involves making a plan together, choosing go-to spots in the event of getting split up and teaching your child to stay put at such a location. It isn't enough to talk this through; also act it through at least once every few months, to be sure that your child knows what to do and where to go.


In a mall, this might be a particular store, where a security guard is stationed, or the information kiosk. Only send your child to a location where you know you can trust the staff.

, You may even purchase or make safety helpers, such as:


Child-safe leashes to put around children's hands.
Temporary tattoos with phone number, contact details of parents or caregivers, placed on the child's arm. These are great for crowded places such as malls, Disney locations, game stadiums, theme parks, etc.
Pinning contact details to the child's clothing. Or, simply write the contact details on your child's hand with a safe marker.
Using digital technology, such as a tracking tag (worn like a watch) or similar device.
Dress your child in bright clothing for ease of spotting.

Treat their romantic partners well.",How to Get Along with Your Kids," Taking the time and energy to bond with your young child will improve their behavior and lead to less tantrums or disciplinary problems, which will greatly improve your relationship with them and help you get along better.Carve out some time each day, or as often as you can, to do something they love with you, like coloring or playing catch.
During your time together, focus on giving positive feedback rather than always trying to correct or improve them.
Give specific compliments -- “you’re doing so well at sharing your toys,” for example -- to build their positive self-esteem, encourage their good behavior, and to help them feel like they enjoy spending time with you.;
, We all lead busy lives, and sometimes parenting can feel like a 24-hour job crammed into an already full day. But it will vastly improve your relationship if your child feels like you really take the time to listen to them.Use your time in the car together to talk and listen, rather than playing music.
Put your phone, computer, or other distractions away for a few minutes each day and give your kid undivided attention.

, As your kid grows out of infancy and into childhood, it’s important to start letting them have agency and the ability to make some small choices of their own.Allow your kid to make some simple decisions, like what outfit to wear or what kind of snack they would like.
Let them accomplish small tasks own their own, like opening their own juice box or tying their own shoes.
This not only builds their confidence, but helps prevent you two from butting-heads or having a power struggle over small issues.

, It can be hard not to lose your cool and end up shouting at your child, especially when they are being stubborn or misbehaving. Yet, it’s vital to stay calm and find alternative ways of getting your point across and correcting their behavior without resorting to yelling.Stress the importance of using words, like “I’m angry,” to express emotions instead of using actions, like shouting or hitting things.
Take a deep breath, count to 10, or even walk away from the confrontation to avoid blowing up and yelling. Taking a moment to collect yourself and sort through your emotions will help you to respond to your child in a more productive way.Model this behavior for your child in addition to telling them this is how they should act, too. Do what you say as well as what you preach., It can be helpful to sometimes think of your kid as their own person rather than just your child. Focus on their qualities and virtues that you would enjoy in a friend and use these to fortify your relationship and help you relate to them., ""Validating"" your child, at any age, means confirming that their feelings make sense and accepting their feelings in a non-judgmental way.When one feels validate they feel respected and heard, which are foundational elements for any good relationship.
Let your child know that they can express their feelings about anything -- school, friends, even you -- without you judging, shaming, or thinking badly of them.
Acknowledge that their problems matter, no matter how big or small they seem to you. Teens especially have problems that might seem silly or small in their parent’s eyes but are huge in their lives at that moment.
Don't make your teen feel like their feelings are misplaced or don’t matter; this will strain your relation and lead to resentment rather than bonding., Once your kids hit their late teens, the parent-child relationship should change a bit so and reach a new balance where you two can get along more as friends.


It’s natural and important for older children to need new boundaries, privacy, and even distance from their parents.Support your older kid’s need for having their own vacation plans with friends, for example, or not wanting to spend every weekend with you.
While this change might feel like a loss of intimacy, these new boundaries are essential for your child to become an independent adult, and you will get along with them a lot better if you respect this., Even though they're grown, it’s still important to have some ground rules concerning how you and your grown kids should treat each other with mutual respect.If you have some specific things you would like from your child -- such as always answering a text or email marked as “urgent” -- let them know.
Ask them if they have some in return for you to follow -- such as not calling them before 10AM unless urgent -- and agree to abide by this.
Agree to disagree sometimes, and recognize that it’s okay if you don’t get along 100% of the time or agree about everything. What's important is that you both love and respect each other anyway., Sometimes your adult kid will ask for your input and advice, but at other times your silence will be golden.Exercise restraint and respect by not asking too many intrusive questions -- especially about personal non-harmful topics (like their romantic life). If they want to share, they will!
Instead of being pushy or noisy, which can push your kid away and strain your relationship, let them know that you’re always available to talk or even just listen whenever they need you.

, It can be really difficult when your adult child becomes seriously involved and attached to a boyfriend, girlfriend, or partner. This is especially the case if you don’t particularly approve or “like” them.Unless it’s for serious, potentially harmful reasons, respect your child’s choice and their shifting relationship priorities that follow.
Don’t make it an issue if they want to spend more time with their significant other. Be supportive and loving to them both and they will naturally respect and want to include you in their adult lives.

Let her know you’re always available to talk.Teenagers aren't children, but aren't adults yet either.,
Listen when she talks to you.,
Be clear when explaining rules and consequences.,
Be respectful of your daughter.",How to Get Along with Your Teenage Daughter1," They still need guidance and direction to a good future. Sometimes your teenage daughter may not want to engage in conversations with you, but you can get along with her if you let her know that you are there for her if and when she needs someone to talk to.


For example, you might say, “I know that we may not always see eye-to-eye, but I’m always here if you need someone to talk to.”
Or you could try, “I just want you to know that I’m always available if you ever need to talk about anything.”;
, It can be easy to get lost in the slang and moodiness of a conversation with a teenage girl.But one of the best things you can do to get along with your teenage daughter is to listen to her. So, remove any distractions, give her your attention, and allow her to talk while you listen.


Turn down the radio if you’re in the car, set your electronic device aside, or cut the TV off at home.
Look at her so that she knows that you’re paying attention to what she has to say. You might say, “What you have to say is important to me. I’m listening.”
Don’t think about how to respond while she is talking. For instance, if she’s talking to you about a friend that skipped school, don’t interrupt and start telling her all the reasons it’s wrong.
Instead, focus on the message she’s trying to give you. For example, she could be trying to let you know that she has already decided not to skip school.

, Don’t simply enforce a new rule that you haven’t discussed with your daughter. This will only lead to frustration on both of your parts. Instead, you can get along with your teenage daughter if you talk with her about the rules, why each one exists, and what the consequences will be for disobeying.For instance, you could say, “Until you are 17, you can’t drive after dark. This is because it’s the law, but it’s also for your safety. If you break this rule, you’ll lose driving privileges for a month.”
Or, you might try, “You can drive to and from school, but you can’t have any passengers with you. This is because you are a new driver and don’t need distractions while driving.”
Be willing to relax the rules if your daughter has been doing a great job of following them.
For example, you might let her best friend ride to school with her if your daughter has done a good job of not having passengers and has shown that she is a careful, responsible driver.

, You will get along with your teenage daughter better if you treat her the way you want her to treat you. If you want her to listen to you and your rules, then you should listen to her feelings and respect her as an individual, as well as your daughter.Talk to her the way you want her to talk to you. Avoid yelling or calling her names. Instead, talk to her in calm, mature manner.
Give her a chance to explain herself and express her opinion (in a respectful way).
Ask her opinion and listen when she gives it. For example, you might say, “What do you think about the driving rules?”

Get a great winter hat for your child.",How to Get a Toddler to Wear Winter Clothes1," Winter clothes should be about more than just keeping your child warm and dry. The outfit also has to fit your child well enough that your active toddler can run around unhindered. In particular, try to pick out winter clothes that are easy to put on and take off, especially if your little one has a tendency to need to go “potty” right after you have put his winter clothes on.


Steer clear of heavy and bulky winter clothes because these winter garments can make it very difficult for toddlers to move around.;
, As mentioned above, bulky clothes can hinder movement. Instead, try layering several warm but thin pieces of clothing on top of each other so that your child can move around easily.


Consider putting a lightweight, waterproof jacket over a fleece, on top of a long-sleeved t-shirt. These layers will be warm enough to keep your toddler comfortable, and light enough that he will be able to join a snowball fight without worrying about not being able to run away from his ‘enemies’.
You could also invest in a few pairs of long thermal underwear which your child can wear under his clothes to stay warm.

, Toddlers have a limited awareness of fabrics. They know that whether a fabric is hot or cold to the touch, smooth or rough, or itchy instead of soft. Because of this, it is important that they like the feel of their winter clothes, or else they will be much less likely to get into them.


Materials that are generally ‘toddler approved’ (meaning they’re comfortable) are made from cotton, wool, faux fur, down, or nylon. Keep these materials in mind when shopping for your child’s winter clothing.
Soft fleece is another great option, as it is extremely warm and comfortable. However, fleece is not waterproof, so your child will probably need to wear another layer on top.
Also try to avoid clothing with itchy tags or labels sewn into them, as this could irritate your child's skin during playtime.

, Take your child to go shopping with you when you buy his winter clothes. If he picks them out himself, he will be much more inclined to wear them in the future. You may consider letting him pick out clothes with his favorite characters on them as an added incentive.


Before going shopping, tell him the plan so that he does not get out of hand when trying to pick out clothes. Before leaving the house, tell him what you are going to buy, and how many of each thing he will be allowed to pick out (for instance, maybe he will be allowed to pick out two pairs of mittens).

, Mittens are much easier to put on a squirming toddler rather than gloves that require you to get each finger into the right compartment. In addition to this, mittens will keep your toddler’s hands warmer because all of the fingers are kept together, which helps to evenly distribute body heat. Remember to buy mittens that have a warm inner layer and a waterproof outer layer.


Fleece-lined mittens work well if your child plays in the snow a lot, as this material dries very quickly.
Select mittens with velcro, rather than strings, as these strings have a tendency to come undone more easily that Velcroed mittens.
Put your child’s mittens on before you put on his snow jacket. Doing this will help to keep snow out of your toddler’s mittens.
If you don't have mittens readily at hand, you could improvise by using a pair of long woolen socks to keep your child's hands warm.

, Make sure your toddler’s socks are not too thick, or else they could your child’s winter boots too tight. This, in turn, can pinch your child’s toes, making your child more inclined to put up a fight when putting his winter boots on.

, Each toddler has his own needs and personality. If your child loves playing in the snow, a one-piece snowsuit is a good option, because it creates less opportunities for snow to get under your child’s garments. Choose a snowsuit with an outer layer made of nylon so that it’s water and ice resistant, but with a soft down or fleece inner lining to help keep the warmth inside. Other things to keep in mind include:


Get a snowsuit with a zipper so that you can unzip your child’s suit without having to take the whole thing off when he has to go potty.
Make sure the cuffs of the suit fit snugly on your toddler’s wrists and ankles to prevent snow from getting into the snowsuit.

, A large percentage of body heat is released through the head so it is imperative that your toddler dons a winter hat. Look for a hat that has ear flaps so your child’s ears will be kept warm.


You should also look for a winter hat that fastens under your child’s chin so that there is less chance of the hat falling off while your child plays in the snow.
In very cold areas, you could consider buying a balaclava for your child, which covers most of his face and neck and just has holes for the eyes and mouth. You can make these more child-friendly by customizing them. For example, you could turn a white balaclava into an Olaf (the snowman from Disney's Frozen) costume by adding a carrot nose and some spiky hair.

Choose your battles.Don't nitpick your daughter over every minor thing.,
Spend time with just you and your daughter.Don't make ""bonding time"" a daily activity.,
Respect her privacy.,
Tread lightly when it comes to her appearance.,
Show her that you love and support her.",How to Get Along with Your Teenage Daughter2," It will only annoy her and stress you. Yes, teens do need boundaries and discipline, but you will get along better with your teenage daughter if you pick your battles. Don't punish or lecture your daughter over the smallest of situations.Address issues that involve her safety and wellbeing. For example, set rules for her curfew, grades, and online behavior.
Let small things go, like an unmade bed on a hectic morning. It’s not worth the time or the argument.
Instead of arguing, let her experience the natural consequences of her actions.
For example, instead of arguing about her painting her nails in bed, let her experience the natural consequence — trying to clean nail polish off of her sheets.

, But on the occasional weekend, do an activity with your daughter that you both like.This quality time will give you all a chance to talk. It will also give you the opportunity to learn more about the young woman she is becoming. Ask her what her interests are and try to plan some activities around that.


It could mean going out to eat together, attending a sporting event, volunteering for a cause you both believe in, or just watching a show.
You may have to insist on this time together. Your daughter will most likely want to spend most of her time with her friends.
For example, you might say, “I know how much fun you have with your friends, but this time together is important to me. It’s also a part of us getting along.”
Set aside your preconceived notions of what parent-daughter time will look like. You might think getting pedicures sounds like fun and is a good way to bond, but maybe your daughter is more into comic books and playing video games. Be prepared to expand your horizons and support her interests.

, As your daughter gets older, she will want, and need, more privacy. Although you are her parent, you will get along with her better if you respect the fact that there are parts of her life that are private to her.


Let your daughter know you are respecting her privacy. Say something like: ""I want you to know that I trust you and respect your privacy. I trust that if there is something going on or you need my help or need to talk that you will come to me about it. I will always check in with you, but I won't invade your space/privacy to do that.""
Knock before her entering her room if her door is shut.
Don’t pry into your daughter’s journal or diary. Instead, talk to her about what you want to know.
An exception to this is if you fear that your daughter is in danger of some kind. In that case, privacy is less than important than her safety. Do what is necessary to keep your teenager safe.For example, if you suspect your daughter may be cutting herself, it’s okay to enter her room without knocking to keep her safe.

, The teenage years can be a very sensitive for a girl when it comes to her looks. Insecurities that she may have never had before pop up, especially as her body goes through some major changes. Although you want her to look her best, try to avoid scrutinizing her choice of hairstyle, clothes, or general fashion sense.Only offer your opinion on her outfit or appearance if she asks. And even then, choose your words carefully.
For example, if she asks how you like her new hairstyle, you could say, “It’s a very different look for you. I’ll have to get used to it, but if you like it, I love it.”
If your daughter is wearing something that is completely inappropriate either for her age or for the occasion, then you should speak up.
For instance, you might try, “Honey, that’s a great outfit, but not necessarily appropriate for opening night at a play.”

, If she thinks you don't care about her or don't love her, she may usually do rebellious things (like smoking) to get your attention. You can get along with your teenage daughter if you make sure to love her and be there for her when times are good and when they are rough.Give her hug every now and then. She may act like she doesn’t want it, but more than likely she really, really does.
Encourage her and support her interests. When possible attend events that she is involved in like sports events, art presentations, or music recitals.
Take an interest in her daily life and her friends. She may not tell you everything, but it's a good practice to let her know you care.

Seek professional help for serious issues.,
Turn to your support system.,
Share coping strategies with your daughter.",How to Get Along with Your Teenage Daughter3," Sometimes the reasons that you aren’t getting along with your teenage daughter are related to serious issues like abuse, pregnancy, substance use, or traumatic events. Asking for help in these situations can help you and your daughter cope with what is going on and get along better.Talk to someone like a counselor, therapist, or religious leader with psychological training when your family is facing extremely stressful situations.

, Not only can professionals help you handle serious issues with your daughter, but your friends and other family members can, too. Let the people close to you support you and your daughter while you work through the issues.Talking to someone that cares about both of you can give you perspective and a way to release your feelings.
Ask your friends and family to help you with everyday chores and tasks when you are going through a rough time.
For example, you could ask your friend, “Would you mind picking up my dry cleaning when you pick yours up?”
Remember that your daughter may have her own support system of friends and family members that she wants to rely on.

, Depending on the situation, you and your daughter may be feeling stressed, anxious, or depressed. You can get along with your teenage daughter during these times if you use coping techniques and teach them to your daughter, as well.


Show your daughter how to do deep breathing exercises to calm herself.
You might tell her, “When you’re feeling anxious, breath in slowly through your nose. Try to hold it in your belly, and then slowly exhale.”
Talk to her about expressing her feelings in appropriate and positive ways. Encourage her to draw, paint, write, sing, or express herself in other creative ways.

Try to ignore her sarcastic tone and focus on her message.
Remind yourself that you were a teenager once, also. Understand that she may be having a bad attitude without even realizing it.
Don’t let her attitude push you away. Keep being there for her and being the parent you know that she needs.

, Writing about what you are going through with your teenage daughter can help you get along with her in several ways. For example, it will help you express exactly what you are feeling without blowing up at her. It can also help you to notice patterns in her (or your) behavior that need to be addressed.


Write about the difficult times and disagreements, as well as the happy and fun times you have with your teenage daughter. Write about how these times make you feel.
Write about your fears and concerns for her, as well as realistic ways you can handle your concerns.
Write about the changes that you see in her and the ways in which she is still your same little girl.
You can even use your journal as a slang dictionary and write down phrases that she uses frequently and what they mean.

, You aren’t the only parent trying to get along with their teenage daughter. Talking to other parents about their experiences can provide you with suggestions for how to handle certain issues.It can also help you understand what your daughter is going through and explore what you are feeling about it.


Being active in your daughter’s school and other activities can give you the chance to meet and interact with other parents. So attend her school’s Literacy Night or her gymnastics meet.
Reach out to parents at your religious institution and community and neighborhood associations.

, It can be easy to lose track of sleep and eating when you are trying to get along with your teenage daughter. But, in order to be the best parent you can be, you need to make sure that you are as healthy as you can be.Drink plenty of water and have alcohol in moderation.
Make sure that you are getting enough sleep. It is okay to take a nap during the day every now and then.
Eat regularly and make sure that your snacks and meals are nutritious.
Engage in some form of physical activity. If possible, invite your daughter to participate in the activity with you.

, There will be times when getting along with your teenage daughter seems impossible. There will be other times when you feel as though your life revolves around your daughter’s drama. At these times, you may need to take a little break and do something that makes you smile.Take a few minutes and play your favorite song. Go into your bathroom, turn the shower on, and sing along with the music.
Take a walk or a hike along your favorite path. Take the time to notice how good it makes you feel and what about it makes you feel good.
Treat yourself to small joy like frozen yogurt, a movie, or a day on the lake.

Find out where she lives.,
Hire a private investigator.,
Call and talk to your ex.,
Stop by instead.,
Ask your ex’s friends or family.",How to Find Out if Your Ex Gave Birth to Your Child1," You probably have lost contact with your ex. If so, then you might not know where she lives anymore. In this situation, you will have to try and find her home address and telephone number.


You can search websites such as Intelius.Enter your ex’s first and last name, as well as the city or state where you think she lives.
You might have to pay a small fee to access the information on her address or phone number.;
, Your ex might have disappeared. In this situation, you will need to contact a private investigator to search for her. You can find private investigators listed in the phone book, or you could find them advertising online.


Before hiring a private investigator, talk about the scope of the search. Also find out how much he or she charges. Generally, private investigators charge $40-100 per hour, though there are additional expenses such as mileage.See Hire a Private Investigator for more information.

, Once you have contact information for your ex, you should call her. The purpose of the phone call is to ask whether she gave birth. You also might want to check whether she intends to keep the baby or give the child up for adoption.


You might be afraid to talk to your ex. The relationship might have ended badly, and you could be feeling tense as you wait for her to pick up her phone. However, you should try to remain as calm as possible.
Also remember to remain polite. You can say, “Melissa, it’s Mike. I’ve been thinking about you recently and wondering if you’ve gone into labor yet.”

, Sometimes stopping by might be easier, especially if your ex is blocking your phone calls. You should think about stopping by at a time when you are sure she will be at home, such as early in the morning or in the evening.


You shouldn’t stop by if you have a history of violence or if you received a restraining order at any time.

, If you can’t locate your ex, then talk to her family and friends. They will probably know whether or not your ex gave birth to your child. Try to find a family member who you are still on good speaking terms with.


You can send an email or call. Be prepared to explain why you want to know whether or not she gave birth to your child.

Explain why winter clothes are important.,
Show your child why is important to wear winter clothes.,
Set aside enough time for your child to get ready to go outside.,
Be a role model.,
Let your toddler choose which clothes he wears.,
Let your child learn the consequences of his actions.,
Make getting dressed fun.",How to Get a Toddler to Wear Winter Clothes2," Children may have a hard time grasping why they have to wear winter clothes. However, it is still important to try to explain the concept of winter clothes to your child. Try sitting your child down for a quick chat about winter clothes before you first try getting your child dressed. Explain that the outside gets really cold during wintertime, and that winter clothes protect you from the cold.


You can also try reading a book about winter and winter clothes to your child. One such book is Thomas’ Snowsuit by Robert Munsch.

, If your child has a hard time grasping the reason why he has to put on winter clothes, and refuses to keep on a specific item, such as his mittens, then let him go outside without his mittens. His hands will start to get cold and you can put on his mittens to show him that they will warm his hands up.


The next time he doesn’t want to put on mittens, remind him of when his hands got cold because he didn’t wear his mittens. Tell him that today is the same sort of day, and that his hands will get cold again if he doesn’t put on mittens.You should also take time to explain to your toddler that if he doesn't dress warmly enough, he might get sick. Then he wouldn't be able to go outside and play at all!

, Hurrying your child while putting on his winter clothes will most likely make him more hesitant about putting the winter clothes on. Instead, set ‘deadlines’ for when your child needs to be ready by, and then start preparing at least an hour beforehand.


For example, tell your child the night before that you are going to start getting him ready to leave the house at 8 AM because you need to leave the house by 9 AM. Do not tell him the consequences of being late. Simply, show him that you expect he will be ready and that there is no getting around your expectations.

, Toddlers generally enjoy imitating adults. If you don’t wear a winter hat, it is a lot less likely that your toddler will want to wear his hat. Being a role model can be hard, but it is important to try to show your toddler what you want through your own actions.Get dressed up in your winter clothes (or at least some of them) and then tell your toddler that putting on winter clothes is the ‘grown up thing to do’. Chances are, your child will see putting on winter clothes as a chance to be independent and grown up.
Use your child’s friends or siblings as role models. Remind your toddler that all of his friends will be wearing snow suits.

, Sometimes, giving your child a bit of responsibility will help him to feel more independent, and will thus put up less of a fight when it is time to get dressed. Only give your child two choices. These choices can be to wear one shirt or another under his winter clothes.


Alternatively you could use something as simple as color to give your child the impression of choice. Show your toddler two identical fleeces, one green, one red and let him choose which one he wants - either way he'll be just as warm!
If your child has two winter hats, or two pairs of mittens, let your child choose which pair or hat to wear.

, This method requires that you be prepared to change your plans for the day to teach your child that his actions have consequences. If your child continuously fights you about putting on his winter clothes, leave him alone for a moment and let his frustration play out. When you come back, tell him that there will be no going outside to play, or that he won’t be seeing his friends today, since he refuses to put on his winter clothes.


Once your child realizes that you are serious about the consequences you may find that your child is much more willing to put his winter clothes on.
If you were supposed to go to the grocery store, tell him that you really wanted to go to the grocery store, but since he refused to get dressed, he won’t be able to eat the delicious soft pretzel you were going to get him. This incentive may also make him want to put his winter clothes on.

, Try making getting dressed into a race. When your child wins, consider giving him a treat, or telling him that he can spend five extra minutes playing in the snow.


You could also try singing a song or telling your child a story while you get him dressed. Your words may help to distract him from trying to take off his winter clothes. Make the story into a tale about a character who is very similar to your child, that set off on an adventure into the winter wonderland with the help of his magic snowsuit.

Let your child know that it's almost time to go.,
Be direct and firm.,
Follow through.,
Reflect his behavior.,
Praise the child for leaving peacefully.",How to Get Your Child to Leave the Playground1," His reaction will probably be very different if you start preparing him for the moment when you have to go than if you abruptly tell him you need to go immediately. Start preparing him to leave the playground and give him a five minute warning.;
, When it's time to leave the playground, after having given a five minute warning, and maybe even a one more minute warning, approach your child and tell him ""it's time to go."" Generally this can cause your child to state that he or she doesn't want to leave yet (whether or not they can put this into words doesn't matter -- you understand somehow that they don't want to leave).

, It is important to do what you say you are going to do, or else you become unreliable, and your child will learn that you do not mean what you say, and your child will push you (usually by whining or screaming or some other ""torture"" method), and if you give in to the child's demands, you are teaching the child to act in this whining/screaming/awful way, because you are rewarding him or her. 

, To reflect is to make yourself a mirror for the child of the child.  So you say to your child, in a soothing voice, ""you wish we could stay in the playground.  You feel very sad to leave the playground."" Or ""you look so angry because we are leaving.  You wish we could stay and play longer."" This lets the child know that you understand. There is no need for the child to scream or escalate into a tantrum once the child has been heard. There is no need for you to bribe the child with a treat if he or she will leave in peace. You might even surprise the child further by offering your own feelings about how hard it is to leave the playground, especially if they match the child's feelings; this will foster greater attachment.

, Let the child know that you appreciate his or her cooperation and that life is so much nicer when the two of you can cooperate with each other.

Check your ex’s social media.,
Perform an Internet search.,
Look at newspapers.",How to Find Out if Your Ex Gave Birth to Your Child2," If your ex gave birth, she might have posted pictures on her Facebook or other social media accounts. You should check those social media accounts to see if she has posted anything about your child. You should also check the social media accounts for her close family, such as her mother, father, and siblings.


Your ex might have protected her social media account.If so, then ask a common friend whether they could check to see if she has posted information about the birth.
Don’t try to hack into your ex’s social media account. Even if you know the password, you shouldn’t log in unless she has given you permission.

, Social media might not yield any clues. However, you can also do a general Internet search. Type your ex’s name into a search engine and see what comes up. If too many records show, then also add the word “birth” to narrow the search results.


It is possible to obtain official birth certificates online through the VitalChek website.However, these records are restricted to people who are close family. Also, you have to request the birth certificate by entering the city of birth as well as the child’s name and birthdate, which you may not know.
Nevertheless, you can perform a basic Internet search. The birth might have been reported on an online newspaper.

, Births are often recorded in local newspapers. Find the newspaper for the county or city where your ex was living when she gave birth. You might be able to find the newspaper online.


You might also stop into your local library to see if they carry a copy of the printed newspaper. Estimate when your child was likely born and go through every issue of the paper one month before the estimated birth date. Also go through newspapers a month after you suspect the child was born.

Find the correct court.,
Get the correct forms.,
Complete a motion for genetic testing.,
File your paperwork.,
Pay for the genetic test.,
Have the genetic test taken.,
Wait for the results.",How to Find Out if Your Ex Gave Birth to Your Child3," Generally, you have to file a “petition” with the court to request a paternity test. You should file in the county where the child lives.If you live in the same county as the child, then file in your county’s court.


Some counties have separate “family law” courts which handle paternity issues. You should visit the court’s website to check.

, Many courts have printed forms you can use to request a paternity test. You will probably need a “petition” to open the case and then a separate “motion” to request a genetic test. You can ask the court clerk for the forms.If no forms are available from the court, then check the following places:


Local legal aid organizations. Legal aid provides free legal help to the public, particularly those with low incomes. They often create printed, “fill in the blank” forms for family law cases, such as paternity disputes. You should look in the phone book for nearby legal aid organizations.
Your local Child Support Division. Each state has offices which help establish and collect child support. The agency where your child lives will probably help you establish paternity. To find this office, contact your Attorney General’s office.

, Print neatly using black ink, or use a typewriter. You want the judge to be able to read your information. Each form is different, but they generally will ask for similar information, such as the following:your name
your ex’s name
a request that the court order you, the child, and your ex to undergo genetic testing
why you think you are the father, such as the fact that you had sexual intercourse around the time the child was conceived
your signature under penalty of perjury

, You need to file the petition and motion with the court clerk. Make several copies and take the copies, along with the original, to the court clerk. Ask to file. The clerk can stamp your copies with the filing date.You will have to send your ex a copy of the papers you filed. You may also have to send other documents, such as a summons, which you can get from the court clerk.
Generally, you can hire a process server to hand deliver the papers to your ex. You can find process servers in your phone book or online. In some counties, you may also be able to arrange for the sheriff or constable to make hand delivery for a small fee.
Alternately, you could have someone 18 or older make hand delivery, provided they are not a part of the lawsuit. For example, a neighbor might make delivery for free.
You may have to pay a filing fee. Call the court ahead of time to check the amount and acceptable methods of payment.

, You may have to pay ahead of time, otherwise the court will not schedule the genetic test.You should find out the cost and acceptable methods of payment. Ask the court clerk or the local child support agency.


If you can’t afford the test, then you might be able to file a fee waiver form. It goes by different names, such as an “Affidavit of Indigency” or something else.You can typically get the fee waiver form from the same place you obtained your petition form.

, There are generally two types of genetic tests used to determine paternity. You may have to take one or the other. The two tests are:Blood tests. You will have blood drawn, usually from your arm.
Buccal swab. With this test, a nurse rubs a cotton swab against the inside of your cheek.

, Your ex and the child will also have genetic tests taken. The lab will then compare the results and prepare a report for the judge to read. The judge will read the report at court and tell you the results at a hearing.


After determining paternity, the court can then move on and determine other issues, such as child support, child custody, and the provision of health insurance."

Identify why you want to know if your child was born.,
Analyze your ability to pay child support.,
Wait until your child is older.,
Meet with an attorney.",How to Find Out if Your Ex Gave Birth to Your Child4," Everyone has different reasons for finding their children. However, before starting the search, you should try to identify why you want to find out this information.


For example, you might want to seek custody and help raise your child. This is a solid reason to try and find out if your ex gave birth.
Alternately, you might just be curious. This is also a good reason. However, there could be negative consequences if you reach out to your ex. For example, she might come after you for child support once she knows where you’re living. In this situation, you might do Internet research but not try to contact her.

, If your ex gave birth to your child, then the hospital likely asked that she identify the father. She could have lied and said she didn’t know. However, if she named you as the father, then the state will seek child support from you.


For this reason, you should think about whether you want to establish some sort of relationship with the child, particularly if you can’t afford child support.
Each state determines child support a little differently. For example, in Texas, you can expect to pay 20% of your net income if you have one child or 25% of your net income if you have two children. “Net income” is the total amount of income from all sources minus any required deductions, such as federal income tax or FICA tax.See Calculate Child Support for more information.

, You can always try to establish a relationship with your child once he or she is grown. In this situation, you won’t have to pay child support because your son or daughter is now an adult. Most states will cut off child support once the child reaches 18, though this might differ slightly depending on the circumstances.Waiting is a good option for men who aren’t ready to take parental responsibility right now.

, You might have other reasons for wanting to find your children that aren’t captured in this article. If so, then you should reach out to an attorney to discuss any paternity questions that you have.


You can get a referral to an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Once you have the name of an attorney, call him or her up and ask to schedule a meeting. Ask how much the attorney charges.

Before going to the park, talk with your child about behavior.,
Tell him you need to leave and ask how much more time he needs to finish up.",How to Get Your Child to Leave the Playground2," ""Let's go to the park, but let's not argue about having to leave when it's time to leave.  How do you think we can do that?"" Chances are your child might not know or might say that you should stay all day and all night! That's okay. You are going to explain that you have an idea -- you will approach him or her to privately speak with him or her before it's time to go. You will not speak loudly across the park in front of their friends because this sets up a power struggle. You will quietly remind your child that it will be time to leave soon and ask him or her how much time he or she needs. He or she is allowed to ask for up to ten minutes more. You agree to give that much more time, and then you can add some reflection from step one while nicely leaving with your child once the time is up. Get your child to agree to cooperate before you go to the park. They can pick how much ""extra"" time they get to play for up to ten minutes, but then they must cooperate and leave with you.

, When you are in the playground, and you want to leave in fifteen minutes, approach your child, and without speaking loud enough for others to hear, tell your child that it's almost time to leave and ask him or her how much more time he or she needs. If your child says more than ten minutes, remind him or her that you agreed on ten minutes or less. ""Please pick a number between one and ten."" Once they have chosen a number, say, ""in that many minutes, we will leave. I will come and remind you."" Then do that. If they protest, reflect how hard it is, how sad they feel or angry or disappointed or frustrated or whatever you think they feel at that moment -- it is okay if they correct you with a different feeling. Take the corrected feeling they provide and reflect that feeling to them. It helps if you show it on your face as well.

Great work.” You can give your child a high-five or a hug as affirmation.Even if your child makes a mistake or receives an undesired outcome, praise the effort and not the outcome. You can say, “ I know that’s not what you wanted, but you worked hard and put a lot of effort into that project. I’m proud that you stuck with it and gave it your best.”;
, Instead of asking, “What do you want to play?” say to your child, “You can have blocks or cars. Which would you like?” Give your child choices instead of leaving options open. When giving choices, make sure they are not overwhelming.Keep the wording brief and allow no more than three options.


You can use this in response to undesired situations too. For example, if your child is upset about not wearing the outfit he or she chose, say, “Would you like to wear these pants or those? This or that shirt?”
Keep choices realistic with outcomes you can handle. Don’t offer a choice you secretly wouldn’t like your child to choose.

, If your child is trying to get your attention by acting out, don’t enforce these behaviors. If a child throws a tantrum and you do not respond, the child will learn that there is a different way to behave that you will respond to. Likewise, praise the behaviors you want to see.Trust that your kids are inherently good. If your child is acting out, find reasons for it. For instance, if your children are young, are they hot, tired, or hungry? Did they sleep well? It can be very difficult for children to cope with situations if they are not feeling 100% physically.
Even older kids and teens might display behaviors that might seem like they are acting out, but as kids mature, the reason they are upset could have more of an emotional origin because of their increased ability to comprehend the world around them. In addition, even teens can go through a great deal of physical discomfort as their bodies and brain grow. Try and go to one of these reasons first.
Regardless of age, check in with your child's status first. Ask your kids how they are feeling. If your kid is acting out, but he’s having growing pains, you have your answer. Then you can see what might help your child feel more comfortable, like a nice warm bath.
Praise your kids for sharing their concerns, worries, and physical status with you. It also helps them feel special when you thank them for the opportunity to help them.
For example, if your child responds well to a frustrating situation, say, “I can tell that made you frustrated, but you stayed calm and didn’t hit or yell. I’m really proud of you!”

, Your child should know what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior. Have some clear family rules and limits.Generally, children want to please parents. By having clearly defined rules and limits, children can have a good understanding of expectations and consequences.


Clearly explain rules and limits in simple language. You may want to visually display them to help children remember.
Make sure rules and limits are developmentally appropriate for your child’s age or stage of development. For example, a reward can be given for following rules, like a small toy for a young child or tv time for an older child. Consequences may be taking away privileges, which might include not getting a reward (like a dessert or tv time) or having limited access to wifi or the phone.
For more information on appropriate limits and behavior, check out How to Discipline a Child According to Age.

, Instead of just pointing out where behaviors are negative, show when they can be positive. This can help the child to understand when the behavior is appropriate and when it is inappropriate.


For example, say, “Use your markers on the paper, not on your clothes.”
You can also say, “If you want to throw something, it’s okay to go outside and play basketball. Throwing toys doesn’t happen in the house.”

, Help your child to solve the problem. Ask questions about how your child can approach the situation differently or see things from a different perspective. Encouraging your child to problem solve can empower and help her to take this approach in the future.For example, if your child is upset with a sibling, say, “I can see this is hard for you. What do you think you can do to not feel upset? Do you think you can take a break? What about doing a different activity? How do you think you can solve fighting with your brother?”

, Instead of pointing out the negative (like having to stop playing), draw attention to the positives (like you're stopping play so you can go to her favorite restaurant). You can do this even as you set limits. A child will more likely respond to your “yes” than your “no.”Say, “Yes, we have to stop playing now. Yes, we can leave your block castle up. Once we clean up we are going to your favorite restaurant and yes, you can have the grilled cheese if you want.”

, Children often act out their feelings, but it’s beneficial for them to label their emotions so that they can better respond to them. If your child is throwing a tantrum, say, “Are you feeling angry?” For younger children, you can try, “You seem upset to me. Is something the matter? How can I help you?” For an older child, you can say, “What’s going on? I can see you feel strongly about this.”Reinforce that emotions are okay to feel, even negative emotions. Yet, correct any behavior at the same time. Say, “It’s okay to feel angry, but it’s not okay to hit.”

, If a child is struggling with a particular activity, redirect to a different activity. Redirection cuts the child off from continuing the behavior and enforces that those behaviors won’t be tolerated. When redirecting, clearly say what behavior is not tolerated.For example, you can say, “Playing with blocks isn’t working because you’re throwing the blocks, and we don’t throw things. We’re going to play with the puzzles now.”

, Children want to behave well. Children are doing the best they can, and if they misbehave, there’s likely a reason behind the behavior. Once you discover what drives the behavior, it’s much easier to address the emotions or remove the cause of the behavior.The child may be saying, “Please notice me,” or, “I’m frustrated and I give up.” A child may also misbehave as a way to say, “I feel hurt so I’m hurting others,” or, “I want my way and to be in control.”
By thinking about what the behavior is linked to, you can then start to find solutions. If a child is tired or hungry, it’s unlikely that he will respond to “Stop whining.” Ask yourself, “What is my child’s need right now?” and approach the misbehavior that way.

, Instead of trying to get your child to behave differently, make sure you are in control of your own emotions.Especially if you’re trying to get your child to stop misbehaving, make sure you are not misbehaving!


If you’re feeling especially frustrated or angry with your child, take a deep breath. Take note of your feelings and ask yourself, “Do I want to interact with my child in this state?” You may need to walk away or choose different words.
Instead of yelling, try a song instead. Sing a simple song, such as, “Uh oh, you’re sad about leaving, but it’s time to go.”
Or, you can redirect the conversation. After all, what kid really wants to leave the playground? Give her something to look forward to, such as, “It’s time to go get a drink,” or “I was hoping we could get home so we have enough time to do (the child’s favorite activity) together.”

, Don’t display behaviors you don’t want your child to show. For example, if you yell, scream, or throw things, it shouldn’t be surprising if your child begins to mimic these actions. Yelling often leads to more yelling, frustration to more frustration.Monitor how you interact with your child and make changes when you notice them.


If you are frustrated with a task, use it as a learning opportunity for your child. Say, “Wow, I feel really frustrated right now. I want to yell and be angry, but I know that taking a break will help me more. I’m going to sit down for a minute,” then take a moment to go to your bedroom and do some deep breathing.
Be honest and respectful to your child and to those around you when your child is present. Behave in ways you want your child to behave and your child will learn from your example.

, Defiance can be a sign that the caregiver-child relationship is not fully supported. A child should be able to take direction (or redirection) without much difficulty. Turning the situation into a power struggle doesn’t benefit you or the child, and indicates that there is an issue with the relationship (don't worry — this happens occasionally). Think about how to strengthen the relationship, not how to make the child do what you want.Instead of seeing defiance as your child not respecting authority, see it as a disconnect in the relationship. Then, find ways to strengthen the relationship. This can include spending more enjoyable time together, playing together, or interacting with the child in a meaningful way. Start by spending 20 minutes each day doing activities with the child such as drawing, playing blocks, or playing hide-and-go-seek.

Ask your spouse questions if the way he or she does something irritates you.,
Never interject with, ""Don't do it like that, do it this way,"" because this is a fast way to chase off the one you love, and make him or her self-conscious about being with the children.

,
Give suggestions in a nice way, not as if you are the teacher and your spouse is the student.,
Take into consideration the possibility of any role you've played in making him afraid or resistant to interacting with the kids.,
Use hobbies.,
If your child is of the opposite sex from your spouse, take into consideration that your spouse may not know how to interact appropriately.",How to Encourage Your Spouse to Interact with the Kids," For instance, if he or she bathes the baby differently, ask something like, ""I saw that you bathe Bailey this way. Do you do it that way for a reason?"";
,, ""Tommy said today he really wants to go to the zoo. I was wondering if you and he would like some time to yourselves to go Saturday. I have some errands and things I need to do. But maybe you would like to spend some time as just the two of you.""

, Sometimes the simplest things have done so much damage.

, If your spouse is into trains and your son loves trains, then say something like, ""I noticed Joey looking over your train things; he was really getting into it, maybe you could show him some things."" This is a low-threat way to bring the two together.

, This is particularly an issue with men and little girls, although some women may also have an issue with little boys.

A child’s acting-out behaviors or social challenges usually reflect back onto the dynamics of their family unit and how their parents interact with one another, as well as how they project this onto their child. In other words, what is usually going on (or not going on) between mom and dad is often the cause of the child’s problems.

There is a strong relationship between how parents interact with one another in front of their children, and how a child feels, behaves, or adjusts to situations. For example, if you child has been exposed to a fight between you and your spouse, then this would put them at a greater risk of developing feelings of anxiety, shame, guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, hopelessness, and depression. Your child may also have trouble identifying and adopting healthy social skills and long-term healthy relationships with friends.;
, Conflict is normal and natural, and it is a part of all relationships. However, the way you deal with conflict, especially in the presence of our children, is important to promote their own understanding and developmental growth. Work with your spouse to demonstrate how to solve problems in a collaborative way. Approaching your conflicts in this way in front of your children, will increase the chances that your child will develop healthy personal and interpersonal life skills.

Make sure to avoid arguing in front of your children. It is especially important to avoid using inappropriate words or name calling in front of your children.
If you and your partner do get into an argument in front of your children, make sure to be courteous. Listen to one another’s viewpoints. Let your partner have a turn to speak, and make sure to validate their opinions and concerns.
If you and your partner do get into an argument in front of your kids and your disagreement becomes heated, then agree to take a “time out.” Your “time out” will help you both to cool down from the conflict, and then you can resume the conversation when you children are not around, such as while they are at school or at a friend’s house.

, When you and your partner start to get into an argument in front of your kids, agree to both take a deep breath and step back from the situation. Taking a breath and stepping back can help you both get some perspective on the argument and handle it with less anger or resentment. Though you may both still be upset, having a lower anger threshold will ensure the argument does not get out of hand in front of your children.You and your partner may also agree to discuss the issue at a later time when you have both calmed down and can approach the situation with less emotion. You may also suggest this option to your partner if you feel you are getting upset and do not want things to escalate in front of the kids.

, When you and your partner have an argument in front of the kids, remember to focus on the behavior that bothers you, not on blaming the other person. You and your partner may try to use “I” statements to discuss your feelings about the other’s behavior and reflect on how to come to a resolution. Using “I” statements and focusing on the person’s behavior will ensure the disagreement stays productive.For example, you may say to your partner, “I feel like you are not pitching in as much as you could be around the house. Can we discuss this issue together?” or “I feel as though you are letting work take priority over spending time with the kids. Can we talk about this?”

, When you and your partner are arguing, do not allow your kids to become the mediators or referees. If you notice the kids starting to try to mediate by saying, “Mom, don’t say that” or “Dad, be nice,” this is a sign that perhaps the argument has gotten out of hand. You and your partner may need to step back, take a deep breath, and agree to discuss the matter later in private, away from the kids.You should also be aware of any signs of stress in your kids during arguments with your partner. Pay attention to how your children react when you have a disagreement. If they cover their ears or run out of the room, these are signs of stress. They may also develop headaches, stomachaches, and other physical issues. Some kids act out at home or at school due to stress from parents fighting.
If you notice any signs of stress in your kids, you and your partner should discuss how you can both better approach disagreements and arguments in front of them. You and your partner may need to adjust your behavior so your kids are not stressed or upset by your actions.

, You and your partner should work together to come to an agreement or a resolution to the issue in private and in a controlled way. Agree not to shout, yell, or scream at each other. Take as much time as you both need to work out the issue. Then, let your kids know that you both have come to an agreement and can move forward together as a family. Reassuring your kids can help them feel less stressed and overwhelmed.For example, you may both sit down with your kids and say to them, “Mom and Dad have discussed the issue together and we have come up with a resolution” or “Mom and Dad have talked the issue out and are going to work on the problem together.”

, You and your partner should not be shy about showing affection for each other in front of your kids. Showing physical affection for your partner in front of your kids tells them that showing affection for someone you love is normal and okay. Demonstrate open and affectionate behavior for your kids so they learn that there is no shame attached to being physically engaged with someone else.You and your partner may hold hands when you are together and in front of the kids. You may also give your partner a quick kiss hello and goodbye every day on the way to work.
Try to be playful around your partner and in front of your kids, making jokes, teasing, and laughing with your partner. This will show your kids that being playful around those you love is acceptable behavior.

, Do not be afraid to say these loving words in front of your kids, as it can help them to get used to saying that to those they love and care about. You and your partner may say “I love you” to each other at least once a day or when the mood strikes. You may also tell your kids that you love each other as people and value each other as partners so they know your relationship is healthy.Try to maintain eye contact with your partner when you say “I love you” to them so your kids can see that eye contact is important in emotional situations. You may make an effort to also maintain eye contact with your partner when they are speaking so your kids can see that this type of body language is healthy.

, You and your partner should try to be affectionate to your children as well as to each other. Being affectionate to your kids will show them that there is no shame attached to being loving to another person. This can also help to create an environment at home that feels supportive and loving for your kids.You can be affectionate to your kids by telling them that you both love them on a daily basis. You can also do actions that feel affectionate, such as tucking them in for bed at night or tickling them and being goofy together.

, You and your partner should make time for your kids and be there for them as parents. But a big part of having a functional marriage is also making time for each other, where you spend time just the two of you. You and your partner should include alone time in your schedules so you can make sure your marriage gets the attention and care it needs.For example, you and your partner may have a standard date night once a week or twice a month where you go out just the two of you. You may arrange for childcare and spend time away from the kids for a night so you can have some alone time.

, You and your partner should model healthy relationships in front of your kids as well as privately so your marriage is strong and functional. A big part of that is showing respect for each other, even in difficult situations. Always be respectful towards each other and try to support each other with kindness and care. Doing this can help to maintain your marriage and model good behavior for your kids.You can show respect for your partner in little ways by being on time for dinner every night and by following through on your commitments to your partner. You can also show respect for your partner by listening to them intently during any disagreements and by being honest with them during any arguments.

, You can also maintain a healthy marriage and a healthy family life by making an effort to spend quality time together as a family. This can help your kids feel important and central to your lives as parents. It can also allow you and your partner to work together as parents and feel like a team.Your family may spend quality time together by having a weekly movie and snacks night at home. Or you all may go out to see a game or a show together that you will all enjoy.
You may also have quality time with your family by going on a trip together, such as a camping trip, an overnight stay at a cottage, or an overseas trip to another country.
Sometimes quality time can come in the form of involving your kids in things you like to do, such as a favorite hobby or sport of yours. You may all go watch a sports game together or participate in a fun run together as a family.

Attend the final hearing.",How to Do a Stepparent Adoption," In all states, stepparent adoption terminates the legal parent-child relationship between the child and the noncustodial parent. This means that the noncustodial parent will lose his or her parental rights, as well as parental responsibilities, such as paying child support.Additionally, in most states, the child loses the legal right to inherit from the noncustodial parent and the relatives on that side of the family. The child will only receive inheritance from that side if he or she is named in a will.Adoption in the United States is governed by state law, so each state may have different requirements and implications for stepparent adoption.;
, Most states require that couples applying for a stepparent adoption be married to each other. Some states will not approve a stepparent adoption unless the stepparent has been married to the child's parent and living with the child for 1 year or longer.If your state has a similar requirement, you can begin the adoption process before the one-year deadline; you will just need to wait for the deadline to pass before you get approval.


If the applying stepparent is not married to the child's parent, you might consider a ""second-parent adoption,"" which is the available to unmarried couples in some states.Also be aware that some states prohibit adoption by unmarried couples, so verify that you meet your state's adoption requirements regarding marriage., If the child is old enough, the court will want to verify that the child consents to the stepparent adoption. Different states set different ages at which they recognize a child's ability to make this decision. Some states require consent from children 14 and older, while other states require consent from children as young as 10.Even if your child is too young to give consent, talk to your child about the possibility of your new spouse adopting him or her.


If your child is old enough to consent to the adoption, the judge will inquire into the child's wishes, most likely by asking questions in court.

, The noncustodial parent must give his or her consent to the stepparent adoption, because the adoption will terminate the noncustodial parent's parental rights and responsibilities, including directing the child's education, medical care, upbringing, and religious training; as well as child support obligations.Some courts require the noncustodial parent to give consent in court, while others accept written consent as part of the adoption paperwork.Explain to the noncustodial parent why you believe a stepparent adoption is best for your family, and ask if he or she will provide consent in writing or at a court hearing.


If the noncustodial parent cannot be contacted or will not give consent, you can file an action to terminate his or her parental rights. This usually involves proving that the noncustodial parent has not exercised any parental rights or been in contact with the child. Most states permit termination of parental rights if the noncustodial parent has failed to support the child or has not communicated with the child for at least a year.Contact the court clerk in your county and ask what forms you need to submit to proceed with an action to terminate parental rights.

, Different states structure their court systems differently, so you will need to locate the correct court to file your adoption petition. Depending on your state, you might need to locate your circuit court, district court, superior court, probate court, family court, probate court, or surrogacy court.You can find more detail on which court is used for adoptions in each state and territory here.

, Most states provide pre-printed forms for stepparent adoptions. You can find those forms at the court's website online or at the court clerk's office. The court clerk may be able to give you a packet of all the forms you will need. The website may also feature an interactive online program that creates your documents based on information you provide.Call the court and ask about self-help programs. Your court have a self-help center where you can ask an attorney to help you with your paperwork for free.
Typical questions on the paperwork include the child's full name and what his or her name will be after the adoption, how long the stepparent and biological parent have been married, and where the child was born. You will likely also be required to provide proof of this information, such as the child's birth certificate and your marriage license.If your state has a form for the noncustodial parent's written consent, include that form with your paperwork., Take your paperwork to the court clerk. The clerk will assist you with filing your petition. Make sure you get a copy of the paperwork for your own records, and a copy to serve on the noncustodial parent. The clerk will notify you of the date of your preliminary hearing.

, Each parent must receive formal notice of the proceedings. You may be required to give notice to the other parent, or your state's rules of civil procedure may permit you to file a ""Waiver"" or ""Acceptance of Service"" signed by the other parent. If you are required to give notice, you may be able to request that the court clerk give notice on your behalf. Otherwise, you will need to do one of the following:


Pay the sheriff's office or a professional process server to serve the parent; or
Arrange for a friend or relative over 18 years of age and not involved in the case to hand-deliver your documents to the other party. This friend or relative will need to fill out a Proof of Service form verifying that he or she served the other party., At the date and time given to you by the court clerk, you will need to attend a preliminary hearing, which may be a few weeks or a few months away. Both the biological parent and the adoptive parent should attend the hearing with the child. The judge may ask the child whether he or she consents to the adoption. The judge will explain the rest of the process, and may set a date for the next hearing, where the adoption will be finalized.Often, the preliminary hearing can be waived if all parties are in agreement., Most states require that the adoptive parent pass a criminal background check.The court will arrange for the investigation, which will most likely be conducted in the interim between the preliminary and final hearings.

, Some states require that the biological parent and the adoptive parent participate in a home study.The court will appoint an agency to conduct an investigation to make sure that the adoptive parent is mentally sound, financially stable, healthy, and able to support the child.Alternatively, you may be visited by a social worker, who will review how the family is adjusting to the adoption., At the date and time give to you by the judge or the court clerk, you will need to return to court to attend a final hearing. The judge will issue an adoption certificate or court order naming the stepparent as the legal parent of the child."

Calculate housing costs. These can be expected to total roughly 33 percent of your overall household expenses. Housing costs consist of mortgage or rent payments, home maintenance, property taxes, utilities and renter's or homeowner's insurance.
Allow another 33 percent for education and childcare expenses: daycare, baby-sitting, primary and secondary school tuition, books and materials. This does not include money set aside for college.
Figure meal expenses, including the cost of food purchased from grocery stores, restaurants and school cafeterias.
Add in transportation costs. These consist of a portion of your monthly car payments, gas, maintenance, repairs, automobile insurance, public transportation and travel fares on trains and planes. For purposes of figuring the cost of child-rearing, you would include here only those costs incurred specifically in caring for your children (expenses you would not have if you didn't have kids).
Include clothing expenses for all children's apparel as well as diapers, shoes, uniforms, athletic gear, dry cleaning and alterations.
Tally all medical and dental care, prescriptions and supplies not covered by insurance. Include health insurance premiums only to the extent that they cover your children. Don't include premiums paid by your employer.;
, The more children you have, the more you would share the costs. This will lower the cost per child.

It is very common to automatically say ""no"" to a child when they ask if they can do something. This can range from leaving the table before they're done eating to playing in the park.
You can't let kids do whatever they want, but limiting them just because you may not want to do something is not always the best approach.;
,


If you are working on a home improvement project and the child asks if he or she can help, don't automatically say ""no"" because you know the job will get done faster.
Find a reasonable task for the child to do, like handing you tools or working on cleaning something. This can help build trust between you and the child as well as boost their confidence.

,


Children are very curious and often feel the desire to explore new places. Let them explore when you know that the place you're at is safe and the people around are trustworthy.
This will let the child know you trust him or her and are willing to let the child learn on his or her own. Saying ""no"" right away, because you may feel the child will get into something or you don't want to chase after him or her, is a legitimate concern, but doesn't always have to be there.
Allowing the child to explore, and even get into trouble, can be a healthy learning experience.

, Continue to communicate with them on a regular basis. Make sure they know they are safe and give them a sense of belonging.


Introduce them to friends and family members.
Ask them questions about their lives and ask if they need any help with something that may be going on at school or daycare.
Place pictures of them around your home.

, Make sure the basic needs are met, such as healthy food, a place to sleep and activities to do at home.


Providing simple rules, such as television guidelines and specific bedtimes, will also help give the child a routine and a sense of security.

,


It is not uncommon for parents to win affection and effectively control their child's behavior by using a reward system or by giving him or her whatever he or she desires.
Although this might appear to make the child happy and keep your relationship positive, in the long run it does not work. Children often end up demanding and grow up with a sense of entitlement.
Instead, reward them for something they have done right as opposed to trying to stop doing something wrong.

, Well, the only other way is to keep them in there room. Make sure that they don't get what they want. Push them over the top and never let them anything(food is not one of the things you can't give them)!!

, After they learn you have to make sure that they will keep doing this. Some kids are different. One kind of kid is they learn easily and start doing what you say and then they start doing what they did before. Another type of kid is they take a long time to learn and in a week or so they do what they were doing before. If you have a kid that comes home with good grades they might just keep with what you say!

You don't have to go it alone! Enlist the help of friends and loved ones with the planning and preparations right from the beginning, and consider hiring outside help if needed.


Most houses of worship have people on staff who can give guidance in this process.
Funeral directors will also help, but will charge for their services.
For a very large memorial service, consider hiring an event planner to help run the show.;
, A memorial service can take many forms and be as formal or informal as you like. Carefully consider the personality and wishes of the deceased, and the preferences of other family members when making your decision. Pay particular attention to religious preference, as this is often the biggest factor in choosing the kind of service to conduct.


Traditional memorial services are usually more formal and somber in nature, and are frequently held in places of worship or funeral homes.
Celebration of life gatherings tend to be less formal, and focus less on grieving and more on celebrating the memory of the deceased. Gatherings of this type can be held almost anywhere.
Interment or sprinkling of ashes. If the deceased chose to be cremated, the memorial service is often held in conjunction with the interment or scattering of the ashes. The timing and location for this ceremony will depend on where the ashes will be placed.

, If the service is to be religious in nature, a house of worship is an ideal choice. Funeral homes and banquet halls also work well for formal memorial services.


Memorial services can also be held at the cemetery or crematorium, even after the interment has taken place.
Consider holding a celebration of life service at a favorite place of the deceased. This could include a restaurant, park, or even a bowling alley.
An ash sprinkling ceremony will take place outdoors, usually at a favorite place of the deceased. Many people choose to scatter ashes into the ocean or other body of water, or at a location with a beautiful view., Confer with the loved ones of the deceased to choose a day and time when everyone can attend. Remember to keep the needs of out-of-town guests in mind when making your choice. It is generally preferable to schedule the service on a weekend or in the evening to maximize the number of people who can intend.


If the service is to be held outdoors, consider planning for a time when good weather is likely to occur.
If the service will be held in a remote location, give people adequate time to make travel arrangements.

, For most indoor locations, reservations are a must. If you are planning to hold your service at a public park, you may also need reservations or a permit, depending on the size of the service.


You may also need to rent chairs, a podium, sound system, etc. These can all be reserved through a local event rental company.

, This should be done as soon as possible. You can send out at additional details later as they arise.


Personal phone calls are generally considered the most appropriate way to notify family members and close friends.
Place a notice in the obituary section of the local newspaper. If an obituary has not yet been published, you can do this at the same time.
Emails and social media are also good ways to get the word out about the service, and keep people updated of any changes.
Be sure to notify current and former coworkers of the deceased who might wish to attend.
Be prepared to provide lodging and transportation suggestions for out-of-town guests.

, In the case of formal memorial services, this is most often a religious leader or a funeral director. For less formal services where everyone is invited to speak and share stories, it is still advisable to choose a family member or friend to serve as the master of ceremonies.


If the officiant will be writing a eulogy, be sure that he or she has all of the information needed to make it personalized and meaningful, and don't be shy about asking to see a draft before it is delivered.
State very clearly to the officiant what you have in mind for the service, and be firm with any requests to include or leave out certain material, etc.
When choosing an emcee, look for a person who is energetic and good at drawing people out. Many mourners get shy at memorial services and have trouble speaking, but a good emcee will be encouraging and able to help people find their voice.
If you plan to ask guests to share stories, readings, etc., let them know ahead of time and give them time to prepare.

, It is common to read favorite poems, passages from religious texts, and even the writings of the deceased in a memorial service. Decide on the readings that you wish to include, and on who will read them, or invite guests to bring favorite passages with them to share at the ceremony.


Think of friends and loved ones you can specifically invite to deliver readings. Many people who might be too shy to volunteer would be happy to participate if asked.
It is a nice touch to include a copy of any prearranged readings in a handout for guests to follow along with, or to display them on a Power Point slide.

, Not all memorial services include music, but many do. The music should fit the type of service your are holding, but should also reflect the tastes of the deceased and the talents of friends and loved ones. Even a formal service can be concluded with a rousing rendition of the deceased's favorite jazz standard or rock anthem.


Enlist or hire any musicians you might need as soon as you have a date to work with.
Consider asking those closest to the deceased to make suggestions for music to play at the service.
Remember to arrange for any sound equipment you might need. A portable stereo will work, but depending on the size and nature of the event, this might be the time to go all out and rent some professional speakers or even hire a DJ.
Creating and distributing mix-CDs of the music played at the service can be a meaningful memento of the deceased.

, It is common to display photographs of the deceased before and during a memorial service. Consider bringing a large portrait of the deceased to display, or creating a photo display board. You may also ask guests to bring favorite photos of the deceased to share, or to send image files to include in a PowerPoint slide show.


Helping to create a memorial slide show or video is a great way for friends and family members feel included.

, If something is preferred in lieu of flowers, such as making contributions to a favored charity or memorial fund, make sure to include this information when announcing the memorial service to guests.

, Most memorial service programs include a photo and biographical information about the deceased, and information about the service. Many also include inspirational quotes, the text of any shared readings, information about surviving relatives, etc. You can find free templates on-line to create and print your own program at home, or you can have them done up professionally.

, You might also encourage people to include phone numbers or other contact information so that relatives who have lost touch can reconnect.

, The best memorial services really capture the spirit and personality of the deceased. If the deceased was known for wearing zany ties or Hawaiian shirts, encourage guests to do the same. If the deceased was a chocolate fiend, provide personalized candy favors for the guests. Use your imagination, the possibilities are endless!

, Light refreshments should be provided at the memorial service even if an off-site reception will also be taking place. Refreshments might include coffee, cookies and juice, or something more elaborate. Having refreshments on hand will encourage people to linger and talk, and continue remembering the deceased in a more relaxed setting.

, A post-memorial reception can take many forms, from a potluck at the home of a nearby relative, to a raucous after-party at the favorite bar of the deceased.

, The reception should take place fairly near the location of the memorial service. Make any necessary reservations ahead of time, and prepare maps or clear directions to the reception site to distribute to guests at the memorial service.

, If the reception will be a potluck, be sure to notify guests ahead of time and try to coordinate dishes. Hiring a caterer for the reception is another option that is often less stressful on the family of the deceased.

, If at all possible, delegate this task to a friend or associate who will not mind missing the memorial service to ensure that the refreshments are in place and kept stocked, and that the reception venue is in order.

, Allow for at least a half an hour between the end of the memorial service and the beginning of the reception to allow people time to rest, freshen up, and change clothes if they would like.


If the reception will be an adults-only event, consider helping to arrange childcare for any parents who would like to attend.

Educate the kids about the importance of water.,
Depending on the children's age level, teach children to recognize when their body needs water.,
Include water as a regular drink at home.,
Include water as a regular drink at home.,
Minimize the amount of juice you buy.,
Make water tastier.,
Pack foods that are high in water content for snacks and lunches at school.,
Give kids fun water bottles for school.,
Make sure that your kids do not go overboard.",How to Encourage Kids to Stay Hydrated," Teach children how water affects the body and brain. Don't forget to teach how water can affect mood and thinking as well.


Look for simple diagrams of how water works in the human body. Find cartoons or fun illustrations that have been specifically made for kids. Show these to your kids to help make a stronger visual impact of the effects of water and not having enough water.;
, Tell them to do the following:


Check for dry mucous membranes (nose and mouth).
Check their urine. This should be clear in colour and not dark yellow.
Are they constipated? That could be a sign of lack of water intake as well.

, When the kids are home in the morning or evening, encourage them to drink a glass of water every hour (up to a total of 7-8 cups a day) . Join them, so they can watch you participating in this regularly too. Each person has a preference. Some like water warm, tap or cold and filtered. Find the one your kids likes and make sure they have access to it. It is always a good idea to have cups with the kids' names on them, so that they are not getting a new glass every time. Who wants to wash that many dishes all day? They sure won't!

It is always a good idea to have cups with the kids' names on them, so that they are not getting a new glass every time. Who wants to wash that many dishes all day? They sure won't!

, This is completely within your control. If you do buy juices, dilute with water; this will have minimal change to flavour, especially the more that it is done.

, Some schools only allow children to bring water. Kids may not drink the water because they consider that it is boring and tastes bad. To get around this, put fruit slices in a pitcher, such as apples, pears, oranges or lemons, then add water and allow it to ""marinate"" overnight. In the morning, add it to their water bottles.


The fruit/vegetable flavor in the water gives the kids the impression that they are not just drinking plain water.
Some great combinations to try include apple and cinnamon, blueberries, mint and cucumber and lemon. Try it you will be surprised how they react. Maybe they can come up with a combination they like too, in which case, it's their own ""buy-in"" and they'll keep on making it.

, Examples of suitable high-water content foods include: watermelon, tomatoes, celery, lettuce, and so forth. (Check online for more ideas.) Through such high water content foods, kids obtain a little more hydration via their diet.

, Have them choose the bottles so that they like the designs. Encourage them to fill the bottles each morning to take to school and to refill once at school.

, Becoming obsessed about drinking too much water, can in turn cause problems as well. There is always a balance which needs to be stressed."

Remain calm.,
Get all of the information.,
Consider at-home consequences.,
Know your child’s rights.,
Talk to a lawyer.,
Attend the expulsion hearing.,
Decide if you are going to appeal the decision.,
Explore your next steps for education.,
Follow through with the readmission plan.,
Work on problem behaviors at home.,
Get therapy for your child.,
Consider residential treatment.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Deal With Your Child Being Expelled From School," Whether you’ve just gotten the news or are about to attend a meeting, remaining calm will help you problem-solve and approach the situation with a clear head. You might instantly take your child’s side or feel like their expulsion is a reflection of you. If you get a phone call or have a meeting with the school, do your best to be calm throughout.If you notice you’re feeling upset and need to calm, take some deep breaths. Breathe from your diaphragm and lengthen each of your breaths until you feel more calm and centered.;
, Start by asking both your child and the school district about what happened. Ask who was involved, what happened, and the timeline of events. Get as much information as you can from as many perspectives as possible. Don't be afraid to ask for a meeting or call back later for more information. This is your child's future.It’s normal for stories to not entirely match up and for blame to be placed, but get as clear of a picture as you can.
Be willing to hear both sides without judgment or interruption. There’s probably at least hints of truth in all stories.

, The school deals with your child as a student, but you deal with them as a parent. While an expulsion is a large academic consequence, you may wish to have consequences for your child’s behavior at home, too. Think about what’s appropriate for your child’s behavior.An expulsion shouldn’t be a holiday for your child. You may want to take away their privileges (like a phone or television) or tighten the reigns on their freedoms with friends.

, You and your child have the right to know why they are being expelled and what they are accused of. You also have the right to know the evidence collected. Both you and your child have the right to be heard.If the expulsion is more than 10 school days, a formal due process must occur with the school board.
At the hearing, your child has the right to tell their side of the story. They also have the right to have the decision made by someone who is impartial and not invested in the outcome., You may seek legal counsel regarding your child’s expulsion. A lawyer can familiarize you and your child with your rights and recommend some directions to take. The lawyer can come with you and advise you and your child during the school board hearing.Having an attorney present at the school board meeting can help you formulate questions and seek fair treatment.

, Your child’s school should give you a date, time, and place of the hearing. You may wish to learn about the process of the hearing and what will happen during it, including who will speak and what will be discussed. You can bring a letter or plan to speak during the hearing.You should be able to review the school records before the hearing.

, You always have the right to appeal. However, appeals are very rarely successful. Make sure you have a very solid reason why you think this is a misunderstanding or an overstep. Otherwise, dragging out the process can be grueling and not lead to anything beneficial.


An appeal would happen at the child’s expulsion hearing or shortly after.

, If your child is expelled and not welcome to return to the same school, you will need to come up with some options for their education. The school district should give you some suggestions on what to do next, but you can also create a plan on your own. Your options include going to a different public school, attending an alternative school, attending a private school, or homeschooling.Private schools might be boarding schools or day schools. This might include military schools, religious schools, or therapeutic schools.Homeschooling can help kids who are having social problems. If your child got mixed in with a questionable crowd, homeschooling can be a good option. Your child can even complete on-line schooling.

, Some schools allow for re-entry after a child has completed steps to readmission. This might include attending anger management or behavior therapy, substance abuse treatment, or completing community service. Someone from the school board may check up on the progress of the re-entry plan every three months.Once the re-entry plan has been completed, your child may go before the board once again. They board will vote whether your child will be re-admitted.

, This is where your role of parent comes in, especially if the problems at school are behavioral. Let your child know when their behavior is inappropriate and that they need to make some changes. It might be helpful for you to enforce some new rules in your home or enforce consequences in a different way if what you’ve been doing hasn’t been working.

Write down your house rules (along with consequences) and put them in a visible place.
For example, have your child tell you each time they spend with friends, where they are going, and who they will be with. If plans change, have them call you on their phone. If they don’t do these things, then you will ground them or take away their computer privileges.

, Your child’s extreme behavior might be a wake-up call for you that they need help or intervention. Therapy can help your child build skills and create positive behaviors. Your child might learn mindfulness skills which can help them make better decisions and cope with stress in more effective ways.Therapy shouldn’t feel like a punishment to your child or a consequence for their bad behavior.

, Residential treatment is for children and teens who have behavioral or mental health issues that need more attention outside of traditional weekly therapy. Here, your child will get specialized medical and psychological treatment in a safe, structured environment. Treatment lasts from one to several months and often includes the parents and family.While residential treatment isn’t a long-term schooling solution for education, children can still get school credits while at residential treatment as they work toward improving their behavior.

, Your time and attention may be focused on your child during this time, but make sure you’re taking care of yourself, too. Have someone to talk to, like a partner, friend, or another parent who understands. Even if they can’t solve your problems, it can be helpful to talk about it and what you’re going through.Do things for yourself that make you feel supported and taken care of. Take a bath, go on a walk, write in a journal, or listen to calm music.

Plan your attack.,
Understand that you can’t keep everything.,
Decide how much you are able to keep beforehand.,
Start with the trash.,
Make piles.,
Select items that fit into your life and have meaning for you.,
Ask another person for an objective opinion.,
Take pictures of what you can’t keep.,
Talk to others and ask for help.,
Avoid regrets.,
Take breaks.",How to Deal with Sentimental Belongings of Deceased Loved Ones," Start your process by deciding if you are on a time crunch or if you can go slow. If you’re on a deadline, set milestones throughout the process to keep yourself on track. If you aren’t in any rush, take the process one step at a time. Don’t put too much stress on yourself, but don’t avoid the task, either.

Deciding to go through the home room by room is one good way to start the process. Or you could decide to go through the belongings based on items, such as books, textiles, chotskies, etc. Going in without a plan can be overwhelming and can lead to more stress and heartache that you simply don’t need right now.Include your family members in this process. They may want to take some things for themselves. They may even be willing to help you sort through the items.;
, As much as you want to hold onto every item that reminds you of the departed, doing so is impractical. Not only do you likely not have room in your own home to house the items of another, but not everything should necessarily be kept. Old newspapers, raggedy towels, and items that have seen much better days are those you may consider getting rid of.

Remind yourself that letting go of items isn’t disrespectful to your loved one. Material items are not what defined your relationship, it was the memories you had together., Take an evaluation of your own home and decide how much room you have for your loved one’s belongings before you begin sorting through their home.

Keeping more than you have room for could result in you needing a storage unit to have a place for everything, which defeats the purpose of keeping the items, as you won’t be able to see them. Be honest with yourself and then stick to what you decided.For example, maybe your mom left behind a large china collection that you really do not have space to store or display. You might pass some along to your siblings for their homes or donate to Goodwill.

, Throw away any items you know you aren’t keeping, particularly items that will mold or go bad. Toiletries and pantry products are usually ones to eliminate, as are items that are in bad condition. Unless you aren’t keeping these items, they should go in the trash as they probably aren’t suitable for anything else.To ensure you are ready to tackle this project, equip yourself with an adequate amount of trash bags and boxes. You may also recycle some items rather than throwing them away. If you have a huge amount of items to be trashed, consider renting a trash bin from your local trash collector to help with the process.

, After you throw away what you can’t keep, create two piles: what you are keeping and what you are donating. As the names imply, you will hold onto the items in the keep pile for yourself or for others, and donate or sell the items in the other pile. Once you make these definitive piles, do something with them; don’t allow them to stay in the space for too long because they will just create more clutter.

Make piles as you go through each room or sort through each item, do what you’re going to with the piles, and then tackle the rest. Don’t allow the piles to sit. , Even though your loved one would probably love it if you could take all their possession, it's doubtful that they'd want you to become a hoarder. Be selective with what you decide to keep for yourself.

For example, if your mom had some lovely paisley bed linens that match your guest bedroom, you might honor her by using them in that room.
If your dad had a vintage car that was his pride and joy, you might choose to keep it and use it for weekend outings or special occasions.

, If you're having difficulty deciding what to keep and what to give away, ask a friend or family member for their opinion. They may be able to offer a more objective, rational view.

For example, if you're torn over keeping your father's entire watch collection, a friend can help you choose one to keep while giving away the rest.

, You may love some items dearly, but they just don’t make sense to keep. Snap photographs of these pieces. Doing so allows you to hang onto them in some way, but without taking up room in your home.Just having the memory of these sentimental items might give you some peace of mind. Therefore, snap a photo of your dear aunt's beautiful porcelain cat collection before you donate or sell it. That way, you can always look back and remember it how it was.

, Letting go of sentimental items is difficult, and you’re going through one of the worst times in your life right now. If doing this project alone is too much for you, ask for help. Not only will this take some of the pressure off of you, but having someone work alongside of you may also keep you motivated and on track.Simply say to a sibling or partner, “I want to go through Dad’s things today, but I need some emotional support. Will you help me?”

, It’s easy and common to second guess yourself when deciding what to keep and what to get rid of. However, you’ll need to eliminate any regrets you may feel after. Beating yourself up for not keeping every item is pointless, and a feeling that you don’t need right now.Try to process your emotions and grief as much as you can before you start this process. When you're feeling emotional it's hard to make rational decisions.
Take as much time as you need to grieve before you begin. This will prevent you from keeping items you can't store or throwing away items you later wished you had kept.
If you find yourself becoming emotional while sorting, take a break, and start again later when you're calm.

, Rome wasn’t built in one day, and you won’t get through your loved one’s belongings in that amount of time, either. You’ll likely find moments that you’ll feel emotional and overwhelmed.

When this occurs, take a break, whether it’s for a few hours or a few days. Come back when you’re in a better state and you’ll likely find yourself more productive."

If you've only known the person for a short time, ask friends and family members for contributions. If you do not want to use the original photo, copy the pictures at the neatest quality you want.;
, Too many photographs may distract rather than enhance a pictorial.

, A wide variety of pre-matted frames are available for purchase. Some stores may be able to provide a framing service. Cardboard in a muted color is acceptable for a lower cost alternative. Keep in mind how this will be displayed as well. Will you need an art easel to hold a large frame?

, This will make frame selection easier. This is a good time to remember that less is more. A flashy frame is not appropriate here.

Find some comfort.",How to Cope when a Schoolmate Dies1," When you learn that a schoolmate has died, you may feel emotional and sad. That is okay. It is normal to feel sad and feel like crying. Alternately, you might feel angry, be in denial, be shocked, or feel nothing or be numb. All of these emotions are perfectly okay.Tears are common when something tragic happens, like the death of a schoolmate. Let it out and cry. You’ll probably feel better afterwards.You may experience some or all of these emotions as you work through the grieving process.;
, Consider talking to someone about what you are feeling. You can talk to your parents, a teacher, school counselor, or your friends.Consider seeing a professional counselor or grief counselor. They can help you work through confusing and distressing emotions.
Talking about the event and your feelings helps you heal and work through your grief.
For example, say, ""I am feeling very sad because John died"" or ""I'm scared about my own death because John died."" You can also say, ""I am confused about how I feel because my classmate died.""

, Having someone you know who is so close to your age die can be a frightening and confusing experience. Maybe you have not thought that young people could die, so you feel scared. This is okay. Maybe you want to question the concept of death or life. You may ask adults about the nature of death, what happens after death, or what happens to a physical body after death.It’s natural to feel scared and think about your own eventual death when someone dies. Talk about these feelings with your parents or teachers.
If you feel obsessed about your own death or become scared you are going to die, talk to an adult. If you feel uncomfortable talking to your parents, then talk to a teacher or school counselor.

, When you are dealing with traumatic events, try to find some comfort in things that make you happy and feel safe. You might spend time with those closest to you. Spending time with friends and family can help provide comfort when you are scared, sad, or grieving.

Do one room at a time.,
Set goals.,
Start with a small space.,
Set a timer.",How to Declutter when You Have Kids1," Toys and children's things seem to make their way into every corner of the house. To prevent yourself from feeling overwhelmed, choose one room at a time to declutter. If you're up for a challenge, sort through your child's bedroom or playroom first. Or if you'd like to start small, choose a room that happens to have some of your kids' things, like your bedroom or the bathroom.Be realistic with your goals. You're more likely to declutter the toys if you give yourself some time in between rooms for breaks and to donate the toys. This will keep them from building up in your garage or attic.;
, You might want to declutter your entire house, but that can be difficult if you have small kids running around. Think about what's most important for you to declutter and focus on making achievable goals, instead of goals that will just cause you stress and anxiety.


For example, instead of saying, ""I'll declutter the entire house while the kids are home in the morning,"" make a more reasonable goal like, ""I'll declutter the living room in the afternoon while the kids are napping.""

, If kid clutter is everywhere, you may not know where to even begin. Try decluttering a small space first so that you feel a sense of accomplishment and become familiar with sorting through things. For example, sort through a small closet or bedroom before moving on to a playroom.Decluttering a small space will also help you gain momentum with decluttering. This will give you motivation to keep going through the house.

, If you have younger kids, you might struggle to find the time to declutter. Try setting a timer for 15 or 30 minutes so you can get a quick declutter session in. This is also a good idea if you're having a hard time motivating yourself to begin the task. If you have older kids and can spend longer decluttering, write deadlines into the goals you set.For example, if your goal is to declutter the playroom and the garage, tell yourself that you'll need two hours for the playroom and three hours for the garage. Hold yourself to this deadline.

Talk about your loss.,
Reflect on your memories.,
Return to your usual routine.,
Seek closure.,
Know when to ask for help.",How to Cope when a Schoolmate Dies2," An important way to move on and heal is to talk about what happened. Talk about the loss of your classmate. It doesn't matter if you were close to the person or not. The death of someone you know is difficult. Talking about the person, your fears, or your feelings can help you start to process and heal.When you talk about it, you let more of it out. If the feelings stay inside, you may feel upset or like it's too much. Talking about it lets you get a little bit out each time, which eventually allows you to move on and heal.
For example, say something like, ""I am sad about Sally dying"" or ""I wish I had known Sally better before she died. That makes me sad.""

, When a schoolmate dies, think about any good memories you have of the person. Think about interactions you had with your schoolmate. If you didn’t know the person very well, think about what you did know about them, such as remembering them in class, at lunch, or out on the playground.Get together with other classmates to talk about the deceased schoolmate. You can talk about memories with each other.
You can say, ""I remember when I played with Jasmine on the playground. We had fun"" or ""I remember how Jasmine always was the first to answer a question in class.""

, It's important to get back to your normal day to day life. This includes going to school, participating in activities, and going out with friends. Sitting around and constantly thinking about what happened is not healthy. You need to remember the person who died, but continue on with your life.


This may be difficult at first. If you need to, start out slowly. Instead of trying to return to everything at once, return to one thing at a time as you move on and get back into your normal routine.

, If one of your classmates dies, you may want to say goodbye to them. Consider going to the wake or viewing, or go to the funeral. Some families may have a reception or dinner in honor of the student. Visit the gravesite after the classmate is buried and read them a letter you wrote.This can provide closure for you, help you grieve, and allow you to move on.
If you do not want to attend the funeral, then you might try setting up a memorial for your friend in your home. Find some pictures and keepsakes that remind you of your friend and place them on a table. Then, reflect on the good times you had with the person. You might even try talking to a picture of your friend and saying goodbye to him or her.

, You may find that no matter what you do you cannot get over what happened. If this happens to you, talk to your parents or school counselor about getting help. Consider going to see a professional grief counselor or therapist to help you talk about and process what happened.You might feel anxious or scared of dying. You may not want to get out of bed or go to school, or you might be unable to go to sleep. If you feel depressed, anxious, or otherwise unable to move on, talk to someone.
For example, tell someone, ""I need some help dealing with this grief"" or ""I'm not sure how to get over Bob dying. Can you help me?""

Encourage your child to talk.,
Respect your child's emotions.,
Listen to your child.,
Offer suggestions for dealing with emotions in a healthy way.,
Allow the child time to grieve.,
Be honest.,
Help the child understand death.,
Notice the warning signs.",How to Cope when a Schoolmate Dies3," When a schoolmate dies, let your child talk about their grief. Let your child control the conversation and explain things they way they understand them. Let them tell their story how they experienced it, and encourage them to talk about how they feel.For example, tell your child, ""I'm here to listen to whatever you have to say. Tell me what you are going through/thinking/feeling.""
Don’t interrupt or try to give advice. Instead, be a listener while they talk.
If the child has trouble talking about the event, suggest that they draw pictures or write a story about the schoolmate., No two children will react the same to the death of a classmate. Some kids will be sad and cry, some may get aggressive or angry, and other may withdraw. Some children will feel intense fear and feel anxiety or have panic about dying or loved ones dying. All of these reactions are perfectly normal.Some students may be distracted, their grades may slip, and they may have difficulties concentrating.
Be supportive of these emotions and help the child express them in healthy ways.
However, watch them to make sure their emotions don’t get out of control. If the child is being overly aggressive, fearful, sad, or withdrawn, talk to them or take them to see a professional.
For example, say, ""I understand you are hurting/this is scary/this is difficult, but acting out and being aggressive is not a good way to deal with this. Would you please tell me what happened?""

, It is important to give your child a chance to talk about his or her feelings. Let your child know that you are willing to listen whenever he or she wants to talk. Some things you can do to be a good listener for your child include:Removing distractions such as by shutting off the TV, putting away your phone, or closing your laptop.
Nodding and making neutral statements to show that you are listening. For example, you can say things like “yes,” “go on,” and “uh-huh.”
Asking probing questions to get your child to talk more. For example you might ask things like, “How does this make you feel?” or “Why do you think it is affecting you this way?”

, Your child may be having a hard time figuring out how to express the things he or she is feeling. One way that you can help is to suggest healthy ways for your child to express his or her feelings.


Try teaching your children how to identify and accept their emotions. For example, if your child is feeling angry, then you might help your child to notice that emotion and acknowledge it. Teach your child to say something like, “Right now I am feeling anger because of my classmate’s death. I have a right to feel anger, but I can choose to express it in healthy ways.”For a younger child, you might encourage him or her to draw pictures to represent how he or she is feeling. Try asking your child to draw a picture of how he or she feels and then discuss the picture with your child.

, You never want to see children or teens hurting. However, experiencing the death of a schoolmate, especially if the kid was close to the deceased child, can take time to process. No one deals with grief in the same way, so some children will grieve and move on faster than others.Don’t try to make the child or teen move on or get better before they are ready. Instead, let the child grieve at their own pace and work through their grief.
One of the most important things you can do is to be patient. Grieving takes time. Some children may grieve and process faster than others. Some may be delayed in their feelings and feel emotion later. Don’t try to force the child to get better faster than they are.

, You may feel you need to protect the child or teen by lying to them or not telling them the whole truth. Resist the urge to sugarcoat what happened to the deceased schoolmate to try and lessen the impact. Children can pick up when you are lying, and teens will find out what happened anyway. Be honest with the child about what happened.Some details may be omitted depending on the age of the child. For example, if the child died by suicide refrain from sharing that or the details on how they killed themselves. If the child died via murder, do not want to share all that the police found. However, helping them understand and deal with death can help them learn coping strategies for the future.
For example, tell your child, ""Heather died in car wreck last night"" or ""Heather died this morning.""
Try not to use euphemisms, like ""Heather went to a better place"" or ""Heather passed away."" Don't beat around the bush by saying things like, ""Heather is no longer with us."" Instead, be direct.

, The death of the child’s schoolmate may be their first exposure of death, or their first exposure to the death of a young person. They may have a lot of questions, such as “why” and “what happens when someone dies?” Try to be willing to talk about these issues with your child.Children may want to know about physical changes that happen to a dead body. They may also want to know what happens to a person after they die. Talk about these issues within any religious frameworks that you believe.
Help children understand that death is a normal part of life.
For example, say, ""Death will happen to everyone. It happens at different ages and suddenly. Most people will not know when they will die."" Another thing you can say is, ""Though it seems unfair, even young people die. It is not common, but tragedies like car accidents happen.""
Help the child cope with death by having them read books about death. Many books have been published that give information about death. They also help put death and grieving into terms children can understand., Try to be patient while the child grieves and heals, but also be aware of any warning signs so you can get help for your child if you think he or she needs it. Some things you can watch for include:Inability sleeping
Not eating or overeating
Withdrawing from family and friends
Severe academic problems or not wanting to go to school
Abnormal aggression
Apathy
Obsession with death

Discuss the event with the affected classes.,
Give the students positive ways to channel their grief.,
Be available to students.",How to Cope when a Schoolmate Dies4," When a schoolmate dies, a teacher, counselor, or administrator may want to first break the news to the deceased student’s class or classes. The students in the schoolmate’s class will feel the most impact from the death. Make sure to be direct, and use simple, straight-forward sentences when talking about the event.For example, tell the class, ""Our school has experienced a tragedy. Jake has died in a car accident."" Don't go around in circles or try to lessen the impact with metaphors or fluffy language.
Be prepared for questions about the event. Make sure the school staff has all the facts straight and is aware of what is going to be shared.
Let the parents know when you are going to talk to the classes. They may want to be present with their children.

, Help the students work through their grief by helping them channel their feelings into positive actions. This can help give the child or teen closure and help them come to a place where they can move on.For example, let the children release balloons, plant trees, collect money for a bench, or make a memory book for the deceased classmate’s family.
Organize a school activities that help the community in honor of the deceased schoolmate. Have a bake sale to raise money for charity and donate it in honor of the child.

, When a student dies, it affects the entire school. The students may not know they can be open with their feelings. Try to foster an environment of acceptance where students feel safe expressing their feelings and asking questions. Talk honestly about your feelings so your students may decide to open up about their own feelings and address their grief.Tell your students, ""If anyone would like to talk in a safe environment where you won't be judged, feel free to come talk to me.""
Be around for the students in case they need to talk. They may not feel safe talking to parents, so provide an open, safe environment for them to talk about their feelings, confusion, and questions. It will also be important to have counselors on hand to talk with parents and students. Depending on the situation, more counselors may need to be brought in to help the students, teachers, and parents to cope with the loss.

Get your kids involved.,
Consider what toys you want your kids to play with.,
Go through toys before big holidays or celebrations.,
Store and rotate the toys you keep.,
Sort through toys every few months.",How to Declutter when You Have Kids2," If your kids are old enough (at least around five), have them help you sort through their toys. Explain that you're only removing toys that they no longer play with and make it clear that the toys will go to other kids who will love and play with the toys. Be prepared to explain what you're doing so your kids don't get upset or think they're being punished. Getting your kids involved can actually make it easier to declutter your home. If your kids are very young and can't help or would be upset, declutter the toys when they're asleep or out of the house. Just don't remove anything that they're emotionally attached to.
For example, tell your kids, ""We're going to spend a few minutes sorting through toys you no longer play with. This way we can donate them to kids who need them and you'll have more space to play!""

, Whether you're purchasing or decluttering the toys your kids have, think about what kinds of toys you want for them. Would you like them to play with educational or imaginative toys? Should the toys be well-made and of high quality? Do they already have another version of the toy?Asking yourself these questions will help you decide what to keep and what to part with.

, Your kids probably get gifts from friends and relatives a few times a year. If these events are coming up, take the time before the event to declutter their toys. This will prevent toy buildup and may even make the kids appreciate their new toys more.For example, if Christmas is coming up, take the time to fill a few bags of unused toys to donate. Try to follow a one-in-one out rule when it comes to toys coming into your house.

, Once you've sorted through your kids' toys, divide them up. Place half of them in a storage space where your kids don't have access to them. Let them play with the half that you keep out. When your kids become tired or bored of playing with the toys, swap them out with the toys in storage.This will also keep the toys from piling up while they're not being played with. Your kids are more likely to play with their toys if they have space to play.

, Toys can quickly accumulate so be in the habit of decluttering kids' toys on a regular basis. Ask yourself if you've seen your kids playing with a particular toy at all within the last month or two. If you haven't, it may be time to donate or sell the toy.


Being in the habit of decluttering your house will get easier once you've been doing it for a while. Once you initially declutter the toys, you'll just need to maintain what your kids have and receive as gifts.

"
"
Choose what to get rid of.,
Decide what to do with the items you don't want.,
Know what to keep.,
Sort and store the kids' toys.,
Decide what to display and what to hide.",How to Declutter when You Have Kids3," Things you or your kids no longer need seem to stick around longer than they should. Look at the individual items in a room and ask yourself what you don't really need anymore. These are some things you should consider getting rid of:


Items that are broken
Clothes that no longer fit you or your kids
Things you don't have space for
Toys your kids no longer play with
Things you have extras of
Items that are dangerous to have around your kids

, Get out three boxes or bins. Label one bin ""Trash,"" one bin ""Store,"" and one bin ""Recycle/Donate."" As you sort through toys and items, place them in one of the boxes. Once a box fills, take it to the thrift store, organize it and find a place for it in your home, or take it to the dumpster.Keep the boxes somewhere handy so you can declutter whenever you need to.
You could also have bins for selling items or giving away to friends.

, You may find it easy to sort through the broken or unwanted items that are cluttering up your house, but have a harder time knowing what you should keep. Ask yourself if an item has sentimental value or if it's something you'd like to pass on to your children. You should also keep items that you use frequently.


Once you've decided to keep something, you need to organize and store it wisely. You should know where it is and be able to get to it easily.

, While it may be tempting to just throw your kids' toys into a large toy box, it may be hard to find specific toys since they're all mixed together. Teach your children to store their toys by sorting them into buckets, containers, or small bins.


For example, you could have several bins on a shelving unit. Put blocks in one bin, crayons in another, and musical toys in a different bin.

, It's probably not realistic to expect that your kids' belongings and toys are always in their rooms. Instead of finding their things strewn about, create a system for organizing the things that you don't mind leaving out and for things that you want to hide.For example, if you want to leave their books out, install shelving units or bookshelves so they can be stored in plain sight.
To hide toys, try storing them inside decorative boxes, furniture benches, or cabinet drawers.

Leave your final wishes in a letter.,
Make other arrangements.",How to Communicate Burial Preferences," There are two burial options for you - ground burial and mausoleum burial. With a ground burial, the body is placed in a casket and buried in the ground beneath typically six feet of dirt. A mausoleum burial entails being placed in a casket and then sealed in a wall, sometimes with other caskets.


In many cities, a mausoleum burial may be required if you live in a city that is below sea level, such as New Orleans.;
, Be sure to consider any religious customs that you and/or your family observes as well. It may be upsetting to your family if you do not take these customs into account.

For example, in Judaism cremation is forbidden and there are other specific burial rituals that must be observed.

, If you do not want a burial, there are other options for you to consider. Cremation is an option and many opt to have their ashes either housed in an urn for family members to keep or to have their ashes spread in a location that is important to them


Another option is donation to science. You can donate your body if you choose and often times they will be used by scientists or doctors in studying disease and/or medical school students practicing surgical technique to develop their craft.
You can also consider being an organ donor if you do not want to donate your entire body. This is a way to both contribute to science and medicine while allowing your family to give you the burial they may desire.

, If you have a friend who has already made their burial arrangements, have a talk with them about your options and what they chose. Make sure to ask them why they made the decisions they did, as you may have different motivations than them.


For instance, if they chose cremation because it is the most cost effective option, but finances are not a major concern for you, you may want to consider other options more in line with your own wishes and lifestyle.
This may be a difficult topic to broach, but you can start it by saying something like “I know that you have already made your arrangements for how you want to be buried, and I was wondering if you could give me some advice?”

, Though your friends will be able to help you in the beginning stages of your information gathering process, a professional, who is often times a funeral director, will tend to offer even greater insights. They will be able to provide you information about burial options, vaults, costs, and funeral processions. They will likely also bring up other arrangements that you may not have thought of, like flowers.


Don’t be pressured into making any decisions that you are uncomfortable with. Though there are many funeral directors who will have your best interests at heart, there are certainly some who are more concerned about making money. If you make decisions that feel right to you, you can have peace about your burial arrangements.

, The average burial can cost anywhere from $4,000 - $6,000, so you must consider this before making any final decisions. Take some time to look at your finances and both consider what you can afford as well as what you are comfortable spending.


Remember, donating your body to science is free.
Cremation is typically cheaper than a burial, ranging from $2000 - $4000.Mausoleum burial will remove the requirement for purchasing a vault, making it cheaper than a ground burial.
You might consider getting some life insurance to help cover your costs. Some plans even allow you to borrow against them while you are still alive.
Make sure that you let your family know how to access these accounts after you die and educate your family about your finances (debts, savings accounts, life insurance policies, estate plans, etc.). A financial planner or lawyer can help with these matters.

, In addition to thinking about how you would like your body to be handled after death, and if you should choose to be buried, you must also consider where you want to be buried. If your family has a family plot somewhere, you may want to be buried there. Or perhaps you would like to purchase a plot for your family to be buried in to alleviate future costs for them.


If you want your body taken out of state, you may need a permit.If you are married, consider purchasing a joint plot.

, After considering all of the options, you should begin thinking about your funeral. You may want to include your spouse and/or family in the planning process as well. This will help to ensure that you don't plan something that goes against their wishes by accident. This will also allow your family to have the time to grieve without having to worry about the details. Consider the kind of funeral procession you would like to have as your family tells you goodbye.


One thing to consider is the music you’d like at your funeral. If there is a certain song or singer you’d like, make a note of that.
Many also have made requests that those who attend their funeral wear a certain color other than the traditional all black garb, like wearing all white or even red.
Consider if you would like a certain preacher to preside over or officiate your funeral.
Also consider if you would like your funeral to be at a church or at the funeral home.

, Find a time that works well for your loved ones to sit down and have an informal, yet serious talk about your decisions. Thought this may be unexpected for them, it will prevent a lot of confusion and worry in the future.


You may want to call your family together to have dinner. You can begin the conversation by saying something like, “I’ve always taught you all the importance of planning for the future, no matter how distant that future may be. I wanted to let you know that I’ve taken my own advice by putting together some burial and funeral plans for myself after talking to some of my friends who have done the same. I wanted to let you all know these plans so that you don’t have to fret over the details when my time does come.”
Talk to them in a place that is quiet and private, like your family home.

, Once you begin discussing this topic with your family, they will likely immediately begin worrying about your health. You should be as honest as possible with them about your health condition so they are not blindsided in the future. If your doctor has told you that you will likely not live beyond a certain point, you should be honest with them.However, you may be in perfect health and simply pre-planning before it begins deteriorating. Assure your family that you are okay but want to make the proper plans for the future. You may want to say something like, “My doctor tells me that I’m as healthy as a horse, and I feel great, but you simply never know what is going to happen. This is my way of securing your future so you don’t have to worry about planning when you are needing to grieve.”

, After all of the research and decision making that you have been doing, communicate to them your wishes for burial. Assure them that you will draft these decisions in a document and you will tell them where the document will be kept in the event that something does happen to you.


If they have questions about why you choose a certain method or place, answer them to the best of your ability. This is a sensitive topic and any clarity that you can provide will be helpful to your love ones.
If they have any suggestions, keep them in mind, but at the end of the day, make the decision that seems best to you.

, If you are considering purchasing burial insurance, let your family know. Your family will need to know this information when it comes time to bury you and you don’t want them to miss out on utilizing the money you have been setting aside for this occasion. Include this information in any funeral and burial documentation that you draft.


You can say something like “In addition to making these plans, I’ve also began paying for the arrangements so that you all don’t have to deal with that burden, either. Funerals can be very expensive and I don’t want my death to hit you in the pockets.”

, This conversation may be highly upsetting, intense, or uncomfortable for your family members. However, there will come a time when we all will have to face the death of a loved one, whether untimely or in their old age. Remind them of this to put things in perspective and let them know that these arrangements are more for them than they are for you.


Reassure them. You may want to say something like “Even though I believe that I have a lot of time left on this Earth, I wanted to do all that is possible now to avoid the stress for either of us later. I don’t want to make these decisions when my health is failing and I certainly don’t want you to have to make them after I am gone. Death can cause a lot of confusion in families and I don’t want any of you to have to deal with that.”

, After you have done the proper research and had a discussion with your family, it is time to begin the documentation process by choosing a funeral home. Take some time to choose the right funeral home for you and begin working with the funeral director there to plan your burial and funeral.

, After making your decisions with the funeral home, begin the documentation process with the funeral director. They will typically keep a copy of your requests on file. If you choose to purchase burial insurance or prepay for your funeral through the funeral home, they will keep these records for you, as well. However, you can record all of your requests in as much detail as possible in a letter that your family can keep.

, This will cover most if not all of your funeral and burial expenses in the event of your death, but you may have needed to make a certain number of payments beforehand. Another method of coverage is to just prepay for your funeral and burial costs, so that you can secure a set price beforehand. Sometimes, funeral directors can sell this to you directly., Though the funeral home may have a copy of your requests, make sure that you have a similar document for your family. Keep the letter/document in a safe place in your home and make sure your family knows where the letter is.


If you keep it in a safe, make sure your family knows the combination or has a key.

, Upon your death, there will be things to settle beyond your burial wishes. Consider having a will drafted up as well to handle the allocation of any assets or finances that you might have. Other issues, like power of attorney, should be considered as well as your medical wishes, such as if you would want to be resuscitated or not. These decisions should be documented by an attorney or else they may not be considered as legitimate after your death.


One of the major issues that families fight over after a death is money. Though you cannot prevent such fights, you can eliminate confusion over who should get what. Do what you think is fair and consider talking to your spouse about it if you are married.

Choose the appropriate time to talk.,
Offer your sympathies.,
State a specific offer of help.,
Accept their refusal graciously.,
Avoid touchy subjects.",How to Comfort Someone Who Lost a Loved One1," In all of your interactions, make sure that bereaved person is in the proper mindset to have a discussion. They may be particularly upset or dealing with another critical issue. Ask if it is a good time to talk before going on. It also usually a good idea to talk with them one-on-one, when possible.


People can be particularly touchy about receiving gifts, even after a funeral, so approaching them when they are alone will maximize the odds of them accepting your offer of help.
At the same time, don't let waiting for the ""perfect"" time become an excuse for not reaching out to this person. There may never be a ""good"" time to talk, but you should be able to identify that some times are better than others. For instance, when they are in the middle of talking with the funeral director or arguing with their child, it's probably best to wait.;
, As soon as you learn of the death, try to reach out quickly to the person you know. You can send an email, but it is really best if you make a phone call or go to see them in person. You don’t have to say too much in this first conversation, just a quick, “I’m so sorry,” followed by a positive comment about the deceased person is usually best. You can also promise to get a hold of them again shortly to check in.It's important that your words are sincere and genuinely sympathetic. If you don't know what to say, it's okay to say something like ""I wish I knew what to say. I just want you to know I'm here for you.""
If the person who you are talking to doesn’t know you personally, make sure to offer a quick introduction letting them know how you knew the deceased. Otherwise, they may not feel comfortable talking with you. You might say, “I’m Michael Smith and I worked with Noah in the lab at NYU.”
If the bereaved seems almost rude or is really hasty with you, don’t take it personally. It is likely that they are overwhelmed and are not behaving as they usually do.
There are some things you should avoid saying. It’s generally not a good idea to talk about “moving on” in this initial conversation. You should also avoid platitudes like ""He's in a better place,"" ""It was her time,"" ""Be strong,"" ""I know exactly what you're going through,"" ""There's a reason for everything.""The grieving person likely doesn’t want to hear it and your words will likely not be appreciated. Instead, keep it short and simple and let them know you are there to support them., In your next conversation, it’s a good idea to follow through on your first offer of assistance. Try to be as specific as you can. This will help them to see how you can actually help and it will make it more doable on your end. Choose a certain activity to assist with and give some thought as to how much time it will take.For example, if only have a limited amount of time, you could offer to pick-up the extra flowers from the funeral and donate them to a hospital or other charity.
Many people will make a general offer of assistance and say something like, ""Call if you need me,"" putting it on the grieving person to ask for help. But the grieving person may be hesitant to ask for anything or be a burden on others. Instead of putting the responsibility on the grieving person, come forward with a specific offer, like ""I'd like to help by bringing you dinner tomorrow so you don't have to worry about cooking. Is that alright?""

, If you offer assistance and they turn you down, it is probably best to leave it alone or try again at another date. Whatever you do, don’t take it personally. There is a good possibility that the bereaved is overwhelmed with offers and are uncertain as to how to sort everything out.


You might say, “I understand your hesitation. How about we talk again next week?”

, During your conversations, try to weigh the degree to which any efforts at humor would be accepted. Basically, don’t joke around unless you know the person very well. And, it is a good idea to not discuss the cause of death, unless you know the person very well too. Otherwise, they may see you as a gossip-hunter and not a sincere person.

Call or email often.,
Offer to stay with them.,
Give them the chance to talk about the past.,
Follow the lead of the bereaved person.,
Offer silent comfort.,
Be available for formal remembrance activities.,
Offer your presence at a support group.",How to Comfort Someone Who Lost a Loved One2," In the long-term, try to stay in touch on a regular basis. You want to be there for them in the immediate period of grief, but also as they face difficulties moving forward. Look over your schedule and try to determine a few times a week that are most convenient for you to make a quick phone call or send a fast email.It is a particularly good idea to check in with the bereaved over any holidays as these can be times of loneliness and negative feelings following a death.
Try to walk a fine line between being there for the bereaved person and pestering them. And, some people simply wish to mourn without interacting with too many other people. Try to find out about their needs rather than imposing yourself on them. At the end of one conversation, you might get an idea for their wishes by saying, “I was thinking about calling you next week to see how everything is going then, will that be okay?”

, Some people suffer from physical loneliness following the death of a loved one. They simply miss having someone else around, who they trust, in their home. If you think this might be the case, you can offer to stay a few nights over at their place, especially until the funeral arrangements are made.Make this offer more enticing by offering to do something that they enjoy, such as spending an evening knitting or watching an action movie.

, Let them know that you are comfortable discussing the life and death of the deceased person. You can start by referring to the deceased by their name and then seeing if the bereaved person will follow suit. You can also talk about certain memories that you have and see if they will join in.You might say, “Remember how Samantha loved this movie so much? I always liked watching it with her.”

, It is quite possible that they will not want to discuss the deceased person with you. Instead, they may want to talk about more trivial matters, such as what movies you’ve seen recently. If the bereaved person tries to change the direction of the conversation or simply says, “I don’t want to discuss this right now,” then follow their wishes and move on to something else or end the conversation at that point.

, You don’t have to talk to provide comfort. It may be a good idea to simply sit next to the person or offer them a hug. You could also give them tissues if they are crying. Or, if you are comfortable with this, you could hold their hand or arm. This lets them know that you are there for them without being overbearing.

, Depending on the bereaved, they may want to do something beyond the funeral to remember the deceased. As time goes on, let them know that you are there to help and will attend as well. You can also offer suggestions, such as buying a brick from the deceased’s alma mater or donating to a particular cause., If you notice that the bereaved is not coping well with their loss, then you might suggest that they attend a bereavement support group. You can find a group in your area by searching online. Funeral homes or hospitals can often suggest groups as well. Make sure to offer to attend the group with the bereaved person, or they might take offense to your suggestion.This is a very touchy subject, so it is important to proceed carefully or you could offend the bereaved person. You might say, “I’ve heard about groups in the area that meet to talk about loved ones who have passed away. I don’t know if it is your type of thing, but I would be happy to go with you, if you’d like.”

Serve as a conduit for information.,
Help with the funeral services.,
Offer to cook and clean for the household.,
Investigate how to help financially.",How to Comfort Someone Who Lost a Loved One3," After the death there is a good possibility that the bereaved will be overwhelmed by people approaching them wanting information. You could offer to post details on social media and to monitor their accounts. You could also reach out to any insurance people ASAP.


Part of this task could also involve keeping track of any necessary paperwork, such as death notices. These documents will often be required by credit card and utility companies if accounts need to be closed.
You could also organize a phone chain if the deceased was well-known and there are a large number of people to be contacted all at once.

, This is a huge area to cover, so there are a variety of ways that you can help. You could sit-in on meetings with the funeral home. This might involve discussing the finances of a funeral or the deceased’s particular requests. You could help to write or publish the obituary. You could write thank-you notes or arrange for donations to be funneled to certain charities.


On the day of the funeral itself, you could be of assistance by acting as an usher or assisting the bereaved person in getting ready. You could also act as a liaison between the bereaved and the funeral director.

, Many people who are bereaved simply don’t have the time, or the desire, to attend to basic chores around the home. Use your cooking talents to whip up a few quick meals, especially anything that could be frozen for later use. Bring over some cleaning items and do a fast clean over the house, paying particular attention to the high-traffic areas. Make sure that you have the bereaved’s permission, of course.

, If the deceased passed without leaving enough funds to cover their expenses, the bereaved person may bear the burden of figuring out how to pay for a funeral. See if you can help by organizing some sort of fundraising drive either online or in person. There are websites, such as GoFundMe, which are specifically designed for these types of purposes.

You may not be able to do all of them for this person, such as talking to a funeral home director or providing a place to stay for visiting family, but any help you can manage will lighten the load.

, Take him or her to see a movie, pack a picnic, or do something else together that could be enjoyable. It doesn't need to be anything expensive or elaborate; the gesture and the company count the most.

, It's true that your friend or loved one may need concentrated support right after the death, but grief requires a lot of time and effort to process. If you want to provide comfort to the best of your abilities, understand that it may take months or even years to deal with the loss. Offer support at the beginning, but keep him or her in mind later as well. Many people's support will fall off after a while. If you truly want to help, be sensitive to the needs and the pain for as long as it takes., Avoid presuming that you know what will make him or her feel better. They may know of specific things you can do to be supportive and there's nothing wrong with asking. It shows your willingness to stand by his or her side while through the journey of grieving a lost sibling.For example, you can say ""I'm so sorry for your loss. Is there anything I can do to help you right now?""

, Let him or her know that you are there if he or she needs someone to speak with. Talking about feelings can help process the death of a sibling. Be a sympathetic ear, to the extent that you can, if he or she needs to express the painful set of emotions.


He or she may want to talk about his or her relationship with the sibling while still alive. This can be a good way to memorialize the sibling.
Avoid interjecting too much of your own feelings and experiences. You may have had a similar loss, but be mindful of being a burden with your own past. Your friend may need emotional space.

, Being upfront will show that you care and you are not afraid to discuss the situation.You don't need to go into a lot of detail, especially if she hasn't offered the information freely, but by validating the event you can show her your willingness to engage with her in this difficult time.


For example, you can say ""I heard about the loss of your sibling. I'm so sorry.""

, Losing a sibling can be a powerful experience. A response of intense sadness and grief is often totally appropriate. Helping him or her understand that a strong emotional reaction is both ""normal"" and ""understandable"" is a good way of showing support.For example, you can say ""It's okay for you to be sad right now. I understand. I would feel the same way.""
You can also tell him or her that it's understandable if they have specific painful feelings related to being siblings (like guilt). These emotions are understandable to experience, even if they are ultimately misguided.

, Unfortunately, sometimes the loss of a sibling can be overshadowed by the loss of a child. Parents can sometimes ""take the spotlight"" in the aftermath of these events. Surviving siblings are often referred to as ""forgotten grievers.""If you think your friend or loved one may be getting overlooked, talk to other siblings, parents, or friends about providing support.


For example, you can say ""I'm worried about . I think is taking the loss really hard and needs support.""
Be mindful of other people's suffering. Avoid bringing this up to suffering family members if you're an outsider to the family. Talking to her other close friends may be a safer bet.

, Grief is normal, but sometimes this kind of loss can result in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, if the loss involved trauma.If he or she appears to be having a really difficult time coping with the loss, suggest that it could be helpful to speak with a professional mental health worker.


For example, you can say ""You must have been really close to your sibling. Have you thought about talking to a professional who can help you understand what you're going through?""

, In an effort to comfort someone without really knowing how, you may reach for the most familiar thing to say. However well-intentioned, offering up ""stock"" or ""stereotypical"" platitudes can simply make her feel worse. Rather than comforting, these statements can gloss over the pain of the moment and try to usher in a level of acceptance that isn't appropriate. For example, here are some phrases you probably want to avoid:


""You'll feel better soon.""
""Time heals all wounds.""
""At least you still have your other family members.""
""Everything happens for a reason.""

, There are five different stages of grief that people go through following this kind of loss.Memorize these steps so that you can figure out where your friend is at in the process and try to help with each specific step. Remember that people are different and some do not go through the stages in order and can revisit past stages before reaching acceptance.


Denial is first. Denial of the reality of the loss is a normal reaction. It may seem like he or she doesn't realize the death of her sibling. It may not have set in yet.
Anger comes next. Once the reality of the loss does set in, it's normal to experience anger over the loss. He or she may be angry at the sibling, at herself, or at someone else.
Bargaining is third. This shows up as a desire to change the situation, such as wishing that he or she had done something differently.
Depression is the fourth step. This is the stage where people mourn the loss and bid the person farewell. It's an essential step in the process of grieving.
Acceptance is the final stage. After all of the stages of resistance to loss, acceptance is the stage where people finally come to terms. It's not happiness, but it is calm compared to the stages before it.

, The grief of losing a loved one is bad enough, but losing a sibling often creates specific painful responses. For example, someone may feel bad about how he or she treated her sibling in the past. A person may feel ""survivor's guilt"" over being left alive. When talking to your friend or loved one and doing things for him or her, be aware of these difficult issues associated with the loss of a sibling. If you notice that he or she is feeling these things, try to reassure him or her that it was not his or her fault., Grief does not always have a timeline and time does not necessarily heal all wounds.You can expect him or her to get better as time passes, but they may never make a full recovery. People respond differently to loss. Avoid pushing someone to move on. Allow the person to grieve and recover at his or her own pace. If you feel yourself getting impatient, it's better to back off and let someone else offer support than to pass those feelings on to her.

, It's perfectly okay for him or her to spend some time alone. He or she may want to dedicate time and energy to thinking about his or her sibling and processing all of the emotions that come up. If your friend or loved one says that he or she needs space, try to be understanding. Tell him or her that you're here if he or she does need someone to talk to or be around."

You can create the card using whatever supplies you wish, but some basics include: a nice piece of card stock that you can fold in half to make your card; an envelope; decorations for your card; paints, markers, pencils, or whatever you want to use to write on the card with, and glue to glue the decorations on.


Card stock can typically be purchased at home office supply stores or craft stores.
Consider purchasing a piece of color card stock. You don’t have to purchase a plain white piece of card stock. Instead, you could purchase a nice shade of pale blue or purple, for example.
If you decide to use a piece of color card stock, you might then glue a piece of tissue paper in a soft, complimentary color to the front. White is a safe choice, if you are having a hard time deciding.;
, Before you start gluing and drawing or writing, decide how you want to decorate the card. If you have purchased decorations, such as paper flowers, lay them out on the front of the card before gluing so you can see what you want it to look like.


If you plan to write something on the front of the card, practice writing it in neat handwriting before you do it on the card. Make sure that you write it large enough that it will fill the card, but small enough so that you can fit it how you want to on the front.
Some suggestions include: “Sharing Your Loss,"" “I’m Sorry for Your Loss,"" or “Thinking of You.""
It is not necessary to use words on the front of the card unless you want to. You can also just decorate the front of the card with flowers or perhaps a small piece of lace like fabric; however, keep the decorations simple and a bit muted. You don’t want to make the card look like you are celebrating a party.

, If you don’t have any nice decorations you’d like to add, consider finding a nice picture to paste to the front. For example, of a nice landscape, or of some pretty flowers.

, This is optional, but if you have purchased card stock that will be difficult to write on because it is textured, for example, you can also fold a normal piece of printer paper in half, and glue it to the inside of the card.


This will provide you with a smooth surface to write on, and will also allow you to try again if you make a mistake. If this happens, simply pull out the sheet of paper and start again with a new one.
Alternatively, write your sympathy note before gluing it inside the card, but make sure it will line up with the edge of the card properly.

, This will give you an opportunity to work out exactly how you want the message to sound, and will give you a chance to work out any kinks.


Take your time writing with this part. You want your message to be thoughtful and sincere. What you write here will depend on how close you are with the person receiving the card, as well as how well you knew the deceased.
If you are more familiar, you may have more detail in your message. If you are less familiar, the contents of the card will be more formal.

, Begin with “Dear…” and write the name of the recipient.


If you are not on a first name basis with the recipient, write “Mr.”, “Ms.”, or “Mrs.” and the last name.

, If you have a close relationship with the recipient, you can write a more personal message. Be sincere. Consider mentioning a good memory you have of the deceased.


Explain that you are very sorry for the loss of the deceased, and don’t be afraid to call the deceased person by name.
If you feel comfortable doing so, and can follow through, offer to support the recipient in any way you can. For example, “I would be happy to run any errands you might need during this difficult time.”
Avoid cliches. Don’t say something like, “They are in a better place.” Not only has this been said over and over, and though it may or may not be true, most people don’t really want to hear it. At this moment, they would probably prefer the deceased was still alive.
Make it personal. It can sometimes be hard to find the right words, but avoid just copying something from a store bought card, or something you find on the internet. The recipient will be able to tell that you didn’t come up with it on your own, especially if they know you well.
Do not mention the cause of death in the note. The recipient knows this, and doesn’t need or want to be reminded of it.

, If you are not particularly close with the recipient and/or did not know the deceased, you will likely need to write a more formal message; however, it should still be sincere. These five suggestions will help you provide comfort to the the grieving person:


Acknowledge their loss. You can say something like, “I recently learned of the death of ________.” You can also use the word “passing” instead of “death."" However, using the stronger word demonstrates that you are open to conversation about the deceased.Show them that you are concerned.You could say, for example, “I can’t imagine the pain your are feeling right now” or “I’m so sorry you are going through this.""Include a genuine statement. This will help show the recipient that you didn’t just copy it from a store-bought card. For example, you could say, “I am not really sure what to say, but I hope you know that you are in my thoughts.”Alternatively, you could also say, “I know that these words do not heal the pain you are feeling, but I hope it helps to know that you are cared for.”
Offer support.If you know that they have children, you could offer to take care of them for a few hours while funeral arrangements are being made.If they don’t have children, you could say something like, “I would like to bring you a homemade meal; please let me know when I can drop something off for you.” Make sure you can deliver on what you offer, though. If the recipient does take you up on your offer, it will leave both of you feeling sad if you have to turn them down.
Ask them how they are feeling.This will invite them to get in touch with you, if they need someone to talk to. For example, “Are you doing alright? Here is my number, if you want to chat.”
Avoid stating how you think they feel, as you don’t know really. For example, don’t say, “I know you’re feeling very sad, and we can talk if you want to.” Everyone grieves differently, and if they are still in shock over the death, they may not be feeling much of anything at the moment.

, Now that you have planned out the card, you should rewrite it carefully inside the card. Take your time, and write slowly.


Use your best handwriting. You want to the recipient to be able to read your note easily.
Use a high quality pen, and make sure it has enough ink before starting. You don’t want it to quit halfway through. You should also stick to more traditional color ink, such as blue or black.
Sign the card. You can finish the card with a salutation such as, “Love,” or “Sincerely,” and your name.

, If you plan to send your letter in the mail, neatly write the name and address of the recipient. Make sure to include your name and a return address either in the top left hand corner of the envelope or on the back flap.


If you don’t plan to mail the card, you should still place it in an envelope with the recipient’s name on it.
If you are sending it through the mail, make sure to put it in the mailbox promptly. If you put it off you may forget to mail it all together. If you are hand delivering the card, make sure you do it at a time that is convenient for the recipient. When hand delivering your card, don’t wait around expecting the recipient to hang out with you unless they ask you to.

, In Microsoft Word, open a blank document in “Publishing Layout View.” You can find this view on the bottom, left-hand side of the screen.


These instructions apply to Microsoft Word 2011 for Mac. Be aware that, although the instructions will be more or less the same across the various versions of the program, there may also be slight differences. For example, you might have to look for some buttons in a different location.

, In order to create a card that you can fold in half, you will need to have two pages open in your workspace.


You can add a page by clicking the drop down arrow next to the “Add” button in the top left corner of the page. Click on the arrow and a drop down box will appear. Select “New Page,"" and a second page will appear underneath the original blank document.
Be aware that in order to create a card that is foldable, you will need to print double sided on one piece of paper.
Alternatively, you could make the outside of the card in one go, print the card, and then open a new document to make the inside. The advantage here is that if you don’t own a duplex printer (that prints double sided automatically), you will have plenty of time to insert the card back in the printer properly before printing the second side.

, To make a traditional sympathy card, you will need to change the orientation of the page from “Portrait” to “Landscape.""


In the “Page Setup” dialogue, select “Landscape” and the orientation of the page should change. Meaning it will go from a tall (""Portrait"") document in your viewer to a wide (""Landscape"") document.

, The margins limit the area on the page where you can place text. For the purpose of your card, you can set the margins quite wide. However, you don’t want them to be too wide, or it may affect the way the card prints.


A safe bet is to set each margin (top, bottom, left, right) to .25"". This will still leave a tiny bit of white space, but in the case of the sympathy card, it will look neat and clean.
You can change the margins by going to the “Layout” tab, then typing in the margins that you want under the “Margins” heading.

, The outside of the card will be what the recipient first sees when taking the card out of the envelope. Remember to keep the card simple and muted. Try to choose soft colors, such as pastels.

, Underneath “Insert” select “Text Box,"" and a small box will appear in the middle of your document. Resize the box by hovering over the edge of the box and dragging the corners. Guide lines should appear if you drag the box to fill up half the page.


The text box should fill up the right half of the page, this is because you will be folding it in half once you print it out. Assuming you fold the card to look like a standard card, you will fold it left to right, making the right half of the page the front.
Inserting a text box will give you more control over the document.

, By default, the text box will not be filled with color. If you wish to add a background color to your card, you can do so by right clicking inside your box and selecting “Format Shape…” A dialogue will pop up giving you many options, the first of which is called “Fill."" In this tab, choose what kind of fill you would like (“Solid,"" “Gradient,"" “Picture or Texture,"" and “Pattern”), then choose the color you want from the drop down box next to “Color.""


You can also make the color more or less transparent by dragging the slider next to “Transparency.""

, Now that you have your background, you will want to send the text box all the way to the back. If you don’t, any images or text you add might disappear behind the box.


Do this by right clicking on your text box, mousing over “Arrange,"" and selecting “Send to Back” in the box that drops down.

, Now you can add text to the card if you want by adding another text box (make sure to change the fill to transparent so that it will match the background). You can write something such as, “I’m sorry for your loss,"" “Thinking of You,"" or “Condolences.""


If you choose to add words to the front of the card, keep it short and simple. You can use one of the suggestions above, or you can browse the commercial cards to find something suitable.

, Make the font large enough so that it will be easily readable by the recipient, and try to stick to an elegant font such as Lucida Calligraphy.


Don’t forget that you will be folding the card in half when you print it out, so you shouldn’t decorate the entire page. Instead, keep all of your decoration inside the background text box you created.

, Microsoft Word comes with a gallery of default images that you can use for your card. You can view this gallery by going to “Insert” and mousing over “Clip Art."" From the drop down box, select “Clip Art Gallery.""


Here you can search for images or browse through the categories.
Once you’ve chosen an image (keep it tasteful!), select the image and then “Insert."" The image will then appear in your document. You can resize the image, and place it where you want.

Inserting an image may resize your background text box. Don’t worry! Simply resize the text box to fill half the page again.


If Word won’t let you move the image to your desired position, try changing the “wrapping."" You can do this by right clicking the image, mousing over “Wrap Text…” and choosing “Through” from the drop down box. Now you should be able to place the image anywhere on the page.

, If you don’t like any of the images in clip art, you can also use your own.


Do this by selecting “Insert,"" mousing over “Photo…” and choosing “Photo Browser,"" which will show you thumbnails of all the pictures on your computer, or “Picture from File,"" which will allow you to choose a photo based on it’s location on your hard drive.

If you already know the photo you want, as well as it’s file name and location, choosing “Picture from File” is a better option.



, Once you have finished decorating the outside of the card, you can move to writing your message. At this point, you have two options:


You can print your card out as is, and then open a new document to type your message (recommended if you don’t have a duplex printer).
You can move to the second page in your document and type your message.

, In your new document (or blank page), add a text box as you did before, and resize it so that, again, it fills the right half of the page.


If you wish to, you can again change the background fill of the text box to a nice color. However, choose wisely as you want the actual text to be clear and easy to read. For example, don't choose a background color that will then wash out the text.

, Again, stick with something elegant and simple. You should also consider the recipient. For example, if they are very old, it may be difficult for them to read cursive fonts, or font sizes that are very small.


Fonts such as Comic Sans are not appropriate for an occasion such as this. Stick to something such as Lucida Sans or Times New Roman.
You might also consider resizing the font. Font size 12 or 14 is usually a good choice as it will be easy to read, but won't look awkwardly large inside the card.

, This should be done in the same manner as with the handmade card. It should include all of the same elements. For example, it should be sincere, it should acknowledge the loss of the deceased, make an offer to help, and ask them how they’re doing.The advantage of an e-card is that you will be sure that the type is neat, and it will be easy to correct if you make a mistake.
Be sure to include all of the salutations (e.g. “Dear Mr. Smith,"" and “Sincerely,”) the same as you would with a handmade card.

, The default alignment is usually “Right Aligned,"" and this is OK. However, you might also wish to center the text in the box. If so, under “Paragraph” select “Center Text.""


Don’t forget to highlight the text you want to have center aligned!
You should select the salutation at the end of the text, and “right align” it, as this traditionally belongs on the right side.

, Make sure you proof read all of the text carefully. Make sure all of the images and front text are positioned just how you want them. If you have already printed out the front side of the card, you should now re-insert your card into the printer. This part can be a bit tricky if you don’t have a duplex printer, but it is possible to print it on both sides.


Basically, you will have to determine how the printer feeds the paper to determine how you should re-insert it so that you will print on the opposite side, and with the correct alignment.
If you have a duplex printer, simply select double sided printing in your print dialogue. This will vary from computer to computer, but the option will appear somewhere in the dialogue that pops up when you select “Print.""
You should print the card out on a quality piece of printer paper using color ink.

, Once you have successfully printed your card, fold it so that the left half of the page folds over the right hand side of the page. You should now have a piece of paper that looks just like a store bought card.


Just like a handmade card, you should now place the card in an envelope with the recipient’s name and address, if you plan to mail it.
If you plan to hand deliver it, the recipient’s name should be sufficient.

Avoid bringing your own problems to your friend.,
Know when to step away.",How to Comfort a Grieving Friend1," This is a difficult time for your friend and they need a lot of understanding. Avoid pressuring your friend to talk or discuss their feelings. It is far better to let your friend know that you are available if needed than to force them to talk to you about what has happened.


Don't pressure your friend or keep on asking how they feel. It's self-evident that they don't feel great.;
, A quiet, non-talkative and tearful friend is still your friend but one likely to need his or her own space and time to process the emotions.

, Being told that there is a right and wrong way to feel through actions, statements and generalizations can be painful during the first stages of grieving, so try to keep your thoughts about grief to yourself and simply affirm that their feelings are valued, real and respected.

, This doesn't mean telling them they'll get over it soon! It means doing things more than saying things, bustling about in the background and being helpful by doing the things that need to be done. Things that you can help with include:


Bringing over meals, tidying the house a little, doing some shopping for your friend, etc.
Helping with funeral arrangements or contact people and companies to tidy up loose ends.
Babysitting or pet-sitting to give your friend a break now and then.
Taking your friend out for a day, away from all of the reminders.

, This isn't a good time to be loading off your problems onto your friend. He or she is in a fragile place right now and cannot be the usual sounding board you may have come to rely upon. Seek the help of another friend for this purpose, until your grieving friend feels whole again.

, Sometimes your friend will push you away. Go away without taking it personally. Realize that it is the grief talking and the grief acting out. Your friend may feel too overwhelmed to cope with the acts of friendship for the moment. Agree to back off for a bit but let your friend know it's temporary, and that the moment they need you again, just to call.

Go through and see which property is listed and who you have designated as the “beneficiary” (the person who will receive it).
Decide if you want to change anything. You should make all of your changes all at once. If, for any reason, you want to change the beneficiaries, you can do so.;
, You might have sold property since you drafted your will. Generally, this is not a problem. If you no longer own something when you die, then there is nothing to give to the beneficiary.


However, you still might want to update your will if you have sold property. For example, you might be trying to divide your estate equally between your children. If you sold large pieces of property, then you might need to change the beneficiaries so that the property is more evenly divided between your children.
Also, you might intend to leave your primary residence to your eldest child. However, if you move, then the property listed in your will as your primary residence is no longer yours. You need to update your will to include the new address of your primary residence.

, If you have acquired new pieces of property, you might want to include them in your will. You will have to decide who you want to leave the property to. New property includes tangible property bought (like homes, cars, jewelry or art) or money that you have inherited.


You don’t always have to revise the will because you gained new property. Your will should have something called a “residuary clause.” This clause covers everything in your estate which you don’t specifically leave to a beneficiary.For example, you might have a house, two cars, some cash, and jewelry at your time of death. Your will might leave the house and cars to specific people. The cash and jewelry will then become part of your “residuary estate” and will be distributed to whoever you name as the beneficiary of your residuary estate.
Accordingly, if you buy property after you draft your will, that property will go to the beneficiary of your residuary estate. You only need to update the will if you do not want the beneficiary of your residuary estate to get the new property.

, You might want to update your will because you want to add someone as a beneficiary. For example, you might have married or had children since you drafted your will.


You might have married someone. When you drafted your original will, you might have been single. Generally, your state law will allow your spouse to take a portion of your estate when you die. Depending on the state, your spouse could get 50% even if the will is silent about what your spouse should receive.However, this is not always the case. In order to provide for your spouse, you should update your will.
You also might have had children after you signed your current will. In some situations, your state might give the new child a share of your estate if he or she was born after you drafted your will. However, for extra protection, you will probably want to revise the will.
If a child dies, then you will probably need to update the will to name new beneficiaries., You might think that your will is automatically revoked when you divorce. This is not always true. In some states, your ex-spouse could still inherit property from you even after a divorce unless you update your will.You should change your will as soon as possible after you divorce. Don’t wait until you remarry, because you could die in the interim.

, The executor (also called a “personal representative”) is the person charged with gathering all of your estate property, paying off your debts, and then distributing the remainder to the beneficiaries. You should update your will if you want to change the executor.Your executor may have died or become incompetent. Also, the current executor might have told you that he or she doesn’t want to serve in that capacity anymore.
Before naming a new executor, you should ask the person if he or she wants to serve. An executor named in the will always has the option of declining to serve in the role, so you want to make sure that whoever you name is willing to serve.

, In your will, you probably also named the guardians for your children. If you want to change the guardian, then you should update your will.


As with the executor, make sure that the person you appoint as guardian wants to serve in that role.

, You should probably meet with a lawyer to discuss the best way to update your will.After meeting with the lawyer, you might find that you don’t have to update the will at all.


If you used a lawyer to help you draft your current will, you should reconnect with the attorney. Call and say that you want to discuss updating your will. You can schedule an appointment.
You might not have used a lawyer to help draft your original will. In this case, you will need to find a will attorney by getting referrals. You can ask people that you know if they would recommend their lawyer.
You can also get a referral by contacting your state or local bar association, which should run a referral program.

, If you want to make a few minor changes to the will, then you should use a “codicil.” A “codicil” is an addendum to the will. It can add to the existing will or make deletions in the existing will.


A codicil is a legal document, just like the will. Accordingly, you need to draft and execute the codicil in the same way that you did the will.For example, you will probably need witnesses to testify to your signature and also have the codicil notarized.

, You might think you can revise your will by making handwritten changes on the document by crossing out someone’s name or inserting a gift. You should not do this.If you write on your will, then a judge might decide the entire will is invalid.You also won’t be around to tell the judge who you want to leave your property to. Accordingly, you will lose control of who gets your property.

, At the top of the page, you should title the document “Codicil to the Last Will and Testament of .”, The purpose of the opening paragraph is to identify yourself and state that you are executing a codicil. You also need to identify the will you are amending.


Sample language could read: “I, Beth Smith, residing and domiciled in the City of Bangor, County of Penobscot, and State of Maine, hereby make, publish, and declare this to be a Codicil to My Last Will and Testament dated .”, You need to explain what provisions in the will you are adding or deleting. Identify the article and paragraphs.


For example, you can write: “I delete from my Will Article IV, Paragraphs 1 and 2 in their entirety.”To add something, you can write, “In Article IV, Paragraph 1, I insert the following….”

, After you enter the additions or revisions, you should republish the will. You can do that by adding the following language:


“Except as herein amended, my Will shall remain in full force and effect, and, so I hereby remake, re-declare, and republish my Will, together with these amendments, as my Last Will and Testament.”, You will need a line for your signature and the date. Depending on your state law, you will also need to add lines for witnesses. Most states require at least two witnesses.


Look on your will to see how many people witnessed your signing of the will. Unless your state has suddenly changed the law, you will need the same number of people to witness your codicil. Insert a signature line for each witness.

, You can also update your will by creating an entire new will. You should choose to draft a new will (instead of adding a codicil) when you have large changes to make or are making several smaller ones. You should certainly draft a new will if any of the following is true:You have a change in marital status—you either divorce or get married.
You want to leave a sizeable part of your estate to a new beneficiary.
Your assets have increased or decreased significantly.

, You might have drafted your original will with the help of computer software. You can use the same software to draft the new will.


If you didn’t use software, then you will have to update the will by typing up a new version or editing the electronic version stored on your computer.
If you had a lawyer draft the original will, then you can ask the lawyer to draft an entirely new will. Give your lawyer the changes you want to make.

, In the first paragraph of your new will, you should state that you are revoking any prior wills. By including this sentence, you make clear that you know that you have a prior will and that you are consciously revoking it.


Sample language could read: “I hereby revoke any and all old Wills that I have previously made.”, If you are typing up your own will, then you hopefully saved the prior will in a word processing document. You can then simply enter any revisions that you want to make.


If you have to type it up all over again, then be especially careful that you include all information in the new will that you put in the original. For example, you don’t want to forget to put in the names of your children’s guardians in the new will. Because you are revoking your older will, then the guardians listed in that old will no longer be the guardians.

, Out of extra caution, you should show your new will to a lawyer. Also give the lawyer the old will you want to revoke. The lawyer can then review the two to make sure you haven’t forgotten anything.

, Your state law will explain what you need to do to make the codicil or will official. You can find your state’s requirements by searching the Internet for “your state” and “wills.”


Your state law should tell you whether you need witness and how many.
It may also tell you how to authenticate the codicil or new will. By including a self-proving affidavit, you can speed up the will’s admission into probate. Without the affidavit, your executor would typically have to track down one of the witnesses to identify the signature on the will as yours. With a “self-proving” affidavit, a judge will presume your will was correctly executed and will admit the will unless someone challenges it., Your state might require that two or more witnesses observe the execution and sign as well. Make sure that the witnesses are not people who are beneficiaries under the will.


For example, if you are leaving property to your children, then you should not have the children serve as witnesses.
Above the signature lines for the witnesses, you should include the following language:

“The foregoing instrument was signed, sealed, declared, and published by as and for a Codicil to his Last Will and Testament dated , in the presence of each of us, and we at the same time, at his request, in his presence and in the presence of each other, have hereunto subscribed our names as attesting witnesses.”, You will also need to have the codicil or will notarized. You can find a notary by visiting the courthouse or a large bank. You can also find a notary by using the Locator function at the website for the American Society of Notaries.You should search the Internet for an appropriate notary block for your state. Insert the notary block at the bottom of the codicil or will, beneath the lines for the witness signatures.
Be sure to have personal identification to show the notary. A valid driver’s license or passport is usually sufficient.

, You should probably include a self-proving affidavit. Look at your state law, which should provide sample language to include in the affidavit. You and your witnesses should sign the affidavit when you appear in front of the notary to sign the codicil or new will.


Each state has slightly different requirements for the self-proving affidavit. For example, New York’s self-proving affidavit does not satisfy Georgia’s requirements.Accordingly, you should draft the affidavit to satisfy your state’s laws.
To find sample language for your state, type “your state” and “will affidavit” or “self-proving affidavit will.” Look for websites that end in “.gov.” These are official state websites.

, If you drafted a codicil, then make sure that you give the original to whoever is holding the original copy of your will. Your lawyer might have the original, or you might be storing it in a safety deposit box. Attach the codicil to the will.


Also distribute copies of the codicil to whoever has copies of the will.
If you revoked an old will by drafting a new one, then give copies of the new will to whoever has copies of the old version. Send a letter telling them that you have revoked your old will.
Keep a copy of the codicil or will for your own records.

, To avoid confusion, you might want to destroy all copies of your older will.If your lawyer has the original copy of your old will, then can ask that the lawyer destroy it.

Realize that all of your group of friends is likely to be hurting and somewhat shaken.,
Seek to get a debriefing for all of the friends in your group.,
Deal with your own feelings before trying to help others.,
Devise a buddy network between each of you.,
Use a calm and concerned tone at all times.,
Let your friends know that you are available to help things continue as normal as possible.,
Recognize that this is a tragedy and that others will be notified in the proper manner.",How to Comfort a Grieving Friend2," When someone decides to take their own life and is part of a tight-knit group, it deeply affects the people for whom they were so close to. They can feel as if their circle has been broken.

, This isn't something you should handle alone without suitable help. A school counselor, a therapist or some other person trained to assist with this challenging situation must be called upon for advice.

, You have been impacted too and this will make it harder for you to act in a role of supporting your other friends. It is important, no matter how strong and protective you feel, that you also get help for your feelings and emotional outfall from the event.


It is understandable that you want to help when you care deeply for your remaining friends but don't neglect yourself in the process.

, Make it clear who is available at any time should any friend of the group need to talk, let feelings out or just be around someone. Be there for one another so that the emptiness, despair and black feelings can be dealt with rather than swallowing up an individual.

, Helping all of your friendship group to remain calm is an important approach to helping everyone feel that they can cope.

, Defuse any situation for them that may make them uncomfortable. Allow them to gather among themselves and grieve in their own way, in their own time.

, It is imperative that you remain sensitive, and do not use electronic media such as Facebook to contact or notify anyone without the family's authorization.

Start with an appropriate salutation.,
Write how sorry you are about the person's passing.,
If you don't know the person well, consider keeping it brief.,
If you know the deceased, consider sharing memories.,
Offer help or assistance if you'd like.,
End your note with an appropriate closing.",How to Sign a Sympathy Card1," The most common way to begin a sympathy card note is to start with the word ""Dear."" You could also write ""Dearest,"" or simply start with the person's name. Avoid starting with ""Hi"" or another casual salutation - err on the side of being a little formal.


Address the person to whom you're writing as you'd normally address that person. If you're writing to a teacher you normally call ""Ms. Frankel,"" address her that way in the card. If you're writing to someone you know well, using the person's first name is appropriate.
If the card is meant to express sympathy to an entire family, and not just one person, write each person's name out. If you don't know the names of everyone in the family, you could write ""Sarah and family."";
, Say how sorry you are to hear that the deceased has passed away, and if you knew the person, mention his or her name. If you didn't know the person, you can refer to him or her as ""your mother"" or ""your grandfather,"" and so on. For example:


I am so sorry that Miles has passed away after his long battle with cancer.
I am deeply grieved to hear of Margaret's passing.
Words can't express how sorry I am that June is gone.

, Ending your note after briefly expressing sympathy is perfectly acceptable for a note you're sending to someone you don't know very well. Include a phrase that is conventional and has no chance of being misconstrued. Choose to write something like ""thinking of you in sympathy"" or ""please accept my condolences"" if you wish to keep the note on the short side. This is especially appropriate if the sympathy card you're using already has a printed poem or note inside. Examples of other appropriate brief sentiments include:


You are in my thoughts.
Our thoughts and prayers are with you.
We are thinking of you.
I'm praying for you during this difficult time.
We will honor the memory of during this time of sorrow.
will always be in our thoughts.

, If you knew the person who passed away, write how much you will miss him or her, and share a few things you remember. Demonstrating a shared grief will make the recipient of the card feel less lonely during his or her time of loss. Briefly mention something special about the person, or how much that person meant to you.

, Writing a few words that invite the person to call you or reach out to you if you are needed will probably be welcome. Be sure you're ready to follow up on it if the person indeed reaches out for help.

, If you know the person well, you may simply want to write ""Love,"" then sign your name. If you're sending a card to someone for whom that closing wouldn't be right, choose a closing that best expresses your feelings and your relationship to the person.For example:


With caring thoughts,
With loving memories,
With love,
With deepest sympathy,
With heartfelt condolences,
Our sincere sympathy,

Expect denial after the initial loss.,
Anticipate feeling angry.,
Go through the process of bargaining.In the third stage of grief, the person might try to beg and plead, perhaps with God (if someone passed away) or with a friend (if a relationship has ended).,
Plan on experiencing sorrow or depression in the fourth stage.,
Expect acceptance in the final stage.It may seem like the person is emerging from a cave after hibernation.,
Be aware of common myths about grieving.,
Lean on family and friends.,
Turn to your spirituality for comfort.,
Perform a ritual for closure.One way to get closure and move forward after a loss is to utilize rituals.,
Consult with a counselor, if needed.,
Develop a routine to get through each day.,
Be good to your body.,
Avoid trying to numb the pain.,
Give yourself time to properly grieve.",How to Understand the Five Stages of Grief," The first of Kübler-Ross’ stages is denial. It is common for a person to experience shock and disbelief upon first learning about a loss. Some people even feel numb emotionally. These emotions happen to protect the person from experiencing the full intensity of the loss. In many cases, it is helpful because it gives the person time to take action and do things like plan a funeral. Once the person starts to acknowledge the loss, the denial and disbelief will fade away.A person in denial may make remarks like “This isn’t real” or “You must have misunderstood.”;
, The second stage of grief happens when the person realizes that he or she can no longer stay in denial. At this point, frustration and anger occurs. The person may feel helpless or powerless about the loss, or even feel a sense of abandonment. Anger may be directed at the person, place, or thing lost, at close loved ones, or at a higher power.


During the anger stage, the person may question “Why is this happening?” or “Who is responsible?”

, The person may try to seek compromise like “If you keep her alive, I will never take my family for granted again”.


The person may become obsessed with thoughts about what could have been done to prevent the loss. If the bargaining process is not resolved, it can transform into lasting issues with guilt or remorse and hinder the person from properly healing after the loss.

, While sadness may be apparent in other stages, at this point, the person has truly acknowledged the extent of the loss. Depression may be accompanied by feelings of hopelessness, problems with appetite and sleep, poor concentration, low energy, social withdrawal, and negative thought patterns.The individual may despair about their own impending mortality making comments like “My life will not be the same without him/her. Why keep trying?”


A depressed grieving person may refuse to take visitors and spend a lot of time alone crying. Sustained depression can put a person at risk of having suicidal thoughts and behaviors. So, you should see a grief counselor if depression significantly interferes with your ability to function.

, While the person might not be fully back to “normal”, it is important to recognize that he or she is trying to become reintegrated back into the real world after the time of mourning. The person may start to believe “It’s going to be OK” and assimilate the loss into their unique life story.


Although acceptance is the fifth stage, it is common for a person to revisit many of the earlier stages across the lifespan. Grief is a very personal process. To fully grieve, one must experience all the emotions that come with the process.

, Although these stages have been accepted as the normal process of grieving, everyone experiences grief differently. Some people may skip certain stages or go through them in different orders. Just as there are multiple ways to experience loss, there are multiple ways to grieve them. Other misconceptions about grieving include:It lasts about a year. There is no set amount of time for grieving to take place. The time frame required to heal will depend on the person and the type of loss.
Death is the only thing people can grieve. While death may be one of the most significant of losses, a person can grieve many other losses, such as divorce, aging, loss of a dream, loss of a friendship, moving, or retiring after many years of work.
I can move on more quickly by ignoring the pain. Ignoring or numbing the pain you feel after a loss will not make you heal faster. In fact, doing this can actually delay the normal grieving process. It’s better to deal with the pain head on because ignoring it can make it worse over time.

, Your support system is one of your greatest assets during periods of grief. Identify the people in your life who are supportive and capable of being called during a time of crisis. These people may include spouses, siblings, parents, and other family members as well as friends, coworkers, doctors, and religious figures.


Although it’s important to acknowledge the people you can count on during this difficult time, you must also have the courage to ask for support. Be honest when others ask how you are doing or if there is something they can do. Sometimes, it might be nice simply to have someone present with you as you cry., If you are a spiritual person, you may draw comfort from your faith or beliefs after a loss. Read books about that explain the grieving process. Talk to others who share your beliefs. Engage in activities that serve to comfort you, such as attending services, praying, meditating, or even taking walks in nature., These are symbolic gestures or processes that allow you to say “goodbye” and make peace with a chapter in your life that is coming to a close. How you find closure will depend on the type of loss you are grieving.


Potential rituals may be sorting through and packing away the belongings of a loved one who died, writing a letter and reading it at an important site to express pain or frustration, or disposing of sentimental items that defined a relationship that ended.

, If the feelings you experience while grieving become overwhelming, it can help to see a professional grief counselor. This person can help you sort through your emotions, come to terms with a loss, and develop a plan for moving forward. A counselor may also recommend special support groups you can join to talk with people who are going through the grieving process like you., When people are suffering from a loss, they do whatever they can to get through each day. As you start to come to terms with the loss and heal, it’s essential to rebuild a daily routine. A routine offers structure during a time when everything seems topsy-turvy.As you start to heal, your routine may become more full of things you did before the loss. However, it might be helpful to start with a simple routine that includes waking at a consistent time each morning and eating breakfast. Plan a few things to do each day and write them down on a to-do list. Check off each item as you finish it., During such an emotional and upsetting time, you should take care to nurture your mind and body. Keep yourself hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Eat a diet filled with healthy, nutritious foods and avoid fast foods and junk foods if possible. Get plenty of rest—at least 7 to 9 hours each night. Try to stay physically active by taking walks or visiting your local gym. Fight off stress by doing things that are nurturing, such as taking long baths, reading, listening to soothing music, and journaling., It’s common to want to numb the pain you feel after a loss. Unfortunately, numbing your emotional pain can lead to unhealthy habits and hinder your ability to heal. In addition to taking good care of your body and mind, you should also refrain from using alcohol, drugs, sex, or food to temporarily lift your mood., Remember that everyone grieves differently. You may never feel like you did before the loss, but it’s important to be patient with yourself. You may feel better for a short while and then notice that a new wave of grief hits you. Keep in mind that you must heal at your own pace."

Write an intimate message if you knew the deceased well.,
Express sincere condolences if you never met the deceased.,
Write a heartfelt message to acknowledge the death of a pet.",How to Sign a Sympathy Card2," You'll naturally have memories to share and a bit more to say if you knew the person who passed away. Consider writing a draft on a separate piece of paper so you can get your thoughts down before you compose the note on your sympathy card. Think about what you knew about the deceased, and try to come up with a natural-sounding, heartfelt note. Here are a few examples:


Dear Steve, We were incredibly sorry to hear that Joan passed away. She was a kind, caring friend who always made time for other people, and we loved her. Her students will remember her as a devoted teacher and wonderful role model. If you need help running errands, keeping the house in order, or anything at all, please don't hesitate to call us. We love you and are thinking of you. With deepest sympathy, Marcia and Luke
Dear Mary Ann and Juan, it's impossible to express how sorry we are that your beautiful daughter has passed away after her struggle. What a brave, joyful child she was. We will miss her every day. Our thoughts and prayers are with you and your two sons. If there is anything we can do, please call us. With love, Hayden and Dwayne

, While you won't be able to share memories of the person, you can speak to the person's reputation or simply express how sorry you are for your friend or family member's loss. Here are a few examples:


Dear Molly, I am so sorry to hear that your father passed away. Though I never got the chance to meet him, I know how much everyone at St. Paul's admired his volunteer work. How wonderful that you were able to spend so much time with him in his final days. Please call me if you need anything or just want to talk. I'm thinking of you. With sympathy, Jim
Dear Victor, I was very sad to hear the news about your brother Hector. I know how close the two of you were. If there's anything I can do to help, please don't hesitate to call. Warmest condolences, Alicia

, The same sincere sentiments should be expressed when you're writing a sympathy card to someone whose pet has died. Try to remember a few details about the pet to include. Here are a few examples:


Dear Lucia, I'm very sorry that Shadow has passed away. I remember when you first adopted him 13 years ago. What a wonderful companion he was. Our walks won't be the same without him trotting by your side. With love and hugs, Jules
Bobby, I heard the news about your sweet Birdie. She was such a special cat. It's hard to believe she won't be romping around the garden next spring like she always loved to do when the weather started warming up. Thinking of you, Jordan

Always send a card, not an email.,
Send a card even if you're also sending flowers.,
Send a card even if a lot of time has passed.,
Avoid overly religious content unless the person shares your beliefs.,
Don't worry too much about saying the wrong thing.",How to Sign a Sympathy Card3," Even if you learned of someone's death over social media or email, it's more thoughtful to send a card in the regular mail. Either buy a sympathy card from the store, use a blank card with an appropriate picture, or write your note on nice stationary. The note should be handwritten or typed in blue or black ink.


Don't express condolences over text message.
If you do express condolences over social media or by other means, send a card, too.

, Even if the flowers come with a short note card, send a separate sympathy card with enough space to express your heartfelt condolences. This allows you to write the note and sign it yourself, rather than having it printed by a flower shop.

, It's best to send a card as soon as you hear about a person's death, which will usually be within a few days or weeks of the person's passing. However, you should still send a card even if many months, or even years, have passed without you knowing about the death. If you don't send a card, the person may wonder whether you care. Even if it's a little awkward to send a card late, it's definitely better than not sending one at all., Saying ""my prayers are with you"" is completely fine, but copying bible passages or expressing your religious beliefs in other ways isn't appropriate for a sympathy card. The person receiving the card may not have the same beliefs, and you don't want to push yours on him or her at such a delicate time. Stick to universally accepted expressions of love and sympathy, rather than those specific to your religion.


For example, saying ""I know he's in heaven now"" may not be appropriate, because the person may not believe in heaven.
However, if you and the person are members of the same religious group, it's perfectly fine to write a note taking that into account.

, Trust yourself to write a message that expresses your true desire to show the recipient you care. The very act of sending a card is a thoughtful gesture that will be appreciated. Do your best to write a note that is sincere and sweet. If you find it difficult to express yourself through written notes, that's ok - there will be other ways to show the person you're there for them during this difficult time.

"
Expect shock and disbelief as the first stage.,
Expect denial as the second stage.,
Expect anger as the third stage.,
Expect bargaining as the fourth stage.,
Expect guilt as the fifth stage.,
Expect sorrow or depression as the sixth stage.,
Expect acceptance as the seventh stage.",How to Understand the Seven Stages of Grief," Most notably the person will be very still and quiet as if they have turned into a statue. Some people sit down upon hearing bad news and stare blankly or shake their head.;
, The person will try to make out the situation as if it has been relayed to them incorrectly often using phrases such as: ""That can't be true.""""You must have misunderstood.""""He/She would never do that.""""That can't be true.""""You must have misunderstood.""""He/She would never do that.""


""That can't be true.""
""You must have misunderstood.""
""He/She would never do that.""

, Depending on the person, or the nature of the event, intensity of anger can vary. Some will use a more verbal expression while others might revert to physical anger including smashing objects or physical abuse to themselves or others.

, The person might try to beg and plead, perhaps with God (if someone passed away) or with a friend (if a relationship has ended). This is a time where their self-control and willpower will be tested the most. As a friend, it is essential that you are there for them and objectively help them with their best interests in mind.

, This could be guilt towards actions they did not take before the event occurred or even some of the actions they took while in the stages of mourning. Often accompanied by crying, this stage is more of self-reflecting time.

, While depression is apparent through all of the stages they are often overshadowed by other emotions. This is a time where little details or statements can send a person in a frenzy of tears or seclusion from their peers.

, It may seem like the person is emerging from a cave after hibernation. While they might not be fully themselves, it is important to recognize that they are trying to reintroduce themselves into the real world after their time of mourning. The person my not entirely outgoing or into late night partying, but after some more time and reintegration they will be back to themselves.

Talk with your child privately in the evening.,
Word the incident carefully, but directly.,
Answer your child’s questions about death.",How to Help Kids Cope with the Death of Their Cat1," Waiting until the day winds down is a wise idea. This will give your child time to grieve and process before they have to go out and do anything. That said, do not tell them right before bed, as this would not give them time to talk to you or think about the news.For example, you might aim for telling them right after dinner.;
, Lying to your child will only make the pain worse. Be direct with them when telling them what happened to their cat. That said, there is no need to disturb them with unnecessary details. Evaluate how much you tell them by their age and maturity level.For example, you might say something like “We need to talk. Today, there was an accident and your cat died.”
Do not tell your child that the cat ran away or is sleeping. This can cause confusion and more pain down the road.

, The death of a pet can be a good opportunity to teach your child about death. If this is your child’s first experience with death, they are likely to have many questions. Do your best to answer them as you feel appropriate. Again, this may change depending on the age and maturity of your child.For example, a younger child might ask if the cat will come back. This question can be answered by most parents readily.
An older child might ask a more involved question like, “What happens after death?” In this case, the answer may require a more involved discussion that is based on different beliefs and facts.

Acknowledge that grieving is different for everyone.,
Recognize that either acceptance or denial is a natural response.,
Recognize the person's yearning for the loved one.,
Recognize anger as a way to cope with hurt.,
Watch for depression.,
Help the bereaved complete the tasks of mourning.,
Allow the person not to express anything at all.",How to Help People Dealing with the Death of a Loved One1," The grieving person may feel very different emotions from one day to the next, and from hour to hour.People experience grief in very different ways. Some people may feel multiple emotions, such as denial or anger, at the same time. Some people may take awhile to feel anything at all, experiencing a sense of numbness after loss.It is often more helpful to think of grief as a ""roller coaster"" instead of orderly stages. People who have experienced a loss may seem completely accepting of it one day and in denial the next. They may feel angry one moment and calm the next. It is important to validate their feelings as natural responses to loss.;
, Although popular culture expects denial to be the first response to experiencing the loss of a loved one, research suggests otherwise. Acceptance of the death is actually much more common an initial response than denial.However, it is also possible to experience shock or denial. It all depends on the individual. The duration of shock varies greatly among individuals and across circumstances.


It is important to give a person in this stage time to process information. You should acknowledge the death, but it is not necessary to force others to acknowledge the death before they are ready to do so.

, Research suggests that yearning for the lost loved one is a stronger initial response than disbelief, anger, or depression.This yearning may manifest itself as something like ""I miss him so much"" or ""Life just isn't the same without her."" The person may go back over old memories, photos, and other things tied to the lost loved one as a way to keep that connection alive. This is natural.You can help by listening to these stories. Encourage the person to share her memories, if she wants to. You could even ask questions about the deceased, if the person seems interested in sharing.You can also assure the bereaved that she could not have prevented the death. Yearning for the lost loved one may lead to bargaining, which we employ to help us feel like there is some way we can regain control and prevent future loss.Blaming oneself is a common initial response to bereavement.Bargaining statements often start with ""I should have"" or ""If only."" Remind the bereaved that events were not within her control., As the shock and hurt of the initial loss wears off, the bereaved may use anger to combat the pain. Research suggests that feelings of anger increase between 1-5 months after a loss, and then gradually subside after that.The anger may be irrational and misplaced. It may manifest as blaming a deity, fate, or themselves for the loss. Do not minimize these feelings by using shaming language, such as ""Don't be angry"" or ""Don't blame God."" Validate the bereaved's feelings of anger by saying: ""I'm sure that it's painful to go through what you're experiencing. Anger seems natural to me."", Depressed mood is normal after a major loss and will not necessarily lead to Major Depressive Disorder. Research suggests that depression may peak between 1-5 months after the loss.However, the initial shock of the loss may also cause depressive symptoms, such as mood swings, feelings of immense sadness, and trouble concentrating.If the bereaved has expressed a desire to harm him or herself or has completely withdrawn, these may be signs of Major Depressive Disorder, and you should contact a mental health professional., Mourning is a way of expressing and processing one's grief. Some psychologists that there are particular tasks that people need to complete in order to feel some sense of acceptance and closure. It should be stressed, though, that how each person completes these will be unique to them.Accept the reality of the loss: Intellectual acceptance often happens quite early in the mourning process,but it can take a long time for the emotions to catch up.You can help this along by speaking (compassionately) about the loss.
Process grief and pain. This can take a long time. How each person processes grief is unique to them.
Adjust to a world without the loved one. The types of adjustments include external (such as finding a new place to live or closing bank accounts), internal (redefining oneself apart from the relationship with the loved one), and spiritual (considering the impact of the loss on your worldview).
Find enduring connection with the loved one while going into a new life stage. One common misconception about grief is that you should encourage people to ""get over it.""However, bereaved people may want to find a way to help them feel connected to their lost loved one, and that is natural. Help find a way to remember your friend's loved one with a special memorial project, whether it's planting a tree, creating a scholarship or another meaningful activity. At the same time, encourage the person to continue to discover new aspects of herself and what life means for her now.

, Popular culture tends to insist that people ""let it out"" while grieving. We usually believe that if you do not express your emotional reactions to a trauma, you will be unable to move on from it. However, research suggests that this is not entirely true. People experience and process grief in very different ways. Do not try to force any emotional experience on them.


Studies about loss in general, and bereavement in particular, actually suggest that people who do not express negative emotions abut their loss may actually be less stressed and depressed six months later. If the people you're trying to help want to express their feelings, support them, but don't pressure them to do so. They may simply be using another valid way to cope."

Stay with your child.,
Discuss how they are feeling.,
Read a book about death and grief to them.,
Share your feelings.,
Ask how you can help.,
Allow them room to grieve.,
Maintain their normal routine.",How to Help Kids Cope with the Death of Their Cat2," Unless your child asks to be left alone for a while, make it a point to stay with them. This will signal to your child that you are there to support them. Knowing that they have your support will make it easier for them to open up and talk to you., When your child is ready, discuss their feelings. They may be start the discussion immediately, or you may have to initiate it by asking questions. Either way, it is important that your child talk to you or someone else about their emotions., Reading a book about death and grief with your child can help them to understand the situation better and find healthy ways to deal with their feelings. There are many books on death and grief that are appropriate for different age groups. Look into some books for your child and pick one or two up that you can read with them., Your child might not understand how to share or process their grief. Set an example by showing them how you are feeling about the death of their cat. This will signal to them that it is okay to feel sad and express it.You can express your feelings by saying things like, “I know that you are hurting, because I am hurting, too. Our cat was a lovely pet and I will miss it very much.”
You might also say something like, “I’m sad about our cat, and I’ll miss it. I am glad that we got to spend time with such a great pet.”
Be willing to show how you feel as well. Don’t try to hide your feelings because this may teach your child to suppress their feelings as well. It is important for them to know that it is okay to cry if they are feeling sad.

, Asking your child what they need can help them open up to you. They may not be able to express their feelings about the cat, but they can tell you what will help them get through right now. Do whatever you can to help them with any reasonable requests., Everyone grieves in their own way, on their own time. This includes children. Do not expect your child to have forgotten the incident or be back to their normal selves the next day. Let them take time to process their grief and sadness in a healthy way.If your child consistently withdraws from school or extracurriculars, they may be having a hard time with the death.
If your child obsesses about the cat for a long period of time, they may be struggling to let go.
If you see signs that your child is not coping with the death of their cat, you can seek out a mental health professional to guide them through the process.

, Even though your child may be grieving their cat, it is important to keep them in a normal routine. The routine can offer normalcy and comfort. It also keeps them from falling behind in school and extracurricular activities.Keeping their routine can also distract your child from their grief some of the time.

"
"
Reminisce with your child.,
Create closure.,
Honor the memory of your lost cat.,
Avoid the urge to replace the cat.",How to Help Kids Cope with the Death of Their Cat3," Your child will likely cling to the memory of their cat. You can reach out to them by doing the same. Talk about things that the cat used to do and tell your favorite stories about the cat.It can also help to tell them about a childhood pet that you lost.

, You should have your child help plan a memorial service or funeral for their cat. This will give them a chance to create closure and do one last thing for their cat. Keep the service small and intimate for your child.If the child is old enough, and you are planning to put the cat down, then you might even consider allowing your child to come along with you to the veterinarian to say goodbye to the cat and possibly even comfort him during the procedure.

, Even after your child has had closure, they will still want to revisit memories of their cat. Keep pictures of the cat to look back on. You could also consider keeping a small box of momentos, such as the cat’s favorite toy.You may even consider making a photo album with your child that is full of pictures and memories of your cat.

, Your child had a connection with their cat, not all cats. They will likely be confused and offended if you immediately try to replace their cat with another cat. Give them time and space before bringing in another pet."
"
Acknowledge that a death has occurred.,
Do household chores or run errands for the bereaved.,
Attend the funeral and other gatherings.,
Listen and express compassion for your friend.",How to Help People Dealing with the Death of a Loved One2," Be honest and tell the grieving person you don't know what to say or do. Then ask what you can do to help.For example, ""I heard about your grandfather passing. I'm so sorry for you and your family, and I wish I knew how to help. What can I do for you?""

, The days immediately following a loss tend to be particularly hectic. If the bereaved does not ask you to help with specific activities, offer to pick up groceries, help with housework or cooking, or care for pets or children.It is more helpful to make specific offers than it is to say ""Tell me if you need anything.""

, Don't worry about saying the right things. Simply being there is a show of support.If you are unable to attend an event, send a tangible expression of your love and support. You might consider sending a sympathy card, flowers, or a CD of uplifting music. If the person is spiritual, you could send the person something that affirms her traditions about loss and death.
Be sensitive. How cultures and spiritual traditions deal with grief, death, and loss varies widely.Do not assume that others will experience it the same way that you do, or find comfort in your own traditions.

, Simply ask if she feels like talking and then sit silently and listen. Allow the grief to take form in tears, as well as happy memories.Don't be afraid to express your own emotion and affection. Sitting closely and hugging are great ways to physically support the bereaved. Crying is an appropriate way to express your empathy for the bereaved. Smiling or laughing when funny or happy memories are shared are ways to honor the life of the dead.

"
"
Watch for signs of severe depression that require intervention.,
Locate bereavement support groups.,
Continue to support your friend long after the funeral.",How to Help People Dealing with the Death of a Loved One3," It's normal for the bereaved to feel depressed,but these feelings can develop into a more serious problem, if left unchecked for an extended period of time. Tell the person you are concerned.


Studies suggest that the most intense feelings of grief usually last about six months, although it varies from person to person.If more than six months has gone by and the person does not show signs of any improvement, or if her symptoms have gotten worse, she may be experiencing complicated grief. This is a continual, heightened state of grief that keeps the person from processing emotions and moving through them.It may also be known as prolonged grief disorder.
Recommend seeking professional help if you notice any of the following: difficulty functioning in normal activities, alcohol or drug abuse, hallucinations, withdrawal and isolation, self-harm, and talk of suicide., Contact local organizations and groups to ask for guidance helping your friend.Recommend your friend attend support group meetings and offer to go with him or her. If you think your friend will decline, you may even try telling him or her you'd like to join the group and ask them to go to support you.

, Stay in contact and offer words of encouragement. Grieving is an ongoing process, so the bereaved will likely need extra support for at least several months.


Help your friend be prepared to handle future triggers and be prepared to offer extra support at those times.Anniversaries (of death or marriage), birthdays (the deceased's, as well as those of the living), special events (weddings, graduations, births, or any event the deceased would have participated in, or would have liked to participate in), holidays, and even times of day (for people who had regular well established routines with the deceased) can all be triggers.
You can help your friend manage triggers by planning actives to distract from them, establishing time during events to briefly reminisce about the deceased, and creating new traditions and routines."
"
Stay in touch.,
Spend time with your friend.,
Invite your friend to do things.,
Be gentle, but persistent.,
Remember your friend’s child on anniversaries and holidays.",How to Help a Friend Whose Child Has Died1," Let your friend know you care by giving them a call or sending a card after you get the news. Keep checking in with them regularly – texts, emails, and visits in person are all appropriate. Don’t avoid your friend or tiptoe around the subject of their child’s death, even if you’re nervous about saying something wrong.The worst thing you can do is disappear after your friend goes through a tragedy. Be there for them, even if you feel awkward about it.;
, Your friend might appreciate some company right now. Ask them if you can drop by, or invite them to get coffee or lunch with you. Even a fifteen-minute visit can help your friend feel less alone.Ask your friend before you visit them. Don’t drop by unannounced.
Frequent, short visits are often better than long ones.

, Ask your friend if they want to go for a walk or see a movie with you. If you’re both part of any social groups or clubs, keep inviting them to get-togethers and catch them up on anything they’ve missed. Make them feel valued and included, even if they don’t want to socialize much right now.

, If your friend turns down your invitations, don’t push the issue. Keep extending the invitations in the future, though. Your friend may not be ready to spend time around people yet, but they will still appreciate that you’re thinking of them., Christmas, Thanksgiving, Mother’s Day, and Father’s Day are often tough for parents who have lost children. So are the child’s birthday and the anniversary of their death. On these occasions, let your friend know that you’re thinking of them and that you haven’t forgotten their child.Send your friend a “thinking of you” card on their child’s birthday or the anniversary of their death, or just mention that you were thinking about their child.
Don’t forget about second, third, and subsequent anniversaries. Anniversaries never stop being sad days for bereaved parents, but few others even remember them after the first year.

Consider a ""force majeure"" clause.,
Consider a ""successors and assigns"" clause.,
Consider a severability clause.,
Consider an ""entire agreement"" clause.,
Create a signature block.",How to Write a Vacation Rental Contract," The title of the contract should reflect the contents of the agreement, and should be centered at the top of the document in bold type.

, A ""party"" is a person involved in this transaction.When describing a party, include his or her name and the title by which he or she will be referred to throughout the contract, such as ""Guest,"" ""Homeowner,"" or ""Tenant.""


For example, “This Vacation Rental Agreement is being entered into by John Doe, “Guest”, and Jane Doe, “Homeowner”, this 12th day of May 2009.”

, Briefly state the address of the property and what furnishings and/or appliances are included.


For example, “The property is located at 1212 Main Street, Lakeview, MN 55555, is furnished, and includes a refrigerator, oven, stove, and dishwasher.”

, Include the date upon which the Guest may enter the premises, and the date upon which the Guest must vacate.


For example, “This lease begins on June 1, 2009 (“Check-in Date”) and ends on September 30, 2009 (""Check-out Date"").”

, Specify the amounts of the deposit and monthly payments, the dates upon which each payment is due, and the beginning and ending dates of the payments. Include the forms of payment accepted (cash, check, money order, or credit card) and the address where payments should be mailed or delivered.


For example, ""Guest shall pay to Homeowner a deposit in the amount of $500 due upon execution of this Agreement, and then $1150 on the 1st day of each month, beginning on June 1, 2009, and ending on September 1, 2009. Payment shall be in cash or personal check or money order made payable to Jane Doe, and mailed to Jane Doe, 4981 Jefferson Blvd, Lakeview, MN 55555.""

, Generally, repairs for accidental damage to the property are paid out of the security deposit.Your contract should include when and how the deposit will be refunded, as well as under what circumstances the deposit will not be refunded.


For example, ""All deposits will be refunded by check payable to the first Guest listed on this agreement within forty-five (45) days of Guest's Check-out Date. If any amounts are subtracted from Guest's deposit refund, a complete invoice will be provided to Guest along with any partial deposit refund.""
If the homeowner allows guests to purchase a non-refundable deposit waiver in lieu of paying a security deposit, this information should be included in this section. (Note that some states prohibit non-refundable deposits.)The contract should clearly state the guest's responsibility to pay for damage in cases where no security deposit is collected, or where the cost of the damage is greater than the security deposit.

, A guest may unexpectedly decide to cancel a reservation. An unexpected cancellation means that the rental property will be vacant until the homeowner can find a replacement tenant. Prepare for this possibility by stating how a guest should cancel a reservation, and what consequences will occur if the guest cancels on short notice.


The homeowner might recommend that the guest purchase travel insurance to cover the cost of an unexpected cancellation.
For example, “Should Guest cancel his or her reservation, in writing, at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the Check-in Date, one hundred percent (100%) of the deposit will be refunded. All other cancellations will result in no refund of the deposit. Homeowner recommends that Guest purchase travel insurance to cover the cost of an unexpected cancellation.”

, If the homeowner requires the guest to provide a valid credit card number for incidental charges and damages, state the terms of the credit card policy in this section.

, Typically, a guest pays rent to the homeowner each week or each month by mailing a check. The contract should specify how the homeowner will communicate a confirmation that the rent payment has been received. This will help prevent misunderstandings over whether rent was paid on time.


For example, ""Upon receipt of each rent payment, Homeowner will communicate confirmation of receipt to Guest within 1 business day via telephone, email, or text message.""

, Setting ground rules may be helpful to keep the rental property clean and safe. You may wish to include:


Rules regarding pets. For example, ""No pets are allowed,"" or ""All pets must be kept outside on leashes.""
Rules regarding minors, parties, and overnight guests. Many landlords do not allow minors to rent the property, or allow tenants to throw parties or host overnight guests who are not listed on the Rental Agreement.
Rules regarding smoking. For example, ""Guest understands that the rental unit is a non-smoking unit, and agrees to smoke only in the outdoor designated smoking areas.""

, A good guest will leave the property clean and in good condition. However, reasonable people may differ on their definitions of ""clean."" Define your expectations clearly to avoid confusion and disagreement later.


For example, ""Guest shall leave the property swept and vacuumed, with washed appliances and bath fixtures, and trimmed lawn.""
If the homeowner has provided pillows and linens, state who will be responsible for laundering those items. For example, ""Guest shall launder all soiled linens prior to vacating the property.""

, A homeowner may wish to enter the premises to inspect the property or make repairs.However, setting rules for entry is courteous and respectful of guests' privacy. State the time of day the landlord may enter, as well as how much notice the homeowner must give to the guest before entering.


For example, ""Homeowner may enter the property to inspect or make repairs between 9:00am and 5:00pm. Homeowner must give Guest twenty-four (24) hours' notice of Homeowner's intent to enter the property.""

, The property may be subject to rules that are outside of the homeowner's control. For example, if the rental unit has a designated parking space, or if street parking is restricted, state the guest's obligation to abide by those parking rules. If the local Homeowner's Association prohibits certain conduct, state those rules as well.

, A ""choice of law"" clause allows the parties to agree upon which country or state's law shall be used to settle any dispute which may arise under the contract. These clauses are particularly helpful when the homeowner and guest ordinarily reside in different countries or states.


For example, ""This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Alabama. Each of the parties irrevocably consents to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Alabama, as applicable, for any matter arising out of or relating to this Agreement.""

, These clauses protect a homeowner from liability for any loss or damage occurring at the rental property. An indemnification clause obligates a guest to compensate the homeowner for harm to the property. A ""hold harmless"" clause means that the homeowner is not liable for harm or loss.Thus, the homeowner cannot be held accountable for accidental injuries or harms that occur on the property, or items lost or stolen from the property.


For example, ""Guest agrees to indemnify and hold Homeowner harmless from any liability for personal injury, property damage, or loss or theft of personal property sustained by Guest or parties invited onto the property by Guest.""

, A ""force majeure"" clause cancels a party's obligation to perform when certain circumstances beyond the party's control arise.This can specify what happens if performance of the contract becomes impossible due to catastrophic weather or some other unforeseen event.


For example, ""A party shall not be liable for any failure of or delay in the performance of this Rental Agreement if the Rental Property becomes uninhabitable or inaccessible due to causes beyond the party's reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, strikes or labor disputes, embargoes, government orders or any other force majeure event. If the Rental Property becomes uninhabitable or inaccessible prior to the Check-In Date, one hundred percent (100%) of the deposit will be refunded.""

, A ""successors and assigns"" clause specifies whether a party may assign his or her rights under the contract to a third party.This includes cases where the homeowner wants to sell the rental property to another owner, or where a guest wants to leave the property and let someone else take over the rent.


For example, ""Guest shall not assign his or her rights under this agreement, or sublet the property, in whole or part, to another party without the prior written consent of Homeowner. Homeowner retains the right to assign his or her rights under this agreement to a third party without further notice.""

, A severability clause states that if any of the provisions of the agreement are found to be unenforceable, all other provisions will still be enforceable.For example, ""If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of law to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, (a) that provision shall be deemed amended to achieve as nearly as possible the same economic effect as the original provision, and (b) the legality, validity, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired thereby.""

, An ""entire agreement"" clause, also known as an integration clause, states that this document is the complete agreement of the parties, and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements.This prevents a party from claiming later that some there was an agreement on some term, not included in the contract, that should be made part of the contract.


For example, ""This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements concerning the subject matter.""

, The signature block should include a line for each party to sign, with the typed or printed name of the party below his or her signature.

Be honest and direct.,
Listen to your child’s response.,
Include your child in any funeral arrangements.",How to Help Your Children Grieve1," Tell your child as soon as you get the chance to do so. Do not delay the news. Sit with your child in a quiet, familiar environment. Speak simply and directly. Specific details are unnecessary when breaking the news, and may distract your child from the reality of the situation.Be direct. Be explicit with the fact that someone has died. Do not use a euphemism for death, as children often take things literally and you may confuse or frighten them. Take care not to use words that might be misinterpreted by young children in particular.
With younger children, it may be tempting to say something along the lines of, “They went to sleep and didn’t wake up.” A euphemism such as this will diminish the child’s ability to confront and cope with the reality of traumatic experiences.Say something like, “Grandpa’s sickness got worse and he died last night. I know we had been hoping he would recover, and we had fun visiting him in the hospital these last few days, but he’s not alive anymore.”
Reassure them emotionally by telling them you love them and that you’re there for them. Give them a hug, hold their hand, or stroke their hair.
With children who are young, make sure to dispel any worries that they had anything to do with the death. Know that these assumptions are actually quite common, as children tend to assume they cause the things that occur around them.;
, Allow a few minutes of silence if they do not immediately respond. Your child is likely thinking about what to say and may be very confused. They will likely struggle to come up with words.Ask your child if they have any questions. Sometimes a child will accept what you’ve told them and not need or want to know any specific details. Other times, children will have endless questions as they try to come to terms with what has occurred.Answer any questions honestly. Be straightforward with the words you use and the way you frame things. That said, Don’t include any information that might frighten or traumatize your child.
For instance, if a loved one died in a motorcycle accident, say something like, “______ crashed on their motorcycle and died from the injuries.” Do not say anything too specific about injuries or accidents.
The older the child, the greater their ability to understand the permanence of death. Default to clarity and honesty in all your conversations about death and loss that you have with a grieving child.Though older children may have more specific questions, and wonder more intensely about how, specifically, a death occurred, you need to balance honesty with a sensitivity towards the further trauma that specific details might induce.
Let them know they can ask you questions or talk to you about what has happened whenever they want to.

, This is vital to helping your child accept the loss of a loved one more fully. It is also an important way to make your child feel included in a series of events that will significantly affect their family. Aside from infants, this applies to children of all ages.Never prevent a child from participating in a funeral if they want to do so. This may directly lead to feelings of confusion and rejection. .
Explain that funerals help people say goodbye to people who have died. Tell them that there will likely be people crying at the funeral, and that it’s entirely okay if they cry as well.
Plan a specific roll for the child. (You can also ask the child what they would like to do.) Rehearse whatever roll the child will fulfill. For example, have the child place something of their choosing in the casket.
If you are not able to do so, have a friend or family member stay with a small child during the service. They may want to leave or need to be held at some point.
On the other hand, don’t force a child to participate or attend. Some children may simply not be ready for the emotional intensity of a funeral service.
If a young child is uncomfortable with the idea of attending a funeral, offer some alternatives to help them achieve closure. Mention planting a tree or releasing balloons in memory of the lost loved one, or ask if they have any ideas."

Take your friend’s grief seriously.,
Use the child’s name.,
Ask your friend if they want to talk about their child.,
Share memories of your friend’s child.,
Avoid platitudes and religious talk.",How to Help a Friend Whose Child Has Died2," Acknowledge and affirm your friend’s heartache. Don’t say anything that trivializes your friend’s pain, and don’t try to make them feel better – you can’t. It’s better to be sad with your friend right now than to try to cheer them up.For instance, you could say something like, “This is really terrible. I’m so sorry that you’re going through this.”
Don’t ever say, “At least you’re young enough to have more kids,” or anything like that. Even if you mean well, you’re still minimizing your friend’s grief, and that will make them feel worse.

, When you talk to your friend, don’t shy away from bringing up their child’s name in conversation. Tiptoeing around their name won’t save your friend’s feelings, and it will make your conversations awkward. Using the child’s name will make your friend feel like their child mattered and will be remembered.For example, instead of saying ""Would you like to talk about it?,"" say ""Would you like to tell me about Randy?""

, Your friend may want to share stories and memories about their child with whoever will listen. They might also not be ready to talk about their child yet. Ask, and if your friend does want to talk, listen patiently for as long as they need you to.For many bereaved parents, talking about their child and their own feelings is a necessary part of the healing process.

, If you knew your friend’s child, share some stories about them. Reminisce about their good qualities and any times you spent with them. Let your friend know that their child is, and will continue to be, fondly remembered.For instance, you could say something like, “I’ll never forget how much Michael made us all laugh when our families went to the zoo together last year.”

, Trite comments like, “He’s in a better place now,” or, “It’s all part of God’s plan,” aren’t comforting or helpful to a grieving person. If your friend isn’t religious, comments about God or heaven may even be painful to hear right now. It can be tempting to fall back on clichés when you don’t know what to say, but don’t do it.It’s better to stay quiet than to accidentally make your friend feel worse.

Ask if you can do specific things for your friend.,
Offer to inform other people.,
Help your friend remember their child.,
Suggest they join a support group.",How to Help a Friend Whose Child Has Died3," Ask your friend if you can run errands, cook, or do laundry for them. Better yet, just do the work quietly and let your friend know afterwards.For instance, say something like, “Would you like me to come over and help you around the house tonight?” or “I made some food for you to put in the freezer. When should I bring it over?”
Don’t just tell your friend to let you know if they need anything. Many people don’t like to ask for help, even if they need it. Take the initiative yourself.

, Your friend might be dreading having to explain over and over to other people that their child died, especially if the death was unexpected. Ask if they would prefer for you to break the news to teachers, doctors, coaches, and other people their family interacts with often.Do not tell anyone about your friend’s loss unless they give you permission. It should be your friend’s right to decide how and when to break the news.

, As time goes by, let your friend know you haven’t forgotten their child. Light a candle for them, bring their name up in conversation now and then, or make a donation in their name.Don’t worry that you might be bringing back painful memories for your friend. For most bereaved parents, it’s very comforting to know that someone else still remembers and cares about their child.

, Many community churches and mental health centers offer special support groups for parents who have lost children. You might research organizations like this in your friend's area and pass along the information to them. If you live nearby, you might even offer to join her at a meeting, if it will make her feel more comfortable.

Ask religious and spiritual leaders in their community about such groups. You might also contact mental health counselors or therapists to see if they facilitate parent bereavement groups.
You might also search for groups online like The Compassionate Friends."

Don’t be surprised by significant changes in a child’s behavior.,
Allow the child to cry.,
Let them see you express emotions.,
Continue to allow children to grieve throughout their childhood.,
Get the child professional help.",How to Help Your Children Grieve2," Children will display intense feelings of grief unpredictably, likely over a long period of time. Make a point of ensuring that you or another family member is always around children that have just experienced a loss, and during likely times of emotional turmoil during their childhood.When speaking with your child, make sure they know that they are always able and welcome to show their emotions and talk about their feelings with you.
Don’t be surprised by fits of anger. At various ages of development, anger is a common feature of children’s emotional processing.
Especially if a child has lost someone integral to their previous experiences, children will often actively express their anger towards other members of their families.
When a child is roughly 6-12, they may go through seemingly unprompted fits and tantrums, which may simply be the release of anger they are unable to process. While this certainly needs to be monitored and discussed, understand that their inexplicable anger may reflect deep sadness.Similarly, teenagers may respond to grief with periodic, even intentional lapses in healthy judgement. While they may be able to control tantrums, outbursts of misbehavior and knowingly inappropriate activities may be directly connected to their suffering.To diminish the negative effects of extreme emotional swings, spend as much time as possible with your child, especially when it seems they need support.

, Emotional release is the first stage of healing. Encourage them to express their feelings when you see them begin to become agitated. Don’t hesitate to touch or hold the child while they cry.Read a children’s book about death with them. While this might elicit some tears, it will also facilitate some potentially important conversations with the child.
Ask a young child who has just finished crying is they’d like to draw or tell you a story. Children sometimes struggle to convey things they are struggling with verbally, but may be more capable of expressing themselves creatively.

, Show the child that crying is perfectly normal and natural by allowing yourself to cry with them. Emotional pain is inevitable after a loss. Indicate that grieving is entirely appropriate by doing so yourself.Share a bit about what your feeling with children who are grieving. Admit that you are in immense pain yourself.
Encourage children to open up by saying things like, “I’m very sad that ______ died because I loved them deeply and it hurts that I won’t be able to see them anymore.”Be particularly open with older children, who will feel more comfortable expressing their emotional by crying if they see older people do so as well.

, At all ages, children need to express their grief, tell stories, and share their memories about the loved one they lost. Whatever their age when tragedy occurs, children will experience grief over the death of loved one throughout their childhood. Recognize and respect that intense periods of sadness may be frequent and long-lasting.Know that even when periods of intense sadness come less often, they will still come from time to time. Often, they will coincide with other emotionally intense parts of human life, particularly during times of transition, accomplishment, or celebration.
Even infants will experience suffering on account of someone they lost when very young. Be sure to allow a child who lost someone while very young to talk about it as it comes up later in their life.Always allow someone who has experienced a loss to openly share their feelings about it, as this will normalize a process of working through their sadness and processing intense emotional scenarios as they arise.
Know that it will get better. Though it’s far from everyone’s mind during periods of mourning, the experience of loss often contributes to personal growth. Children that suffer the loss of a love one often later report feeling more compassion towards other people, place greater value on personal relationships, and even develop a greater sense of appreciation for their own lives., Since children who are grieving can sometimes be hard to predict, it can be challenging to be sure a child is emotionally healthy following a significant loss.


If any of these signs develop, take the child to see a mental health professional:Extended depression, including loss of interest in events and activities the child used to enjoy.
Withdrawal from friends.
An inability to sleep or disinterest in eating.
An sustained, irrational fear of being alone.
Behaviour that is more characteristic of substantially younger children.
Excessive imitation of the dead person.
A sustained decline in academic performance of a blatant lack of effort.
Repetitive declarations of a desire to join the dead person.


Mental health professionals will know the best approach to handling grief at different ages. For all children, professional help will allow children to accept the reality of death and begin to grieve safely.
Connect your child with other children of a similar age who are going through or have experienced the loss of a loved one. There are support groups for specific ages, often organized according to how a loved one was lost. Involving a child in a support group of children their own age will help them feel less lonely in their grief."

Keep kids in their routine.,
Reminisce with the child about the person they’ve lost.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Help Your Children Grieve3," Routine is comforting for all people, and especially children. The importance of grieving is matched by the necessity of recognizing that life goes on despite the death of a loved one. While the loss of a significant person in anyone’s life often leads to a sense of emptiness that may never fully go away, your life and the life of your child will continue. A period of grief will deeply affect the way your child is feeling for some time, but grief cannot be allowed to dominate a child’s life.
If you are struggling with the weight of the grief you are experiencing, find a relative or friend that may be able to help keep your child’s normal routine. This may simply include having someone perform some daily task, such as bringing the child to a park or to school.

, The loving thoughts and memories associated with a lost loved one should be cherished and maintained.Keep and share photos. Consider making a scrapbook specifically in remembrance of the person the child lost.
Recall funny or otherwise enjoyable things the person that has passed had said or done.
Don’t avoid positive experiences based on the concern that it might sadden a child who may be reminded of someone they lost. Positive memories, though potentially emotion-inducing, actually contribute to a healthy grieving process.

, In order to be there for a grieving child and to set a good example of healthy grieving, you need to be able to cope with the loss you’re suffering from as well. Give yourself time to reflect and recover. Don’t rush the healing process for either yourself or your child. Live right. Sleep enough, eat a balanced diet, get some exercise. Get in the habit of maintaining your own routines.
Reach out to friends and other family members for emotional support. Be honest with those that care about you. Tell them about your frustration, anger, and sadness about what has happened.
Ask for help with everyday responsibilities, especially in terms of childcare, if you’re not able to keep up.
Speak with a counselor or therapist is you’re experiencing persistent depression or melancholia. ·
Join a group, either in person or online. There are helpful online communities that can help, particularly GriefNet.org.
The better you are able to handle your own grief, which includes being honest to yourself and others about the pain you’re experiencing, the better a child who is close to you will be able to cope with grief as well."

Hold an exploratory meeting with their parents.,
Ask the grandchildren for their ideas.,
Remain flexible.,
Gather together all the documents you will need.,
Look online for companies that specialize in arranging vacation trips for grandparents and grandchildren.",How to Take Care of Your Grandchildren on Summer Vacation1," Invite them to dinner to discuss the options. Consider your budgets and the grandchildren’s interests and ages. (If you live far away, get everyone on a conference call or use Skype.) Budgetary concerns to address include:


The amount of money the parents can contribute towards expenses.
The amount of money you can contribute towards expenses, including airfare, if needed.
The amount of spending money that can be allotted for each grandchild.;
, If you have more than one grandchild, try to accommodate the desires of each grandchild. This can be a little tricky, but you may be able to work out a plan that will ensure no one gets disappointed. If one grandchild wants to go camping and another one wants to visit a city, try to reach a compromise. Suggest a weekend camping trip and a weekend in the city. Perhaps one grandchild wants to go to the mountains, and another grandchild wants to go swimming at a beach. Try to combine the essence of each wish and plan a vacation destination to a mountain area that also has a lake for swimming. If you can’t reach a consensus, you may have to resort to drawing straws or flipping a coin. If finances are tight, honestly explain to your grandchildren the amount of money you can realistically spend on your shared vacation.

, Even if you want to provide an educational trip to a national monument or park for your grandchildren, be open to their wishes. The goal is to spend time together and have fun. If they think the perfect vacation is a week at a theme park, be willing to go along with it. Keep in mind that it is just one week for you; it’s a lifetime fond memory for them.

, You will be the temporary legal guardian when your grandchildren are with you, so be sure you have all the legal documentation you might need:


A notarized letter from the parents that gives permission for emergency medical treatment.
Copies of the grandchildren’s medical, dental and prescription insurance cards.
Certified copies of their birth certificates or their passports. If you plan to travel with your grandchildren in North America, and they are under the age of 15, you will have to have certified copies of their birth certificates. If you plan to travel internationally, your grandchildren will need passports, no matter what their ages. (Remind the parents that they should allow at least 6 weeks to apply for and to obtain any needed passports.)

, Planning a trip can be a lot of fun, but if you find it stressful or confusing, let a travel expert well versed in multigenerational vacations plan the trip for you. All the details will be taken care of beforehand, leaving you that much more time to enjoy your grandchildren.

"
"
Decide what you want to accomplish from your trip.,
Learn what research resources the area has available to you.,
Do as much preliminary research as you can before you travel.,
Learn where you're going before you go.,
Practice any skills you need to learn ahead of time.,
Identify and make copies of any genealogical research documents you need to take with you.,
Gather all necessary office supplies.",How to Take a Genealogy Vacation1," Because you cannot expect to answer all the questions you have about your ancestors in a single trip, you'll have to decide what information will be most important to you in the time you can devote to your genealogical research. Focusing on a specific ancestor or family unit will provide you with a goal for your trip and help direct you to the kind of resources that are available to further your research.


If you keep your genealogical research notes in a genealogical database program, you can search that program for the name of the place you intend to visit and print out reports for all family members who live(d) in that location, then highlight the spaces representing information you want to find.;
, Once you know which of your ancestors you want to learn more about, you can then investigate methods of learning what you want to know about that ancestor. You can find out what general resources are available from GenWeb or the LDS (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints � Mormon) Family History Library. You can also do an Internet search on the area to find out what libraries and cemeteries are in the area and use a people search site to obtain contact information for known friends and relatives.

, In addition to consulting online genealogical databases such as the LDS website and Ancestry.com, you can consult other websites to enable you to spend more of your research time during your trip looking at research materials than trying to find them.


Consult the Library of Congress Card Catalog to help you find books that have been written about the area you plan to visit. Although you can't borrow books from the Library of Congress, you may be able to find them at either a local library or a library in the area you plan to visit.
Check out the websites of any libraries you plan to visit on your trip, both to find out their hours of operation and to see if their catalogs are online to see if they have the books you're looking for. Also, many libraries maintain pages of genealogical resources they have available.
Visit the websites of any cities or counties you plan to visit to find out the names of area cemeteries and churches and the hours the county courthouse is open, as well as a list of other government offices that may be helpful in your research. Contact the cemeteries in advance to find out which cemetery your ancestor is buried in and when the caretaker will be available to answer your questions and the churches to arrange times to view their birth, baptism, confirmation, marriage, and death records.
Look for any local festivals or events that take place in the area and time you plan to visit during your genealogy vacation. While such festivals may make it harder for you to obtain lodging during that time, they may also provide you the opportunity to interview more people in a shorter period of time than if you went at another time or provide other family members with activities to enjoy while you're busy researching. (You'll need to contact city or county officials ahead of time to find out what the lodging situation is during such a festival and discuss the matter with family members to determine their interest in the festival's activities.)
Also check your local resources. Some larger city libraries maintain large collections of genealogical and historical resources, as do university libraries and state historical societies. If your city has an LDS Family History Center, you can obtain records from the main branch in Salt Lake City through it.

, Obtaining maps and driving directions to the places you plan to visit on your genealogy vacation will save you time while on your trip. Many websites provide driving directions through links to Mapquest, Google Maps, or another source. You can obtain state highway maps through a state's Department of Transportation, and you may be able to find and photocopy maps of cities in other countries at your local library or a university library.

, If you plan to photograph or make rubbings of tombstones and haven't done so before, practice on local gravesites. Also, if you're planning to travel to a foreign country, take some time to learn the language, as well as the geography and history of the area.

, Family group charts, pedigree charts, and research logs should be filled out as completely as you can before you go and then copied, with copies for each family member you plan to interview and the originals staying home. Also make copies of any photographs of people who you need to have identified.


If you're taking a laptop computer with you, have both digital and print copies of your information available, for your convenience in research and for the convenience of any interviewee not comfortable with looking at a computer screen. If you have an all-in-one printer/scanner/copier, you can scan in any documents and non-digital photographs to make whatever copies you need.

, Be sure to have along enough blank forms or other note-taking paper and pens and pencils (for facilities that don't allow the use of pens) with you, even if you do have a laptop computer along. Some major genealogical facilities will sell you forms, but having your own will save both time and money.

Have an honest discussion with the child.,
Use concrete images when talking about death.,
Avoid euphemisms.,
Be ready to answer questions.,
Decide whether or not to attend the funeral.,
Model healthy grieving.,
Encourage your child to express emotions.,
Read books about loss with your child.,
Watch for radical changes in behavior or grades.,
Contact a school guidance counselor or social worker.",How to Help Your Child When a Friend Dies," Death can be a confusing and traumatic event for children. It’s important to forge a supportive and open atmosphere so that they can begin to cope and to ask any questions that they may have. If one of your child’s friends has died, make yourself emotionally available.How you discuss death will depend a lot on your child’s age. Children have different developmental stages in understanding death – a toddler needs a different approach than an elementary schooler, who needs a different approach than a teen.
In general, don’t be afraid to talk about the event. Kids won’t benefit from “not thinking about it” or “putting it out of mind.” Not talking openly about a death can lead to confusion and anger in the long run.Talk to your child in the days immediately after the death. Don’t be surprised if your child is very quiet at first, but leave the door open, i.e. “You can come to talk with me any time, if you want to.”;
, Small children have a very literal way of seeing the world and won’t benefit from metaphors or abstract ideas about death. Instead, use very concrete explanations and images. This will help the child understand what has occurred.Keep it simple and limit your explanation about what happened, i.e. “Dear, your friend Kevin died in a car accident” or “Julia died last night at the hospital from cancer.” Adding extra information about the car crash or details about the disease can confuse a child.
Favor the word “dead.” You may need to explain to a small child what this means, again in concrete terms, i.e. “Death means that her body has stopped working.”
You will have to tailor what you say for your child’s age, obviously. You might have to explain to a small child that “Death means she’s gone and not coming back.” Older kids and teens will have a better understanding of death as a concept.

, Part of being open and straightforward in explaining the death of a child’s friend is to avoid euphemisms – that is, round about or sugar-coated ways of talking. Euphemisms will be lost on small children because they think so literally. For older kids and teens, such language may not be emotionally helpful.Avoid phrases like, “passed away,” “gone to sleep,” “gone to God,” or “taken to a better place.” The same holds for saying that you have “lost” someone.
Because children think literally, these phrases can be very confusing. They may not realize that the friend is permanently gone or may start to fear going to sleep or becoming “lost” themselves.
Feel free to include religious beliefs in the conversation, whatever they may be. However, avoid saying that God “took someone away.” A child might become afraid that God will take them away, too.

, Your child may have lots of questions about the death of a friend. It is important for you to answer these openly and honestly, again using concrete explanations. Keep it simple. It is also fine to admit when you don’t know something.Children might wonder if death is like going to sleep. Explain that during sleep the body still works, while with death it doesn’t. Be clear about the differences so that your child doesn’t start to fear sleeping.
Kids may also ask about pain, i.e. “Does it hurt to die?” You might say that doctors and nurses can use medicine to take away the pain and make it hurt as little as possible.
Be honest if your child asks more generally about death and whether he or she will die. Explain that everyone dies at some point, but that most people live for a long-time – and that someone will be there to look after your child if you yourself die.
Questions of meaning are harder. It’s OK to admit that you don’t know why your child’s friend had to die or say that you are upset and confused, too., Should you take your child to the funeral of a friend? The answer to this question is very personal. Your child should be able to join in any mourning ritual – but only if he or she wants to. Don’t pressure the child to do so.First, explain what your child will see at the funeral or memorial service, i.e. the friend’s body may be in a casket and there will be many others there, too.
Explain what will take place, as well. For example, other people will probably speak about the friend who’s died and other mourners may be crying. If you are religious, you can also share your faith’s spiritual beliefs about death and what these mourning rituals mean.
Make sure to respect your child’s wants at the funeral, too. Don’t force your child to stay if he or she wants to leave.

, Children learn how to cope with emotions and to grieve by watching what adults do. They are very aware of how you react to death and loss. That said, try to model healthy grieving. Sitting quietly, crying, and displays of emotion show children that these behaviors are natural and OK.It is OK for your child to see you cry. This can make the child more comfortable with showing his or her own emotions.
Your child should also know that it’s OK to feel strong emotions when a friend has died, like anger, sadness, and fear.

, Continue to model grief by encouraging your child to express how they feel in healthy ways. Allow adequate time and don’t press the child into resuming “normal” activities before they’ve had a chance to process and deal with the death.For example, you could give your child the chance to say a final goodbye by writing a letter for the graveside or casket or by releasing a balloon. You can also encourage your child to draw pictures or write poems or stories about the friend and how they feel.Put limits on grieving behavior, though. It’s normal for kids to react to death with some regressive behavior, but limit acting out and displays of physical aggression.

, One way that you can continue to help your child cope with the death of a friend is to read together. Find an age-appropriate book. Use the opportunity to read to your child, learn more about loss, and grow together.Ask for books about death and loss for children at your local bookstores or libraries. A librarian may be able to make recommendations. You can probably find them in sections on psychology.
Books like When Someone Very Special Dies, I Know I Made it Happen: A Gentle Book About Grief, or The Next Place may be appropriate.

, It’s perfectly normal and expected for your child’s behavior to change after the death of a friend. Kids may seem detached. They may show regressive or immature behavior or even become angry and lash out. Within limits, this is normal. But watch for any signs that your child may need extra help in coping.For example, act if your normally outgoing and loving child becomes angry, withdrawn, morose, or overly anxious. A counselor or school therapist can help deal with these emotions.
Pay attention to your child’s performance in school, as well. A noticeable drop in his or her grades could mean that the child is struggling and needs extra support.

, Reach out to people around your child who can offer help, like teachers, school guidance counselors, or social workers. Talk with staff at the school to explain that your child is struggling with mourning. It may take some time, even with help, for your child to come around again.Think about mentioning the situation to your child’s teacher, even if just in passing. That way, he will understand if your child acts out-of-character in the classroom.
You might also set up a meeting between your child and the guidance counselor. This can be private – just the counselor and your child – or you can ask to participate.

Learn to navigate without a phone.,
Stay in contact with those in your party.,
Avoid your email.",How to Survive Without the Internet on Vacation1," Getting used to being Internet-free means being resourceful.

If you prefer something smaller than a paper map, you can also check out an offline GPS app that will work for you without needing Internet access.Print maps ahead of time. If you’re printing them from the Internet, you can often print both long views and close ups to help you avoid getting lost.
Buy paper maps. They can come in handy if you need to detour while you’re traveling if roads are closed or traffic is bad.
Many cities and states provide maps for tourist on request. Request them for areas you'll be visiting. Your hotel or resort may also have helpful paper maps on-hand as well.;
, If you plan on splitting up, don't lose touch. With a little preparation, you can stay connected for emergencies, changes in your plan, or just to share something great you saw.

Buy walkie-talkies. Be warned: while some might say that they provide service up to thirty miles, that might only be in ideal conditions. They aren’t recommended for an emergency.
Use offline chat apps.This option is handy if you travel with teens that wander off on their own.
Pick specific meeting times and places. Make sure the entire party is aware of where and when, and that they understand that meeting up is mandatory.

, Even on vacation, emails pile up from work, friends, and family. Don’t let yourself focus on what you’re missing.

Set up an away message that includes your return date and an alternate contact.
Let the emails stack up. You can deal with them later.
Send letters and postcards. Instant communication lets us get lazy and sloppy. Brighten the day of a friend or family member with some good old-fashioned snail mail.

, While many beaches are just what you'd expect - sandy, breezy, and along the coastline - others can be rocky, close to volcanoes (as may be the case in Hawaii) or pose another type of inconvenience or even danger. Browse the web for current beach conditions and make sure to look for any notices or warnings of potential hazards.

, You can easily do this by logging on toWeather.com or another forecast site and check out the weather for the day you'll be visiting. Unless you have hotel reservations, if the weather says rain or thunderstorms, try rescheduling your visit to a later date if circumstances allow.

, If the beach you'd like to visit is more than a 4-5 hour drive away, it may be worth it to spend the night at a budget hotel or motel near the beach. Otherwise, just spending the day and returning home in the evening is more cost-effective on short notice.

In addition to planning activities during their stay, you may need to make some adjustments to your home before they arrive.


Make your home safe. If your grandchildren don’t live nearby and don’t often visit, chances are your home is not child-proof, especially if the grandchildren are very young. Go through each room in your home and assess it for hazards:
Remove or rearrange any furniture that has sharp edges.
Gather together and put away all small objects that may be choking hazards, or may cause accidental injury.
Cover electrical outlets and tape down extension cords.
Put away anything you don’t want to get damaged, or that can’t be replaced, such as fine china, delicate fabrics or family heirlooms.
Protect any furniture that can’t bear up under sticky fingers or spilled liquids.

, Ask the parents and the grandchildren about their favorite toys, puzzles, and games. Go shopping before your grandchildren arrive and select age-appropriate items. If possible, scour tag sales and flea markets to find bargains.

, Make up a bag or box full of inexpensive toys, books, and treats. You don’t need to go to any great expense, but having some special gifts and treats for each grandchild when they arrive will make them feel special.

, Purchase or borrow cots, rollaway beds or air mattresses. Don’t forget that you will need extra pillows, sheets, and blankets. Pick up some new pajamas, robes, and slippers for a special treat.

,, Some websites also provide discount admission coupons that you can download and print.

, Ask the parents beforehand what their limits for the grandchildren are for snacks, TV viewing, computer use, and video game use. Tell mom and dad you might bend the rules a little, but that you will be respectful of their wishes.

, As much as your grandchildren love you and want to spend time with you, they need to interact with other children, too.

, As soon as your grandchildren arrive, sit down and talk to them about house rules. Explain why certain objects or rooms are off limits. Tell and show them where they may go, with or without your permission. This is especially important if your grandchildren are teens.

, Children need some structure and guidelines, even when they are on vacation. However, they should be allowed to have a little more freedom and flexibility than they normally have at home. Let them stay up later than their regular bedtime at home. Give them special snacks and desserts, such as homemade ice cream sundaes. Let them leave their beds unmade once in a while.

, Looking like a researcher instead of a tourist and being focused will help you get both the co-operation and assistance of courthouse workers, librarians, and cemetery caretakers in finding the information you want.

, Let the people who are assisting you with your research know as precisely as possible what you're looking for. Identify the ancestor by name, date, and place of birth, and mention what records you've already checked, then ask, ""What other records do you have that can help me?""

, If you visit a cemetery during a funeral, while someone is purchasing a plot, or while maintenance work is being done, ask if there's a better time to return. Always thank the people who've assisted you, even if you don't find out any genealogical information.

"
"
Update your genealogical database.,
File your notes and documents.,
Share your discoveries with others.,
Consider what you want to do next.",How to Take a Genealogy Vacation3," If you had a laptop with you during your trip, you can handle this chore after each day's research on your trip; if not, do so as soon after you get home as possible.


If you have a large amount of information to input, make ""To Do"" and ""Done"" piles to keep track of what you've done and what you have left to do. This is also the time to add digital photos you've taken to your database program, if it accepts them.
If any of your new findings updates existing information, document both the change and the date you made the change, so that no one else accidentally ""corrects"" the information back to its original form later.
Back up your database before and after updating it.

, Filing your notes as soon as possible will be easier than waiting until you've forgotten exactly what's in the documents and have to read through them again to file them properly.


Scan key documents with your scanner, if you have one, particularly if you plan to refer to them regularly in your future research or integrate them into a published family history. You'll also want to photocopy them if you plan to show them to people you plan to interview at a later time.

, Let other family members know about what you've discovered, either through a family newsletter, email, website, or social media. You can also offer to share your research with the institutions you contacted to obtain it, if they keep collections of genealogies compiled using their research.


Include your name and address on any information you send so that others can contact you with questions or to offer updates.

, If the answers you find to your existing questions led to new questions about your family history, decide which of those questions you want to have answered and pursue the appropriate research paths to finding those answers.

Have your children's appropriate legal documents.,
Bring a backpack of toys and activities.,
Bring your car seat on the plane.,
Divide and conquer.,
Take precautions to guard against ear problems:


For babies: bring something they can suck on to help regulate their ears during the course of the flight, especially during ascent and descent.,
Take items for mess clean ups.,
Be flexible with your seating arrangements.,
Take snacks.",How to Travel With Children on Long Trips," Passports are now required for all children, including infants and toddlers, for international U.S. travel. Make sure to order them 4-6 weeks in advance to allow for their applications to be processed. Double check everything, as the last thing you want is to cancel a trip because your child's passport application was denied for lack of information. If you don't need a passport to travel, still remember to take a copy of your children's birth certificates. The cut-off age for lap children is two years old. Some airlines don’t ask for a birth certificate and some do. So to be on the safe side, keep a copy of your children’s birth certificates in your purse/bag. Of course, if you have a passport, you will not need to bring birth certificates as the passport will provide complete authentication.;
, Kids like being in charge, so give them something to be in charge of. A backpack is perfect because it stays put, unlike a bag which can slip off their shoulder and you end up with one more thing to carry; just don't make it too heavy for them. Not only is this useful in-flight/on-board entertainment but it'll serve a dual purpose of amusing the kids once you reach your destination. Put in all your favorite ideas, including these suggestions:


Books. There’s never enough time in the day to read to the kids, so take advantage of the opportunity of the long plane, train or car ride for some one-on-one time. Pack your kids' favorite books for you to read or easy-reader books for them to read by themselves. There’s no reason to plug their brains into electronics for the whole journey. Expand their imagination through the endless possibilities in a good book!
Coloring Books. Coloring books can be a great distraction and can help get out a little scribbling energy. A favorite coloring tool is Crayola’s ""Color Wonder"" markers and paper. They’re great because the markers only write on Color Wonder paper, which means your little ones leave no evidence behind! Also try dollar stores for coloring books you won't mind them half-completing and being discarded for the sake of extra space.
Comfort Toys for Small Children. Throw in a favorite blanket or bear for small children. It may help them snuggle down for quiet time or just help get through a bumpy patch of air or a tedious part of the drive. You can never have enough props for entertaining that last 20-30 minutes of a flight when everyone is impatient to get off! Favorite games to play with a blanket or cuddle friend are ""peek-a-boo"" and ""pat-a-cake"".
DVDs and Personal DVD Players. A laptop with a DVD drive works just as well as a personal DVD player. Bring along a set of earphones (or a splitter so you can have two sets of earphones), so your child's viewing of his/her favorite movie or TV show doesn’t interfere with the comfort of others. Although, if you are taking a plane flight, you can save on space and rely on the in-flight entertainment. Best suited to car travel.
Electronic Games. Hand held games are extremely popular for older kids and can keep them quiet for hours. Bring along a set of earphones so your child’s favorite game doesn’t interfere with the comfort of others. A long plane or car trip might be a good time to invest in a new game for a special surprise!
Sticker Books. Reusable sticker books are great for early elementary age kids. You can find them in your child’s favorite TV/movie character or interest. And because they’re reusable you can create new scenes, stories or just mix them up for fun!
Boards. Pegboards are fun for all ages of children: young children can just fit them into the slots, middle-aged children may make patterns, and older children can make designs. Geoboards are great for children over 3 years old. Children can make shapes or designs with the rubber bands. Felt or flannel boards are great for making scenes with felt figures. Magnetic boards also serve this purpose, they just use magnetic figures instead of felt ones. Try activity boards for young children, these can be purchased at the store, as well as dressing boards. These are great because all of the pieces are attached, so you won't loose anything. They are easy to store, and have long playing value for toddlers and young preschoolers.
Pretend play. Children love acting like adults and can learn adult ways from pretend play. Pack according to age: plastic keys made for babies for infants and toddlers, real ones for preschoolers. Also consider:
a wallet with play money and cards
a camera
a map
a compass
a doll with a blanket and a bottle or other simple item

, One way to rein in a fidgety toddler is to take their car seat on the plane. Young kids behave much better in a familiar car seat, which keeps everyone happy. They can rest and fall asleep more easily in their car seat because it reminds them of riding in the car. Check with your airline first that this is permissible before lugging it down to the airport. Car seats also make for greater entertainment for younger children and make you not have to carry so many toys. Attach an unbreakable mirror to the soft side of the car seat, and a play steering wheel and keys to the side with the hard arms (though these may be soft at times, depending on the car seat). Suction toys are popular for the car seat tray, if the car seat has one.

Attach up to 4 entertainment items on the car seat, then bring along some string or ribbon to attach small toys to the car seat. Also, many toy companies make toys that are attachable to the car seat. Changing the toys every so often is well worth it, for infants and toddlers.







, Don't lose the kids, especially if you have more than one to keep an eye on. Decide ahead of time who is in charge of which child. This will eliminate the heart-sinking question “Where is so-and-so?? with the answer of “I thought you were watching him?"" Miscommunication and lost children are not a good way to start a vacation!

, Airline flights can be quickly spoiled by a little one with an earache! Some ideas to try: Bottles of juice and/or water, pacifier, jello jigglers with extra Knox gelatin (this is messy but the kids love it!), or any Gerber baby type snacks. They dissolve quickly in the mouth eliminating a choking hazard (read safety precaution on the label before buying). Try such snacks as ""Gerber stars"" (lots of flavors), fruit snacks (these start dissolving almost instantly) and baby cereal bars. As of August 2006, such snacks and gel products may be prohibited under tight new security regulations. Check with the airline or government transport security sites for prohibited items.
For toddlers and older children: toddlers and older kids don’t always understand how to regulate their ears by just swallowing, so a little help is sometimes required. Try Starbursts because they take a long time to chew and a lot of saliva begins flowing, which to keeps the child swallowing. Some other ideas are fruit snacks, gum and hard candy (for older children). Again, check with your airline or government transport security site to see what is and what isn't permitted to be carried on board.

, Keep a bag of wipes, hand sanitizer and disposable bags for dirty diapers nearby. Baby wipes can clean up almost anything—even something spilled on carpet. Hand sanitizer is a must for traveling with kids and those disposable bags are good for containing messy stuff besides diapers! And don't forget to bring your favorite brand of stain remover wipes or pens for those times when the baby wipes just aren't enough. As of August 2006, very strict security regulations are in place which may impact on which of these items you can take on a plane.

, If you’re traveling with a group, or a large number of family members, it might be fun to let your children choose which adult they want to sit by. If they don’t see Uncle Bob very often and want to sit by him (and Uncle Bob is okay with the idea), then relinquish parental control for a few hours. It’s a great time to talk and tell stories with people you don’t get to see every day. And the parents have a small rest!

, Snacks, snacks and more snacks! Snacking keeps children busy and entertained. So pack your kids favorites for your long journey. The healthier the better - try carrot sticks, celery pieces, permitted nuts, gummy bears etc.

Immerse yourself in activities.,
Learn about the culture.,
Exercise.,
Unplug.",How to Survive Without the Internet on Vacation2," When you're active, your body releases endorphins which elevate your mood.The enjoyment you get from the activities will keep you from focusing on the ""loss"" of the Internet.

Eat. You don’t need the internet to tell you ratings if the restaurant you just walked past smelled amazing.
Play a game. Card games, dominoes, and even board games are great ways to spend time with others.
Visit an arcade. Be a pinball wizard, throw a few skee balls, or kill some zombies.
Attend a mixer. Hotels and resorts often have happy hours and events for the residents to attend.

, Instead of holing up in your room with your computer or your phone, giving up the Internet allows you to find out what’s around you. You can soak in the local ambiance and connect with your vacation spot.

Find museums or landmarks. Many sites offer audio-guided tours that allow you to fully experience the things you see without the need for Google.
Find local music. You may decide to try out a dance class or just listen to what the area has to offer.

, Physical activity gets your blood and adrenaline pumping. Even if you’re not an exercise junkie, there are plenty of ways to work out that don’t feel like work. In addition to the exercise, you may also be able to learn something about your vacation spot or see something new.

Take a walking tour or hike. If you choose to hike, look for a local guide to keep from getting lost.
Use your hotel or resort's amenities. Most resorts have a gym, a basketball court, a lap pool, or more.
Do some yoga. Hit up a local class around town.
Mix exercise with adventure. Try extreme sports like wind surfing, sky-diving, bungee jumping, or whitewater rafting.

, Sometimes you have to do nothing in order to feel that you're doing something. Allow yourself to slow down and take in your experiences. Go out and enjoy nature. Spending time outside can help to relieve your stress. Enjoy the sights, listen to the sounds, take in the smells, and view the landscapes around you.If you're at a hotel or spa, take advantage of services or amenities that can take your stress away. You could lounge at a pool (remember to use sunscreen and keep hydrated!) or get a massage, a manicure and pedicure, or a facial.
You can also meditate. Take time to be alone with yourself. You’ll be surprised at how differently you perceive yourself and the world around you after you’ve been alone with your thoughts. Sleep. Bring a sleep mask and some quiet music to listen to.Read. Immerse yourself in other worlds and let this one slip away.

"
"
Take photos.,
Draw for a rewarding visual memory.,
Journal to bring home your memories in a written form.",How to Survive Without the Internet on Vacation3," You don’t need your phone to capture the world around you. To remember your vacation and share those memories with others, you can grab a disposable camera or bring a Polaroid camera. The latter type of camera has come back into style. Some of the new styles even allow you to take photos on sticker paper, and others have a digital component where you can save the file before you print it out, allowing you to have both a physical and a digital copy.

Alternatively, you could seek out a photo booth. Many tourist spots – and even some stores – have a photo booth so you can capture fun memories. While most require cash, some now take credit cards.
Buy a waterproof disposable camera if you would like to take pictures near a body of water.

, There’s an artist hiding inside you! Take the time to observe and transfer what you see to paper. Let others see your vacation through your eyes, or keep the drawings to yourself. Start by doing quick sketches - spend five minutes committing the scene to paper. Don’t worry about getting every detail.

Try blind contour drawings. To do this type of drawing, avoid looking at the paper. Look only at the subject. Keep your pen or pencil on the paper, and give yourself over to creativity. You’ll get an abstract image, but the more you do, the more life you’ll breathe into your drawings. Take home rubbings. This technique is very popular at old historic sites and cemeteries. Lay a piece of paper over a hard surface, then rub a stick of chalk, charcoal, or even a crayon over the surface to get an imprint of what’s on the other side., Writing can give you a chance to think about what you’re doing, allowing you a fuller, more rounded experience. A journal can help you remember a funny conversation you overheard or something you’ve never seen before. It doesn’t take long to make a note about something unique, and the time you spend writing will provide you time to reflect on the enjoyment you’re having. You can bring a journal with you or buy one on location if you’re looking for some local flair.

Jot down thoughts about your vacation as they occur to you.
Pen an essay. You can keep it to yourself or even share it as a blog post once you’re home again.
Write poetry. Allow the inspiration from your new surroundings to fill you up.

Listen to the teen.,
Validate their feelings.,
Be aware of when the parent died.,
Understand the relationship the teen had with their parent.,
Allow them the space and time to grieve.,
Share a personal story of grief.,
Continue supporting them.",How to Help a Teen Who Lost a Parent1," The emotions associated with losing a parent can be very confusing. Helping them feel heard and valued is the most important role that you can play. Listen to their needs without judgment and try to meet them.If you are unsure how to help them, say something like “What can I do to support you?”;
, Every death is different. Some deaths are sudden. Other deaths are long, drawn out processes. There is no “right” or “wrong” way for a child to feel after their parent has died. Avoid comparing their loss to any loss that you have experienced.


Try saying something like, “I can't imagine how hard this is for you. I am so sorry that you have to experience it.”
Avoid telling them to “get over it” or “move on with their life.”
On the other side of things, if the child is doing okay, do not try to make it more of an issue than it is. Let them guide you on how much they want to talk about it. You do not want to traumatize someone who is actually doing okay by making a big deal out of the event and forcing them to regress.

, Know if they died recently. Find out if the death was sudden, or expected because of prolonged illness. This will help you understand how long the teen has been grieving and how they are moving along in the grieving process.

, Some teens adore their parents, others may have abusive or neglectful parents that they harbor harsh feelings toward.Even if the teen despised their parent, they will still need to grieve and cope after a death.
Understand that many teens who had harsh feelings toward their parents will regret not having a better relationship. Keep this in mind and say things like “I know you may not have had the relationship you wanted with your parent(s), but it is clear that there was some love there and you should allow yourself some time to heal.”

, Grieving is a natural process after a death but it may be a process that makes them uncomfortable. The mourning process looks different on everyone. Grief will change and take different forms throughout the teen’s life, but it will never end. If they ask for space, let them have it. Be there when they need you, but if you can tell that they are overwhelmed by your presence, give them time to process their feelings.Respect their privacy. If the teen says that they need space, respect that. Some people grieve privately instead of publicly.Just make sure you keep the lines of communication open. You might say, ""I'll wait for you to call if you need, but I'm always here.""

, Sharing your personal story will make you seem more human and authentic to a teen. It may also help them to feel like discussing their grief is not a burden on your relationship. Tell them about a hard time that you went through, especially if it relates to their age.If you had a close aunt or uncle (or a parent) die early in life, you can share that story with the teen you are mentoring.

, Grief can persist long after the death of the parent. The teen is likely to need your continued support throughout their teenage years and maybe into adulthood. Be there when they need help and give them someone to lean on.

Make the fact that you cannot help them explicit at the time they let your know they're headed your way.,
If they ask you for accommodation outright, be diplomatic and polite.,
If money is an issue, consider whether you can help fund their stay.,
Be sure to make good on any promises you've made to them about spending time with them during the day.,
If you want to see your relatives but you don't want them to stay with you, avoid inviting them.",How to Suggest Your Relatives Stay in a Hotel Rather Than Your Home," It isn't fair on anyone to have the possibility hanging in the air. You could say something as simple as: ""We'll be happy to spend the weekend days with you when we've time off from work and we know some fantastic places to stay."" That makes it very clear that you have no intention of putting them up.;
, You don't want to create bad feeling between you. The way in which you approach this will make all the difference between icy relations and outright acceptance of the need to find their own accommodations. Use your personal needs as the reason for asking them to stay somewhere else. This is much more thoughtful than suggesting it has anything to do with them, even if that is the case! For example:


""I'd love to have you stay but I am having a really hard time at work currently and I've got all the work manuals and laptops piled up in the guest room because I need to work there till really late at night. I won't be able to make a change in this habit while you're visiting because the deadlines are looming.""
""Little Rachel's been very upset at school lately and we are doing a lot of things to ensure her routine is as stable as possible. At the moment, this means we just can't have guests because it'd create instability for her. I do hope you understand how important this is to us. We can suggest some great places to stay near us and we'll catch up for meals each night.""
""Oh we'd love to have you but our house is just too small. We don't have a guest bedroom and we're not able to ask the kids to share rooms because they're all doing exams at the moment. We can give you some ideas of good places to stay though.""

, For examples, if it's your parents and you really don't want them getting on your spouse's nerves but you know they're skint, see if you can shout them the accommodation. Given that you live locally, you'll have the opportunity to scout out the best bargains in the nicest locations and to look for a good deal. Even though you end up paying, this can be a great sanity saver and also maintains family goodwill.

, You're making a trade off to give yourself peace and space in your home and in return, you do need to take them to see places, and perhaps to shout them a dinner or two.

, Consider visiting their city or town instead and put yourself up in local accommodation to avoid the hassle of obliging them to have you to stay.

Understand that special days will be difficult.,
Share your memories about their parent.,
Help them to remember the good times with their parent.,
Ask if there is a way the teen would like to honor their parent.",How to Help a Teen Who Lost a Parent2," Help the teen come up with a healthy way to deal with all of the “firsts”, such as the first Christmas or the first birthday without their parent. Come up with a plan for these days so they know what to expect.Include the teen when planning the day.
Allow the teen to talk about — or not talk about — their parent that day, whichever they feel like doing. Follow their lead in how much they want to talk about it.
Don’t be afraid to try something new, especially if a special day didn’t go well in the past.

, If you knew their parent when they were younger or outside their home environment, share these stories with the teen. It will be refreshing for the teen to remember how many great experiences their parent had in their lifetime. Share as many happy memories as possible.For example, you might tell the teen about the time you and their deceased parent went ice skating and fell ten times.
You might also tell them about the first time you met their parent.

, Encourage the teen to share these memories with you, too. This will help them feel connected to their deceased parent as they work through the grief. It will also give them a chance to think about their parent in a happy way as opposed to being focused on the death.Prompt stories by saying things like “Do you remember that time you and your parents went to the art museum?”
You can also encourage them to write or express their feelings and stories in other artistic ways.

, This can include creating a memorial to them, planting a garden, writing a poem, or donating to a charity in their honor. This can help the teen feel as though their parent’s importance lives on.

Become a parental figure in their life.,
Learn about the parent that was lost.,
Watch for warning signs.,
Know what holidays are hard.",How to Help a Teen Who Lost a Parent3," Many teens who have lost a parent as a child seem to be searching for someone to fill that void in their teenage years. Be open to the idea of guiding and mentoring the teen during these difficult years. Strive to be a positive role model for the teen and avoid exposing them to destructive behaviors. This may also include supporting the teen emotionally or financially.


This is a very delicate situation and it's important to remind the teen that you are not trying to replace their parent, but to help honor them by supporting the teen.

, The teen you are mentoring will appreciate your genuine concern for their lost parent. It will give them a chance share memories (if they have them) and family stories. Also, make an effort to understand the circumstances around the parent’s death. This will help you be more sensitive around tough topics.For example, if you know the teen’s parent died in a car accident, you might be more patient if the teen seems timid in the driver’s seat.

, Although grief takes many forms, some methods of grieving can cause long-term damage. Be sure to watch for signs of drinking, drug use, or other harmful methods of grieving and try to guide the teen to healthier methods of grieving.Warning signs of dangerous behavior can be subtle. People are unlikely to witness drinking or drug use directly, but may observe lying, significant weight loss, changes in sleeping patterns, etc.
Suggest a physical activity to help channel their grief into something positive and healthy. Running, hiking, or yoga are all great physical activities that could help alleviate stress and center your emotions.
If the teen discusses thoughts of suicide or hurting themselves, seek professional help immediately.

, Grief can last for a long time, especially in children and teens. Find out if there are any specific days that are more difficult for the teen. Many teens will struggle with holidays such as Christmas, or the deceased parent’s birthday.Try to avoid downtime during these days. Keeping the teen busy will help distract them from their sadness.
Be sure to remember their parent on this day. Say things like “I know you miss your parent(s), and you should keep them in mind and try to enjoy the day.”

"
"
Seek therapy or counseling for yourself.,
Remember to eat well.,
Get adequate rest.",How to Help a Teen Who Lost a Parent4," You cannot provide anyone emotional support if you are not emotionally stable. Do not lean on the teen to be a source of support for you. Many adults treat teenagers as adults during times of grief instead of treating them as adolescents.If individual therapy does not seem like your cup of tea, consider a support group or an online chat room.

, If you are also grieving, you may find it difficult to eat anything at all. Be intentional about eating. Low blood sugar makes people irritable. You will provide better emotional support to the teen if you are well nourished.Make a meal for you and the teen to share or take them out to eat. Sharing a meal with someone is very therapeutic.

, Resting may be particularly difficult if you are the surviving parent. Being lonely and grieving can interfere with your sleeping, but you will be much more helpful to the teen if you are not exhausted or cranky. Leave yourself ample time to sleep."

Consider buying a zoo membership.",How to Plan a Zoo Trip with Kids," Checking the zoo's homepage before you pick a day for your trip will keep you updated on the daily schedules and any special events you could see if you visit on specific days. Make sure these are included in the price of admission or be prepared to pay extra.;
, Many animals will be most active in the morning right when the zoo opens and after feeding. Zoos will also receive new animals from time to time, so keep an eye out for new arrivals.


Take into account the weather. Some animals, such as elephants, might be more active after the rain.
Take into account the time of year. Animals from warmer climates may not be able to tolerate the cold weather, and are placed inside for the winter. If you want to avoid large crowds don’t plan your trip on a major holiday. Instead plan to go on a weekday if you can. Try to see popular animals or exhibits early in the day, such as pandas, which almost always draw a line. , Plan your trip around the animals that your kids want to see. Do some research on their favorite animals. It will make the experience more memorable and also educational.


Checking out a book about your child’s favorite animal can excite them about the zoo trip while also reinforcing the experience afterwards. Respect your child’s sensitivities and avoid animals that they might be afraid of. For example, if your child doesn’t like snakes, be sure to stay away from the reptile house.

, Based on your research and talking with your kids, list all the animals, exhibits, or events that you want to see, keeping in mind the timing of special events such as demonstrations, shows, or feedings.

, Find a map of the zoo, either online, in a free zoo app, or from a kiosk once you get there. To avoid backtracking, plan the best route to take so you don’t miss any of the sites.

, Most zoos have play zones for kids. Mark these on your map to let the kids blow off some steam.

, Don’t forget to allot time for lunch. If you’re planning on buying lunch, find cafes or restaurants that your kids would enjoy. If you’re looking to save money, find a picnic area or even a bench to stop, rest, and eat a sack lunch.

, If your children are hands-on, be sure to include a stop to the petting zoo on your route. Most zoos have a small area dedicated for this. Looking at animals all day that they can’t touch can be unbearable for some kids, so this can provide much needed some relief.

, If it is a long trip, plan accordingly by giving the kids something to keep them occupied.


If you have a smartphone, you could download some mobile apps games or fun math games for kids to keep them from getting bored. Play some music they enjoy or a few interesting books or keep them engaged with fun road trip games like “How Many Trucks Do You See?” You definitely don't want a bunch of grumpy kids on your hands before the outing has even begun.

, If you plan to bring a baby, don't forget to bring plenty of diapers, baby food, pacifiers, and extra clothing.

, If possible, bring a wagon or stroller if your kids are too young to walk long distances or if they tire easily. Otherwise, you might find yourself having to carry them!

, It’s important to carry plenty of water, especially in warmer months. Bring a water bottle you can refill once you're there. The zoo will probably sell bottled water, but this can quickly get expensive.

, Most of the zoo will be outside, so be sure to wear sunscreen and bring extra to use once you’re there.

, Check the weather before you go, and bring an umbrella if it looks like rain. If you’re not wanting to carry around an umbrella all day, you can also pack plastic ponchos.

, To make the most of your ticket price, get to the zoo when it opens and plan to be there all day. Getting there early will also help you see the animals when they’re most active and beat the lines for the popular exhibits.

, The zoo might have a cafe but it's probably too expensive and the queues too long so it's a good idea to pack a lunch from home and get the kids to help out.


Don’t bring messy food. Chocolate is a definite no-no; fresh fruit, pretzels and sandwiches are your best bet since they are non-messy and will keep in a small cooler. Try to pack some snacks for mid-morning and early evening hunger pangs.

, Many cities have a reciprocal agreement with the aquarium, other attractions, or even nearby hotels. If you are visiting a city and plan to see other major attractions check if there is a “city pass” or something similar. Some zoos will even have particular days or months when kids get in free with a paying adult. , If you plan to go to the zoo often, it might be worth buying a membership. These typically come out cheaper than buying individual tickets every time you go to the zoo. Zoo memberships also often have reciprocal deals with a city’s aquarium, so you could get access to both venues.

While everyone is responsible for their own itineraries (like plane flights) and special needs, someone is orchestrating the master schedule so that everyone can be on the same page. In this way, decisions can be made quickly, there’s a central point of contact for most everything and it reduces confusion and malaise.;
, Usually everyone has a few places they’d really like to go to. Others have certain places that they absolutely don’t want to or can’t go to. Everyone has some level of budget restriction.

There’s nothing like being able to stroll into the living room to watch a late night movie with whoever is staying up. Conversations need not be interrupted prematurely and plus there’s always a central base that is the hub of activity.
Cruise – the ultimate in convenience. You don’t have to worry about food and you unpack only once. Make sure you get rooms reasonably near each other or else you risk spreading the hub of activity.
Tours – Some tour companies can customize a tour for your family if you have a minimum number of people in your group. Many view tours as a the great way to learn more about a place while others may view tours as being too restrictive.
Hotels / Resorts – suites are a great way to pack more people together and to save on costs by cooking. For large get-togethers though it can be somewhat impersonal because hotel rooms are too small to accommodate everybody for a chat or to play a game and so you end up with dispersed mini-groups within the get together. If you have to book multiple hotel rooms, try to get them all in one wing or even suites that connect if possible. Look for the group discount too -- depending upon the size of your group you may qualify.
Family member's house – choosing one family member’s house to congregate is definitely the cheapest option. You never have to worry about picking the right restaurant and stocking up is easy to do. There are certainly many other wonderful options, like working ranches, Disney World, RV, houseboat, camping, renting that castle in Scotland, taking that trip around America on Amtrak but the key is to get the commitment first. As soon as you agree, start booking. Once people are committed, meaningful planning goes a lot faster and easier.

, You could do this via email, but you will be inundated with a myriad of emails that will add even greater confusion. One source that we have found to be great is to use a group website like PBWiki, where family members can add their own information


Have everyone put their flights in the group calendar - this makes it easier to coordinate airport pickups and car rental configurations.
Put local resources and maps in the group site so that everyone will have the latest and greatest information
Place everyone’s cell phone number, pager, instant messenger handles, etc. for quick communication online. Add any other important information such as visa’s, shots, temperature and weather patterns and provide that information to all family members.
Consider booking a few restaurant reservations before your trip. If you have a large group, trying to find a decent restaurant last minute that can accommodate a large party may be impossible.
Make an online shopping list - have all family members add things that they would like to eat, snack, beach toys etc. Think about setting up a WalMart or Costco run as your first order of business when you get there so you can stock up on the things you need early.

, Nothing can sap the fun out of a vacation than somebody who can’t roll with the punches – and especially for the person who is organizing or helping to organize the vacation. No vacation works out exactly as you plan. Remember that you are having a vacation and that means having fun, not making sure everything on the planned itinerary is checked off. Also I usually only plan at most 2 things in a day. Getting so many people coordinated is difficult already and any transitions between activities takes more time than you think. Somebody always wants to visit that gift shop for a little bit extra time or to take that side diversion and you have to be able to accommodate for that.

, The purpose of a family vacation is to have family spend time with each other and especially to engage with each other in conversation. A couple of ideas to make sure you include everybody and increase those memorable moments…


Cooking meals together – it’s certainly cheaper to eat inside but the bigger benefit is that you get people working together in the kitchen talking. And there’s nothing like being able to share your food repertoire with your family members. (have an online sign-up sheet where families can sign-up for dinner duty)
Slide show – family slide shows are only boring to those who aren’t in the family. Seeing baby pictures, embarrassing photos and swapping stories are a great way to get the family laughing together. PowerPoint and a projector are the best way but bringing a DVD with all of the goods is another great way to get some great laughs.
Video Games? -- well it depends. For most families, banning video games are essential to prevent the children from spending their entire vacation in front of the television. However there are many group participation games that are a blast for groups. On the Wii for instance, there’s Rock Band, Karaoke type games and a multitude of brain teaser and puzzler games that are fun for everybody.
Exercise – the Kennedy’s aren’t the only ones who play football when they get together. Get people out on the court, get some exercise and have some fun.

, It’s good to work out a system with regards to shared costs early so there is no misunderstanding. Some families prefer to spend everything separate by family while others pay up front and say “pay me later.” For the latter, it’s important to work out a good way to distribute the costs fairly. Some families keep track of every dish that is ordered and while that is clearly the fairest way, it’s also requires the most effort. In my last vacation we had 4 families. For shared costs like meals, we split it up by number of adults and number of kids (we counted each kid as half an adult) so that we could simplify the calculation. It’s never perfect, but why worry about nickel and dime among family. Everyone should keep their receipts and ideally, you spend the last day putting stuff into a spreadsheet so that you can settle up that day or at least soon after the vacation.

, Spend a little time on the last day talking about what you want to do for the next vacation. You can get a lot done talking about it in person in a group versus over email or over the phone and plus you’ll be fresh with the knowledge of what worked well and what didn’t.

, - make sure everyone gets back fine by sending an email or making a phone call. Do some photo sharing and if you are enterprising, put together a photo book using services like http://www.shutterfly.com and http://www.blurb.com so that you can always remember the good times.

, If you have limited car space, use strict limitations. It's a good idea to include change for a laundromat, should you get stranded at your destination. Or, you could have everyone pack half the amount of outfits as they'd need, and do the laundry on the day they run out.

, A road map from your last road trip to your destination in 1990 will be outdated. Highlight your planned route.

, This should include a cellular phone, matches, flares and a car starter.

, If you are driving with kids, give them plenty of activities to do, especially if your destination is a long ways from your home. One possibility would be purchasing a dual screen portable DVD player so the kids can watch movies.

, If you need, stop at rest stops or the side of the road to stretch your legs or take a power nap. Coffee will not help you stay awake.

If there are boundary problems, be polite and respectful. Make sure you are not attacking her about something she may be unaware of doing.
Your spouse may be the better person to talk to his or her mother about boundary issues. This may be a better idea than you talking to her, especially if your relationship with your mother-in-law is contentious.
Telling her things like, ""In our household, this is how we do things"" or ""We think this is important in our house"" will let her know that you have your own priorities that may be different from hers.

, When your mother-in-law visits, it can disrupt your normal family routine and dynamics. Be consistent with your regular schedule. Don’t fall into old patterns because your mother-in-law is around.Make decisions as you normally would. Your mother-in-law is a guest.

Don’t talk about religion with your mother-in-law. This is especially a good idea if you know there are differences when it comes to religion. Regardless, make sure to not spend too much time on discussions of religion if could be a point of contention. Say things like ""Well, everyone has their own beliefs"" if disagreements come up.
This may be obvious, but don’t talk about sex with your mother-in-law. It’s uncomfortable and can cause problems in your relationship with your spouse.

, Mother-in-laws love giving advice. Listen to them politely if they offer advice. However, don’t feel obligated to follow their advice.Let your mother-in-law give you advice. Even though you may disagree with her, it’s better to let her talk than cutting her off or disagreeing with her.

Talk to your in-laws.,
Become comfortable around them.",How to Make Your In Laws Like You," If anyone knows your in-laws, it's your spouse. You should try to find out what they do and do not like in people so you know how to act around them. You may find out that your in-laws do not like when someone is ""too nice"", so to speak.;
, Any person's family want their family member to be happy and loved. Any hint this is not the case and they will begin to form negative opinions. Never argue or have a spat in front of your partner's family. Not only will the family side with your family making you outnumbered it is a source of embarrassment to your partner to have you act in that manner.

, Do not try to come between your partner and their family. Not only will this create issues within your relationship but will instantly put your in-laws offside. If you have a troublesome in-law, speak respectfully to your partner in private and ask them to address the person or issue. Do not take the lead in someone's else family unless it is an urgent or unsafe issue.

, Be the role model they need to live up to. Unless they've done something terrible (such as abused your spouse or something of that nature), treat them with respect. Respect goes a long way, and you might find them being able to open themselves up easier to you.

, If you put up an attitude, your in-laws are less likely to take to you. However, if you say your please and thank-you's, they will most likely see you as a friendly, approachable person.


Use good manners in their presence. Be on your best behavior. If you're invited to their home for a meal, take a bottle of wine or something appropriate. Always offer to assist in the kitchen and offer to clean up. Remembering simple courtesies like that will go a long way to a positive reception.







, Remember they have been a family for longer than you have known them and have established their own customs and norms. While you personally might not like certain things, you are not in a position to assert authority over them or demand like a diva they do things your way.

, This will most likely cheer them up about seeing you, as well as making you appear friendly.

, Gifts are a great way to show how much you like someone. Find out what kinds of things your in-laws are into, and give them presents. Make sure you remember birthdays!

, You can talk about an array of things. Discuss what you both have in common. Doing this will often lighten the atmosphere, and you may be surprised to find how many similar likes you both have. Try to avoid arguments, as that can quickly turn into bitterness against you.


Get to know your in-laws as people. Everyone has a story to tell and things to learn about each other that help form the common basis of all relationships. Get to know your in-laws as people not just someone you have to interact with. This may open up new perspectives on the reasons they act or do things the way they do. It also greatly helps when it comes time to buying gifts.







, If you act tense and uncomfortable around them, they may become the same way. Your in-laws may become offended if you act distanced from them, and may think that you do not like them.

While you may not be able to accommodate everyone’s concerns, be mindful that a five year old, a teenager, and a grandparent are likely to have different needs and interests.Talk ahead of time, before a specific destination has been planned. Ask each family member whether this destination and the possible activities could be of interest.
Explain to each family member that they each have a say in the situation, but that there will be compromises from time to time.
Accept that disagreements will arise. Try to come to a consensus that can appeal to the majority of family members. While there needs to be a set destination, allow for flexibility once at the location in terms what activities are planned.;
, If you are traveling with a bunch of young kids, you will likely need more time to travel from point A to point B. Kids may need more rest time, more breaks, and get more distracted. Make sure to add additional time into the trip so that you don’t get too frustrated by being late or delayed.Talk as a family about realistic expectations about travel time and possible delays. Make it clear that traveling long distances could include traffic jams or flight delays.
For example, if you are traveling for a family vacation by plane with two young kids, make sure to factor in extra time for check-in and airport security.

, While it may seem odd to think that you need to rest before your vacation, this may be exactly what you need if the family vacation involves of lot of activities and expectations. Don't overload yourself with work, school, or other obligations right up until you leave for vacation.

Engage in self-care before your travels.

Don't plan major activities or parties right before your family vacation.
Give yourself some extra time to rest or sleep. Focus on low-key activities and lots of sleep a week before the vacation.
Avoid putting major work or other deadlines a few days before you leave. This will create unnecessary stress before you go.
Consider planning big family vacations outside of high holiday times, such as Thanksgiving or Christmas, so that you are less overwhelmed by high expectations from other relatives and friends.

, Consider filling a bag or backpack with activities and games that appeal to each family member. This way, if there’s a long car, train, plane, or bus ride, then they have a bag of activities to keep them focused. Consider putting these types of activities and games in their bags, depending on their ages:For younger kids, put in travel games like Mad Libs, simple puzzles, coloring books, crayons, and their favorite stuffed animals.
For teens, put in gadgets like tablets with built-in games, e-readers, teen magazines, music players, young adult books, and travel journals for writing.
For adults, fill bags with books, magazines, crosswords, tablets with games, and comfortable pillows or blankets.

, When kids and adults are restless, it may be partly due to hunger. Make sure to have snacks easily accessible, particularly on longer drives. This can help to soothe a kid’s temper or help an adult feel less fatigued. Pack a variety of things like:

Healthy snacks such as fruit slices, carrots, nuts, and granola bars
Sweet treats like cookies, candy, and fruit snacks
Filling foods like sandwiches, cheese, and chips
Drinks such as water, juice boxes, and soda

, Understand that each family member has their own unique style, personality, and behavior. Give them a variety of activities to choose from so that they can feel involved in the trip planning process.


For example, let’s say that you’re planning to visit a national park for the day. Offer a few options of what to do in the afternoon. There’s Plan A, Plan B, and Plan C. Even if they aren’t into outdoor hikes, they can at least feel like they contributed.
Think about what activities have worked and not worked in that past. For example, are there certain activities that your child, sibling, or family member are more likely to enjoy? Try offering options that are more likely to appeal to their interests.

, If you find yourself getting upset with your family members' whining when on vacation, try to minimize those behaviors by separating activities from time to time while on vacation. This way you can help to keep the peace by accommodating different people's interests.For example, let’s say you’re having a family vacation at a winter lodge. Maybe your teen and your spouse want to go skiing, and you’d rather be sitting by the fire and reading a book. Split up events this way, and meet up later.
See this as a healthy way to avoid constant whining or conflict. It could also help you to bond with a specific family member better.

, While you may be hopeful that everyone will have a great time, and you’ll be praised for your amazing travel planning skills, this may not always be the case. You may encounter the unexpected such as a sick kid, a fight with your partner, or family drama.

Give yourself permission to be imperfect. Understand that you may have challenges even when heading out for the perfect family vacation.
Set yourself up for the unexpected. By anticipating that problems may arise, you’ll be less frustrated when they do.
Be patient when possible. If you feel yourself getting upset or impatient, step away from the situation. Take some deep breaths. Think about or say words of self-affirmation that remind you of your strengths and resilience.

, While you may be glued to your smartphone or tablet, make it a point that on family vacations there will be less time spent staring at screens. Use this a special opportunity to connect with your family in a way that you don’t normally. Try to forget about school, work, or what’s going on back in your hometown.Try focusing on the present moment and what you can do to make it interesting.
Avoid defaulting to old habits that may isolate you, such as reading articles on your tablet or checking social media.
Notice things out the window of a car or hotel room that remind you that you’re free from the troubles back at home. Appreciate what you see, rather than focusing on the negative.

, You may find that your bag of goodies or usual gadgets aren’t enough to entertain you and your family. Make sure to balance individual activities with group activities to reduce impatience. Try games like these to help redirect your kids’ boredom:I Spy games in the car, at a rest stop, in an airport terminal, or on a plane
License Plate games in cars
Count the Cars on long car rides
Card games on plane flights

, While family trips are about quality time together, don’t expect that everyone should spend every waking minute with each other. Make sure that family members, young and old, have opportunities to do things on their own. This can help to make family time together less exhausting, particularly for family members that like to do things independently.Talk openly with your family about the opportunities to separate and do things independently. See how each family member feels, and identify what they are wanting to do on their own.
Ensure that they are connected by phone, or stay in a specific place while they do things independently. This can help to prevent people from splitting up and getting lost.
For example, let’s say you’re on a family vacation at a big resort. You want to hang out with some other teens at the resort’s pool, but your parents want to take a walk along the beach nearby. Talk with your parents about a set time that you’ll be at the pool, and what time you’ll meet back up with them in the afternoon.

, While your family members may want to see and do everything they can while they’re on vacation, avoid overscheduling events each day. Allow for time to unwind and rest. Make sure that each person is given the time they need to feel rested and ready for the next day.Over planning and high expectations for the day could lead to meltdowns from the kids and stressed parents.
Make sure that the end of the day is about winding down. Do things that are low-key together when it’s later at night or right before bedtime.

, If you’re on a family vacation, you may have fewer opportunities to be connected to your spouse or partner. Make time when possible to do things that help you stay connected one-on-one. The same may be true if you have a bunch of kids on the trip. Make sure that each person feels special.Arrange for alone time at the end of the day or at certain points during the vacation with your spouse. Consider going to resorts where there are kids’ clubs that have adult supervision while you spent time relaxing with your partner.
Bond with your parent or child one-on-one. Do some activities with just the two of you present. This way, there is more quality time spent and less time spent just managing everyone’s needs.

Determine how you will pay rent or housing costs.,
Discuss how you will split bills.,
Determine how you will pay for food.,
Factor in childcare payments.,
Address unusual circumstances.,
Consider putting everything in writing.",How to Live With Your in Laws1," If you are moving into a home that already belongs to your in-laws, you may decide to pay rent directly, perhaps an amount that factors in your share of the utility bills. If you are buying property with your in-laws, you may decide to have your portions of the mortgage withdrawn directly from your accounts each month.


If you are moving into your in-laws’ home, they may be reluctant to take money from you for housing. While it may be nice to live rent-free, it is probably better to find some way to compensate them anyway, in order to help prevent resentment. You could say, “I understand that you don’t want to charge us rent, but we feel that we need to pay you something for letting us stay here. How would you feel if we took over paying the utilities and bought all our own groceries?”;
, Decide how costs will be split for all utilities in the household, and in whose name the bills will be. Decide on payment deadlines and who will be responsible for them.For example, you may decide that your in-laws will pay the gas and water bills, but you will pay the electricity.
You could decide to split bills 50/50, or have one group of family members pay a larger share than another. For example, your parents-in-law would pay less in utilities than your family of five.

, You may first want to figure out how you want to split meal responsibilities before you determine how you want to budget for food. You will want to decide if you want to all contribute to a communal food kitty, keep your food bills separate, or a combination of the two.


For example, you may want to keep your food entirely separate, with your own cabinets and making your own meals every night. Or you may wish to split all food costs down the middle and share everything. Determine what will work best for your family situation.You may also want to factor in other consumable household items into your food budget, like cleaning supplies, toilet paper, or toiletries.

, A major reason why multiple generations move in together is to help with childcare. Determine if you want to compensate or be compensated for helping with childcare, and come to an agreement with other members of the household about what would be a reasonable payment.


For example, does your mother-in-law want to be compensated for watching your child two days a week while you’re at work? If so, do you want to pay her in cash or subtract the amount from her share of the bills?
If you do not pay a family member for watching your children, consider how you can help reduce the workload in other ways. For example, you could take care of all the food shopping and meal preparation or do a larger portion of house cleaning.

, Make plans for unexpected life changes. Discuss how you will handle bills if one of you should lose their job, have a baby, or fall ill. It is better to discuss possibilities ahead of time rather than not have a plan of action in an emergency.


For example, you could say, “What if I were to lose my job? As it is right now, we are barely making ends meet, which is why we are moving in with you. How would we handle this situation? What would you expect from us?”
Discuss what you want to do in case one family decides they want to move. At some point, one or both families may decide that this living plan isn’t working out, or there may be a new opportunity for someone in another city. Determine how your families could separate and how you would divide moving responsibilities.

, It might not seem like something you want to do with other members of your family, but putting financial obligations in writing will help put everyone on the same page and could avoid arguments down the road. While having members of your family sign a lease or other legal documents may feel awkward or distrustful, the uncomfortable feelings now may save you a lot of heartache and strained family relations later.Determine what kind of documents you need. Look online for examples to draw up your own, or you could consider hiring an attorney to prepare any legal documents for you. Make sure the documents would hold up in court; for example, you may want to get some documents notarized.
If you are buying property together, you may want everyone’s signatures on loan documents, for example.

Discuss how you will prepare meals.,
Determine responsibilities for cleaning and other chores.,
Determine how you will be responsible for caring for and disciplining any children.,
Agree on rules around privacy and personal space.,
Consider other rules that may need to be implemented in your family.",How to Live With Your in Laws2," Consider everyone’s schedules and responsibilities as you make decisions about who will shop for food, who will cook, and who will clean up. Decide if you will eat separately or together.You may wish to assign roles: You do the shopping, your in-laws do the cooking, and your spouse cleans up, for example.
You may decide to assign days of the week when one family member is completely responsible for a meal, giving others the night off.
It may be helpful to create a weekly meal planning chart to help determine what everyone is serving and who is responsible for which meal.
Decide on family responsibilities and expectations for all meals. Some questions to resolve may include: Will someone be making a sit-down breakfast during the week? Will there be a designated day to go out for dinner? If you are not going to make it to a meal, when should you let the household know?

, You may want to make a chore chart or write down everyone’s responsibilities while you are talking. How will you divide up household duties? Who will be responsible for cleaning and maintaining common areas? Some other areas of responsibilities you may wish to discuss include:


Laundry
Cleaning bedrooms or separate family areas
Pet care
Outside home maintenance, such as raking leaves or mowing the lawn
Home repairs

, Living with multiple generations under one roof can be extremely rewarding for everyone. Children will have more adults in their lives to nurture them and help them grow, and the children’s parents can find some relief in sharing the workload of parenting. The parents of the children should be the ones to determine how they want their children taken care of and disciplined, and should discuss their expectations with other family members.For example, you may have a rule that your children can’t watch TV until they have finished their homework. Make sure that other adult members of the household agree to enforce that.
Affirm your discipline procedures. If one of your children misbehaves, what would you like the other adults in the house to do? Are there any discipline methods you disapprove of that you do not want to see used on your children? Be clear in your expectations.
Do not allow other adults to undermine your discipline procedures. If other adults in the house have a problem with your discipline (whether they feel it is too soft or too harsh), have them come to you with any concerns instead of talking to the children. A statement like, “Your mommy never lets you have cookies if you don’t eat a good dinner, but grandma will give you some!” undermines your parenting and confuses the children.You could say, “Mary, I know you mean well, and I am so grateful that you help out with the kids. But Matt and I have a rule that the kids don’t get dessert unless they clean their plates. Can you please abide by our rule in the future?”

, Determine which rooms need permission to enter. Make sure you all agree on ground rules around giving each other enough space.For example, you could decide that a house rule will be to knock before opening any closed door, or that Grandpa’s office is off-limits to the kids.
Respect each other’s privacy. You may have your in-laws living in your house, but consider their designated personal spaces (like a bedroom) their own property. Respect them and treat it as such, knocking before entering or not disturbing them in the evenings.
Designate which spaces “belong” to each family member and if family members can personalize those spaces. For example, can anyone add personal touches to common areas, or is the owner of the house the default decorator?If finances and space permit, you could consider doing some home remodeling for additional privacy. For example, you could put up a wall to divide a room into two separate, private spaces. You could even consider building an addition on the house, like an in-law suite (which usually contains, at a minimum, a spacious bedroom and full bath)., Look at your family situation and determine what other unique rules you may need to develop and enforce. Get input from all members of the household.


For example, if someone in the household works from home, what will other household members do to give the worker the space and privacy they need to do their job?
Consider any rules you may need to implement around driving and vehicles. For example, can everyone drive each other’s cars? Can teenage children drive their grandparents’ car?

Hold family meetings on a regular basis.,
Talk about it before resentment builds.,
Disagree respectfully.,
Learn to let things go.,
Try to stay positive.,
Connect with each other.",How to Live With Your in Laws3," You may want to sit down with other family members every once in a while to discuss how your living arrangement is working out and address any concerns. Agree to be open, respectful, and honest in your conversations.


Discuss finances and the household budget. It may be helpful to save old bills and receipts for your records and discussion. For example, you could say, “I noticed the water bill really went up last month. I think it’s because Kevin is taking such long showers. Could you talk to him about making sure he’s not in the shower so long?”

, Living with your in-laws can be stressful at times, and you may find yourself disagreeing with how they do things. Determine what kinds of issues are worth confronting your in-laws over, and what other problems are just common annoyances of living with someone.Be respectful and confront the problem as soon as you can. Don’t let resentment build up and make you angrier. Remember, letting time pass may mean that the other person may have no memory of the incident.
Your in-laws may be more receptive to talking to the person they are related to, rather than the person who married into the family. Therefore, if you have a problem with someone’s behavior, it may be the most helpful to discuss with your spouse or child first, instead of going directly to your father- or daughter-in-law, for example.
For example, you could say to your spouse, “Your mom agreed to clean the downstairs bathroom, but she hasn’t done it in about three weeks. Can you please remind her it’s her job? Sometimes I feel like I am nagging her when I remind her.”

, You will likely have disagreements with people you live with, whether they are your in-laws or not. Even if you don’t see eye-to-eye with each other, you can still discuss your differences


Try to understand where the other person is coming from. For example, you could say, “I always listen to music when I’m working at night, but I had no idea you could hear it in your bedroom. I can understand why you’re so annoyed!”

Apologize and agree to change your behavior in the future, if necessary. For example, “I’m so sorry I didn’t call that I wasn’t going to be at dinner. I completely forgot, but I’ll put a reminder in my phone so that I remember to call you next time.”
Don’t get defensive. If your daughter-in-law says, “You forgot to pay the gas bill,” don’t respond defensively, like “I always remember. Don’t act like I never do it.” A better response would be, “I’m sorry, it must have slipped my mind.”

, Practice your patience. Everyone gets on each other’s nerves from time to time. When you are feeling frustrated, remind yourself of the benefits of your living arrangement, or find some ways to take time to yourself.Remember that not every opinion needs to be expressed. You may hate the look and contents of your mother-in-law’s curio cabinet, but there is no point in bringing that up except to be hurtful.
You could take a walk, offer to run some errands by yourself, or have planned activities during the week that get you out of the house.
Vent to someone who will listen to you without judgment. Just make sure you are talking to someone who won’t take your frustrations back to your in-laws! And don’t vent on social media -- the internet never forgets, and an angry post could find its way onto your in-laws’ computer screen.

, There are lots of benefits to having several generations living all together. When you are stressed out and frustrated with your living situation, try to think of some benefits to your situation:You may have a much lower cost of living than if you did not live with your in-laws.
You may get free childcare, or get to see your grandchildren every day.
You may get more date nights with your spouse.
You can feel secure that when you go out of town, someone else is watching your house.

, Have fun with your family. Come up with activities you all enjoy and can do together to grow closer and bond with each other. For instance, you could:


Cook together. You could all decide to try out a new recipe and serve all your creations at dinner.
Have a movie or sports night, watching a movie you all enjoy or a team you all support together.
Have a game night, playing your favorite board or video games.
Go on outings together. Take in local sights or museums in your area as a family.
Celebrate holidays and birthdays together. Come up with new household traditions.

Without going over the top, say nice things about your partner.,
When leaving, thank your host for the beautiful evening you had and let them know you had a lovely time.",How to Impress Your In Laws," Too much make-up can often give the impression that you are false. Skip the eyeliner. Go for the 'every day, girl next door' look. This bodes well with suspecting mother in-laws. She knows her grandchildren will be naturally beautiful. This is all she cares about.;
, Nobody wants to sit at the dinner table and taste JOOP as they chew. The same applies to women and perfume. Subtlety is key.

, For a man, jeans and a shirt. Wearing tracksuit bottoms with white socks pulled over the end of them and a pair of trainers will have your mother in-law hiding her best silver.

, A nice pair of trousers and a blouse will suffice and if not, then a pretty dress that doesn't reveal too much. Don't wear heels that are too high. Go easy on the jewellery. You are not a Christmas tree.

, Remember your P's & Q's. Always say thanks. If your dinner is burnt, eat it or be in it. Nobody likes to be told their cooking sucks.

, I would actually advise to refrain from it altogether. If it is forced upon you, sip your drink slowly to deter a future top-up. The last thing you want is to get drunk and tell your respective parent in-laws how great your partner is in bed.

, Hanging off them, being touchy feely, kissing, is NOT cute. It's annoying. More annoying for people watching. It also makes a statement. It says 'he's mine now'. Mummy In-Law will not be a happy bunny. You are effectively stealing him. In reverse, the same applies to a woman with respect to her father.

, Modesty is attractive. Nobody is perfect. And I mean nobody.

, If the paint is peeling, the curtains are falling down, rats climbing out of bins, tough. This is a brief visit and you have to see it through for the one you love. This is not just about you.

, You want them to know that you love him/her but you don't want to sound obsessed. A light & breezy comment 'He's brilliant at soccer, I go to some of his games and he has talent' should be a guider. Not something like ""OMG, your son is AMAZING!! He's the next Maradona!! I rub his feet after training even when he's wearing smelly socks just so he can play again tomorrow"" - queue, shut the hell up.

, Smile. Always smile.

If your MIL calls more than once a week and can't understand why this is inconvenient, start writing e-mails.,
Even though he does the whole communication, make sure you talk to her at least 2 - 3 minimum times a month, and whenever the phone is passed to you with your permission, be always in good spirits.,
Let your husband/wife deal with their own mother.,
Grandkids.,
Also, when they call to know about the kids, don't feel obligated to say everything, just talk about the highlights and end it there.",How to Handle a Mother in Law," if they don't have an e-mail address, write letters. If she is calling just to see how you and your family are doing, that is a good way to keep her updated while keeping your space. Another way is to just let your husband talk to her. Listening to her voice all the time can be like she is living with you and you feel lack of space, therefore, let your husband talk. Usually men are brief but at the same time they give simple information, this way she gets what she wants but in a not intrusive way. If your husband is not brief, you can ask him to call her when he is coming home from work, that way he will let it out. Another thing is if you let your husband/wife talk to their own mothers (your mother-in-law), if she says something that you would take it badly, you won't know and you will still have peace.;
, Let her know that even though she hardly talks to you, it's not because you are mad at her or anything like that.

, Letting them deal with them on their own is better. Why? Because they grew up with them whole life with their mom's therefore they know how to deal with them and if they do get them mad, they did it, not you! And there are advantages to this too, the conflict is minimal and she will forget it in no time, because it's her own son/daughter therefore she is very forgiving.

, Should I say more? Grandparents can be really intrusive when it comes to grandchildren and can turn our world around. They expect pictures, updates and everything. What you can do is set a certain time to send pictures, you don't have to set a time with her but set the time for yourself. You can tell her: 2 to 2 weeks we will be sending pictures.

, Let her talk to your child as well, some children hardly say anything and some talk a storm, use that time to do something around the house (which we know we have a lot to do). Also, it's really important to encourage grandchild - grandparent relationship.

Realize that you may be dealing with a drama queen.,
Do not get involved with the drama.",How to Handle a Dramatic Sister in Law1," The dynamics of a sister-in-law (S-I-L) are complex at the best of times but no more so if she has spent much of her life causing her immediate family to run to her beck and call. The drama queen thrives off drama and having everyone pay attention to her as a result.


Sit back at your next family occasion and simply watch. Notice how she interacts with her family members, and how they in turn react back. If you witness a lot of step-toeing around her and acquiescing to her, she is clearly used to getting her own way.
Consider what happens when she raises a drama-filled topic. Do other family members rush to agree with her about how ""outrageous"" the price of child care/electricity/shampoo/dog grooming/car maintenance/etc. is? Do they confirm her quibbles as quickly as possible, thereby engendering even more complaints? This shows that they enable her complaint-filled view of the world and sadly, have long been used to pandering to it. You can't change them but you can set a new role model by not complaining yourself.
Notice what happens when you disagree with her. Does she pout, throw an adult-style tantrum or try and put you down? While it's important to stand your ground on things that matter to you, if she does react childishly, you'll need to learn how to manage this carefully. Learn not so much to disagree as to fail to agree––there is a fine line but it's about acknowledging her underlying need (notice me, care about me, help me, etc.) without buying into her view of the world.;
, Your S-I-L can let off steam, vent away and curse all she wants but there is no need to join the negativity. Avoid taking any of what is said personally––the crazier the reactions and actions, the more your S-I-L is grasping at straws to try and provoke you and restore the limelight back onto her. Let her have the limelight in her own home but don't hang around to be vented upon. If it gets really bad, simply announce that you will come back when she is feeling calmer and leave. Equally, if it's happening in your own home, tell it's time to leave. (You can even make up a fake appointment or an early bedtime if you really need a polite excuse.)

"
"
Look to yourself first.,
Create boundaries.",How to Handle a Dramatic Sister in Law2," It can be hard when to do this when someone else pushes your buttons. But it is important because it is your reaction that defines whether or not she feels she can keep going in the same direction with you. Some of the things to consider include:


Stay silent and there's a risk she just thinks you're dumb, awed by her or chewed up with resentment. Take your pick, she's probably happy to think you're feeling all three. And she'll use your silence to keep putting across her point of view at the expense of yours. If you're grinning and bearing it, you're likely turning into a doormat.
Argue and she probably thinks her brother/sister has married an angry, resentful and bitter so-and-so who hates her and will do anything to come between her and her brother/sister. You may feel as if you're defending yourself but to her, it's about you not caring what she thinks and possibly even about putting her down. This doesn't mean there isn't room for disagreement; it just means that the manner in which you realign her understanding must be done with care.

, State the facts about matters that she pressures you about, firmly but politely, and avoid being emotional into the bargain. If you state things simply, stick to the facts and avoid making it into an issue about her, she has few places to run. Be aware that she may continue to resent you for speaking your mind in an assertive and self-effective way but this shouldn't stop you from clarifying your position. Ultimately, she has to respect someone who doesn't argue, lose their temper or bite their tongue but instead makes it absolutely clear where the boundaries exist. And even if she doesn't everyone else will plainly see that you are the cooler head in the room.


For example, let's say your daughter Sheila has been running outside and has fallen over. Your S-I-L insists that she needs to see a doctor or something terrible might happen. You are quite sure nothing of the sort will occur and you know you're a good parent but S-I-L keeps badgering you, upping the intensity of all the bad things that will happen if you fail to follow her advice. Offer your S-I-L a calmly spoken ""That's very kind of you to notice that Sheila has a bruised knee but I am thoroughly satisfied that Sheila is going to be all right; this happens all the time and is a part of the way she learns to cope with the great outdoors. She does not need to see the doctor."" And that's the end of it, no need to enter into any further discussion. If S-I-L keeps trying, smile and change the subject; refuse to re-engage on the matter.

"
"
Talk to your spouse about your feelings.,
Ask your spouse to think carefully about the way in which he or she relays information about family issues.",How to Handle a Dramatic Sister in Law3," Avoid name-calling, insulting or insinuating anything about your sister-in-law. Instead, explain how you feel when the proverbial dung hits the fan whenever you're in her presence. Your spouse cannot fault your feelings, so be clear and thoughtful in stating them. This puts your spouse on notice that you've recognized the behavior of your S-I-L for what it is and that you have chosen to no longer accept being at the receiving end of it.


For example, ""Georgia, when your sister talks a lot about how hard it is to fund her children's private schooling, I feel claustrophobic because she doesn't know when to stop discussing it. Given that we can barely afford our mortgage, I feel a little distressed at this kind of talk all night. I'd like to stop putting myself in this position from now on by simply acknowledging her problem but not letting her continue discussing it all night and I'd like you to help me do this by finding other subjects to talk about that don't involve money. Do you think that this is something you can get on board with?"".

, Tell your spouse that you love to hear about how your sister-in-law is doing but that you don't appreciate hearing about the embellished drama that often comes with it. Help your spouse to recognize what you consider to be ""drama"" from what you consider to be ""real news"" and in time, both of you will learn to speak about family matters in a less dramatic and more emotionally healthy way.


Remind your spouse gently whenever you feel that your S-I-L's drama is being repeated in your house. You could even have a special signal rather than having to spell it out each time.
Place a ban on gossip at home (or anywhere). Remind one another whenever it veers anywhere near close to gossip and shut it down. It doesn't matter if you feel you are being gossiped about; you're the bigger person for not engaging in the same behavior.

"
"
Avoid answering what isn't worthy of a response.,
Keep social media networking to a minimum with your sister-in-law if she sets off your buttons.,
Take care if you do soldier on and try to be her friend online and/or through the phone.",How to Handle a Dramatic Sister in Law4," Don't respond to any text messages that do not directly relate to a family get-together, positive messages or something else perfectly normal. If you are getting texts that spell out her outrage about things that have happened to her, her annoyance at something you've apparently done or to send you gossip about family or friends, let it slide and leave her wondering.


If you feel angry and want to send back a retort, reprimand or justification straight away, don't do it. Treat your anger or irritation as a warning sign to sleep on the matter. Furious texting or messaging can only end in more angst on both sides.

, If your S-I-L is truly a pain and a bit of a drama queen, it's possible that her social networking reflects her attention-seeking ways. You can be all too easily drawn into a web of her anger and drama venting if you can see her Facebook updates or her latest tweets.


If she friends you, you can do one of several things.

One, simply ignore the request. When she asks you about it, tell her that you don't use social media much to exchange important things (or at all); or
Two, reply to her with a ""Thanks but no thanks, I am not accepting new requests at the moment due to busyness/privacy/overloading, etc."" You might also add something like, ""Besides, we see each other often and I prefer we talk face-to-face""; or
Three, turn all of your settings to private so that she can't see who you are friends with. Either say nothing or tell her either that you stopped using social media or that you only have a tight knit circle of followers and don't wish to extend it at the moment. If you say you didn't receive any request, she'll only resend it, but it might buy enough time to throw her off the whole idea if you offer to ""look into it"" but let the ""looking into it"" drag on and refuse to raise the matter again); or
Four, offer her a more neutral alternative. Offer to friend her on Pinterest and focus solely on a shared craft or cooking board. Nothing racy or mean spirited, of course.


Try to avoid using the terminology of ""friends"" when discussing any refusal to accept her request. Unfortunately, the usage of this term by social media sites has caused many people to take it at face value; many people are simply followers or fans, not friends. She might feel devalued if you make any suggestion that she is being rejected as a ""friend"".
If she is already a follower of one or more of your networking sites, you might consider blocking her and turning your pages private on some sites. Most probably you will need to explain what has happened (with a sound excuse); if she's a drama queen, she'll not only notice but she'll take offense too.

, If she acts abusively, it is recommended that you keep records to show your spouse and other family members if needed. Save messages, emails, voice-mails, etc. Some drama queens like to ""attack"" when nobody else can see, thinking you won't have the courage to out them. This isn't about deliberately looking for dirt but it is a way of protecting yourself if anything should get out of hand. However, this is truly the stuff of last resort––if you handle yourself deftly in public situations around your S-I-L, everyone will know for real who is behaving and who is stirring the pot.

"
"
Get on with your lives together.,
Listen for real.,
Be compassionate.",How to Handle a Dramatic Sister in Law5," You married your spouse, not your family. While his or her family members are part of the package, they are not a part of your intimacy and they do not share the same journey with the two of you. If you make it very obvious that you're not bothered by jealousy, insinuations, rumors or gossip, it will soon become clear to your S-I-L that her barbs, attitude and meanness aren't pricking you in the way that they used to. Eventually, it ceases to be profitable or enjoyable for her to keep bothering and most likely she'll begrudgingly go and find someone else to taunt and hassle.


Spend less time around your S-I-L. In what ways are you putting yourself in her pathway? While it may feel like you have to put up with her, you can find ways to reduce the time spent together. For example, ask other family members to meet you at different times than when she is around, more often than not. Don't always do this, or she will have a legitimate cause for complaining, but time spent with other family members shouldn't always involve her presence. If you live far away and have to visit once a year, stay in your own accommodation to give yourself respite.
Take walks, get outside and don't overstay any welcome when it comes to drawn-out family events that press your buttons. Families know the pressure points better than anyone and unfortunately, some like to press them. At such events, your S-I-L probably has alliances that she can set in train to be even more effective, so the less time spent near such complaint-prone cliques, the better.

, When you are around your S-I-L, try active listening and acknowledgment in place of letting your fog of self-defensiveness take control. When she gets on top of her complaining mountain, instead of trying to topple her off with ""if you think that's bad, you should live in my shoes"" replies, actually focus on her and try to discern what is really driving her jibes, whining and gossip. By not making this about you, you may be truly surprised at what you unearth.
As for responding to her, acknowledge her pain with neutral comments like: ""I'm sorry you have had to go through that to pay an electricity bill. It must be hard having four kids chewing through the power each month."" Don't offer advice, don't offer how you would deal with it and don't ever offer to pay or pave the way to see her problem resolved. She owns it, you simply acknowledge it.

, If your S-I-L has been a pain more than once and has even done things to show you up or drag you down, the chances are that she will try to do it again, even when you don't bite. But if you're ready for it and if you're understanding as to where she is coming from (insecurity, loneliness, feeling left out, needing to be in control, etc.), you can be compassionate about her actions and detach yourself from her drama. If you don't carry her load, she'll be forced to do it for herself and will stop seeing you as a viable target.

Listen to your in-laws.,
Don’t bicker pointlessly.Families often fight about politics, religion, or the proper course to take in current events.,
Treat your father-in-law and mother-in-law as you would your father and mother.Treat your brother-in-law and sister-in-law as you would your own siblings.,
Don't share your spousal problems with your in-laws.They will always take their child’s or sibling’s side, and letting them know about problems on the home front will only make them worry.,
Remember to set boundaries early on.Many sons and daughters-in-law will be extra accommodating in the beginning in order to win approval and make a good impression.,
Adjust your expectations.,
Make holidays and events a collaborative effort.When it’s your partner’s birthday, for instance, call your in-laws beforehand and invite them to help you plan meals, games, and hosting.,
Recognize parents-in-laws’ fear.As people see their children age, they worry more that they will grow further apart from their children.,
Spend time with your in-laws.,
Do favors for your in-laws.As people age, they may need more help around the house with maintenance like raking the leaves, mowing the grass, and inserting and removing window air conditioners with the changing seasons.,
Offer presents to your in-laws.Don’t limit your gift-giving to Christmas and birthdays.,
Find common ground -- hobbies, habits, or interests -- and share it with your in-laws.,
Get along with your spouse.Make sure your spouse is happy enough to report good.",How to Get Along with Your In Laws," They’re likely to be full of stories about their lives either today or in years gone by. Let them tell their tales and make yourself a rapt audience of one. You might learn something interesting, and it will make them feel good be listened to as well. Many of the stories might be about your partner, and you might learn more about them in the process.


Encourage your in-laws to communicate with you. Invite them to “Tell me about life when you were growing up,” for instance.;
, Don’t try to change someone set in their ways. Similarly, don’t try to correct someone’s social habits. If they spit, curse, or pick their nose in public, don’t feel obligated to call them out on it.


Your in-laws are likely to be quite a bit older than you, and people tend to be less receptive to new ideas and invitations to change when they reach seniority. Respect their decisions and perspectives, even if you don’t agree with them.
Try not to find fault with them. Do not create a long list of grudges that you regularly churn out when complaining to others or yourself about your in-laws. If your litany of issues becomes unmanageable, perhaps you should consider talking them through with your partner, and then, if necessary, with your in-laws directly.

, Be friendly, cordial, and natural around them. Be honest and open in your communication. Relax when you are with them. Don’t feel as if you’re being tested or studied by them. Share with them your innermost feelings and thoughts, if appropriate. After all, your in-laws are family. Seeing them as such will go a long way toward helping you get along with them.

, Nobody wants to hear denigrating tales about their own son or daughter; hearing such things will likely make them become defensive. Work out your issues privately with your spouse. Do not attempt to drag your spouse's family into things or make them choose sides.

, While such behavior is natural when one is nervous and new to the family, it is important to establish boundaries sooner rather than later. This will make the relationship much easier in the future.


For instance, if your mother-in-law constantly invites herself over at all hours, insist that she make arrangements before coming over. Talk to your partner about making the suggestion instead of doing so yourself; hearing that certain boundaries need to be set will sound better from your in-laws’ child than from you.
Using the prior situation as an example, you might suggest to your spouse that he or she say “Mom, would you do me a favor? We love having you over to the house but need time to prepare for your arrival properly and ensure we have adequate time to devote to you. Could you please let me or my spouse know you want to come over before doing so? Thank you.”
If your in-laws offer advice on raising your children, you should listen patiently and think about it. They’re giving you advice from experience, and it might be worthy of real consideration. Thank them for their advice and inform them you will talk the matter over with your spouse. Later, in private, you and your spouse should decide whether or not to implement the advice your in-laws offered. If you choose to reject it, don’t rub it in their faces; simply don’t do it. Your in-laws are gracious and will let the matter should fade out.

, Meeting your partner’s family might require you to go outside your comfort zone.Don’t assume that their family dynamic will be the same as yours. Perhaps your family is reserved and doesn’t show much physical affection, while your partner’s family is boisterous and tends to hug and kiss each other’s cheeks with gusto. Try to do things their way when you’re on their turf. Remember, “When in Rome...”

, Perhaps your parents-in-law can bring the cutlery and napkins, while you bring the cake and snacks. Perhaps you can find space to host the party if they barbecue the chicken. Sharing responsibility in this way demonstrates that you trust them and want them to be involved, which will help you grow closer over time.


When you change or adjust plans, do it with your in-laws consent. Don’t unilaterally cancel plans.Don’t allow your in-laws to dictate what your family does. For instance, if you’ve agreed to Christmas eve dinner with them, you and your family should share Christmas day alone (assuming you want to). Inform your in-laws that “We had a really nice time yesterday at Christmas dinner; we wanted the kids to stay inside today and enjoy their new toys.” If they are adamant about visiting, seek a compromise such as having your in-laws visit your family at your house.

, Parents often want to have an active role in their child’s life at any age. When a child marries, they might feel they are losing control of the child. This fear is only one part of a larger fear of losing control over their own lives as they age and become physically weaker and, sometimes, senescent.


Address your in-laws’ fears directly.They might not come right out and say they are worried about losing touch with their child, or losing their affection. Assure your in-laws, though, that you want them to remain an active part of your spouse’s life. You might encourage your spouse to assure them of this themselves, as well.
Follow up on your promises. Visit your in-laws regularly with your spouse, and invite them to join you during family gatherings, holidays, anniversaries, and special occasions.

, Mere exposure to someone or something over a long period of time can inspire affection. Don’t avoid your mother or father-in-law, especially. When your partner proposes a visit, make time for it and accompany them there. Your in-laws will become more comfortable with you over time as they get to know you better, too.Visit your in-laws regularly with your spouse, and invite them to join you during family gatherings, holidays, anniversaries, and special occasions.

, Make yourself available to help them out when they need it. Don’t just wait for them to ask you; be proactive and suggest to mom/dad “I’d like to come over and give you a hand with the oil change. How does next weekend work?” This will endear you to them and make them feel that you’re capable of caring for their child, too.

, Unless you visit very often find something thoughtful that your in-laws would like. It helps to know the collecting habits of your in-laws. For instance, if your father-in-law plays golf, you might consider getting him a new golf hat or set of golf balls when you go away on business trips. If your mother-in-law enjoys baking or cooking, bring her new cookbooks or high-quality, luxury ingredients with which to whip up something good.


Give gifts at the time of anniversaries and any special occasions too.

, For instance, pull a book from the shelf of their house next time you’re visiting.This is not only a good way to kill your boredom during a big family get-together, but also demonstrates that you appreciate and have an interest in the things they are interested in


If your father-in law enjoys golf, invite him out for nine holes. If he enjoys baseball, buy some tickets and invite him for some one-on-one time, or invite your mother-in-law along with your spouse for a full-on family outing.
If your mother-in-law has a green thumb, head over to her place to help her weed her garden and plant seeds. When the harvest is ready, you can help pull the veggies up.

, While it’s not realistic to expect your relationship will be perfect all the time, keeping your relationship on an even keel is a good way to engender trust in your in-laws. Maintain open lines of communication, provide each other with love, and talk to each other as a team.

Make the adoption official.",How to Adopt an Adult Stepchild," Adoption procedures and requirements vary significantly among states, and specific cities or counties may have additional steps you must complete. Before you begin the process of adopting an adult stepchild, make sure adoption will serve the goals you have in mind.The adoption process typically isn't complicated, and you can usually do it without an attorney. However, you may want to consult an experienced adoption attorney if you're unsure whether adoption will do what you want it to do.
For example, you can't use adult adoption for immigration law purposes. If you have an adult stepchild who is not a citizen or lawful permanent resident and you want to change that, you can't do so by adopting them.
There may be requirements that apply to all stepparents adopting stepchildren, regardless of the age of the stepchild in question.
For example, some states require you to be married to your stepchild's biological parent for at least a year before you can legally adopt them.
Some states have additional requirements that must be met by the stepchild you want to adopt. For example, in Arizona you can adopt an adult stepchild, but only if they are under 21.;
, It's a good idea to sit down with your spouse and your adult stepchild, as well as any other family members, and talk about your reasons for wanting to adopt your adult stepchild.Your stepchild needs to know that any legal parental relationship with the other biological parent will be severed if you adopt them. This can impact inheritance if, for example, your stepchild's biological parent dies without a will.
It's also important for everyone to understand that adoption is permanent. If you and your stepchild's biological parent divorce, your stepchild still is your adopted child – unless the child's other biological parent agrees to adopt them back.
Generally, reversing the process can be legally complicated – and may be impossible depending on your state's eligibility requirements.
You want to make sure that everyone understands the reasons for the adoption and is on the same page regarding the process. Having the support of the entire family can make the process a lot easier.

, States that allow adult adoption require consent from the person you want to adopt. Even though your stepchild is an adult, your state may also require consent from that child's biological parents.Consent from parents is required because through adoption you terminate a legal parent-child relationship.
Even though the child has reached adulthood, this still affects other matters such as inheritance rights.
If your adult stepchild is married, you also may need a consent form from their spouse.
Other states, such as Oregon, only require a consent form from the adult stepchild. There is no need to contact biological parents or get consent from anyone else.

, You must have a complete and signed consent form for everyone required to consent to the adoption, or your petition for adoption will not be processed by the court.If your state requires consent from both of your adult stepchild's biological parents, things can get complicated if one of them hasn't been in your stepchild's life for many years, or if their whereabouts are unknown.
Many states have a process whereby consent can be waived if the parent hasn't contacted or supported the child for a number of years.
You may want to consult an attorney if you are unable to locate someone from whom consent is required.
Typically you must have the original, signed form to file with the court. However, you probably want to make copies for all involved, including your adult stepchild and the person who signed the form.
Keep in mind that most states also require signatures on consent forms to be notarized.

, Most states have a form packet that you can pick up at the county or family court where you plan to file your petition. In some jurisdictions, you also may be able to find these forms online.If you download forms online, make sure they are appropriate for the specific court in which you plan to file your petition. There may be additional forms or items that are specific to particular counties or courts.
If there are no forms available, you can check your state's adoption law to find out what information must be included in the petition.
You may be able to get copies of adoption petitions filed in other cases from the clerk of the court and use those as guides. However, in many states adoption records are sealed and only available for parties to the case.

, Your form packet typically will include instructions. Make sure you read them carefully before you begin filling out your forms. Some courts may have specific requirements related to the printing and format of your answers.The petition requires information about you, your adult stepchild, and the reasons you want to adopt them.
Typically you also must include information about your adult stepchild's biological parents.
Along with the petition, you're also typically responsible for preparing an order. This is the document the judge will sign if he or she grants your petition.
The consent forms you had completed and signed must be attached as exhibits to your petition.
You'll want to make enough copies of the complete packet that everybody involved can have a copy for their records.

, When you've completed your forms, you must take them to the clerk of the court that handles adoptions in the county where your adult stepchild lives. Typically this will be the county civil court, but in some states adoptions are handled by the probate court.Some courts don't charge any filing fees for adoptions, but others do. Filing fees for an adoption typically won't be more than a hundred dollars, but you may want to call the clerk's office first to make sure.
You also may be able to find out information about filing fees by going to the court's website.
Take your originals as well as the copies you've made. The clerk will stamp all of them ""filed"" with the date and give the copies back to you.
The clerk also typically will schedule a hearing date. This is when the judge will review your petition and decide whether to grant the adoption.
There may be additional preliminary requirements, particularly if your adult stepchild is mentally or physically disabled. The clerk will let you know.

, In some states, you may be required to have your adult stepchild and their biological parents served with your petition. This is so the court can be certain that they all have legal notice of the proceeding.Who must be served typically depends on the consent process. If you have a consent form from a parent or spouse that you filed with the petition, you don't have to serve the person who signed that consent form – they already know about the adoption.
On the other hand, if consent from someone, such as a biological parent, is required but not given, the court may require you to serve that person so they have the opportunity to object to the adoption.
If your state requires a consent form from someone and you were unable to get them to consent, you may want to consult an attorney regarding the procedure in adult adoption cases.

, When the scheduled date of your hearing arrives, go to the courthouse at least a half hour before the time listed on your hearing notice. You want to make sure you have time to get through courthouse security and find the correct courtroom.You don't necessarily have to wear a business suit to court, but you should dress conservatively and respectfully. Clothing you would wear to a church service or a job interview typically is appropriate.
Make sure you have your copy of the paperwork you filed with the court. You may not need to refer to it, but it's still a good idea to have it.
In many cases, an adoption is a celebration. Any friends or family members who want to witness the proceedings are welcome to attend.
The judge may be hearing several cases the same day as yours. Unless you've been told otherwise, take a seat in the courtroom gallery until your name is called. Then you and anyone with you can proceed to the front of the courtroom.

, Different courts have different procedures, but essentially you will be asked to present your petition to the judge and explain why you want to adopt your adult stepchild.In many courts, the judge will simply ask you questions rather than requiring you to make a speech to present your petition.
Some courts may proceed more formally, with the judge requiring you to present your petition through a brief monologue. typically you can just read from your petition – you don't have to have any special words prepared.
Make sure you speak loudly and clearly so the judge can hear you. If the judge asks you something you don't understand, ask for clarification.
The judge also may want to talk to your adult stepchild, to make sure they understand the proceedings and have voluntarily consented to the adoption.

, After all parties have been heard, the judge will decide whether to grant or deny your petition. Even if you believe everything about your case was relatively straightforward, don't take it as a given that the judge will grant your petition.Judges occasionally refuse to grant adult stepchild adoptions, typically because they are concerned about the parties' intentions or motivation for completing the adoption.
For example, judges may refuse to grant the adoption if they are concerned that it's being done to defraud someone, or to attempt to avoid debts your adult stepchild owes.
In most cases, though, the judge will grant the adoption. They typically let you know this decision from the bench, although it may take a few more days to get the finalized order.

, If the judge grants your petition, you should receive copies of the written order within a few days after the hearing. Those orders can be used to change your stepchild's birth certificate, update insurance policies, or anything else.There may be official forms to be completed and submitted to your state's vital records office. The court clerk may have copies of these forms, or will be able to tell you where to get them.
Expect it to take several weeks, or even months, before a new birth certificate is issued.
Typically your adopted stepchild must have the new birth certificate before they can change their name elsewhere, such as on their Social Security card and government-issued identification.

You become what you think about most, but you also attract what you think about most.,
Your thoughts cause your feelings.,
Begin to talk about what you want with others and enroll them in your dream, your desire, your want.,
Remember ""I am..."" is a powerful creative statement.,
Take inspired action that aligns you with what you want.",How to Apply the Law of Attraction Successfully,"


Do not think about what you don't want, or dwell on past occurrences, because if you only think about all the bad things that have happened to you, or the bad things that you think are going to happen to you, then you'll only get more of the bad things you don't want to happen.
Thinking things such as, ""I don't want this to happen..."" or, ""This will not happen..."" or, ""This is happening now, but it wont happen again..."" is not acceptable. You are not pushing the bad circumstances away, or stopping them from happening. If anything, you are actually attracting the bad circumstances to you. The law of attraction sees that you are thinking about, not about how you don't want it, just that you are thinking about it, and the law of attraction will give you whatever it is you're thinking about.;
, This is the hardest part for most people to understand. It's also incredibly hard to learn how to use, but its not impossible and is totally worth it. As was just mentioned, this step is the hardest part for people to learn, but it's also the most important part. Applying the law of attraction to your life will be unsuccessful if you do not know how to manipulate your bad feelings into good feelings.


If you're feeling good emotions like happiness, love, excitement, gratitude, passion, joy, hope, and satisfaction, then your thoughts will be positive and positive things will happen to you. But if you're feeling bad emotions such as anger, fear, resentment, depression, hate, revenge, and guilt, then your thoughts will be negative and negative things will happen to you.
If you're feeling those good and positive emotions and something negative happens to you, then you have to be able to control your emotions and not let that negative thing that has happen to you, affect your emotions. There's an easy answer to how to keep your feelings positive: you need to think positive thoughts! So, what is a positive thought? It is a good feeling and realistic thought, which you believe in. Of course, it can take time to find such a thought and you may have to apply it over and over again until you think it habitually, if this is your desire, but in any given situation, we can find positive thoughts. Just don't expect that you will feel great all the time, because that is just not possible and not how life is.
For example: In the morning, if you start out having a good day and as long as you don't allow anything to change that feeling/mood, then you will continue to attract more situations/circumstances/people that sustain that happy feeling. Same thing happens if you wake up in a bad mood. If you start out having a bad day and do not alter your mood, then you will only attract more bad and unhappy situations/circumstances/people.
What is about to be said is very important, and you need to fully understand. The way you feel is everything. It is the key to applying the law of attraction. If what you desire is to be healthy, then you have to feel as if you are already healthy. Not wishing to be healthy or hoping to someday be healthy, but actually feel as if you are already healthy, even if you are not. You have to continue thinking and feeling this way all the time. You have to commit to the feeling of already being healthy. If you do not commit to it, then it will be a waste of time and nothing will change.
If what you desire is something tangible like a new car, then you have to feel as if you already have that new car. Not wishing you owned the car or hoping that someday you will eventually own the car, but actually feeling as if you already own that vehicle, even if you do not own it. You have to continue thinking and feeling this way all the time. You have to commit to the feeling of already having that new car. If you do not commit to it, then it will be a waste of time and you might as well just go back to wishing and hoping you had that car and never do anything about it.
Once you realize that the way you feel is everything and you begin to direct your thoughts based on how they feel, little by little you can find the feeling place of what it is you desire and it'll manifest into your experience.

, Begin to speak as if what you want is already coming to you, or is already part of your experience.

, It is a declaration. A declaration begins the process of creating. Be sure whatever follows ""I am..."" is indeed what you want in the now and to perpetuate into the future. Also, make your statements concise and precise. Put it in a nutshell. Do not add to what you want all the reasons why you cannot have it, (i.e., ""I want to have a new car, but I can't afford it). Instead simply state what you want in present tense (""I want a new car."") with no qualifiers, not but, no because, clean and clear.

, If you want a new job, one more fulfilling, more exciting, better paying, thinking about it and talking about it will not get you there. You MUST take action that tells the Universe that you want that job. Begin actively looking. Make contacts. Talk about what you want in a job. Tell your friends and family what you are doing. Support your desire with action. Manifestation of what you want comes much more swiftly and completely when you stand by your words. Stand in your integrity. Do what you say you are going to do. Show the Universe that you are a powerful creator by BEING what you say you want to be.

Pick a non-stressful time to talk.,
Ease into the conversation.,
Tell her you don’t want to have more kids.,
Explain why you don’t want more children.,
Talk about your wife’s desires.,
Focus on understanding your wife.,
Answer her questions.,
Reaffirm your love and commitment.",How to Tell Your Wife You Don't Want Any More Children1," When bringing up this heavy topic, pick a time when you both have the least going on. If you know your spouse has a tough week at work ahead, delay the conversation until afterwards. Choose a time during the weekend after the kids have gone to bed.Avoid picking important dates like birthdays or anniversaries, as well.
Be mindful of the location, too. Tell her at home and in private.;
, Don’t just jump into the discussion; ease your way into it. Start off by talking about your family, how you’re feeling about work and home in general, and your love for your wife. Begin speaking about the kids, as well, mentioning different accomplishments they’ve made lately or even the trouble they’ve gotten into. Talk about your own feelings of being a parent. This will provide a natural segway into talking about not having more kids.You might say something like “Josiah is a really good kid and I love him more than life. I didn’t realize parenting was gonna be this hard though, did you?”

, Once you have opened up the conversation, break the news to your wife. Be open, honest, and direct with her about your decision. Let her know if this is final for you or if you are open to having future discussions about it. Know that if your wife truly wants more children, having more than one discussion will probably be necessary.

Say “I was looking at you, Isaiah, and Chloe today and I just felt like our family is complete. I don’t think that I want to have any more children and I wanted to see how you feel about that. But, this is a really big topic so I don’t want you to feel like we have to only discuss it today.”

, Explain to your wife your reasons for not wanting more children. It could be because of finances, marital discord, or general contentment with how things are.

Say, “With how things are financially, I just don’t think we can afford another kid. I didn’t realize children were going to be so expensive, and I would never not want Amy in our lives, but I just don’t want any more children.”

, Once you tell her how you feel, allow her time to tell you her own thoughts. She might react negatively to this news; if so, remain calm, without yelling or walking away from her. Find out why she wants or doesn’t want to have more children., To truly hear and understand, don’t interrupt your wife when she is talking. Avoid looking at the television or your phone, as well. Try summarizing and repeating back to her what she says so that she knows you are listening.For instance, you might say, “It sounds like you’re confused because when we got married, I told you I wanted three kids. And now you feel like I’ve gone back on my promise.”

, If your wife is set on having another child, she will likely feel confused, hurt or angry. Should she have questions for you, answer them to the best of your ability. She deserves your honesty., At the end of the talk, be sure to tell her that you love her and are still committed to the family. Your revelation may have her feeling confused or insecure, so work to reverse that.

You might say “Even though I don’t want to have more kids, I'm blessed to have these beautiful children with you. And I’m glad you’re my wife. I love you.”

Instead, wake up with enough time to feel relaxed. This may not be the same as a leisurely morning, but having even 10 more minutes to do what you need to do can be a real improvement on your mood.


Give yourself time to truly do what you have to do in the morning--not what you can do under pressure. Yes, you can get to the bus stop 20 minutes after getting up, but that should be an emergency plan. Instead, give yourself time to do what you need to do with focus and calmness.
Start the day by giving yourself a moment to breathe and collect yourself for what the day will hold.One very simple mindfulness exercise is upon awakening, take 10 deep breaths. This simple act gives you time to transition to awakening not with panic, anxiety, or frantic behavior, but simply being where you are now for a moment.;
, Decide each morning to approach the world with optimism and hope.


Visualize your day going well. Envision yourself doing well on the math test, asking out that cute co-worker on a date, or finishing your taxes.
Optimism does not mean you refuse to acknowledge things do not always go as planned. If you worry about negative outcomes, counteract these thoughts by envisioning yourself overcoming these problems, getting over disappointment, or simply trying again.
Instead of saying ""I can't,"" start the day off by saying, ""I can.""
You cannot fully control what happens to you. Sometimes bad things will happen. But you can control how you prepare yourself for what life gives you. Starting the day off with a positive mindset can help you deal with things in a healthy way., Before you start your day and focus on responsibilities, take a few moments to meditate. Start by taking deep breaths. Inhale slowly through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Hold each breath for a count of 5.


Focusing on your breath and clearing your mind of any outside thoughts can help you start the day feeling balanced and peaceful.If you believe in a higher power, pray. Even if you do not believe in a higher power, focusing on a wish or desire can be powerful.

, Before you get out of bed, or while you are in the shower or fixing breakfast, take a few moments to focus on what you are thankful for. Starting your day by thinking of the positive things in your life can help get you into the right frame of mind for the rest of the day.You can be grateful for anything in your life. You can reflect on your family or friends, your health, your job, your bed, your house, the food in the cabinets, the sunshine or rain outside, or even for just being alive.
Set a ""low bar"" for happiness. This means that the little things will make you happy, and you will try to stop taking things for granted.Spend the morning focusing on the good things in your life instead of what you lack or what you have to do before the day is over., Before you start your day, read some kind of affirmation. This can be a positive quote, a religious verse, or a short story. When you do this, get in touch with your inner strength. Tackle the day by being assured and strong instead of weak and passive.Write down your favorite quote or verse on a slip of paper and keep it by your bedside table. That way you can see it as soon as you wake.
Read an entry from a blog, newspaper, or website that is uplifting instead of negative., Instead of dreading the day, anticipate your day. Find things to look forward to, even if it's lunch time or seeing a coworker. This helps you get going on a positive note instead of dragging your feet because you dread what's to come.


Before you go to bed, make a list or mental list of what you are looking forward to the next day, this week, this month, or in life., Many people set alarms on their cell phone, and as soon as they turn it off, they check texts, e-mails, and social media. This can make you feel like you're starting your day hectic and chaotic. E-mail, Facebook, Twitter, and other interactive sources bombard our minds with people's electronic voices, photos, news updates, ideas, and opinions. By exposing yourself to this first thing in the morning, you are cluttering up your mind before you have a chance to fully wake and come out of sleep.As soon as you turn off your alarm, back away from the cell phone. Going straight to your cell phone tends to overwhelm you with chatter, rather than useful and pertinent information. This removes focus from what is the here and now. Wait at least 30-60 minutes before checking anything. If you have to check work e-mail, if possible, wait 30 minutes, check your work e-mail, but leave the other stuff for later. Give yourself time to spend with yourself before interacting with the ceaseless stream of internet chatter., Don't dwell on what you did or didn't do yesterday. Instead, start each day fresh. Get organized for the tasks you have to complete today, and face the day as something new without the weight of the past.


If you had a bad day the day before, leave that behind you. Focus on a new day instead. How can you make today better? How can you fix any mistakes or avoid situations that made the previous day bad?
We all have things from the previous day we have to continue working on or finish. When you pick up the project from the day before, treat it fresh because today is a new day., Make sure to wake up early enough that you give yourself enough time to get ready. You need time to focus your morning and mentally prepare for the day. More than that, you need time to get all your morning tasks done. Rushing around causes stress and makes you forget things and perhaps be unprepared for the day.


Waking up early can help you leave for work on time, which can help you get to work on time and avoid a speeding ticket., Instead of rushing through the morning, go slow and take your time. Rushing around trying to get your day started can cause unneeded stress.Going slow helps you stay in the moment. Take the time to focus on the water from your shower, taste the flavors of your breakfast, or look at the morning sunshine. This can help you focus on your surroundings instead of getting wrapped up in your head., Eating healthy in the morning can help your brain and body work at optimal levels throughout the day. Eat a high fiber diet that includes fruits, whole grains, and low-fat protein food in your breakfast.Avoid bagels and muffins, along with foods with high sugar content. This will slow you down.
Eggs are a great protein-rich breakfast food. Scramble them with some low-fat cheese or make a spinach and avocado omelet. Use egg whites if you are concerned about cholesterol.Berries are great to eat with your breakfast. They are high in antioxidants, low in calories, and rich in vitamins and minerals. Add a cup of fresh or unsweetened frozen strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, or raspberries.
Eat a nutritious cereal. Many kinds of cereal are full of fiber, whole grains, and protein. Stay away from cereals with high sugar contents and that are full of artificial ingredients. Look for at least 3 grams (0.11 oz) of fiber and less than 6 grams (0.21 oz) of sugar. Also, try oatmeal. Make sure to eat plain oats and not the packets, which are full of sugar and other additives. Add nuts, fresh fruit, spices like cinnamon, or a few dark chocolate morsels to add flavor.
Try dairy, such as cottage cheese or yogurt. Just make sure not to get the fruit yogurts with extra added sugar. Add honey to them, mix in fresh fruit like pineapple or strawberries, or place them in a smoothie., After sleeping for 7-8 hours, your body is dehydrated. It is especially important to drink a lot of water in the morning to replenish the hydration in your body. After waking up, drink 1-2 cups of water to start your body off properly hydrated., Instead of starting your day with coffee, drink lemon water. Pour yourself a cup of lukewarm water and squeeze a fresh lemon into it. This helps boost your metabolism for the day, boost your energy, and cleanse your mouth and throat.


Wait 30 minutes after drinking the water before you brush your teeth, drink another beverage, or eat breakfast., Tea has numerous health benefits. Starting your day with tea instead of a coffee can be a positive change to make your day better. Try green tea, which includes catechins, powerful antioxidants and disease fighters. Yerba mate is another tea with tons of antioxidants and healthy benefits.Tea contains caffeine, but in lower doses. An average cup of coffee contains 150-200 mg of caffeine, while black tea contains 60-90 mg and green tea contains 35-70 mg. Green tea, white tea, oolong tea, mate, and black tea all contain caffeine, so you can get your morning caffeine fix, but at a lower dosage.
The caffeine in tea gently enters your blood stream, which doesn't give you a jittery feeling., Exercising is one of the best methods to start off your day for your mind as well as the body. It keeps you fit as well as freshens up your mind from its state of sleep. Exercising increases brain function, which can help you get a jump-start on the day. Exercise also reduces stress and boosts your metabolism.Go for walk, go for a bike ride, go to the gym, or walk on the treadmill.Do yoga. Yoga is a great way to start off the day by not only getting active but by allowing yourself some time for reflection and meditation.Stretch. Gently wake up your body and mind by stretching your muscles. Elongate your spine and stretch out your arms and legs one at a time.Lift your arms over your head and bend from side to side. Twist your torso. Bend down and touch the floor. Slowly ease your body into the day as you loosen up the muscles for the day., Write down the tasks for the day. Make a to-do list and make an effort to follow it. It will keep you organized and make your day easier.


Make sure your to-do list is manageable. There are only so many things you can do in a day. Prioritize what has to be done on this particular day and put that in the ""Things To Do Today"" column. Make a separate column for ""Things To Do If I Have Time."" The tasks in this column should be able to be done at a later date if you run out of time.
Get organized the night before. Make your to-do list before you go to bed. Pack your work or gym bag. Prepare your lunch. Lay out your work clothes. These small tasks won't take long before bed and can help make your morning run smoothly., Starting your day by acting the way you want to feel can help you be more positive. If you feel grumpy or tired, do something physical to make yourself feel happy. The easiest thing to do is smile. Just smile because you are alive and you can. Watch or listen to something humorous so you can laugh. It makes you feel positive and really beautiful about yourself and the world that surrounds you.


Try other actions to get yourself to feel happier. Jump up and down. Listen to peppy music. Dance. You may feel stupid, but it can help lift the mood for the day., Put flowers in your eye line so they are one of the first things you see when you wake up. If you don't want flowers, try placing a bright, colorful painting instead. Seeing something bright and vibrant instead of dull walls can help you start your day off right.Bright colors are supposed to help stimulate the brain and get you moving.After getting out of bed, open up the curtains or blinds to let the sunlight in. This can help you feel energized and more positive about the day. If you don't want to let outside light in, or it's raining, trying soothing light instead., Essential oils are aromatic compounds found in parts of plants, such as the seeds, bark, stems, roots, and flowers. They are used in foods, beauty treatments, and some health care practices. Essential oils can be especially helpful in waking you up in the morning, helping to reduce anxiety, and increasing concentration. When choosing essential oils, do research into what you're getting; there are a lot of bold claims out there, and while some people swear by the use of only therapeutic oils, others say the use of that term is only a marketing tactic, and any essential oils will be suitable.


Many companies that sell essential oils offer wake up or morning blends that are supposed to help you get your day started.Try mixing Peppermint oil and Wild Orange oil to help wake you up and chase away drowsiness.Mix two drops of Peppermint oil with two drops of Wild Orange oil.You can place it in a diffuser while you are eating breakfast, or dab it on the back of your neck or wrists after waking.
Lemon oil is known for its ability to help with focus and concentration. You can also put this oil in the diffuser or on your neck and wrist in the morning while you're getting ready.Open up your sinuses and prepare your body for deep, cleansing breaths by using Eucalyptus oil or a Breathing blend. Dab a small drop on the inside of your nose and then take a shower. Take some deep breaths as you wake up.Try patchouli oil for grounding and stability. Lavender oil is good for calming. Frankincense helps with mental clarity and peaceful feelings., To make mornings less hectic, start a habit where you keep your important items in one easily accessible place. Put your keys, wallet, purse, public transit card, and other important items there. This way, you're never looking for that lost item when you're running behind."
"
Give yourself enough time to get ready if you want to learn to be on time.,
Don't give yourself permission to be late by making excuses for it.,
Allow ample time for your journey.,
Avoid overextending yourself by scheduling too many appointments around the same time.,
Refrain from accepting invitations that you cannot realistically fit into your schedule.,
Always give yourself more time than you need to get there.",How to Avoid Being Late," You don't want to rush because that will likely make you forget something. If you have an early appointment, prepare the night before by getting your clothes ready and making sure that everything you need, such as car keys and cell phone, is ready to go.;
, You may think that it's just a few minutes, but tardiness is a habit that often gets worse, and minutes will grow. Therefore, take tardiness seriously and recognize that it is a bad habit that should not be excused.

, Take into consideration the time of day that you will be traveling, and always add enough time for travel delays and other problems that could crop up, such as finding parking or getting lost if you are heading out to an unfamiliar destination.

, By doing this, you are setting yourself up to being late. If you do have more than one meeting at a time, then make sure that you schedule enough time in between so that you can travel from one to another without rushing or risking being late.

, Not only will you be creating a stressful situation for yourself because you will be forced to follow through on the invite, but you will most likely be late and upset the person you are meeting. It's better to decline the invitation and risk disappointing the person, than risking offending them by being late.

, Better safe than sorry, and it's okay to be a little bit early. For Example, if you have to go to a wedding that starts at 5:00 and you know it takes 20 minutes to get there,leave at 4:30. You WILL get there on time!

Acknowledge her needs.,
Determine a time to reopen the conversation, if you'd like.,
Find ways to compromise.,
Spend time together as a family.",How to Tell Your Wife You Don't Want Any More Children2," From your conversation, you may have learned some things about your wife. Perhaps she told you that her desire to have another child comes from loneliness. Or she may miss when the kids were younger and needed her more. Find ways to help her work through these issues and revisit the conversation about having more kids later.For instance, if she feels lonely, make an effort to come home earlier from work. Spend quality time together each day. Play with your kids together as a couple and mark out family time.

, Though you might feel sure of your decision right now, you may change your mind later. Set a time in the future for you and your wife to discuss having more children if you foresee that you might change your mind.

If you don’t want another child because your children are very young, you could agree to talk about this when your children are in school and more independent.

, There are very few ways to compromise on the issue of having another child. But for example, if your wife is looking for someone to take care of, see if she would be happy with getting a dog, instead. Or offer babysitting services to your friends or family so your wife can get more interaction with infants.Babysitting small children might even change her mind about wanting another baby!

, Be sure to spend time each day appreciating your family. Have family dinners together without electronics on hand. Plan regular weekend outings to the skating rink or bowling alley. Limit your hours working overtime so you don’t miss out on time with those who mean the most."
"
Give her some space to think.,
Discuss a potential vasectomy or hysterectomy with your wife.,
Determine if this is a dealbreaker.",How to Tell Your Wife You Don't Want Any More Children3," After your talk, your wife may change her mind about wanting kids. She might also be very disappointed. Either way, give her some space to process this information and don’t try to make her think the way you do about the issue. Don’t bring up the issue again until she says she’s ready to talk.Continue to check in on her emotionally. Ask her how she’s feeling and do random acts of kindness for her like surprising her with flowers or cooking her favorite meal.

, Though your body is your own, you should still make any permanent decisions with your spouse’s knowledge. Discuss your desire to get a vasectomy or hysterectomy with your wife before you make an appointment to do so. This will help foster trust and openness in your relationship., Perhaps you have children from outside of your marriage and your wife has none of her own. In cases like this, the issue of children might be a dealbreaker. Talk to your wife to determine what you can do to keep your marriage together or whether it’s better to move forward separately."
"
Decide what is important to you.,
Have work goals.,
Have goals for life too.",How to Maintain a Work Life Balance1," Is work or family more important? Both are necessary, so you’ll need to make conscious choices as to how you balance your time and commitments.


It’s all about perspective.Sometimes just a small change in the way you view things can make a difference. Set your priorities in order. Aim for contentment rather than overfilling the bank. Plan holidays. Surprise your significant other. Go to a football game with the kids and at the same time put your heart and soul into your work during office hours.;
, You don’t want to feel smothered by a dead-end job, do you? Think of realistic goals for yourself to achieve at work. When you succeed at work, the rewards will spill over into your family life. Work goals range from short-term to long-term.Have short-term goals. What do you hope to accomplish in the next month? Do you want to increase efficiency in your department? Try to approach old problems in novel ways. No problem is too small for reconsideration when it comes to efficiency. Do you want to make some slight change in the work environment? Make your goals known no matter how small. Upper management loves to see people take charge.
Have long-term goals. Most of these will take years to accomplish, but having a long-term goal or several will help motivate you to make the most of your time at work. Do you want to advance up the professional ladder? Do you want a raise? Think about where you’d like to be in 5 years. If your answer is: “not in this job.” Then you probably need to start thinking of strategies to help realize your goals.

, If you have goals at home too, they can positively affect your work life. Strive for personal growth. Learn something new, whether or not it relates to your job. When you learn, your brain constantly applies new knowledge to old tasks. Most likely, you’ll begin to think of better ways of doing your job too.Think about long-term personal goals too. Do you want to have children, get married, or move to a new area? Consider what is important to you at home and then make career decisions that will help you get there.

Let go of expectations.,
Ask your child to fill you in about their in-laws.,
Ask questions to get to know each other.,
Look for their good traits.",How to Get Along with Your Child's In‐Laws1," Keep an open mind about your son- or daughter-in-law’s family as you get to know them, and don’t assume that their differences are flaws. Every family has their own traditions and quirks, so it’s not realistic to expect that your child’s in-laws will do everything the same way your family does. You also have to consider that you will have to ""share"" your child and their family with the in-laws.For instance, as soon as your grandchildren are born, you might expect to be the primary babysitter. However, if the other in-laws live nearby, they may want to share in the childcare duties, too.;
, Before you meet your child’s in-laws for the first time, ask your child whether there is anything you need to know about them. Find out whether there are any topics you should avoid talking about or any rules of cultural etiquette you should observe.You might say, “We want to make sure the first meeting is pleasant. Fill me in on your in-laws, dear.”

, Be friendly and curious when you get together with your child’s in-laws. Try to establish common ground by finding out whether you share any interests or have had similar experiences.Being genuinely interested in your child’s in-laws is a good way to start the relationship on the right foot. Everyone is flattered when someone else wants to know more about them.
Keep topics of conversation light when you’re still getting to know each other. Avoid touchy topics that might offend or upset someone.
If you’re worried about not having enough to talk about, ask your child to help you establish common ground with their in-laws.

, Maintain a positive frame of mind towards your child’s in-laws, and focus on the qualities you appreciate in them. If you’re unsure about whether you like them, give them the benefit of the doubt – time and familiarity may help you to like them more in the future.If you like your child’s spouse, start by appreciating the fact that these people raised your son- or daughter-in-law. You might say, ""I don't know you well, but you've raised a mighty fine daughter. We are so glad to have Jessica as a part of our family.""

Decide what stuff is unnecessary.,
Do quick cleans.,
Do big cleans every season.,
Shrink your wardrobe.,
Stop buying new things you do not really need.,
Downsize.,
Create white space.,
Make your bed every day.",How to Simplify Your Life1," Simplifying doesn't need to be complicated: Identify what's most important to you and eliminate everything else. Imagine you had to pack everything you owned in an hour to move across the country for ten years, or for the rest of your life. What would you take? What would be essential? Cut your possessions down to the bare essentials and get rid of everything that’s merely taking up space.


If you tend toward hoarding for nostalgic or emotional reasons, try to evaluate your attachment to stuff. Start a ""get rid of"" pile of things and take them immediately to the thrift store to donate. Old candlesticks that haven't seen a candle since Reagan was in office? Toss them. Stack of Billboard Magazine from the mid-70s? Toss it.
In general, if you have not used an object in 18 months, you are likely not going to.
Is it something that actually makes your happy? Some objects may be valuable, but does not really make you happy to use or have. This includes gifts. Your great-aunt may have meant well giving you her old china cabinet, but you have neither china nor does it fit in your life.;
, Walk through your house with a big basket. Fill it with necessaries. Crank up something good on the stereo and give yourself 15 minutes to de-clutter and see how much you can get done. Throw away garbage, gather clothes and put them in the laundry. Be judicious. If it's not necessary, throw it in the garbage.


Focus on the high-traffic areas, like the living room and the kitchen. If dishes are piled up in the sink, you'll feel stressed out and messy, even if the rest of the house is clean-looking and tidy. If you've only got a little bit of time, focus on the most important spaces.
Don't worry about getting the dirt out of every corner and ""cleaning"" every surface. Just focus on tidying. Put things away, straighten things up, make the place look right.

, A couple times every year, you should do a more thorough cleaning to get rid of accumulated stuff and simplify your living space, as well as cleaning the house of dirt and grime. Pet hair, dust, and other debris can accumulate in even the tidiest spaces, making it important to do thorough cleaning: Vacuum, shampoo the carpet, clean the toilets, scrub the walls, wash the windows. Get the dirt out!


Go through desks and clear out the paper archives, too. Clean out drawers to get rid of that hidden clutter. Move toward eliminating paper waste and digitizing important documents. This will simplify your living space. Go paperless.

, Find your favorite, most versatile clothing items and donate the rest. If it's worn out, get rid of it. If it doesn't fit anymore, get it to someone who can wear it. If you've always meant to wear it but just never seem to find the occasion, give it up. Pare down what is in your closet.


If you’ve got a big war-chest of clothes that you're attached to, consider simplifying by season. There’s no reason you should be digging through sweaters in the middle of summer, so pack up all your seasonal clothes in separate tubs and put them away until that season rolls around. Out of sight, out of mind.
Throw ""Naked Lady"" parties or other get-togethers in which you can all throw old or ill-fitting clothes into a pile with a bunch of friends and trade. Maybe that pair of jeans doesn't work for you anymore but would look great on someone else. Anything that's left at the end of the night, donate.

, Just because you found a good deal on something does not make it necessary to buy. Simplify by stopping the additional accumulation of junk in your life.


Before you buy anything new, ask yourself:""Do I really need this?""
""Is there a sustainable alternative?""
""Do I have a family member or friend who already provides this service or product?""


Avoid buying new books. If you read a book, and will re-read it, by all means buy that book. But most books people read once, and that is it. Instead, go to the library. You will have more space for things you actually use.
Avoid buying new housewares - make do with what you have. If you need a new microwave, that is one thing. But instead of a pastry cutter, simply using two knives you already have will save space. Alton Brown famously promotes that the only ""uni-tasker"" in the kitchen should be the fire extinguisher.
Research rental options in your town. Consider renting a leaf blower that you use only once in fall, rather than buying one. Tool-libraries are increasingly common, allowing you to use what you need for a short time, then return it.

The flip side of this is to share what you have with your friends, family, and neighbors. If you start this practice, you may reduce the need to buy, store, and organize so many tools and ""conveniences.""



, Have a small but comfortable home and learn to live with less. Buy less, savor quality more, and put the spare money in the savings account for a rainy day or a reward vacation.


Consider renting rather than buy a home or items you need to use. Then the repairs, rates, and dry rot are someone else's problem, not yours.
Own fewer items but make sure that what you do own has greater versatility. Objects able to do double or even triple duty are the most desirable. Remember that working to pay for objects is not an ideal approach to living happily; review your priorities.

, Having empty space in your home, your room, or your office can help to relax you and create a feeling of simplicity. Don't clutter your walls with entertaining stuff, let the emptiness be calming and elegant. Let simplicity trump adornment.


White space doesn't need to be ""white."" If you don't like the feeling of a sterile, super-clean living space, then natural wood, exposed brick, or other patterns are perfectly simple and effective at relaxing you. White space doesn't have to actually be white, just free of clutter. No shelving, movie posters, or hanging frames. Simple lines and clean empty spaces on the walls.

, It only takes five minutes and it can do wonders to change your mood. Your bedroom looks much more elegant, simple and tidy with the bed made and cleaned up. Taking little steps like making the bed can help to de-stress you and simplify your life.


If it's simpler for you to leave your sheets in a pile, so be it. The point is taking little steps to simplify your experience of the day. Maybe instead you spend meditative time making your coffee every morning, grinding the beans, heating the water, and pouring it into the press pot. Maybe you start the day by tidying the kitchen and listening to the radio. Have a routine.

Choose the correct line of work.,
Think about work-life balance when planning your family.,
Consider long-term time commitments.",How to Maintain a Work Life Balance2," Your profile of work holds the most important spotlight when it comes to maintaining a balance between work and family life. If the work that you do is what you love, making that balance is a way easier job.


Pick a profession that gives you a sense of satisfaction. Every job comes with its set of difficulties and deadlines. If you are satisfied with what you’ve accomplished, even are proud of a job well done, you’ll be able to focus all of your energy on work while you are there.You may need to switch jobs. Some jobs and bosses are too demanding. If the salary or level satisfaction from your current job is not enough to keep you there and to outweigh time with your family, it is probably time to find another position. , Just as you should consider how your job affects your family, you should also think about how your family affects your ability to complete your job.Ask questions about who should work in your family. Should both husband and wife work? What effect, both financial and personal, will this have? How many children can we take care of, while both working? Are there any other family members that we can rely on to shoulder the load?

, Sometimes, finding a work-life balance means more than just balancing family time with work. Consider some of the following questions:


Do you want to be a part of other communities? Do you volunteer and does your job give you enough time to do so?
What about hobbies? Does your current job allow you to do things that make you happy outside of work?
Are there other time commitments that figure into your work life? How far is your commute? If you choose to live further away from work, then you’ll spend that much more time every day commuting in between. Then there are the costs of maintaining a car. Consider finding a place to live that is closer to work."
"
Get organized.,
Keep a work diary.,
Draw a line between professional and personal life.,
Get your email habits in check.",How to Maintain a Work Life Balance3," Use to-do lists at work and at home. Sometimes, it can be difficult to juggle all the tasks you need to finish. Create lists in order of importance. Get the most difficult or most important tasks done early in the morning, so you’ll have progressively easier tasks throughout the day.Don’t erase completed tasks on your to-do list. Some people scratch out or completely erase finished tasks. Many psychologists agree that you should also have a list of things you’ve completed. Doing so reminds you that you’ve been productive.

, At the end of each day at work, write down what you need to do the next day and thoughts you have about accomplishing those goals efficiently. This way you’ll know you can resume work easily the next morning. You’ll also feel better about leaving tasks unaccomplished.

, This is a very important rule that we tend to overlook or break. Sometimes, your boss may hinder your ability to strictly demarcate work time and home time. Sometimes, you will face deadlines that force you to work at home.


Do your best to abide by this rule. It can be hard and if working at home is part of your job, reduce the amount of time spent at home as much as possible. Limit your at-home work to specific hours of the day or to particular days. So if you designate Monday evenings for work, try not to work on other days of the week.Don’t go home and immediately start working. The first thing you should do when you get home is tend to your family. Ask your significant other about their day. If you have children, sit down with them, play with them, and help them with their homework. Only after you’ve filled the needs of your family should your mind turn back to work.
If you work from home, then you need to find a way of “clocking out”. Have a time when work has to stop. Or designate spaces in your home for work purposes only., Email is a double edge sword. It speeds up communication around a company, but the amount of time you spend checking it might cripple your productivity. Consider only checking your email during designated time periods. Check it once in the morning, once after lunch, and once before you leave for the day. This will allow you to answer critical emails and reply in a timely manner. "
"
Rely on your friends and family.,
Take time for yourself.,
Get enough sleep.,
Eat healthy.,
Exercise.",How to Maintain a Work Life Balance4," You don’t have to shoulder the burden of work and life. Talk to your family members. Tell them when you are stressed and when you have a problem at work. They probably won’t mind listening to your issues. And you’ll feel better afterwards. Everyone needs support networks.

, It can be exhausting having to play the role of employee and family member. You need to decompress. Play golf, go shopping, or see a movie. Blow off some steam before it builds up and you explode. Take some time where all you have to worry about is yourself. This is key. Have some “me” time., Prioritize it. You may be up against deadlines or have dozens of time-sensitive tasks to complete. Without sleep, your brain won’t be able to function on a level needed to take care of all of those problems. Get a solid 8 hours of sleep a night, every night., It is tempting to grab fast food, while you rush from the office to your home. Take time to eat healthy. Healthy nutrition translates to more energy, which you’ll need to maintain a balance., Working out, walking, going for a jog, or swimming at a pool can be great on a number of levels. You get some time to yourself. While you are working out, your brain will continue to examine problems from work or at home. Eventually, you’ll discover answers. The most obvious result is that you’ll feel better about yourself and feel better too. Those “gains” will make balancing work and life easier."

Be adaptable when it comes to family plans.,
Avoid trying to compete with your child’s in-laws.,
Resist jealousy.,
Compromise.",How to Get Along with Your Child's In‐Laws2," Holidays, summer vacations, and other family events can become complicated when your child and their spouse have to divide their time between both families. Be understanding of logistical issues, and consider having your family celebrations at less traditional times to avoid scheduling conflicts and squabbles.For instance, maybe you could have your family’s Christmas get-together on Boxing Day instead.

, Don’t try to outdo your son- or daughter-in-law’s parents in terms of personal qualities, favors, or gifts. You and they are different people, and there’s no point in comparing yourself to them. Instead, be yourself and focus on maintaining the best relationships you can with your child and their in-laws.It’s particularly important to avoid competing over any grandchildren you have. Love and quality time are more important to kids than expensive presents or trips.

, Don't take it personally if your child spends more time with their in-laws. Sometimes it’s not practical for a young couple to split their visits between their families equally, especially if long distances and travel costs are a concern. Your child became part of their spouse’s family when they got married, so try not to feel hurt if they visit their in-laws frequently.If you feel like your child makes more of an effort to see their in-laws than to visit you, have a heart-to-heart with them about the situation. Be honest about your feelings, but avoid accusing them of not caring about you.
Say something like, “We miss you, and it bothers us that you come to see us so rarely, especially because you see Jane’s family so much. What can we do to make visiting easier for you?”

, When you have a family conflict, work with your child and their in-laws to come up with a solution that’s acceptable to everyone. Take everybody’s personality and needs into account as you look for a resolution.Your child’s in-laws will be more likely to work with you if you take a positive, proactive approach to finding a good solution.
Remember that you can only control your own actions. If your child’s in-laws refuse to cooperate, it’s natural to feel disappointed, but you should still take the high road to avoid damaging the relationship.

"
"
Stay in the family loop.,
Set boundaries.,
Take initiative to resolve disagreements.,
Sit down together as a family to discuss plans.,
Keep everyone updated on wedding plans.",How to Get Along with Your Child's In‐Laws3," Communicate regularly with your child, and ask them to keep you updated on their family happenings too. Misunderstandings and resentment can arise if people are left out of discussions or not informed of plans.If you live far away from each other, consider having a weekly phone call or Skype session with your child and their spouse.
It’s especially important to communicate early and frequently about time-sensitive topics like holiday plans.

, If you interact with your child’s in-laws frequently, create boundaries that will help you keep the relationship positive and enjoyable for everyone involved. Setting a few ground rules can prevent conflicts later on.If your child’s in-laws do or say things that you find inconsiderate or uncomfortable, consider talking to your child and their spouse about it. Your son- or daughter-in-law is probably the best person to handle issues with their parents.
For instance, if you had made plans to eat dinner with your child and their family, but the in-laws encroach on your plans, you might express your frustration. Ask your child and their spouse to ask that they respect your plans.

, If you have a conflict with your child’s in-laws, reach out to make amends right away. Ignoring the problem will damage the relationship more over time.You don’t have to become best friends with your child’s in-laws, but for the sake of future family well-being, it’s a good idea to try to keep the peace.

, Take advantage of family gatherings or other events where everyone is present to speak to your child's in-laws about upcoming plans that are important to you such as holiday traditions or family reunions.

You might say, ""Rose, David, we wanted to make sure you guys knew about our yearly visit to the pumpkin patch. It falls on your weekend to get the kids, but we're willing to switch so that you don't lose a visit. Plus, you all are welcome to join us. It's great fun!""

, If your child is getting married and you’re helping to plan the wedding, stay in touch with their future in-laws throughout the process. Make sure everyone is on the same page about the preparations being made.Planning a wedding can be a good way to make friends with your child’s future in-laws.
If you and the in-laws disagree on an aspect of wedding planning, look for a solution early instead of leaving it until the last minute. If you can’t find a compromise, consider deferring to the engaged couple’s wishes.

Plan what you can, or embrace your inner chaos.,
Split household chores evenly.,
Streamline your finances.,
Keep in mind the adage: ""A place for everything, and everything in it's place."",
Prepare quick meals.,
Simplify your parenting.",How to Simplify Your Life2," For some of us, there’s no point in thinking about planning for a trip until the hour before you’re about to leave the house. What’s the use in stressing out for three days over packing? Alternatively, others have to lay out every day’s wardrobe in advance, calculating the benefits of every item, until you can be confident that you’ve got everything you need.


If you tend toward procrastination, don't tell yourself you need to change your ways, unless it's getting in the way of your productivity or your ability to finish things on time. If it works for you, it works. Make sure you schedule enough last-minute time to finish tasks, and you'll let those deadlines produce your best work. Simple and easy.
If you stress about unfinished tasks, do them ahead of time to put them out of your mind. Don't abandon the packing half-way because you started early–finish it off and call it done. Simplify by doing it now, getting it done, and relaxing. Simple and relaxed.

, A common source of complication and stress is a messy living space and disorganized methods of handling it. Finding the time to do the laundry, wash all the dishes, cook meals, and take care of other essential chores can be a big hassle if you don't go about it in a simple, organized way. Get together with your family or your housemates and agree on simple ways to divide up the chores and simplify the work around the house.Separate tasks by day. Make everyone contribute to the litter-box cleaning and the laundry-doing, but not every day. Let someone take the messy jobs for a while and switch over to other jobs for a while on a rolling basis. Write up a schedule everyone agrees on and post it in the kitchen for simple, easy access.
Separate tasks by preference. For example, if you just can't stand doing the laundry and tend to let it pile up, strike a deal with your roommates — if they handle the laundry, you'll agree to cook a big meal for everyone three nights a week (when they've got to work late) or to consistently wash the dishes. Find a way to balance things for your situation.

, Nothing gets more complicated than money. If you can, simplify your finances as much as possible by consolidating your debts and creating as few payments as possible for each month. Create a budget, based on how much money you've got coming in every month, and calculate your average expenditures of known and estimated amounts. Stick to the plan and spending gets simpler.


Set your bills up to debit automatically from your account. If you've budgeted accurately, you should never have to worry about paying bills again. What could be simpler?
Make saving money your default. If you're not sure how to approach the task of simplifying your finances, err on the side of saving. The less you spend, the less you're thinking about money.

, Assigning a place for each object simplifies life dramatically. It is a key component in making a space less frustrating, more beautiful and pleasurable.


It creates calm. If keys go in the key bowl by the doorway, it prevents last-minute panics for finding them. This creates calmness and gives you power in a chaotic world.
Your space is more pleasurable. A workbench that has your tools visible, orderly, and organized is more enjoyable to work at than one that requires a massive hunt for the right screwdriver.
Your living space brings more joy to others. For instance, couches are for sitting on, not for holding laundry. Disorganized spaces have a way of putting off visitors; laundry on your couch suggests your pants are offered a better seat than your guests. Organized spaces also make it more likely you will invite others over.
You enjoy and use what you have. If your pantry is a mess, you may not realize you have five pounds of flour, and end up buying more rather than using what you have.
Assigning spaces starts with a single step. Some people can get overwhelmed by the thought of everything being in the absolute perfect spot, and being afraid to be wrong. It is better to just try something rather than do nothing. Besides, there is usually more than one way to organize and simplify...do what works for you.

, The end of a hard day of work is probably not the best time to find yourself wrist-deep in homemade coq-au-vin. Find recipes that are quick to prepare, and search online for quick meals that you can use with the ingredients already in your house. Spend the spare time enjoying the meal and your family rather than over-complicating the cooking process.

, Don't make lunch, don't clean the dirty clothes, don't put the toys away. Expect your children to start doing things for themselves at age-appropriate stages. In the long run it isn't easier to ""just do it"" for your children, as it teaches your children that you'll always do it and that they don't have to. Do tell your children where they can find the things to do tasks for themselves — show them how the first few times, but then let go.



Create a chore chart for all children to follow and complete weekly. Involve them in its creation and they'll be more ready to buy into using it.
Stop over-scheduling. Kids historically have not been shuttled to after-school activities as much as they often are today. It is OK to have days when your children do not have ballet, ice hockey, Girl Scouts, or oboe lessons.

Identify bad friendships, and work to fix them or end them.,
Learn to tell people “no”.,
Spend more time alone.,
Spend less time on social networking.",How to Simplify Your Life3,"


Do not waste time keeping up with friends who bring you down, waste your time, or bore you. Start by cutting out the relationships that do not uplift you. Or at the very least stop investing so much energy.
You do not have to be rude or invite drama into this process. For example, you do not have to make ugly Facebook updates about how you are making big cuts from your contact list. Just stop making the extra effort. Take away the water and the plant will shrivel.
Make the effort to spend time with people you like. Keep a close group of friends who mean a lot to you and make an effort to spend time with them. It is also OK to have friends and acquaintances that may not be your best friends, but bring you a lot of happiness. The key is to invest your time and energy in people that bring you joy.
Relationships are often in flux; honor this. Your co-worker becomes a friend, you have a falling-out with Maria, and maybe you develop a crush on that cute redhead. Aim for simplicity, but understand that emotions, relationships, and all we go through can be confusing.







, One way that our lives get complicated is being ""agreeable."" We think it helps to simplify if we let other people make the call: where to eat for lunch, what responsibilities to take on at work, whether or not you're available to drive your friend to the airport. Being a doormat won't help you to simplify your life, it'll just get you a face full of other peoples' boot prints. Don't let yourself be tread on. Stand up and learn to say no.


Alternatively, if you tend toward being assertive and don't struggle to let people know how you feel, maybe it might simplify your life to learn to keep quiet sometimes. Don't cause drama if there's no need for drama in the situation.

, Maintaining relationships, romantic and otherwise, gets complicated. When you're focused on other peoples' quirks and habits, you're focused less on yourself and what your needs are. You're complicating your life for others instead of simplifying it for yourself. It's not selfish to want to spend time alone, working on you.


Consider going on a vacation by yourself, traveling solo to a place you've always wanted to visit. Rely on your own skills to navigate and get you through. Maybe try a solo retreat to a monastery of some kind to get really introspective.
Romantic relationships are often complicated, but some key ideas help. Good communication is extremely important. Be sure to have realistic expectations. Do not try to change the other person, nor keep them changing. Have firm but loving boundaries. Never accept abuse.

, Clutter doesn't have to be physical. The psychic clutter of status updates, Tweets, and Instagram posts can do a lot to drag you down and complicate your life. Don't worry about liking everybody's newest posts or keeping a constant check on your different feeds. It'll be there when you've got a free second, and you probably won't even miss it.


If you're feeling ambitious, consider ditching social media entirely. Make face-to-face interactions your priority, and schedule catch-up sessions and phone calls with old friends who you can't keep in touch with, rather than stalking their profile online.

"
"
Put your phone away.,
Stop reading self-improvement manuals, books, and blogs.,
Work from a manageable to-do list.,
Declutter your digital packrattery.,
Do one thing at a time.,
Leave your work at work.,
Meditate for 15 minutes each day.",How to Simplify Your Life4," Nothing will distract you and keep you unfocused more than checking your telephone for messages every two minutes. Texts, emails, Facebook updates and other little messages will be just as compelling an hour from now.


When you're with friends or family, put your phone on silent and keep it tucked away somewhere. Better yet, keep it in the car. Don't look at it. Make a rule at your next get together that the first person to check their phone picks up the tab. Stay focused on your phone and have a simple evening.
Increasingly, people are experiencing a phenomenon known as FOMO: the fear of missing out. What if you don't get that status update before everyone else? What if someone beats you to a witty comment stream message? What if your crush texts and you can't respond right away? Don't let ""convenient"" technology create complicated stress in your life. Be willing to miss out momentarily to enjoy the moment you're experiencing in the real world.

, Other people's advice about living can often be a source of distress. Simplify by giving up the idea of perfection. Be confident that you're a good partner, a good parent, and a good person. Trust yourself more and do what comes naturally.

, For many people, having a little guide through the day makes it a whole lot simpler. Come up with a manageable to-do list and stick to it as closely as possible. What do you hope to accomplish by the end of the day? By the end of the week?


For some people, it might even be helpful to come up with more substantial lists of long-term goals and plans, to help prioritize accomplishments. Simplify your long-term career and life prospects by outlining where you'd like to be in your job in five years, or where you'd like to be living. What do you need to do now to get there?
Record your day if you're not sure where the hours are disappearing to. Keeping a calendar can also simplify your day because you don't have to rack your brains to remember everything continuously.
Celebrate each accomplishment of the day. Working from a to-do list can be a lot more enjoyable if you take a bit of time to celebrate what you've done. Cleaned up the kitchen and straightened your room and done your work for the day? Time for a glass of wine in your sparkling tidy kitchen. Treat yourself., Unplug! Do a massive purge of the things that are cluttering up your computer, start keeping things simple and maintain a regular purging regime.


Place timers on electronic things that suck your time without you noticing. If you can spend more hours than you'd like online, install a timer, and use it. You might be surprised at your level of intensity. Even if you simply add in enforced regular breaks, your use of the technology will instantly simplify.
Try to keep your email box empty. Answer, file, or delete emails upon reading.

, Multi-tasking should be avoided, if possible. It is a myth that a person can focus on more than one thing and do so well. While sometimes you have to, or (as the Zen story below illustrated) want to, one at a time should be your ideal.


Focus on doing the best possible (or ""good enough"" ) job at this moment.
Savor what you are doing, even if it is something mundane. Washing the dishes can be pleasurable, if you reflect on how the soapy water feels, your pleasure from your favorite teacup, and how good it feels to have clean dishes.In an old Zen story, an elder monk chastised some novices for talking while they were supposed to be doing their work. ""When it's time to talk, just talk,"" he said. ""And when it's time to work, just work."" The next day, at lunch, the novices saw the elder monk eating lunch and reading the paper at the same time. They approached him to remind him of his lesson. Why was he not just eating, or just reading, as he had instructed them? ""When it's time to eat lunch and read the paper, just eat lunch and read the paper,"" he said.

, Don't let the complication of your work day mess up your after work life. Don't bring any work back to the house to complete later–stay until you can finish for the day. If you're feeling stressed out after a work day, do something relaxing the minute you get home so you don't have to burden your housemates with complaints about the day. Don't spread the complicated stress around. Simplify.


Cut down your hours as much as you can afford to, if your job is a significant source of complication in your life. If you want to simplify, cutting back on work is one of the easiest ways to do it. Less money, less clutter.
Stop working weekends. Even if you love your work, dragging work into your weekends starts unbalancing the proportion in your life. You might not feel it right now, but eventually, this will lead to burn out and/or passion reduction. Block off every weekend for the next six months. Not a single one of those weekends can include work from now on.

, Just fifteen minutes. It's half a sitcom, or half a wait in line at the DMV, but it can help to make all the difference in your stress levels and your ability to simplify your life and remain calm. Take the small step of spending quiet time, just sitting, in a comfortable space. Focus on your breath. Relax your body and let your mind calm itself. Watch your thoughts.

Use the simple displacement method.,
Come out of the mindset of blame games.,
Open your mind to ideas from friends, acquaintances, and even strangers.,
Set achievable goals, and achieve set goals.,
Come out of the habit of perennial dissatisfaction.,
Don’t overestimate the effects of your level (or lack) of schooling.,
Reframe your situation from different angles.,
Tattoo your mind with conscious, positive thoughts.",How to Remove Mind Tattoos," Mind tattoos and negative mindsets grow in a vacuum. Do not allow such a vacuum to be created in your mind. Increase your curiosity for things around you and beyond, allow yourself the privilege to be wonder-struck. Let the newness of every moment tickle your senses. Question yourself, keep asking what, why, when, where and how. A questioning mind is an open mind. It is not a knowing mind (the knowing mind soon leads to arrogance and shutting down on newness). Only an open mind can be creative. A knowing mind can never be creative.


When you open your mind, it can be filled with creativity, positivity and newness. Negative mindsets and tattoos will be displaced and deleted.
A questioning stance sensitizes the mind in a very special way, enabling it to sense what would have been missed otherwise.;
, The most damaging tattoo is the tendency to look for and find a scapegoat for every situation. Release yourself from the tendency of being problem averse and for shifting away responsibility. Stop wringing up your hands whenever there is a problem; while it is good to hope for a life without problems, realistically it is possible only when you work to make your problems surmountable, by cultivating a problem-friendly attitude. This means just rolling up your sleeves whenever you're faced with a problem, and searching for an opportunity to improve the quality of your life by dealing with the problem. Being faced with a problem is never a problem. It is a way of life and once you have woven problem-solving into the matrix of your life, you will feel stronger, more capable, and freer of the negative mind tattoos.

, A tattooed mind is beset with preconceived ideas and closed to suggestion from outside. Open up your thinking to the ideas, opinions, and viewpoints gathered from your friends, colleagues, and even from strangers. Once you realize the value of these alternative ideas and views, you will be in a position to start using your increased understanding and empathy to improve the quality of your own thought and decision processes.

, A major reason for negative thought process is failure on personal or professional front; not just failure though – it is the failure to learn and grow from failure, to accept it as part of life's lessons. The negative thinking can set in when personal or professional goals are not properly set. An improper understanding of your strengths or constraints often results in goals being not properly set and many excuses being made to sidestep developing a purpose to your life. In letting others make the decisions and change the rules on you, you drift rather than achieve through life. Instead, know yourself, understand yourself, and be yourself when setting your goals. This way you can be successful in setting and achieving your goal and keep failure out of your door. Moreover, do not be dissuaded by the failures but see them as detours that teach what to do better next time.

, Perennial dissatisfaction is a major indication of a person with a negative mindset; a positive thinker can spot such a person a mile away and will do their best to steer clear (hence, you attract more negativity than its opposite). It is good to be acutely aware of your dissatisfaction and unfulfilled desires. However, this awareness should not frustrate you or cause you to give up citing everything as being ""too hard"" or ""all over"". Even if you are frustrated, it should never be reflected in your behavior toward other people. As a matter of fact, you should use this awareness as a stimulus to realize your dreams, and to be grateful for that which you have achieved already. See How to Stop Feeling Like Your Life Isn't Good Enough.

, A feeling of being uneducated or inadequately educated is one of the biggest self-destructing tattoo one can carry around. But higher level schooling can also imprint more negative tattoos: arrogance, self-righteous behavior, and greater dissatisfaction with one's lot in life or sensitivity to past failures. Whatever category you fall into, understand that schooling is different from education. Education is sourced from life itself, the people you meet, the things you discover, and the environment in which you move and observe daily. Very often people with less or no schooling are found to be highly educated in matters of life. Less schooled people are often highly successful because they have minds clear of the biases that schooling can build into us. The more highly schooled who have simply associated their learning with being of a ""higher status"" might actually lack openness to new ideas and empathy for others, so they wind up less likely to succeed. Both would do better to


Realize that universities and degrees do not determine the level of your education and do not even determine a person's all-round intelligence or suitability for the rest of life.
Instead, figure out what you still need to learn and find the fastest way to learn it.

, A situation often appears to be hopeless and irretrievable. In many cases, such catastrophizing does not ultimately turn out to be true, especially where it is based on allowing ourselves to be the victim and to imagine things that are not there. Try to reframe the situation from different angles till you find an angle from where it looks acceptable. For example, in a cricket match in a close run-out decision, sometimes it appears that the batsman is out; however, reframing it from different angles gives the umpire more options of viewing the truth and taking correct decision. Similarly, being your own inner umpire (referee) by mental reframing of the situation often helps you to make the correct decision.

, What we tattoo on any part of the body for others to see is not as important as what we tattoo in our minds. Much of what is tattooed there has been absorbed from the criticisms, expectations, and limitations placed upon us by other people; they are not wanted or chosen tattoos but they are embedded out of obligation, loyalty, misplaced trust, and over-eagerness to please the other. On the other hand, positive, successful, energetic mind tattoos are a must to attain success and are tattoos that we can choose to implant and thrive from. So, it should be your conscious (and ultimately subconscious) endeavor to keep tattooing your mind with thoughts that are only about winning or thriving. Implant and nourish the tattoos that reflect who you want to be, the goals you want to reach, and the successes you seek to achieve. Mentally, make or choose your day's outcomes for the day every single day.


Focus doesn't simply sprout unaided. It requires effort and conscious attention. However, once you are focused, you can achieve a great deal of your heart's desire because you're consciously attending to what needs to be done, as well as channeling your subconscious experience more effectively.

Consider mistakes you made in the past that you don't want to repeat. Gather any practical lessons you can from those mistakes and let go of any theoretical fears surrounding those mistakes. For instance, a child may burn himself by touching a hot stove and thereby learn not to touch other hot stoves, but that experience does not need to prevent that child from touching and exploring other parts of his world.
Past interactions with people can cause you to develop grudges against them, but grudges also drain you of your own energy and resources and ultimately hold you back.;
, Your life is yours to live. Others may offer guidance and advice. Some of this can be helpful, and some of it can be hurtful. Regardless, you need to make decisions based on your own desires and ideas without worrying about what others expect of you.


Keep in mind that even the people closest to you have a limited understanding of who you are at the core.
When you pursue a goal, some may criticize you if it does not fall in line with the things they view as important. For instance, your new passion may not make much money, so someone who values money as a high priority will likely view it as a waste of time. Remember that your values and others' values are not always the same, so running your life according to another's values will not bring satisfaction to your own life.

, Failing to make a choice is a choice in itself. Train yourself to be a more decisive person. If you cling to your indecisiveness, you will continue to doubt yourself at the most crucial moments.

, Right now. You have an indefinite number of “tomorrows” to deal with, and telling yourself that you will start doing something “tomorrow” can quickly become a habit. Stop putting things off and start doing them immediately.


Think of it this way: you may end up pursuing a wrong path, but the sooner you embark on that path, the quicker you can learn your error and set it right. Dragging out the journey will only limit your future opportunities.

, Problems and issues inevitably arise, and many of these issues cannot be avoided forever. The more time you waste on running away, the less time you have for moving forward.


For instance, if there is a misunderstanding or other form of tension between you and someone else, try talking it out with that person. The relationship could break apart afterward, but it could also end up becoming stronger. Either way, the issue will only continue to fester in your life until you take care of it.

, Granted, there are often legitimate obstacles that may prevent you from pursuing a specific goal or idea, but oftentimes, something one considers to be an obstacle can be overcome with a little effort. When there is an obstacle that you can remedy, telling yourself that it prevents you from accomplishing something is simply an excuse, and these excuses need to stop.

, Wanting an explanation for something is natural, but fixating on that desire can actually hold you back if you refuse to act before you have an explanation.

, Everyone has his or her own set of fears and anxieties. Be honest with yourself when identifying the fears that hold you back. Once you know what these fears are, work at letting them go.


Heartbreak is a major fear, especially for those who have already suffered from it. Understand that things can work out with another person even if they didn't work out with someone from your past.
Another fear that haunts many people is fear of the unknown. Change is a scary thing—things can get better, or they can get worse. By avoiding possible evils that could lie around the corner, though, you end up forcing yourself to deal with current evils that definitely do exist already while depriving yourself of possible goods.
Some people even fear success, especially if they do not like to stand out. Understand, however, that people who treat you poorly because of how you stand out are generally not worth impressing in the first place.

, Nobody is perfect, after all. Mistakes are a part of life, and you will continue making mistakes regardless of what you do or don't do. The sooner you embrace the fact that you are imperfect, the quicker you can begin acting in spite of that fact.

, It can be far too easy to focus on all the negative things in life. Instead of thinking about everything that's wrong, though, take a good look at everything that's right and good. Life is often better than one might perceive it to be.


Think about the things you are fortunate to have and be grateful for them. Instead of bemoaning the fact that you can't afford to take an exciting vacation or buy an impressive car, think about the support you get from family and friends or the simple pleasures you can enjoy in your own neighborhood.
You should even acknowledge the good in things you plan to give up. For instance, you might give up a career that you felt miserable in, but that career did provide you with a comfortable life. That, in itself, is something to be glad for.

, Learn from your past, appreciate your present, and focus on your future. Thinking ahead to the life you want to have will give you something to pursue, and having something to pursue will make it easier to walk forward.


In the midst of focusing on the future, you also need to make sure that you do not spend too much time worrying about it. Plan out what you can and form dreams, but don't sweat the little details. You can't control or predict everything, anyway.
Concentrate on one definite goal and aim high. A definite goal gives you something to aim for. Having too many goals can scatter your energy in too many different directions, though. Since you are only focusing on one goal at a time, it is even more important to set goals that challenge you and make the most out of your capabilities.

, Be confident and be brave. Think about who you want to be, and reassure yourself that you already possess the basic qualifications you'll need in order to become that person.


By thinking ""as if"" you are already the person you want to become, your behaviors and mental images will naturally begin to fall in line with those needed to actually become that person.

, Try not to be too hard on yourself when you do struggle. Moving forward is difficult for many people, and you're bound to take a step or two back once in a while. Show yourself a little compassion for your own weaknesses, but reassure yourself that those weaknesses do not define you.


Take comfort in old favorites. When the changes in your life threaten to overwhelm you, turn to familiar comforts to give yourself a rest. Watch a favorite movie, eat a favorite meal, or visit a favorite place., Surrounding yourself with positive people will make it easier to maintain your own positive attitude. Drop as much drama as possible and nurture the relationships that provide you with the most strength.


Be reasonable in your relationships and stop expecting people to act in certain ways. Allow yourself to be pleasantly surprised by positive interactions instead of being disappointed by negative interactions.
Find someone reliable to talk to about your fears and insecurities. Make sure that this person can listen and advise you without letting his or her own issues interfere.
When dealing with others, give without thinking of receiving in return. Sometimes your dedication will be returned in kind; other times, it won't be. Regardless, you will build the skills and attitude needed to maintain meaningful relationships as a result of your own actions.

, One of the easiest ways to build passion is to focus on the things that you already love or have a strong interest in. By doing what you love on a daily basis, you will likely end up loving your everyday life.


Look at your habits and interests and determine if there is any way to profit from them.
Build on your strengths. Everyone is naturally gifted in some area. If you aren't sure where to begin, start from one of your strong points and build from there. It may not be a “love,” per se, but it could develop into one or point you in the right direction.

, Oftentimes, even the things you think you should do are not even necessary. Take the time to sit down and make a list of all the things you “should” do that aren't actually necessary or desirable.


To figure out what you need to stop doing, ask yourself which things are draining your enthusiasm and stopping you from reaching your goals. Of these things, honestly ask yourself which are necessary and which are only done out of a misplaced sense of obligation.
Make sure that the things on your ""stop doing"" list are legitimate problems. For example, you might think that you're unhappy with your marriage when, in actuality, you're unhappy at work and allowing that dissatisfaction to bleed into other areas of your life.

, A big goal can seem daunting, so break it down into smaller parts. Chances are, there is at least one action you can take right now to make your dream a reality. Discover that action and start doing it.


For instance, if you want to start a new business, you can take the first step by starting a blog and various social media accounts for that business. Once you have something tangible to look at, it might be easier to do the research you need to do before pursuing the next tangible step.

, Finding the solution to your own problems can be difficult because it is impossible for you to view things objectively. On the other hand, helping someone solve their own problems can allow you to be an objective observer. You can then take what you've learned by helping others and apply the knowledge to your own circumstances.

, If you struggle with taking your first steps forward while in the midst of your everyday routine, change things up a bit by taking a short trip.


Taking a trip also forces you to think in the present rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.
You can also make this into a practical exercise by going to a seminar, conference, or event related to a new career or interest you want to pursue.

, Another way to change your daily routine and work yourself out of your rut is to simply try something you've never done before. The change does not need to be anything immensely exciting or daring, but it should be something that interests you even though it lies just outside of your usual comfort zone.


For example, sing karaoke somewhere to break yourself out of your shell or take a class on something you've never tried—whether it's kickboxing or cake decorating. Get creative and stretch yourself.

If you wish to reap good quality fruits, sow quality seeds now!.

, If your goal is to climb Mount Everest, you should know where it is located, the altitude, the oxygen supply, mountaineering techniques, best time, weather, and the equipment. Similarly, you should be specific about what you want from life, where and how you can get it, what are the efforts you need to fulfill the needs, and the time and equipment needed. Don't sally forth blindly without goals and signposts or be unequipped.

, It is a well known fact that without venturing and taking risks, not much can be achieved. It is good to take risks, but before taking risks, make an objective assessment of pros and cons, the gains and losses, the investment, the returns, and the time required. Remember, you cannot get the lost time back, you cannot unwind the clock. Time is the one resource of which there is always plenty but which can never be restored once passed.

, It is common for people to follow the path of least resistance. It's a path that almost everyone follows because it's commonplace to follow the crowd and do what others do. Unfortunately, more often than not, the crowd may not know where it is going, and if so, then everyone ends up like everyone else, wondering what has happened to their life many years down the road! The crowd is indulged with such frivolities as reality TV and sitcoms, bestsellers, and the conformity of fads, which encourages competitiveness, and often an extreme focus on fun and exhibitionism with rarely a moment for reflection––while a little indulgence of this sort is entertaining, it rarely shows us the deeper meaning of life and how to find our own sense of direction. Therefore, it is prudent to use discretion even while following good people.

, Remember, you only have one life, and it's no dress rehearsal; it’s only going to happen once. There is no leeway to say “Cut, let’s start it all over again.” Take the time right now to work out a design for your life. If life were a movie, and you were the producer and actor, what role would you want to play and how would the plot unfold? Designing your life is like making a movie. You have to be able to envision the end at the beginning. It may start off a little hazy, but as you continue working on it, it will become clearer and clearer. You’ve got to write the script, put in the characters. Use your imagination; let your creative juices flow. Most of the time, the most creative ideas can lead to the most sensible outcomes, if you let yourself follow them.

, As the producer of your life, you can change, delete, or add in anything you want in your project. But at least by going through this exercise of designing your life, you are in control of your circumstances, rather than allowing yourself to become a victim of them. So do not hesitate to change your path, if the circumstances warrant.

Be honest about what really happened instead of making excuses. Sometimes it's harder to face a situation that was outside your control than when it was something you caused by your own procrastination or bad decisions. Other people find it harder to accept that they may have contributed to the disaster or caused it. A comeback starts with needing one.


Of course, not everything that went wrong in your life may be your fault. Maybe you fell into a drug addiction or acted poorly in a relationship, but it may also be true that you didn't grow up in a supportive environment or were just a victim of plain bad luck. Don't blame yourself for things that weren't in your control, and learn to accept the bouts of bad luck and to work against them, instead of using them as excuses for your present situation.;
, Even if it was just bad luck, there are ways to cushion the loss -- if you wind up in the situation again. If you failed a university exam, what was the problem? Did you get distracted or not study the material? Did you over-study, freeze up at the exam and forget everything due to anxiety? Were there major distractions in your life, like breaking up with a long-term relationship?


Ask yourself these questions without judging the answers. You are not looking for excuses to blame other people; give that up right at the start. That's the last option - it was someone else's fault. If it turns out that it was, then you have to re-evaluate your priorities and that relationship. Did a friend, parent, partner constantly interrupt your studying with demands for attention? How can you learn to hold your boundaries so this doesn't happen next time exams come around?

, Though this may seem like an extreme idea, before you make your comeback plan, it may help to reconsider the direction you want your life to follow. For example, does college matter to a career you might be happier in? Would you be better off with shorter, specific training in an apprenticeship or trade school? If you're a physically active person and could be as happy/fulfilled doing something with visible results: scholarly or office work may not be as good a life choice as construction, electrician work, heating and air, plumbing, automobile tech or forestry.


Change the approach: your comeback does not need to go in the same direction as the trial that failed. Life is trial and success/or error (not failure as such). That means failed trials are only that -- that trial failed, like law-/med-school was not for you. If you went into law school because you were politically passionate, maybe activism, campaign advising or lobbying is a better choice for how to accomplish your long term goals.

, What changes can you make in your life that will reduce the chance of this happening again? If it was a natural disaster, you may purchase emergency supplies and keep them more accessible so that if it does happen again, you have necessities at hand. If it was a job loss or a breakup, sort out what you can do to prevent the same thing happening in your next job or relationship.


Maybe one of the things that went wrong were the people or situations that were weighing you down. Reevaluate your relationships and see if there are any toxic friendships or relationships that are keeping you from being the person you want to be. If that's the case, you may need to cut ties.

, Once you're informed about what went wrong and why, it's time to start mapping out your comeback. The map is not the terrain. Your plans can change as you go along, you'll meet obstacles and also run into unexpected runs of good luck and opportunities no matter what direction you take. If you know what you want and understand more or less how to get it, then it's easier to start making short term goals to get where you're going.


Don't worry if you don't have a perfect 10-step plan for success. It may be something harder to map out like, ""Find my true calling,"" or ""Love myself more."" Just start with a few steps that you know will make the situation better. As you move forward in your comeback, you'll have a better sense of what you really need to do to be successful.
The most important thing is that you take action. Though ""actions speak louder than words"" may sound like a cliché, it's absolutely true. You can say that you're going to make a comeback all you want, but until you take that first step to get there, your words won't mean a thing.

, Talking to someone who was not part of the situation is best. Especially someone who has endured a similar problem. Almost flunking out of school may be salvageable. Talk to older students who made it through the same hurdles you faced and listen to their strategies. If it's a breakup, find out what others think of how you behaved and how your partner did - that may have some surprises. Your friends may have seen your problem coming long before it happened.


Talking it out with someone who cares about you can help you feel like you really can make your comeback, and can give you some great advice along the way.
Talking to others about your plan can also make it more likely that you will achieve it. If you actually tell people that you want to turn your life around, you'll be more likely to do it, because you'll feel accountable to them. That way, you'll feel like you're letting yourself and the people who care about you down if you don't follow through.

, These should follow naturally earlier steps. Make time in your life for these resolutions, perhaps by allocating a few evenings a week to staying in with the books. Sometimes flat decisions and willpower work. Other times you need to rearrange your life to make it easier to keep your resolutions. If you turn off the IM function on your computer while studying, you won't get drawn into long conversations with friends till the study session is over. Your comeback plan can be built from a series of baby steps. You won't be able to turn around in a day, but making small, incremental changes in your life will lead you to success.


One of the best ways to sustain willpower is to give yourself small rewards for any success, however minor. Every time you do study, mark it off on a scoreboard. Tracking success in small steps with small, frequent self-rewards is one of the most effective ways to accomplish anything. Think about how a game is structured - how often you get points for how much effort and time while playing. If you structure your rewards at the pace of your favorite immersive game, it can have the same effect on changing your habits!

, You have real reasons for any bad habits you have. Understanding what needs and desires the bad habits fulfill can be the key to trading them in for good habits. Your favorite video game may be more emotionally rewarding because it provides more treats - points, win screens - than studying. Supplying the scoreboard for studying and pacing the rewards so it's a little easier to get them than it is to get them in the game can help counter that. If you eat too much to comfort yourself and become overweight, think of other things that comfort you and indulge in those instead.


Every bad habit fulfills real needs, so your task is figuring out ways to fulfill those needs without hurting yourself or anyone else, in ways that help you achieve your goals rather than hold you back.

, Parents and good friends are usually a good bet. Remember not to turn to anyone who got you into this situation, though! Give less time and attention to people who hold you back. Getting mad at them is giving them time and attention. It's better to use that anger energy as ""I'll do it. I'll show them"" rather than confronting them. Anytime you achieve something on your list, you can talk to them about how good it feels to take the next step forward.


Of course, there will be setbacks on the way to your comeback. This is only natural. That's why it helps to have people to talk to about your plan, through the good and the bad.

, You can. You are the only one who can create your comeback. You succeeded before, so you have proof that you can succeed. The more honest with yourself you are, the easier it is to choose the best direction. The best direction is the one that will give you joy in the journey, when real passion fuels your effort and the process is so much fun you'd do it even if you weren't working toward a goal.


While you're working toward your goals, remember to enjoy the journey. Don't treat it as a struggle, but as an exciting adventure that will be filled with many ups and downs, which will ultimately take you to where you need to be.

, It's important to stay upbeat and energetic as you move toward your comeback. Though this may seem impossible, especially if you're coming from a really bad place, the more you work on facing every day with a smile on your face instead of feeling beat up or complaining, the more likely you'll be to get what you need. Instead of complaining, talk about the good things in life, the ones you are looking forward to. Though it's okay to vent once in a while, dwelling on the negative aspects of your life will only make it harder for you to overcome them.


Spending time with happy, upbeat people can also help you keep your own attitude positive. If you spend time with someone who only sees the worst in any situation, you are much more likely to feel the same way.

, Of course, it's easy to be down on yourself when you have to rebuild your whole life, but you have to remember the things you love about yourself, not just the ones you need to work on. Though it's important to recognize your flaws and to work on the ones you can work on, it's also important to remember all of the reasons you love yourself, and all of the things that make you awesome. Make a list of all your positive traits and the things you excel in. Work to make that list longer and longer, through your words and deeds.


One way to boost your confidence is to do the things you're good at. Nothing will make you feel better than excelling in something that you've committed to.
Though building up true confidence can take a long time, it never hurts to project confidence even if you're not feeling it. Stand tall, keep your head up high, and look straight ahead of you instead of down at the ground. Keep your hands at your sides, leaving yourself open to possibilities instead of closing yourself off from new interactions. The more you ""fake it,"" the more likely you are to feel it.

, It's important to be accountable for your actions and for the past mistakes that got you to where you are today. Once you own up and recognize the places where you went wrong, you'll be able to move forward more quickly. If you insist on blaming the world for 100% of your problems, then you won't feel like you have the means to go about fixing them. If you're accountable for the negative aspects of your life, then you'll feel accountable when you earn the achievements and the positive goals.

, Though it's important to be accountable, it's equally important to treat yourself with care and forgiveness. Everyone makes mistakes, and you shouldn't think you're a failure or a loser just because you went down the wrong path. Treat yourself with sympathy, kindness, and compassion, and you'll see that it'll be much easier to move forward. If you're down on yourself, it'll be nearly impossible to feel confident and positive, and this will keep you from achieving your goals.


Being self-critical is not the same thing as blaming yourself. Critique is helpful - it's looking at why you do what you do and seeing whether something else would work. It's sorting out the problem. Blaming yourself is just pointless self-torture, you're already in pain but that's not going to motivate you to do something different. Blaming yourself or others leads to a vicious cycle where it can all happen again. If it's happened more than once, really pay attention to that possibility.

, It's important to right old wrongs before you can fully move forward. Think about anyone you might have wronged or hurt during your downward moments. Make an effort to apologize to those people, in person or in writing, and to tell them how sorry you are for what happened. They may not fully forgive you, or they may not believe that you're really going to change until you prove them wrong, but this is a step to making a change for the better.


It'll be harder to move on if the guilt about hurting others is weighing you down. Though it may be hard to make a clean break from your past, apologizing to people you've hurt is a step in the right direction and will keep you feeling strong.

, You may feel like the last thing you are capable of is helping another person when you can barely get your life back in order. But if you feel ready to stand on your own two feet and are in the throes of your comeback, take a moment to slow down and reach out to a person in need. This could be a friend who is having an even harder time than you, a neighbor who is feeling lonely, or even an adult who needs help learning to read at your local library.


Helping others will not only make a difference in their lives, but it will make you see that you do have a lot to offer to the community and the world at large.

, This takes a bit of courage to begin with but the freedom you gain afterwards is tremendous. By facing what you have lost you begin to realize what is truly important in life because you are being truthful with yourself and that is a very powerful thing, you also begin to take much better care of your needs because of it. It also sets you on the right path to gain."

Introduce the two with care.,
Be completely honest with yourself about the friendship.",How to Help Your Spouse Accept Your Friendship With an Ex," Right now, they’re probably feeling extremely threatened by your old flame. Yes, marriage means love and commitment, but it also means bills, responsibility, mortgage payments, late nights with the baby, and a whole host of other unromantic duties. Your ex, on the other hand, is a mysterious could-have-been in your life, and it’s hard to compete with that kind of unfulfilled possibility. Make sure your spouse knows that they’re still the light of your life by bringing romance back into the relationship. Go on dates, have candlelit talks about your dreams late into the night, leave heartfelt notes, and make them feel appreciated.


If your spouse is very insecure, they might misread your romantic gestures as guilt, overcompensation, or a way to cover up an affair. If you think this is a possibility, come right out and tell your spouse that you’re trying to bring the romance back. Say that you want them to know just how special they are to you and that they’re not taken for granted.;
, Highlight such facts as your former flame is happily married, in a committed relationship, or has recently announced that he or she is gay. Sometimes knowing that your ex has moved on too may provide your spouse with more comfort.


If your ex popped back into your life after a breakup, be honest with yourself about the possibility that they want more than your friendship. If this is the case, sit them down and set clear boundaries. If they aren't willing to meet you on these points, pull back.

, Even if you've already discussed it, it’s never a bad idea to re-tackle an unresolved subject, especially if it didn't go very well the last time around. Some people seem to do better having a discussion while they're busy, whereas others would prefer a quiet setting so they can completely concentrate on the information. Here are some suggestions for when to raise the issue:


Make a private pre-arranged date and set aside some quiet time to discuss your intention. Send the kids to bed or to a sleepover and either have a quiet dinner at home or book a table at your favorite restaurant.
Consider raising it late at night in bed. You may want to discuss the matter relaxing in bed after you've tucked the kids in and may be watching TV or reading together. Keep your approach casual and non-confrontational in order to help your spouse feel at ease.
While watching TV or doing yard work (or other household chores.) Some couples like to hash out important topics while working around the house together. Choose a moment when you're in the same room and can discuss the topic undisturbed.

, Some spouses freak out if they think you're trying to place extreme emphasis on becoming friends with a former lover. Know what you're going to say ahead of the chat. Prepare reasons why you’d like to be friends with your ex including both pro’s and con’s. Deliver your message in a logical, emotionless manner so that your spouse doesn't think that you're desperate to connect with your former flame.

, Your spouse may want you to cut off all ties with this person. You may want your spouse to butt out and give you the trust you deserve. Quite frankly, neither option is fair to the marriage. Your spouse doesn't have the right to ban you from seeing someone any more than you have the right to completely disregard their feelings. Reach a fair compromise by allowing your spouse some control over your interactions with your ex. For example, agree to have dinners at home if it means you can do weekly lunches with your ex.


Ask your spouse what you need to do to make them feel safe. A gesture like this can go a long way in easing their anxiety.
If your spouse is completely against a friendship, it's probably best for you to back off – at least until they've had more time to digest the information. You don’t want to jeopardize your relationship with your spouse for a chance to be friends with an ex. If possible, re-address the topic at a later date if your ex is still in your life. Perhaps with time and seeing that he or she can trust you, a friendship with your former lover may still be possible.

, Making sure someone feels heard can go a long, long way in working through a disagreement. You may want to go forward with the relationship no matter what, but you must give your spouse the floor and honestly listen to what he or she has to say. Their response may just change your determination when you weigh up which person matters most.


Validate your spouse's feelings. If your spouse says, “No way, I’m not comfortable at all” don’t interrupt and start delivering your reasons why the new friendship is a good idea. Allow your spouse to fully express his or her feelings before you talk.
Answer any questions with full honesty. If you're asked whether you still have feelings for your ex, be honest. Your spouse needs all the information in order to maintain a relationship based on trust.
Put yourself in your spouse’s shoes. Would you honestly feel fine with him or her meeting with an old flame or would you be jealous? Don’t kid yourself––think of your spouse's oldest flame and consider how you might feel if your spouse wanted to include this person in his or her life again.
Know thy spouse. If your spouse is easygoing, friendly and very happy to welcome all people into his or her life, accepting an ex may be much easier than if your spouse is prone to jealousy, insecurity and has a loathing for his or her own exes.

, If you arrange a get-together between the three of you at a neutral place like a café, it might take the mystery out of your friendship with your ex. (In fact, the two may even get along and become friends.) However, if there’s a chance that your ex will activate a lot of insecurities in your spouse (ex. a respected engineer making six figures who models on the side), you’re probably better off keeping them separate.

, The more certain you are you’re your feelings are platonic, the safer your spouse will feel. What are you and your ex going to gain from staying in touch as friends? Would having your former lover in your life again be a positive or could you fall into old habits like fighting or jealousy? The reason must be a substantial one, not simply because you think it's nice to be friends with exes. It may be business related, work related, church or socially related, but whatever the reason, be sure it's not tinged with regret for ""what could have been"" or involve any faint hope of rekindling something more than friendship. If you feel pressured by your ex, that's not a good reason; on the other hand, if you both parted ways amicably and have continued to stay in touch over the years building a solid, non-romantic friendship since dating, then this is probably a good reason to keep maintaining the relationship even though you've now married someone else. Things to consider include:


You have unresolved feelings. Did you abruptly end your relationship, leaving unresolved feelings or are you still craving his or her company? Tread carefully if you aren't sure about exactly how you feel about your former lover. You absolutely must know if there is still mutual attraction or if you're both solidly platonic now. If you don't know which yet, don't go back to trying to be friends with your ex.
You ended up liking the ex as a friend but not as a boyfriend/girlfriend. Did you break up because the flame was extinguished but you liked him or her as a friend? Perhaps you needed some time to pass before you could become friends and you've found each other again.
You have to deal with seeing the ex on a regular basis. Suppose your children are in the same class or you have taken a job where he or she works. In this case, you may want to consider keeping your relationship at least civil so that you can function together in society.

Decide to love and let be.",How to Deal With Difficult Relatives," As hard as it may be to acknowledge sometimes, you set the boundaries in your relationships. Think of people who don't seem to get pushed around––you'll recognize immediately that such people have clarified their boundaries with you and you know not to cross them. And no matter how much it may bug you when such a person won't budge to your bidding, you'll always have respect for such people. This is something you can initiate too, making clear boundaries in your own mind first, then asserting yourself when someone doesn't take the hint and tries to cross your boundaries. This is how to restore balance and cope around difficult personality types. By seeing things as in your control, you take away the power of the manipulator, the judge, the moaner or the victim to set off your buttons. It is empowering to acknowledge that while you can't change people, you can always change your way of reacting to them.


Recognize that it is all right to satisfy your own needs and to keep your sense of well being intact. A relationship that causes you to feel violated is never healthy and doesn't deserve to be pandered to.
Define boundaries which you consider to be bottom lines that should not be crossed, ones that make you feel violated when they are. For example, if you value your privacy and a relative insists on frequent unannounced drop-in visits, that may be a bottom line for you.
Realize that you're not alone. All around the world people are constantly reassessing their relationships with people who demand and never give. Unfortunately, patterns get set in stone when we give in to demanding people and in many cases, the pattern is handed down through families, with undeserved deference passed on as baggage from relatives who have never learned to set boundaries themselves. You can break the cycle and while it may upset some people, that upset is a result of their recognition that you're calling them out on their manipulative behavior.;
, Things left unsaid usually get interpreted as agreement to the other person's actions and expectations. You do need to speak up and don't worry, it's a skill that everyone can learn. It can be very helpful to use the technique of nonviolent communication, in which you observe the situation, acknowledge your feelings, determine your need (such as a need for space, for not being verbally abused, etc.) and then make a request for the behavior toward you to change or cease.


Expect surprise or feigned ignorance in some cases. Many people have gone for years without verbalizing their pain, discontent or irritation toward another person. The annoyance sits there inside, bubbling away and may result in complaining to the wrong people (think about the times you've moaned to your kids about overbearing Aunt Mary but you've never actually asked Aunt Mary to consider the impact of her comments or actions on you and your family). As such, you may find that the other person won't take you seriously at first, when you begin asserting your boundaries.
In some cases, there may be a ""shock"" reaction (usually feigned) at the mere suggestion that you dare attempt to put restrictions on this behavior. Just let that person have his or her reaction, but stand your ground anyway. It is going to take concerted repetition to show this person you have changed and mean business.

, Try to enforce with kindness and compassion at first––after all, there's a good chance you've allowed this behavior to go on for years, which makes you partly to blame for the fact that your relative has not learned the behavior you want from him or her. But if that fails, and your relative doesn't respond to gentle reminders, here's a no-nonsense approach to enforcing your boundaries:


Let the other person know that for the next 30 days, you intend to strictly enforce the boundaries you’ve described.
Make it clear that if that person violates your boundaries even once during those 30 days, you will then begin a 30-day communications blackout. For 30 days, you simply have no contact with the other person. No drop-in visits (if s/he shows up, you firmly say, ""Sorry, we just aren't ready for visitors right now. Also, we are not having contact with you at this time, remember? That is to help you with our new rules.""), no phone calls, no emails, nothing––unless it’s absolutely mandatory.
After the 30-day fasting period, you can restart the original 30-day boundary-enforcement trial and repeat the process.

, Let the other person know that you’re resorting to this process because s/he's left you no choice; remind him or her that you've made many attempts to clarify how serious you were, but that those attempts were ignored. Say that you want a fresh start, so that a new relationship that you can both enjoy can grow, and that by taking a 30-day break, you hope to make a clean start, both understanding how to respect one another's boundaries.


The first attempt at a 30-day blackout will probably be filled with attempts to contact you. You will rebuff the attempts by not responding to them. Hopefully, the attempts peter out, and you finish the 30 days in peace.
However, if your relative is relentless and will not respect your request for 30 days, then you need to inform him or her that you're going to have to take stronger measures. Reset your calendar to Day 1. From this time forward, if the other person attempts to make contact with you at all during the 30-day blackout, the 30 days resets to Day 1. Be sure your relative understands the rules of this game, don't just do it without letting him or her know what you expect, and what the consequences of violating your request will be.

, If the rules are breached more than a couple of times and you reach the point where you’re pretty clear that the other person has no intention of respecting your boundaries whatsoever, regardless of your attempts to enforce them, then you’re done. The relationship cannot continue in its current form. If the other person can’t even respect your boundaries for 30 days, then what kind of future do you have together? It means that your boundaries will be trampled for as long as you allow the relationship to continue to exist in its current form.


This might sound a bit harsh, but keep in mind that before you reach this point, you’ve already expressed your needs clearly to the other person, and you were trampled. You owe it to yourself to take a step back and see if you really wish to continue this relationship at all. The 30-day blackout period is a time for both of you to re-evaluate the relationship from a distance. It’s also a massive pattern interrupt that lets the other person know with certainty that s/he crossed an uncrossable line, and enough is enough.

, If the other person attempts to use guilt as a tool of manipulation (which is extremely common), it’s fairly easy to overcome. Whenever you perceive the other person attempting to manipulate your emotions by making you feel guilty, bring the whole matter to conscious awareness by asking, “You’re not trying to make me feel guilty, are you?” The other person will probably deny it, but soon the pattern will re-emerge. Keep interrupting the pattern of falling into a state of guilt by bringing attention to the other person’s emotionally manipulative tactics. Simply keep asking questions like, “Why do you feel it necessary to use guilt as a tool of manipulation?” or “You must really find this upsetting if you feel it necessary to try to make me feel guilty to get what you want. Can we try a more mature way of discussing this?” You don’t need to beat the person up about it, but put a stop to the use of guilt as a weapon, once and for all. If you refuse to enter the emotional state of guilt, it will allow you to stay more objective and be more compassionate in seeing that the other person is probably using guilt because he or she suddenly feels powerless. By addressing that powerlessness, you have the opportunity to transform the relationship for good.

, If the person refuses to change his or her way of interacting with you, think deeply about the worth of continuing your relationship with him or her. You might find that you harbor one or more beliefs that perpetuate the problem. If you operate under the belief that all family is forever and that you must remain loyal to all your relatives and spend lots of time with them, those beliefs are your choice, and you’re free to embrace them––or release them. If you find yourself with family relationships that are incompatible with your becoming your highest and best self, then excessive loyalty to your family is likely to be extremely disempowering to you. Think deeply about your own beliefs about family and loyalty, and consider the following:


You would probably never tolerate the same behaviors in a stranger as you would in a family member. To push a family member out of your life might cause you to feel guilty, or could lead to a backlash from other family members. But genuinely ask yourself, “Why do I tolerate this behavior from a family member when, if it were a stranger, I would refuse to tolerate at all?”
Identify the nature of the external conflicts you experience, and then translate them into their internal equivalents. For example, if a family member is too controlling of you, translate that problem into your own internal version: You feel your relationship with this family member is too much out of your control. When you identify the problem as external, your attempted solutions may take the form of trying to control other people, and you’ll naturally meet with strong resistance. But when you identify the problem as internal, it’s much easier to solve. If another person exhibits controlling behavior towards you, you may be unable to change that person's way of interacting toward you. However, if you feel you need more control in your life, then you can actually do something about your responses without needing to control others.
Familial relationships can be complex, and cutting one person out can lead to your losing someone you really do want to have a closer relationship with. Decide which hills are really worth dying on, in other words, if you only have to see this difficult person two or three times a year, consider just letting it roll off your shoulder. Although you want to be the captain of your own destiny, it won't hurt you to just endure this person for a few hours, and the trade-off is worth it if you are keeping your other relatives happy by doing so.

, You can love your relatives without having a particularly close-knit relationship. Maybe your personal values and lifestyle have moved so far from theirs that there isn’t enough basic compatibility to form a strong common bond anymore. Even though this might be the family you grew up with and shared many memories with, your core values are so different now that it just doesn’t feel like a meaningful family relationship anymore. Despite all these differences, you can be on good terms with each other and get along fairly well, but your differences create such a big gap that you have to settle for being relatives without being close friends. That's okay, it happens and you can stand strong and affirm what matters to you through the close relationships you choose to be a part of.

Do not top up money once it's spent!

, This includes places like charity stores and garage sales. They can have a lot of fun finding quality bargains, especially if the whole family goes together.


Hold fashion, toy, and book swap parties with your neighbors and friends. That way, rather than buying new items, you can recycle what you don't need and get back what you want. Even fashion conscious teens can throw a great fashion swap party!

, Think about all the free or cheap things in your area, such as a picnic in the park, window shopping, people watching, taking photographs, making nature trails, going hiking, seeing movies on the cheap night, etc. While some of this takes a little planning, it's definitely worth it in terms of savings and fun!



Find free things to do on weekends.

Have family fun cheap.

Make crafts together.

Have fun at the beach.

Get involved with something that you are take pleasure in.,
Get involved with the activities.,
If happiness turns to deep depression then go see a mental health professional to get treatment if needed.,
Respect boundaries of estrangers and estrangees.,
Do not fuss about small things.,
Do not abuse anyone either verbally or physically, not even a person from whom you are estranged.,
Mind your own business.,
Work on the relationships in your life that value who you are.,
Focus on being the mentally healthiest person that you can personally be.,
Start looking to your own needs.,
Focus on some of the positive points of your kids being absolutely independent.",How to Deal with Being Empty Nested and Estranged," Even if you cannot find anything, think about what you are interested in or your past time then find something anyway. It can be any hobby such as painting, drawing or woodworking. Or join a club: you will be hanging out with people who have some or similar interests too. It will get your mind off your problems.;
, Consider volunteering. If you are not quite ready to go back to work just yet, volunteering in potential workplaces can be a good way to transition back into the workforce at a pace that suits you. It also gives you the chance to try things to see if you like them or not. Or try participating in charities. Doing something positive or fun with your free time can be very fulfilling.

, Some do work, there are multiple choices for treatment.

, Avoid contacting, harassing, bothering your adult children. Avoid intention of seeing them. Do not make your life harder by relying on them and thinking about them.

, Give yourself a good speaking if you become angry over the thing that the other person has done. It is not serious if you really think about it. Try to calm down, count to 20, go for a walk, say the serenity prayer or call a friend.

, If you cannot manage yourself, see a professional/doctor to get help.

, This does not mean you cannot know anything about a person who is lost to you. Although your friends may share news with you and it is understandable that you would be interested in how an estranged loved one is doing, however realize that what they are doing is their own life, especially it is their own decision. For example if they choose to be a prostitute that’s their choice, if they choose to waste time to write a novel, it is their choice. It does not matter if it is fortunate or unfortunate as it seems, that’s their decision. As adults we are born free and all free to lead our individual lives and deal with our problems in our own way.

, Spend time with a friend who cares about you, who is honest and also interested in you. If you do not have anyone like that in your life, get involved in a good project.

, Do the best that you can, be kind to people, gentle with yourself, and get involved with other people in ways that improve the world. Eventually whatever stage of estrangement you are in, the situation will become more bearable. You will find other people to appreciate and who appreciate you. You will gain a different perspective. You must accept the fact that your grown children disowning you is real: they are free and independent, and they will not see you again. The sooner you accept it, the sooner you will be able to get back to a happy side. It all takes time.

, Write down all the things you'd promised yourself you get around to doing one day. Now is the time to start doing them. Pin this list somewhere obvious and start working through it. Build new friendships or revive lapsed ones. Friends are an important part of your transition from parent full-time to person-at-home-without-kids. Meet new people. There will be other empty-nesters like you looking for friendship too. And friends can prove a useful source of information about hobbies, activities, and job openings too. Go back to college or university, if needed, this is a completely new path you're setting out on, or whether it's to upgrade your existing qualifications or getting even better jobs. Either way is good. Restart a career: either pick up where you left off or start a new one. Realize that even though you're ""rusty"", you have the advantage of experience, so after some initial relearning, you'll be off to a much faster start than when you were fresh out of school or college.

, Focusing on some of the positive changes resulting from your children moving out can ease the sense of loss considerably when you weigh up what you've gained. While this does not belittle the importance of your sadness and the big transition you and your children are going through, it does help you to try to see the brighter side of your future. Some of the positive points include:


You may notice that the refrigerator does not need refilling quite as often. This means less trips to the grocery store and less cooking required!
Romance with your spouse may increase. The two of you have time and space now to return to being just a couple; make the most of it. If you used to do all of your children's laundry, there will be a lot less washing and ironing for you to do now. You've got your bathroom back.
Smaller water, phone and electricity bills will help you save money. And that saved money can be put toward a vacation with your spouse or friends!
Feel extremely proud of yourself for having raised children who are capable of going out into the world and surviving and thriving on their own. Give yourself a pat on the back.

Respect the child’s level of comfort with you.,
Treat stepchildren as you would your own children.,
Participate in your stepchild’s education.",How to Deal with a Stepchild1," You want to make a positive impression on any stepchildren in your life, but be patient about doing so. The key to developing a positive relationship with your stepchild is allowing them to set the pace.Know that younger children will come to desire a closer relationship with you, even if they seem to resist you at first.
Focus on taking small, positive steps that let them know you’re interested in them and in their lives.
With older stepchildren or those that you may see less often, ask about their day-to-day lives, but don’t be intrusive.
Keep it simple, with questions like, “Hey ____, what was the best part of your day today?”;
, If you have had children of your own, and especially if everyone is living together, treat any children you’re helping raise as your own.Always emphasize a familial approach to your interactions.
Assign younger stepchildren chores. Asking them to share household responsibilities will indicate that you see them as part of your family.
Don’t single stepchildren of any age out with special treatment, or treat them as though they are a guest, as this may make them feel like you don’t consider them to be a part of your family.
Older stepchildren, or those you see less often, may actively try not to bond with you. Based on their age and the larger context, you may have to accept this, at least at first. Treat your stepchild respectfully nonetheless.

, Participating in school events that involve your stepchild will show them that you care about them. Even if only by attending extracurricular events at first, demonstrate your interest in what they do.Attend parent-teacher conferences. Ideally, you’ll be able to do this with your partner, but if they are unable to attend, don’t hesitate to attend on your own.
With school-age children, offer to review homework. Don’t push if they don’t want you to do so; simply indicate that you are willing to do so.
Older stepchildren may not need – nor want – your involvement in their education. Especially if both of their biological parents are actively involved in a child’s education already, don’t be intrusive if your involvement is not wanted or otherwise unhelpful.

Stay in touch with your stepchildren.,
Ask stepchildren how they’re feeling.,
Maintain a parental role by clearly articulating goals and expectations.,
Share your affection for your stepchild.",How to Deal with a Stepchild2," If you will be playing an active role in helping to raise a child, you need to be in tune with them and what they’re going through. The best way to do this, if you’re struggling to keep in touch via day-to-day interaction, is to have a weekly family meeting with everyone in the household.Staying in tune with one another is not only important, it can offer an opportunity for shared fun and bonding.
Make a habit of having one meal altogether each week, and follow it up with an age appropriate activity, such as bowling or game night.

, Particularly in regards to life at home, ask them if they have opinions - either positive or negative – about how the family is doing.Ask for specific recommendations from your stepchildren about how things might go more smoothly, even before there are any issues or conflicts.
Write out a list of family values, rules, or goals with all of the family members and post it in the kitchen. Keeping a list will facilitate a collaborative method to address any issues, and will be a powerful bonding experience in and of itself.

, Respecting a child’s feelings and beliefs is important, but it also important to provide a child guidance and discipline. Talk to your partner about your parenting approach together. Address the specifics, including chores, punishment, bedtimes, homework, etc.Establish firm agreements with your partner about rules and expectations so you can present a unified, cooperative approach in disciplining and guiding your children together.
Share your expectations about your stepchild’s participation in the family with both your partner and the stepchild.
This can be tricky, because people’s individual morals and values dictate how they see what a family should be.
Take care to specify some basic expectations about chores, responsibilities, and behavior.
Encourage them. Use statements like, “I see you’ve been studying for ______. I expect your hard work will pay off!” and “Thank you for helping setup for dinner tonight.”

, Both in terms of body language and physical affection, make sure all of the visual and tactile messages you send your stepchild are positive and loving.While speaking with your stepchild, indicate that you care about what they’re saying by facing them and listening intently.
Don’t hesitate to rumple some hair or give your stepchild a hug if they are comfortable with it.
Recognize that comfort with even minimal physical affection, such as hugs, may take a while to develop. This is entirely okay.

"
Listen and respond gently to unfair accusations.,
Give older stepchildren space.,
Be clear and direct.,
Communicate with your partner about your parental role.,
Try to establish a workable relationship with your stepchild’s other biological parent as well.,
Encourage stepchildren to have one-on-one time with all of their parents.",How to Deal with a Stepchild3," Communicate respect for your stepchildren by remaining calm and being honest with them, especially about your relationship with their biological parent.Understand that stepchildren may be frustrated that their biological parents are not still together.
Accept that you cannot control what your stepchild thinks. Avoid getting defensive about any unfair accusations – such as blame for splitting up a child’s biological parents.
If they express frustrations with your presence in their life, thank them for their honesty. Say things like. “I’m really glad to you told me that. It means a lot that we’re able to be open and honest with each other.”
Respond by clearly stating that your relationship with one of their parents has nothing to do with the relationship between their biological parents, and that all three of you are adults who make your own decisions.
Follow up by saying something along the lines of: “I’m glad to be a part of your life, and I hope we end up getting along.”

, Relationships between stepparents and stepchildren can be particularly complex, and at times, especially challenging. Don’t complicate this by becoming frustrated or irritated with what you may perceive to be a lack of interest on their part.Model respectful behavior whenever possible. Be respectful even when a stepchild openly disrespects you. Indicating your respect and interest in your stepchildren will encourage them to develop the same for you.
While older stepchildren may have less interest in getting along with you, and may even be vocal about that lack of interest, do not take this personally.
Offer to spend time with an older stepchild if and when they would like to do so, but don’t push it.

, Even if an older stepchild, or a stepchild who is not often at your home, does not initially welcome your presence, you can still clearly state your expectations about their behavior.Rely on “I” statements such as: “I expect all of us to treat each other with love and respect.”
Explain specific reasons why you might see something different than your stepchildren. This is always based on context, but be clear when you put your foot down about why you’re doing so.

, With older children, especially those for whom parenting responsibilities may be split more so between the biological parents than between you and your partner, discuss your role.For instance, clearly establish boundaries regarding who should be disciplining children – and how.
Understand that your role in parenting older stepchildren may be more “hands-off” than you might expect or want.
Avoid conflict and unnecessary tension with older stepchildren by taking care not to overstep agreed upon boundaries.
If you’re struggling to get along with a stepchild who may resist your presence in their lives, ask your partner to speak with the child about it privately.

, If possible, ask a stepchild’s other biological parent for help. This will indicate that you trust them, and that you’re taking your involvement – in whatever capacity – with the child seriously.Be willing and ready to express concerns, and to listen to theirs.
Consider initiating or attending events where everyone will be in attendance. A great option may be an extracurricular event in which the child is involved, such as an athletic match or school play.
If the other biological parent is unwilling to speak with you, do not let this affect how you interact with a stepchild.
Never criticize either of a stepchild’s biological parents in front of the stepchild.

, Never feel threatened by a child’s desire to spend time with their other biological parent. Whatever the context, be supportive of a child’s interest in and love for their other parents.Say things like, “I’m glad you were able to spend time with _____.” This will indicate that parenting is not a competitive endeavor and should not be treated as such, which is a good reminder for everyone.
More importantly, encouraging your stepchild to have positive relationships with all of their parents indicates that you truly care about their happiness, and are glad to take part in their lives in whatever capacity they are comfortable with.

Be willing to set limits and ensure that your way is followed.,
Visualize a calmer home.,
Sit down and write a list of the things that seem to be creating the most noise and sense of rushing in your home.,
Write a task chart.,
Tidy the clutter away.,
Clean as you create.,
Plan meals.,
Ask visitors to respect your limits.,
File it or lose it!,
Set aside calm time.",How to Create a Calmer Household," This is the first and most important thing that you can possibly do. This means limits as to the times, levels of noise and activity and yes, bedtimes. For the parents too, If the kids have to get their parents out of bed for a ride to school that will be a horrible reoccurring situation every morning. That can easily be avoided by going to bed at the same time as your kids, your sleep is important also but don't expect to sleep when your kids need rides to school.;
, What do you see? Write down the things that you visualize and turn them into goals to achieve in creating your calmer household. In your subconscious mind, you will unearth a true picture of the house that you'd like to be in - always keep this focus in your mind and work towards it gradually.

, These are the first things that you will target with your limits. Consider such things as when you are prepared to receive visitors, limiting the noise level of the TV and limiting to computer usage. And put a ban on running indoors for the little ones.


Kids need toys and entertainment but this doesn't mean TV and video games. Play Chess, Mahjong, Backgammon instead of video games. An investment in good traditional games or board games may prove cheaper than running a TV or video games console.

, This task chart must apply to every single member of the household and it must contain days and deadlines. The larger the job that needs tackling, the longer the time frame you must give it in order to maintain a calm approach to it - bit by bit will get it done rather than rushing around juggling too many things at once.

, Clutter enhances the feeling of stress, rushing and inability to think straight. The fewer bits and pieces in your pathway, the calmer you are going to feel. Not to mention the less cleaning up involved. If the kids must keep so many toys, books, and video games, make a deal with them. They can be kept in storage spaces but if they are found strewn across the floor more than 3 times in a row, they will be donated to the nearest charity store. You must mean this and you must be prepared to do it for this ultimatum to have real effect.

, Cooking creates less mess if you can wash items as you use them in between cooking moments. Same for anything that gets used - retrain everyone to put it back where it came from the moment it has been used. Buy storage bins or baskets with labels if this helps to encourage everyone to do the right thing.

, If you are always wondering what to make for dinner, spend half an hour a week (Sunday evening is often a good time) to write out a plan of meals. It doesn't have to be incredibly specific or you will dull down the cooking process and spontaneity, but at least write ""pasta - Mon"", ""steak - Tues"", ""pizza - Wed"", ""sushi - Thurs"", ""take-out - Fri"". That way you have an idea of the main meal and can decide on the flavors and style on the night, with the main ingredients at hand.

, Inform visiting family, friends, kids, dogs, and any other guests who regularly traipse in and out of your home that closing time is whatever you set it as. In addition, feel free to set out of bounds hours, such as family lunch times on Sundays. This will enable you and your family to connect together over a special meal or activity without outside interruptions. This also includes taking the phone off the hook and closing e-mail applications.

, As soon as it arrives in the post, the schoolbag or the briefcase, deal with it. Open envelopes and toss them into the recycling immediately. Read the letter, bill, or note and file it. Make bill-paying time once a week and sit down with the file and deal with it in a matter-of-fact way, one by one. If you get school notes, decide when to sit down with your child to discuss these matters, then sign them away and put back in the schoolbag, and if money is asked for, write the check there and then and put it into the schoolbag. These actions will take several minutes, but spending more time on school and child matters is more important.

, At least once a week, and preferably once a day, set aside calm time for yourself in which you do nothing more than relax and shut out all that is around you. Eventually encourage other family members to join you in this. Select a special corner or room in the house and set it up just for this purpose, with soft pillows and drapes and call it something neat like ""Mom's Relaxation Corner"" or ""Family Downtime Zone"". Familiarize everyone in the house with this space as only ever being for relaxation by any member of the family at any time of the day or night. It must be away from TVs, music or other sources of noise and disruption. Peace is a virtue and can be hard to acquire in our busy lives. However, there are many simple ways that we have overlooked and should try to encourage in our day to day lives.-

, Make sure they are age appropriate, though (ex. A three year old shouldn't be washing dishes, or doing as much work as a 13 year old).

, If you want, you can have chores rotate every week/month.

, If they want, they (or you) can draw some cool pictures on the chart.

, If you want, you can put some kind of fun sticker in the boxes instead of a normal check-mark.

",How to Create a Room Cleaning Checklist and Reward System for Kids2,", For example, if they are old enough to be getting an allowance, you can give that to them. If they are younger, every week/month you can:


Give them a small toy if all chores are completed in time.






Set up a ""Treasure Chest"" where they can get items such.






Give them candy.






Give them a trip to a favorite store (Eg. ice cream shop)






Give them a small amount of money

Depending on your individual circumstances, you may decide on joint custody, or you may decide that it is best for the child to live primarily with one parent.If you have a baby, try to arrange the schedule so that both parents have the opportunity to participate in the day-to-day care of the baby, as this is important for bonding.
If your child is older, the school schedule may influence your visitation schedule.
In addition to establishing a regular schedule, talk about what will happen if one parent decides to move.;
, You may want to make some special adjustments to your visitation schedule to accommodate for holidays and vacations. For example, if Father's Day falls on a day when the child would normally be with the mother, you may want to make a special exception for that day.If you live close to each other, you may be able to split holidays with your child's other parent. For example, you may have the child for Christmas morning and your co-parent may have the child for Christmas evening.
Be sure to consider vacation plans as well. For example, if you plan on taking a two-week vacation with your child over the summer, decide if your co-parent will be allowed to do the same. Be sure to coordinate vacations with your co-parent to avoid scheduling conflicts.
You may also want to plan for birthday parties. Decide if you will have separate parties or if you will have one party to which both sides of the family will be invited., In addition to holidays and vacations, there may be other things that pop up that will necessitate an adjustment to the visitation schedule. While it's impossible to plan for everything, having a basic idea of how you will handle special circumstances will help you avoid conflicts with your co-parent when they do come up.Think about how you will adjust the schedule if the child is sick during a visitation time.
Decide how you will deal with it if something unexpected disrupts the schedule, like a funeral or a last-minute invitation to a birthday party.
If the child is not able to be with one parent during a normal visit day, decide if you will make this day up or just continue with the regular schedule. You may choose to have the child spend an extra day with that parent during the next visit, for example.

, If there are certain members of the family who you do not trust to be around your child, it is important to outline these restrictions in the parenting plan. Talk through your concerns and decide if it is okay for the person to be around your child, as long as they are not alone.You may also want to establish general guidelines for the type of person who is allowed to babysit your child. For example, you and your co-parent may agree that all babysitters must be at least 16 years old and must be certified in CPR.

, If your child spends time with both you and your co-parent, you will need to establish a procedure for exchanging the child. The right arrangement for you will depend on the kind of relationship you have with your co-parent and how close you live to each other.If you and your co-parent have a good relationship, you could simply drop the child off at each other's houses.
If you do not want your co-parent coming to your house, you could meet in a neutral location.
You could also arrange your schedule so that one parent drops the child off at school and the other picks the child up from school.

, Extracurricular activities often involve a big time commitment, so it's important to talk to your co-parent about what activities your child will participate in. Figure out if you will discuss each activity before committing to it or if one parent will be permitted to sign the child up for an activity without the approval of the other.In addition to time considerations, you should also consider that your co-parent may not agree with the activity or may think it is too expensive. Having a plan for dealing with these kinds of situations ahead of time will make the decisions much easier.
Make sure to think about transportation to and from activities, especially if they are far away. It's important to agree on this before committing your child to any activities that may take place during your co-parent's visitation time.

, Whether your child plays soccer or performs in the school play, you will eventually be faced with an event that you may both want to attend. Come up with an agreement regarding who will attend which events with your child.You may decide to attend alternating events, especially if they are frequent.
If you agree to both attend, decide if there will be any rules. Will you interact with each other or will you sit separately and not speak to each other?

, Lots of things will come up while your child is with you that your co-parent will want to know about, and vice-versa. This includes things like the schedule for soccer games, punishments you have established, or issues that your child has been having at school. It's important to have a plan for how and when you will communicate this type of information. Decide on your preferred method of communication. If you don't like talking to your co-parent in person or on the phone, you may decide to communicate by email.
Also decide what information needs to be shared. You co-parent may want to know about it every time your child has a cold, or the two of you may decide that this is not necessary.

, Walk through your child's everyday routine with the other parent and try to agree on a schedule that you both can follow. Consistency is very important for young children, so having the same routine in both households will make things much easier.For babies, it's important that sleeping and feeding schedules remain consistent.
For older children, it's important that homework and playtime routines remain consistent.

, It's important to lay out clear rules for how and when each parent will communicate with the child during the other parent's visit time. Try to come to an agreement that allows the child to stay in contact with both parents regularly, but which will not cause conflicts between the parents.You may choose to establish rules regarding the hours during which the other parent can call the child. You may also want to both agree to allow the child privacy when talking to the other parent.
Your rules may change depending on your schedule. For example, if the child is staying with one parent for the entire summer, the other parent may want to phone frequently. If the child is only with the other parent for a few hours, frequent phone calls may not be appropriate.
In addition, you and your co-parent must decide how much information about the parenting plan you will share with your child. The right choice for you will depend on your child's age and maturity level. For example, if you have a teenage son who you think would appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the plan, you may want to allow him to help you make some of your decisions. You may decide that certain aspects of the parenting plan, like the financial clauses, are not appropriate to share.

, Child support is probably the most hotly contested aspect of a parenting plan. Most often, the non-custodial parent pays a fixed amount of money to the other parent each month to help cover the child's expenses. The amount will depend on each parent's income and the custody arrangement. If possible, try to agree on a child support arrangement that works for both you and your co-parent.If you are not able to come to an agreement about child support, you can go to family court and have a judge mandate child support.
Keep in mind that child support may need to change if other elements of the parenting plan change. You may have to go to court to get these changes made.

, In most cases, child support is only mandated for minors. However, you and your co-parent may decide that it is appropriate to financially support your child for longer. If this is the case, you will need to incorporate the details of your financial support into your parenting plan.You may want to establish an age at which you will no longer financially support your child, or you may want to use some other factor to determine financial support. For example, you and your co-parent may decide that your financial support will end when your child graduates from college.

, If it is not already outlined in your child support agreement, discuss with your co-parent who will be responsible for everyday expenses. For example, if your child is going to a birthday party and needs to buy a gift, who will pay for it?


You may also want to come up with guidelines for how much it is appropriate to spend on certain items.

, In addition to everyday expenses, you and your co-parent will need a plan for larger expenses associated with your child. This may include things like medical bills or the fees associated with a school trip abroad.You may want to make a provision that would require that large (non-emergency) expenses be agreed upon before they are incurred. This would prevent your co-parent from making a costly purchase for your child that you do not agree with and then expecting you to pay for half of it.

, Decide with your co-parent whether you will keep individual items for your child at each of your homes or if you will allow your child to bring items back and forth. This may be applicable to anything from a video game system to basic items like clothing and shoes., If there are certain lifestyle choices that you have made for your child, it is important to discuss these with your co-parent and come to an agreement that you are both happy with. For example, you may want to ensure that your child eats a healthy diet while staying with your co-parent.You may also make certain provisions regarding the co-parent's lifestyle choices. For example, you may request that your co-parent not smoke around your child., It's very important that you and your co-parent be consistent with your expectations and disciplinary methods. Have a detailed conversation about what you expect of your child and how you will deal with it if your child fails to meet those expectations.If your child has a curfew, be sure that it is the same at both households. Also discuss under what circumstances your child is allowed to go out without parental supervision (if any).
Discuss other rules as well, including those regarding phone, internet, and television usage.
Decide what the consequences will be if your child violates the rules of the household, and implement them consistently.
If your child has chores, talk to your co-parent about implementing the same or similar chores in the other household.

, If you and the other parent have different religions and heritages, decide if you want to teach your child both. Make a decision that you can both agree on.If you have different religions, you may decide to educate the child about both.
If one parent practices their religion more than the other, you may decide to teach your child only about that one religion.

, Whether you agree to public schooling, private schooling, or homeschooling, determine which type of schooling you want for your child. If you have not chosen a school yet, you may want to discuss with your co-parent how you will go about making this decision when the time comes.


Note also how you will be dealing with parent teacher conferences. You can take turns attending, or both parents can attend together. Another option would be to make arrangements with the teacher to attend all the conferences separately.
Make a note in your parenting strategy regarding receiving information and school grades from the school. Again, you can arrange for one person to receive everything and make copies for the other, or you can ask the school to send you both the same information.
Decide who will be attending school events. You can choose to take turns or have one person attend all the events. Make a decision that you are both happy with.
Also consider how you will pay for your child's college education when the time comes. You may want to establish guidelines regarding how much each parent is willing to contribute., Talk with your co-parent about your child's medical care, including how you will select doctors, who will attend appointments, and what the protocol should be in the case of emergencies.If both you and the other parent work, you may decide to take turns taking your child to medical appointments. The other option is to establish responsibility depending on who has custody of the child at the time.
These decisions are especially important if your child has special medical needs. It's very important that both parents be on the same page when it comes to care and treatment.

, It is inevitable that other things will come up that are not included in your parenting plan. For this reason, it's a good idea to have a general understanding of how you and your co-parent will go about making future decisions. For example, you might agree that you will not make any major decisions without consulting the other parent, and that you will discuss the issues in person.

, In some cases, co-parents are perfectly capable of agreeing on a parenting plan without any help. However, this does not work for everyone. If you can't come to an agreement with your co-parent about one or more issues, you may need to go to family court to resolve the issue. The judge will make a decision and issue an order that will enforce the parenting plan.In some jurisdictions, you may be required to file a parenting plan with the courts if you plan on sharing custody of a minor child. Check with your local family court to find out if this applies to you., Writing a parenting plan is no small task. It will require a significant time commitment from both you and your co-partner. Try to coordinate a time when the two of you can sit down and discuss all aspects of child rearing. Write everything down, including the smallest details. This will help prevent confusion later on.


Make sure each of you has a copy of the parenting plan.

, Signing the parenting plan demonstrates that you are both committing to adhering to the agreement that you came up with. Even if you are not filing the document with the courts, it's still a good idea to have both parties sign it.


If you are required to file your parenting plan with the courts, you will need to both sign the document in front of a notary public., As children age, plans will need to adapt to their needs. When developing a parenting plan, it's important to keep in mind that just because a certain arrangement works now, does not mean it will work forever. Be flexible and willing to talk about changing the plan whenever it seems necessary.You may want to create a schedule for reviewing and revising the plan with your child's other parent, but it's still a good idea to be open to discussing it whenever the need arises.

Recognize a backhanded compliment.,
Determine if you think the compliment is sincere or not.,
Evaluate compliments from family members.",How to Deal with Backhanded Compliments About Your Parenting1," Backhanded compliments are intentionally worded in a way to confuse the inattentive listener. The person delivering a backhanded compliment will open with a statement that seems positive or generous, and then twist its meaning or add phrase at the end that effectively changes the statement into an insult.For example:

If someone says, “I love what your child is wearing today; it’s as if she dresses herself!” they may be saying that your child’s clothes are mismatched or poorly selected.;
, Before taking offense, consider the person’s compliment: it may have been genuine, and you don’t want to react poorly in this case. Everyone has a different sense of humor, and some people may come across as sarcastic while being sincere.For example, if someone tells you, “You made some interesting choices when choosing your children’s names,” you could hear the statement as a backhanded, sarcastic compliment that’s criticizing the names. However, the compliment could have been intended as a sincere and well-meaning statement.If you have a relationship with the person in question—for example, a family member, friend, or work colleague—you may be better able to gauge their level of sincerity.
This will be more challenging with a stranger, whose opinions and sense of humor you’ll likely be unfamiliar with.

, Family members are likely the people who are closest to you and have known you the longest; as such, it may be easier to evaluate their compliments since you’ll be familiar with the individual tastes and senses of humor. Family members—especially ones near your age, such as siblings and cousins—may also be more inclined to tease you good-naturedly, meaning that backhanded compliments may be meant only as an affectionate jest.

For example, a close family member commenting “You look well rested, for being a new parent,” could be a harmless joke.That said, if you’re offended by this type of comment, politely let the family member know that you don’t appreciate that type of humor.

"
"
Keep your sense of humor about you.,
Take the high road and say “thank you”.,
Affirm the positive part of the compliment.,
Ask for a clarification.,
Respond with a polite affirmation of your own parenting.",How to Deal with Backhanded Compliments About Your Parenting2," Avoid taking the potentially backhanded compliment too seriously. In many cases, you can give the individual the benefit of the doubt and respond with a joke (whether genuine or sarcastic). It may even be possible to diffuse the situation with a humorous response to the compliment, whether or not it was intended to be backhanded.For example, if someone tells you, “I love how much energy your children have,” joke with them by saying, “I bet we all wish we were that energetic too!”, In most cases, it won’t be worth your time to respond to a backhanded compliment. It may be given intentionally to get under your skin or irritate you, and you’ll be better off not letting this happen. Rather than resorting to an insult or becoming offended, simply say a polite “thank you” to diffuse the situation, and then move on with your day.Moving on from the backhanded compliment will also deny the individual the opportunity to explain or defend their rudeness, which could lead to further frustration or anger on both sides., In order to diffuse the situation and show the individual that their backhanded or passive-aggressive method of communication is ineffective, you can respond to the (ostensibly) polite portion of the compliment while disregarding the insulting aspect. For example, if someone tells you “You look terrific! I’m sure you’ll lose the baby weight soon,” respond by saying, “I think I look good today too; thanks for noticing.”, If you have received more than one backhanded compliment from this individual, or if you suspect that they may be joking, ask them to clarify the meaning behind the compliment. Do this politely, without indicating that you’re angry or frustrated. Be careful to not let this question develop into a full-blown argument, especially if you’re in public or your children are currently with you.

For example, if someone says, “I love how much you let your kids speak their own mind,” respond by asking, “I’m not clear what you mean; are you implying that I should encourage my kids from expressing themselves?”, You can do this by taking on the hurtful meaning of the backhanded compliment directly. This will communicate to the individual giving the compliment that you have understood its intended meaning and will not let their rude behavior continue. Especially if the personal “complimenting” you is a friend or relative, you may wish to address the issue head-on to prevent the relationship from deteriorating.For example, if a visitor to your home says, “It’s a good thing that you don’t care how tidy the house is,”respond by saying something like, “It’s more important that I spend my time raising my children than vacuuming.”

"
"
Identify insecurity or jealousy on the part of the speaker.,
Weigh the merits of the compliment.,
Assess your parenting techniques.",How to Deal with Backhanded Compliments About Your Parenting3," Often individuals who give backhanded compliments are speaking out of jealousy, and their unkind words may reflect a deep-seated insecurity on their part rather than any genuine anger with you. If you believe that insecurity is motivating the “compliment,” it’s best to ignore it and move on. Be polite and don’t intentionally embarrass the insecure individual.For example, if someone tells you, “It must be so demanding to juggle a career and a baby, but you’re doing it well,” perhaps they’re frustrated by their own employment or family status.

, At times backhanded compliments can present valid critiques, although packaged in a rude and insincere format. The compliment may contain more merit if it was given by someone who knows you well and may have genuine insight into your family life. If it was given by a relative stranger, the statement likely has little validity or merit.You may decide to ask the compliment-giver directly: “Am I or my child doing something that’s upsetting you or that you feel needs to be criticized?”
If you feel that a backhanded compliment is not based on any genuine shortcoming of yours or your children’s you can disregard it entirely.

, Despite the rude method of delivery, you may need to consider if the deliverer of the backhanded compliment presented an appropriate critique of your parenting. No parent is perfect, and good parenting advice can come from a variety of sources. While it’s inconsiderate to give tacit insults to parents, an emotionally mature parent may be able to learn productive skills from a backhanded compliment.

For example, if someone says, “You have bold children; they certainly aren’t afraid to go out and take what they want,” it might be time to have a conversation with your kids about sharing possessions and asking politely when they would like something.
That said, don’t rush to incorporate every bit of “advice” you receive. Give yourself time to weigh all advice, and take backhanded compliments with a large grain of salt.

Acknowledge your child’s frustration.,
Recommend a break.,
Make yourself available once everyone has calmed down.,
Try to identify the source of frustration.,
Don’t demand perfection.",How to Deal with Homework Frustration As a Parent1," At one point or another, every child becomes frustrated with their homework. At times, they may explode with anger, or become extremely sad or anxious. Keep in mind that your child needs your support, as their behavior likely reflects a feeling of helplessness that they are unable to fully process.Instead of becoming frustrated yourself, try talking to your child calmly. Start with a brief, sympathetic statement.
For instance, say “I’m sorry your homework is stressful today,” or “I know it can be frustrating when an assignment is hard to understand.”;
, While you will want to revisit a frustrating homework assignment, you and your child will be able to communicate better when you’re both calm. Especially in cases where a child loses their temper or becomes visibly upset, say something like, “Lindsay, how about you take a break from that for a few minutes. We can look at it together when you’re ready to give it another try.”, You may find yourself getting worked up when your child becomes frustrated. If you feel yourself start to become agitated, don’t try to start a conversation, as the situation will likely escalate. To help you both calm down, ask them if they’ll take a few deep breaths with you.Direct them to breathe in through their nose deeply and slowly for five seconds, and then release slowly through their mouth.
If you do lose your temper and shout at your child, apologize to them and remind yourself they need your help.
Once everyone is relaxed again, say something like, “Alright let’s have a look at this homework together.”

, After working through a challenging homework assignment, it may be worth talking about how or why, specifically, your child got frustrated. This is especially worthwhile if your child gets frustrated frequently. For instance, ask them something like, ""That wasn't so bad after all, was it? Why did it frustrate you earlier?""Listen to your child's response and respond with a way they can handle a similar situation differently in the future.
For instance, if they say, ""I got mad because it was too hard,"" point out that they were able to complete the assignment, and had just gotten stuck on one problem. Then say, ""Next time, you know you can always ask me or your teacher about parts of your assignment that don't make sense, right?""

, Children make mistakes as they learn and grow. Keeping this in mind, avoid stepping in to help complete your child’s homework unless they ask you to do so. In fact, learning often depends upon making mistakes.Furthermore, anticipate and accept the fact that you will likely have a verbal battle about homework at one point or another.
If you find yourself getting frustrated when your child struggles with homework, take a moment afterwards to reflect. In particular, remind yourself that growing up involves plenty of challenges for children, and that your patient support will help them immeasurably.

Keep a positive attitude despite your anxiety and sadness.,
Allow your child to play independently before he goes to school for the first time.,
Prepare your child for what to expect at school.,
Fill the void in your schedule with something positive.,
Talk to your child about the physical changes she is going to go through.,
Prepare for the emotional ups and downs of this stage in your child’s life.,
Show your child that you love and support her.,
Accept new relationships but establish boundaries.,
Realize that your child will not need you as much, or at least in the same ways.,
Address your own stress.,
Understand the concept of “empty nest syndrome”.,
Make the effort to spend time together.,
Learn to let go.,
Get moving and get doing.",How to Cope with Your Child Growing Up," A positive attitude towards your child's growing up is essential. Think about what your child has learned and be proud of it, just as you were proud when he learned to walk independently or sleep alone.In the same way, try to appreciate your child's growing abilities, such as going to school alone, finishing his homework without your help and making his own decisions.
Instead of mourning because your child is growing up, be proud of him and be proud of yourself, because you, with your support and love, have helped your baby grow into the child he is.;
, The desire to hover over your child to guide and protect him is strong and hard to control.Often, the first independent step and challenge for parents and children is to let them play alone in the yard.


Talk with your child and let him know what is allowed and what is not.
Allow him to play but watch and be ready to react.
When you see that your child respects the agreement and behaves the way you expect, you can gradually relax and take a step back.

, Help ready him for the daily routines, the expectations, and the fun and fears that are part of going to school. At the same time, you will be preparing yourself to let him go.Ask him about his doubts and fears and find common solutions to them. This will remind you that your child still needs you, but in a different way.
Talk with your child and explain what to expect in kindergarten or school.
Practice going to school by getting up early, packing a lunch and driving your child to the school. Show him where his classroom will be. This will help both of you to feel emotionally prepared when the day finally comes.

, Although you will surely still be plenty busy, you may feel like there is a void in your daily schedule with your child at school. Filling that gap with something gratifying for you will ease the transition and benefit you and your child in the long run.Even if you haven't actually gained any new time by your child heading off to school, now can be a good time to take up a new hobby. This time feels like a new phase in your life because it is, and it is therefore a great time to improve yourself, expand your horizons, or try something you've always wanted to do.
You will likely have ample opportunities to volunteer and otherwise be involved with your child's school. This can provide a positive outlet and establish a new bond with your child. However, be wary of using such opportunities to continue ""hovering"" over your child. Even at this tender age, you have to begin letting go bit by bit.

, Your child is growing up, which becomes evident when you start noticing the physical changes in her body. Use your experience and compassion to help reassure and guide your child into this transition.The well-known physical changes that occur at this time are caused by the hormonal changes occurring in the body. The various endocrine glands produce hormones which bring about changes in the body.
These hormonal/physical changes are also accompanied by emotional and mental changes.
Be open to answering questions when the physical changes begin. Actually, it is best to begin discussing the physical changes before adolescence sets in. Tell her that these changes are normal and are a part of growing up. Be open and honest and answer all questions directly, despite any natural (and mutual) discomfort.While many schools conduct special sessions or classes when the children reach adolescence, don't rely on these alone. Combining school-learning on body changes with your own perspective will better prepare your child and encourage her to confide in and interact with you as the changes occur.

, The hormonal changes your child is going through directly affect the brain. Therefore her interests, wants, and needs will start changing. You can almost guarantee increased moodiness and irritability during this phase.She may want to be independent refuse to even talk to you about her day. The next day, she may demand all your attention and insist that you listen to her right now. Just listen. She will let you know if she needs your opinion or advice.
Know that your child loves you, even if she acts like a moody brat. These mood swings are due to the sudden and fluctuating hormonal levels in her body. But remember that just because your child is liable to bite your head off at the slightest provocation, this does not mean that she doesn't love you!

, If your child wants to try something new, give her your support. When she succeeds and when she fails, give her your support. In this way, emphasize your ongoing role as a parent and take part in her growing process.Her emotional mood swings may wreak havoc on your nerves, but remember that your child is also being affected by it. She is trying to develop her individual personality while coping with these changes, and needs all your support at this time.
No matter what the issue is, express yourself clearly to your child. Tell her that you love her and that you will always be there to support her. This will give her the anchor that she will look for during a crisis.
Always remember also that a child’s brain is not fully developed until she is in her early 20’s. This incomplete brain development can cause the emotional immaturity which so often frustrates parents.

, When children observe the changes in their bodies, they start experiencing a new and unfamiliar set of social experiences. This may manifest itself through new friendships and the emergence of romantic interests.


Keep the lines of communication open. When you’re accepting of your child’s choices and friends, she’ll be less likely to shy away from you and more likely to open up about what’s going on in her life.
Get ready for your child to start hanging out with new groups of kids. Teens tend to feel secure when they belong to a group. They may have a strong urge to become a part of a group of friends because they have not yet developed their own unique identity.
Make the effort to stay connected and spend time together. Try to have dinner together and chat. You want to be a friend.
However, you will also need to set limits, as children of this age tend to engage in risky behavior. Set clear borders between bad and good behavior, and healthy and unhealthy relationships., This is the time when your child will begin to show an increasing desire to be independent. She will, for instance, likely be spending more time with her friends than with you.Give your child space, but be there when she needs you. Give her space to breathe and to solve her own problems. If you are overprotective towards her and solving all her problems for her, she will be less capable of dealing with life's important issues.This is a good time to talk about money issues as well. Her weekly allowance probably no longer covers her desire to go out with friends to movies and meals. Discuss your household budget in a mature manner, and perhaps even help her find ways to make a little cash on the side. Earning her own money will build self-esteem and independence.

, Raising a child of any age is a stressful endeavor, but raising a teen may take the cake. While working to help her deal with her stress about the changes and challenges facing her, don't forget about working to manage your own stress as well. If you don't take care of yourself, you won't be able to take care of her.

Make a point to focus on getting sufficient sleep, eating properly, exercising regularly, finding time to relax, seeking out enjoyable activities, and embracing the support of a spouse, sibling, friend, etc. in addressing the stress you feel.
Your child is watching you and learning from your example, even when she is a new teenager who seems intent on denying your very existence. Show her that taking care of one's mind and body is essential.

, You may think that you will be excited to have all the additional free time (and house space) that comes with your child moving out, only to find that you instead feel sad and adrift. Letting go, and adjusting afterward, are difficult to do, even when you know your child is ready.Acknowledge to yourself first that your child no longer needs your help on a day-to-day basis anymore. She may not prefer your company as much and you will not be privy to all the nuances of her life. This is normal and it’s normal to feel upset.
As a mature parent, understand the changes that are taking place in your adult child’s life. Know that your child loves you and does not mean to be spiteful.
It is normal to experience a feeling of loss at this time, even if you are lucky enough to still see you child regularly. Don't ignore or deny these feelings; accept them as a natural part of the parenting process. You have dedicated your life to protecting and nurturing this child, so it will inevitably be difficult to let her out of your grasp.

, When your child becomes an independent adult, it does not mean that she is gone from your life forever. Indeed, in some ways she may need you now more than ever. Make the most of the time you spend together, whether they are important dates or casual moments.Today's technology allows you to be in constant contact with your child, either on the phone or over the internet. Be in touch and stay a part of her life as an adult. However, don't overdo it (by calling every day, for instance), or you may alienate your child. Remember that she is in the midst of trying to figure out how to navigate life as an independent adult.
Make yourself available when she wants to talk or meet. Don't miss out on these opportunities, because you never know how often they will come again as your adult child's life gets ever busier.

, Do not cling to your adult child, trying to protect her from every harm. Give her the freedom to create her own mistakes and successes. We all learn best from our own experiences and our own mistakes.


Do not always jump to the rescue. Provide advice when requested, but more often simply offer sympathy and understanding. You do your adult child no favors by trying to solve all life's problems for her.Sometimes your very sound advice will be ignored, and you simply have to accept it as part of your child's process of living and learning.
Support your child’s career path, even if you hoped she would pursue a different career. Don't try to fulfill your dreams through your child. When a career is pursued with passion, the child becomes more confident about herself.

, Do things you weren't able to do when your child was at home. Parenting is serious business that requires giving your child all of your attention and having little time for yourself. Deal with the fact that your child has grown up by spending more time focusing on yourself.Find a hobby or do something you never had the time for when you had a child at home. Or, dedicate yourself to exercising and overall health, or devote greater attention to your career (especially if this brings you joy).
Plan time to hang out with your friends. In this way, you can compensate for a sense of loneliness through discussion and exchange of experiences.
Do things that you love to do. You will always be a parent, but never forget that you are a unique individual too. Remember all the dreams and ambitions that you had before your child was born? This is the time for you to start thinking and planning about it.
When you make a conscious effort to move ahead with your life after your child has grown up, you will not be at such a loss when she leaves home. ""Empty nest syndrome"" is difficult and painful to deal with, but it becomes easier if you have a little foresight and independent purpose in your life.

Ask your child if they understand the assignment.,
Correct rude or panicked speaking.,
Have someone else help them.,
Talk to your child’s teacher.",How to Deal with Homework Frustration As a Parent2," If you sense your child is starting to become frustrated, ask them to describe the assignment to you. More specifically, look for evidence that they know what they are supposed to do before trying to help. In fact, they may be frustrated because they don’t know what they’re supposed to do, as opposed to an inability to complete specific tasks.If they are not clearly able to explain the assignment, look it over yourself and see if it makes sense to you.
If you are able to understand the assignment, help them get started - but only enough to ensure they understand what they need to do. Then allow them to finish the assignment themselves.

, Talking about homework together provides a perfect opportunity to help your child learn to calmly express their opinions, and to listen to the advice of others. In particular, guide them to frame negative statements more politely and patiently.For instance, correct your child when they something like, “You’re wrong!” by saying, “It’s okay to think that I’m wrong, but try saying it differently.”
Offer them examples too, such as “Mom, I don’t think that’s how I’m supposed to do it.”

, If your child continues to get frustrated and/or you find yourself unable to help or stay calm yourself, find someone else who may be able to help instead. Sometimes, your child may feel pressure to impress you, or may otherwise worry more about their homework more when working with you.For instance, maybe a grandparent can help more peacefully.
Alternatively, consider searching for an older student to help tutor your child after school. Your child’s school may be able to help facilitate this arrangement.

, If your child consistently becomes frustrated by their homework assignments, do not hesitate to speak with their teacher about it. You may learn that your child is having trouble on their schoolwork in general, or discover that they excel in class and are simply worrying too much about their homework and placing too much pressure on themselves.If you think the homework your child is bringing home may be too challenging for them or for students their age, don't hesitate to mention this to their teacher.
If your child's teacher is not receptive to your input or does not provide adequate responses to your questions, speak with an administrator at the school about any unresolved concerns you have.

Establish a homework plan together.,
Encourage younger children to work in a communal area.,
Allow older children to work where they prefer to do so.,
Give plenty of praise.,
Avoid threatening language.",How to Deal with Homework Frustration As a Parent3," The most important aspect of a homework ""plan"" is consistency. Set aside a block of time for your child to work on homework every day. It doesn’t have to be a substantial amount of time. In fact, allow them to weigh in on when they'd prefer to do their homework, and how long they think will be enough to complete their assignments.A half an hour will often be more than enough for grade school children, while an hour may be better for middle and high school aged kids.
Early evening is usually ideal. Avoid asking your child to do their homework right after school.

, For instance, young children will likely be the most comfortable doing homework in the kitchen or dining room with you nearby. Ideally, you can use the time to work on something yourself.Avoid watching television or messing around on your phone while your child is working. Not only are these potentially distracting, they may also seem unfair to your child.

, Teens may prefer to work in the privacy of their room. As long as the room is free of electronic distractions, including their phone, allow them to do so. Homework time is actually a great way to start granting the independence that older children will start to desire. Do check in from time to time to make sure they’re working on homework for an agreed upon time., Positive encouragement can be extremely helpful, especially if your child gets stressed about their homework from time to time. In particular, make sure to acknowledge and compliment improvements. Meanwhile, avoid pointing out every mistake a child makes.Favor language that praises their effort, as opposed to their ability. For instance, say things like, “I can see you’re working very hard on you home work. Good job!”

, It may be tempting to try to motivate children to work on homework by saying things like, “If you don’t finish your homework, you won’t be able to play with your Legos tonight.” However, threatening language like this risks angering or stressing your child. Instead, say things like, “When you’re finished with your homework, we can all go sledding!”"

Develop a routine that includes each other.,
Spend time with your children one-on-one.,
Create family traditions.,
Travel with your children whenever possible.",How to Create a Good Family Life As a Single Parent1," As both a parenting and a familial happiness inducing strategy, keep children’s mealtime, bedtimes, and wake-up times reasonably consistent. A reliable routine helps gives structure to you and your children’s days.Schedule weekly fun sessions too. Devote specific blocks of time to relaxing and otherwise spending time with your kids.
Limit external distractions by staying home together. Plan an age-appropriate activity such as a crafts or board games that everyone will be interested in.
As a parent, you need time at the end of the day to gets things done and decompress. Your children also need more sleep, so put them to bed before you’re ready to wind down for the evening.
Don’t fall into the trap of allowing kids to stay up late (even if it means you get to spend more time together).
Remind yourself that you can make a point of connecting with your children on the weekend if it seems your weeks are full of work and school obligations.;
, Spending time with your children individually will allow you to enjoy activities together that they specifically enjoy, thus ensuring an emotional connection.


With school-aged children, this may include watching a favorite TV program together, playing video games, or athletic activities.
Get outside! The lake, river, or nearest state park are healthy, cheap, and can be genuinely enjoyable for almost every age group.

, Even if you don't have time or energy to cook dinner every night, make it a habit to have everyone together for meals at least once a week to share thoughts and stories about the day.


Children’s birthdays are an especially good opportunity to build a tradition around. However, birthdays can be hard in a single-parent home.
Consider celebrating birthdays out – perhaps even at the same place every year. Family-friendly restaurants will always be happy to have birthday parties (even small ones), and will likely get the staff assembled for the painfully fun happy birthday song.

, There's no better way to create shared memories than going somewhere new and exploring it together. Family trips can become an incredibly meaningful tradition too.


Camping, fishing trips, visiting relatives, and trips to local museums are just a few inexpensive and healthy ideas.
Even just car rides provide great opportunities for conversation. Enjoy these random opportunities to chat, sing (or joke about) songs on the radio, or make plans for the next thing you’re both looking forward to doing together.

If you're expecting twins and you've already got twins, it's scary and exciting at once.,

Try to make all of your checkup sessions.,
Take extra care of yourself.,
Get some help with your existing twins.,
Prepare a birth plan.,
Be prepared to experience a range of emotions after the birth.,
Enjoy every moment you can.",How to Cope with Having a Second Set of Twins," You might feel really bowled over and worried but remember it has been accomplished by women for as long as women have been having children. From the times with no proper medical care or knowledge for pregnant women, to third world countries and women having babies in the middle of their workplace, some women have been having a second set of twins all around the world. Times have changed thank goodness, and medical care has evolved. Your first step after you have confirmed with your doctor that it is twins is to take a day to let it all sink in before you tell the world.;
, This isn't something that everybody gets to do once, let alone twice! Most likely you have kept a lot of baby stuff you can reuse. If not, don't run out and spend your money on a whole bunch of stuff. People are going to feel sorry for you in the sense of the expense of buying everything all over again. You will more than likely get lots of gifts!

, This news is going to travel fast!


Decide when you wish to tell family. Many women wait for three months to ensure that the babies are healthy, and if you have any history of particular issues, even longer can be appropriate. However, you will need to balance this with how soon you're likely to show.

, Well deserved attention, as you are caring for an two extra lives inside you and you've already had twins, so people will be super curious.

, Your doctor will advise you of an appropriate meeting regime. With this pregnancy, if you have any odd pains or weird feelings, get checked out right away. Your poor uterus was stretched to maximum capacity the first time around. Now it is going to go through this again and you want to be careful that no problems will arise.

, Get some exercise, such as light walking but never overdue it. The last thing you want is to be on bed rest! Pay attention to your body. If something hurts unusually or just doesn't feel right, get it checked out.

, You will need to rest often, to preserve your energy and to be ready for giving birth when it's close to time. Ask family and friends if they can babysit a few times a week, to give you a good break.


Now is a good time to also ask who is prepared to help after the birth; after all, double sets of twins means a lot more than double the work. You need all the help you can get.

, Be realistic about the options and let everyone caring for you know that you have a plan.


If it turns out you have to have C-section this time, or perhaps you had one the first time as well, it's not the end of the world. Remember how busy you were the first time around? Take the help once again––maybe even more so this time! You already are super mom so keep it that way and don't wear yourself out so badly that the whole experience is not enjoyable.

, You know exactly what to expect this time around but it's still perfectly okay to feel even more emotional because let's face it, you remember clearly what it was like the first time! It will be somewhat the same the second time, only more exhausting because now two more makes four!


When your two bundles arrive, you will feel extremely emotional and proud. When you get home, this can quickly turn to feeling extremely overwhelmed. If people offer help,take it! Don't let your pride get in the way and think ""I can do this all myself"". It will be less exhausting for you if you accept help.
Your first year will be a blur and by far the most exhausting. Once again, take any help you can get!

, Remember that the tough days turn into a new day and it will be completely different.

Teach your children about both genders.",How to Create a Good Family Life As a Single Parent2," This will greatly help both you and your kids know that you’re not alone. Build or join a network of parents (and kids!) that can help and support one another.Sharing childcare, carpool, and household duties will greatly decrease demands on everyone.
Many of the challenges that arise while raising children are amplified for single-parent households. Of course, the community of support that is necessary (for everyone) to be a great parent can be harder to develop. Be active about cultivating positive relationships with other single parents you meet, especially those with kids your age.
Relatives, neighbors, and other parents you meet at your children’s functions are all likely candidates for friendship, support, and more.
Try to always have someone who you can call at a moment’s notice for help in a serious situation, as well as someone you can call more casually. Recognize that this doesn’t necessarily have to be – and maybe shouldn’t be – the same person.

, They exist, and they’re brilliant. A brief online search should inform you of the options in your area. Formal childcare cooperatives will charge less to watch children, and may even allow you to volunteer in exchange for free childcare.If none exist in your area, start an informal one with other single parents by rotating childcare locations and responsibilities.
This will not only help you save money and get more time free of parenting responsibilities, it will also help you get to know other families in the area.

, There are others who have experienced what you’re going through, and who are even living similar lifestyles simultaneously. Aside from help with the technical and logistical necessities of parenting, pay attention to your mental and social needs as well.Join a support group for single parents. Simply getting together with other single parents to talk about struggles and things you’ve learned will likely prove both enjoyable and helpful.
Seek social services. There are plenty of government programs geared towards helping single-parent families. Family support offices will help you identify programs you may qualify for.

, You may feel as though your children are missing another role model in their lives from whom they might learn. Know that a lack of a male or female parental role model will not necessarily be a detriment to your child’s upbringing, especially if you’re able to convey positivity regarding all genders.Ensure that your children are exposed to positive examples of healthy behavior by both men and women.
Make a point of mentioning characteristics or behaviors in members of both sexes.
Avoid making negative comments about the opposite sex in general.
Contradict negative stereotypes about both genders.
Make an effort to (non-romantically) include members of the opposite sex in your children’s life.
Seek out and maintain relationships with responsible members of the opposite sex who are happy to spend time with you and your children.
Show your children that it’s possible, healthy, and fun to have positive long-term relationships with members of the opposite sex.

Stay in tune with your children.,
Ensure that your work schedule allows you to spend adequate time with your children.,
Take a moment to calm down when frustration arises.,
After an intense moment or conversation, try to laugh it off.,
Take time for yourself.,
Handle dating appropriately.,
Talk about your separation or loss with your children.",How to Create a Good Family Life As a Single Parent3," There are some serious challenges to being a single parent. You’re likely often tired and distracted by responsibilities. Don’t allow yourself to slack on providing emotional support and consistent discipline for your child.The most important aspect of supporting your child is simply being there for them. Talk with your children about school and what's going on in their lives every day, even if only for a few minutes.
With children young and old, talk about what they want to be when they grow up. This can lead to heartfelt, fun conversations.
Tell children stories from you own childhood.
Don’t allow a sense of guilt from not being as available as you’d like to lead you to overcompensate by spoiling your children.
Be clear with your kids about what’s expected of them at home, including helping with chores and following the rules. Enforce these expectations to provide children with a sense of structure that helps them feel safe and comfortable.

, This can be a significant challenge, but adjusting your schedule, or even your job, is worth it if it means maintaining a happier, healthier family., Since you’re doing something alone that two people often do together, you’ll likely end up becoming frustrated from time to time. Granted, as a single parent, you can’t dump your kids off on a partner to wander off and calm down.When you feel your blood begin to boil – and it does, for everyone – check yourself.
Don’t allow yourself to yell at your children regularly. It will damage your relationship with them and normalize anger and stress in your lives.
Instead, count to ten. You’ll feel better more quickly than you think. You’ll then approach the situation in way you won’t regret.
When feeling overwhelmed, don’t feel as though you can’t let your children know. Share your frustrations with your children instead of taking it out on them.
It’s actually healthy for your kids to see you as human, handling adversity and sadness, which they too will face.

, If necessary, speak honestly with your child. Remind them that things will get better, and tell them you love them.You want them to know they can talk to you when they’re frustrated, so do so with them!
Try to lighten a tense mood, for everyone’s sake, with an attempt at humor.
The quality of your joke won’t matter. As long as it’s a positive and cheerful gesture your child will register those connotations and be comforted.

, Schedule time for yourself from time to time. Allow a family member or trusted friend to watch you kids for an evening so you can catch some leisure time.Don’t use “you time” to do chores or catch up on work – that defeats the point of making time for yourself.
Plan out something fun you’ve been wanting to do beforehand, and look forward to it. This may even include some quiet time alone.
Keep track of how to enjoy yourself. You want to be able to model enjoyment and contentment for your children.

, First and foremost, only date people who only ever treat you and your partner with respect. Don’t cut into time with your children to go on dates – try to do so on time you schedule for yourself, or during the day when your kids are occupied.Carefully consider the impact of dating someone on your relationship with your children.
Wait to introduce a new romantic partner to your children until you’ve developed a solid relationship with them.
Don't expect your children to immediately be fond of your romantic partner. Give them to time to get to know one another, and know that someone new in close proximity to you will take some getting used to for children of any age.

, If and when your child wants to do so, be ready to talk with them about why their other birth parent is no longer part of the picture. Since most single-parent homes are the result of divorce or other type of unexpected separation, the change will likely have led to feelings of unhappiness, sadness, and anger for your children.
Allow your children to convey the feelings they have about whatever happened.
Answer any questions your children have openly and honestly, but avoid unnecessary or traumatic details, and refrain from speaking poorly of their other birth parent.
Reassure your children that a separation was not their fault.
Offer to bring your children to a counselor who can help you both face the feelings that might arise following a separation, even long after it occurred.

If you think your teen’s partner is a risk to your teen’s safety or health, encourage your teen to end the relationship.,
If appropriate, introduce your teen to someone new.",How to Cope when Your Teenager Falls in Love," Your child will always be your child, even as they grow up, so you will always worry about them. But be supportive, give guidance and make an effort to be informed and involved in their life, rather than restrict or monitor everything they do.


Giving them space to experience their first experience of love means letting them be responsible for their emotions and choices. Some of first loves may end quickly, some may persist, but each relationship will teach your teen valuable lessons about how to be with someone else.;
, Have a conversation about what kind of person your teenager is in a relationship with. Ask them how they see the relationship, its virtues and its flaws and why they think the relationship is special.


You can also ask your teen’s friends what they think of the relationship, but do this casually as you do not want to interrogate your teen’s friends and be too aggressive about trying to find out more information on your teen’s partner. Your teen’s friends spend likely more time than you do with your teen, so they can see your teen and their partner in different situations and perhaps see a side of the relationship you may not have access to.

, Invite your teen’s partner over for a family dinner or lunch to try to socialize with them and get to know them better. But always check with your teen before you invite their partner over, as you do not want to be too overbearing or disrespectful towards your teen.

, This is important because the more your teen trusts you, the more they will feel comfortable talking to you about their new relationship.One way to build trust with your teen is to be calm and not overreact to your teen’s new relationship. Avoid asking too many questions, following their every movement and wanting to know everything.
On the other hand, do not be indifferent and do not underestimate the relationship of your teen. Keep in mind that your teen is going through a very important emotional experience, much like your first experience of love.

, If they are not willing to talk, do not force the conversation, but indicate to your teen that you are interested in what is going on in their life and want to be supportive of their new relationship.


If your teen feels comfortable and supported rather than policed or judged, they will be more willing to talk with you and to listen to what you have to say. Listen and consult with your teen and offer advice only if they ask you for it.

, Teenage love can be overwhelming so you may want to establish boundaries and limits to their physical interactions in front of others or in a common space.


Make it clear when and where you think certain physical behaviors are acceptable or unacceptable. Talk to them if you feel comfortable with them kissing in front of other guests and/or other family members, while having dinner together or while spending time together in a common space (watching TV after dinner, hanging out in the living room as a family, etc).
Discuss which types of displays of affection are acceptable and not acceptable in public. For example, constantly kissing in front of strangers and ignoring their presence or too much PDA (public displays of affection) can be impolite or uncomfortable for others.
Try to find a balance between what is acceptable and unacceptable. Give your teen advice on how to deal with public displays of affection, rather than simply chastising or scolding them.

, Other relationships in your teen’s life like their relationship with their family and with their friends are just as important as their new romantic relationship, so speak to them about how to balance out other areas in their life with spending time with their partner.The relationship should not affect their success in school and in extracurricular activities. As well, time with friends is important to maintain, so remind your teen not to disregard their friends.
If their commitment to others begin to suffer, talk to them about this. Encourage them to not neglect their other relationships. Have them make a schedule that includes time for other commitments, family, friends and of course, time with their first love.

, Your teenager will probably be obsessed with their new relationship and spend the whole day chatting online or on the phone with their boyfriend or girlfriend. Depending on how often your teen is spending on the Internet or the phone, set time limits on how long they can chat with their partner.


Explain that they should be spending their time equally with their partner and doing activities with others.

, Do not be too lenient as you guide your teen in his relationship. Be consistent with your discipline but make sure that your rules are fair. Set a realistic curfew to follow and reasonable limits on their Internet and phone use.

, This will give your teen some perspective on your experiences of the highs and lows of first love. Give them advice on the appropriate age for a serious relationship, how to act on a date, how to be a good boyfriend or girlfriend, how to build trust and communication in a relationship, and how to deal with the end of a relationship.Through conversations like this, you can provide support and assistance to your teen and make them feel like they are not alone in their feelings.

, Some teens may not be open to talking about their relationship or their feelings, or to hearing your experiences of first love. Make it clear that if they ever do want to talk, you are always open to a discussion another time or further into their relationship.


Let your teen know that you respect their desire for privacy and are always available if they ever want to talk.

, If your teen seems to committing too much time to the relationship and other relationships or commitments start to slip, this may be an a good time to check in with the relationship to ask if something is wrong or if there are issues in your teen’s relationship they may want to talk to you about.This way, you are trying to get information on the relationship in a helpful, supportive way, rather than a nagging or intrusive way.

, Though you may not be able to control when your child falls in love, you can let them know what kind of expectations you may have for their partner’s behavior and your teen’s behavior in the relationship.


Your teen should expect positive character traits in their partner like a good upbringing, a commitment to schoolwork and to bettering themselves, an ability to behave decently and politely to others, and being respectful and supportive in a relationship.
Do not cultivate prejudices or pre-judgements of your teen’s partner based on a biased against a certain cultural group or social class. Be open to getting to know your teen’s partner better, rather than jumping to conclusions or forming snap judgements of them.
Let your teen know that you expect them to be respectful and polite towards their partner and towards others when they are with their partner. They should not offend or mock their partner or you when they are with their partner and in front of company or other family members., Have an honest conversation with your teen about sex, and your ideas around sex. Do not let sex be taboo, as the less your teen knows about sex, the more likely they are to make mistakes or get in situations that could have been prevented by knowing more about sex.


Explain to them that getting involved in sex with some early in a relationship may not be beneficial to the relationship in the long run. Being physically ready to have sex is very different than being emotionally ready to have sex.Let them know about the unintended consequences of not practicing safe sex (with a condom or contraceptives), such as pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
Ask your teen if their partner’s parents have also talked to them about sex, and if they have not, encourage your teen to talk to their partner about what they now know about sex. If possible, talk to the parents of your teen’s boyfriend or girlfriend to let them know it is time to talk about sex with their teen, as it is in the best interests of both your children.

, While it may seem like you teen is acting over dramatic or too caught up in feelings of first love, try to respect their feelings and put yourself in their position.Remember your teenage years and your experiences of first love. If you have conveniently forgotten the dramatic details of your first love, ask old friends who knew you back then to get a sense of how you behaved. Likely, it was not much different from how your teen is behaving in their first love relationship.

, Teenage love can last, but very often, it will end in fighting and tears. Do not show your disapproval or dismiss your teen’s grief or depression. Instead, try to talk to your teen, distract them by doing some of their favorite activities or taking them on a camping trip away from their usual surroundings.If your teen does open up about their feelings of hurt and sadness, listen to them and try to offer words of comfort and support.

, Make sure they know that the intense emotions they are feeling during a relationship or after a breakup are perfectly normal and felt by almost everyone going through the same experiences.

, Place less pressure on them to complete their house chores or fulfill any tedious commitments so you don’t add more stress to their bad mood and depressed state.Instead, direct their attention to fun activities or things they enjoy doing. Encourage them to hang out with you or with others so they do not spend time harping on angry or sad thoughts. Help, understand and support them. Do not make this challenging time more difficult for them.

, Let your teen know you are concerned about their relationship with their partner. If you find their partner rude, distant, cold, struggling with alcohol or drug issues, or possibly abusive or destructive to themselves or others, communicate this to your teen.Explain how the boyfriend’s or girlfriend’s bad decisions could influence your teen, or lead to bad decision making by your teen. Poor choices can have a lasting impact on your teen’s health and life, especially if they get involved with anything illegal or dangerous. Keep in mind that this first love relationship likely will not last forever, so express your concern but do not put too much pressure or be too overbearing towards your teen.

, Explain the difficulties and challenges of dating a person with an addiction.


Addicts will often find their addictions to be more important than any romantic bonds or relationships in their life, and will often make poor decisions, lose control of their life, and get in trouble with the law.Suggest treatment options or counseling to your teen to help with their partner’s addictions. Try to talk with the boyfriend or girlfriend about their addiction, and get their parents involved, if they are not involved already. Together, you can all try to convince them to get help or treatment.
Explain to your teen how to react and behave in critical or dangerous situations. Make sure they are aware of the dangers of addiction, and encourage them not to succumb to the pressure to become addicted or make poor decisions like their partner.

, Perhaps the initial meeting or your first impression of them was less than ideal. Or perhaps you have only heard details of your teen’s partner and are holding onto certain biases or prejudices against them.


Make an effort to get to know your teen’s partner better. Spend quality time with them, trying to have a conversation with them and find out more about them. Then, assess your assumptions of them.

, Make sure you provide examples and impressions to back up your disapproval of your teen’s relationship. Have a discussion with your teen about the relationship to express your disapproval or warn them that you think the relationship might be toxic or is negatively affecting them.

, Unless your teen’s partner has broken the law or overstepped their bounds, you cannot force your teen to end the relationship. But, you can certainly try. Restrict when your teen goes out, monitor who they go out with, and restrict their phone and Internet access to reduce their ability to communicate with the dangerous or unhealthy boyfriend or girlfriend.

, Once a sufficient amount of time has passed and if your child seems less moody or upset after a breakup, draw your teen’s attention to someone new.If your teen is dating someone you disapprove of, drawing attention to other people and other possible relationships can be a good way to end a bad relationship and show your teen there are other, healthy and positive people available.Encourage your teen to socialize with other friends or potential love interests, and do activities that do not involve their current partner so they have more opportunities to meet someone new.

If you don't like your nanny, consider why this might be.,
Consider changing your attitude about your nanny.,
Realize that your nanny is a person too.,
Talk to your parents if you really can't see your way to liking the nanny.,
Be helpful.,
Be clear about things you are not happy about.,
Realize that when your nanny asks you to do things, he or she is in a position of authority over you.,
Take your own time out if you feel really angry, annoyed or fed up with your nanny.,
Be friendly.,
Don't keep your sadness to yourself.,
Find similarities between you, and focus on those rather than the differences.",How to Cope With Having a Nanny," Is it because you would rather be alone or with your parents? Is it because your nanny seems strict or uninterested in you? Is it because your nanny spends a lot of time doing housework and less time playing with you? Think about the reasons that cause you to not like your nanny that much.;
, Are your concerns realistic or are they just something you'd prefer to be? Maybe you can change your point of view and try to look at the situation differently. The section below this one has a series of suggestions for developing your own coping mechanisms, and it's suggested that you try those before giving up on your nanny.


For example, perhaps your nanny annoys you because she doesn't make the food you like to eat. You could choose to see this as an opportunity to try new foods or to find online recipes for your nanny to follow instead. If you lead the way and explain what you'd prefer, maybe your nanny will be impressed and follow your suggestions.

, While it is a difficult concept to grasp, much the same as with teachers, nannies are human too. Your nanny has feelings, concerns and problems just as you do. The difference is that your nanny is an adult, and should therefore behave responsibly. If you do not feel that your nanny is being responsible, you will need to talk to your parents.

, If you want a change in the way that your nanny behaves, it is probably best to tell your parents what is bothering you. Be clear about why you're not happy, otherwise they might think you're just being difficult or even selfish. Remember that your parents are likely very busy and are doing their best to provide you with top notch care and they want you to be happy. They will listen to genuine complaints but they'll be unimpressed if you just feel out of sorts and don't like the nanny without good reason.


Find genuine reasons to tell your parents about. For example, if your nanny has hurt you physically or emotionally, if she or he calls you names or fails to feed you, etc., tell your parents immediately, as this is abusive. On the other hand, if your nanny rebukes you (tells you off) for being late or for throwing food or for teasing your sibling, etc., he or she is just doing their job.

, Pick up after yourself, put things away, offer to help with some tasks and do what you're asked to do when asked. It's faster to be helpful and gains you both more time for fun and keeps nanny happier.

, Tell your nanny when something annoys, bothers or upsets you. Your nanny is not a mind reader and may simply not realize that she or he has done something that upsets you. If you make a clear statement about something that the nanny did (or failed to do), naming the action and stating how it upset you, your nanny will be able to address the matter openly with you. This avoids seething and feeling rotten and can result in a complete change!

, Maybe you don't like the fact that the nanny is telling you what to do and the nanny is bossing you about and isn't even related to you. Remember that your parents have paid this person to take good care of you and expect him or her to be responsible for your safety and well-being. Hence, your nanny will ask you to stop doing things, to help out, to pick up after yourself, etc. at times, because this is all part of being a helpful and a good family member. Every time the nanny is telling you what to do, then imagine it's your parents telling you, because your nanny will only be doing what the parents ask of her or him.

, Instead of taking out your emotions on this person, go away for a little bit and just chill out. Let your feelings work through you before going back and sorting things out with your nanny. That way, you'll both feel better and be in a good place to talk things through.

, See this as a new chance to make a friend. A nanny is a great person to talk to, as they are older than you and can give you advice about your problems. In some cases, you may grow more comfortable telling your nanny about things than you will with your parents; it is always nice to have an extra ear to tell, an additional shoulder to lean on.

, If you miss your parents when they are out and the nanny is there, then tell your nanny that you really miss them. Your nanny will be more understanding about why you're feeling down and won't worry that it's something she or he has done.

, If you both like the same TV show, board game, etc., then you'll be able to spend time sharing that activity together and learning more as a team."

Set up playdates with children from school.,
Allow your child to play with children in your neighborhood.,
Encourage your child to play with family members.,
Sign your child up for sports and other recreational activities.",How to Cope with Guilt over Your Child Being an Only Child1," One way you can cope with guilt you may feel over having an only child is to set up playdates for your child. Talk to the other parents at your child’s school and arrange playdates with your kids after school or on a weekend. Be social with other parents and children at your child’s school so you can all support each other and spend time together.You may arrange for weekly playdates with children that your child seems to like and get along with. You and other parents may take turns hosting the playdate at your homes. Or you may plan a fun activity for your child and other children from school once a week, like going on a hike, going bowling or going to see a movie.;
, You can also reach out to any children who live in your neighborhood and invite them over to play with your child. Allow your child to go over to a neighbor’s house to hang out and play, with adult supervision, of course. Try to create a community of children for your only child so they are never without a playmate close by.To encourage children in your neighborhood to come over and play with your child, you may host a get together with neighborhood families at your home. Or you may arrange a block wide get together where all the children can play together.

, You can create a community of playmates for your only child by encouraging them to play with their family members. Cousins, uncles, aunts, and other extended family can often become as meaningful to an only child as a sibling might be. Younger family members like first cousins and second cousins can be great playmates for your child.You may host family dinners once a week so your child can grow up close to their younger family members. Or you may suggest going on family outings with younger family members so your child can spend time with them.

, To help your child meet other kids, encourage them to sign up for sports teams and other recreational activities like clubs, groups, or leagues. Note your child’s strengths and encourage them to sign up for activities that will play to their strengths.For example, you may notice that your child is very good at math. You may then encourage them to join a math league after school where they can meet other kids that share their interest.
Or you may notice that your child is interested in social justice. You may then encourage them to join the school paper so they can write about social justice issues or encourage them to join a social justice club at school.

Arrange weekly playdates with your child.,
Take interest in your child’s interests.,
Give your child alone time.",How to Cope with Guilt over Your Child Being an Only Child2," Often, only children end up growing very close to their parents. You can encourage this bond by spending quality time with your child on a regular basis. You may arrange weekly playdates with your child where you both spend time doing something fun and engaging together. You may allow your child to choose the activity you do together or suggest a possible activity you can do. Make these playdates part of your child’s routine so they do not feel lonely or without a playmate.For example, you may have weekly movie nights with your child where you prepare snacks and watch a movie of your child’s choice. Or perhaps you have once a week basketball sessions where you play one on one with your child.

, You can also make your time with your child feel meaningful by taking an active interest in your child’s interest. Ask thoughtful questions about your child’s hobbies and interests. Or ask your child about their day and listen intently to what they have to say. This can help them feel you care about them as a person and want to be there for them.For example, you may ask your child, “How was your day at school?” or “What was the most surprising moment at school today?”
To get meaningful conversation started, you may say to your child, “What is so cool about science, anyway?” or “Tell me more about your social justice club.”

, Though you may be worried that your child will be lonely or isolated as an only child, you should try to allow your child to have their alone time. Many only children enjoy some alone time where they can read, write, or play on their own. Carve out some alone time in your child’s schedule so they can be with themselves and be independant.You may try balancing your child’s alone time with time with others. Perhaps you set aside time after dinner for your child to play alone and make sure they have a few playdates a week with other children for balance.

Talk to family and friends.,
Reach out to other one child parents.,
Speak to a therapist or a counselor.,
Work on accepting your status as a one child parent.",How to Cope with Guilt over Your Child Being an Only Child3," Though you may take productive steps to make your child feel part of a community, your feelings of guilt may still be there. Rather than bottle these feelings up, reach out to family and friends. Talk about your feelings of guilt and be honest about where it is coming from. You may just need someone you respect and trust to listen to your thoughts.For example, you may confide in a close friend or family member that you are feeling guilty about having an only child. Be willing to listen to any advice or counsel offered to you. Take comfort in others and try not to keep your guilt hidden from others.

, You may notice one child parents at your child’s school, in your neighborhood, or in your circle of friends. Reach out to them and talk to them about your feelings of guilt. Many one child parents experience feelings of guilt and speaking to other parents can help you feel better.You may end up being part of an informal or formal one child support group with parents who are experiencing similar feelings you are. Build a community with other one child parents so you can all talk about where you are at and feel less alone.

, If you are still struggling with feelings of guilt despite talking to family or friends, you may consider professional counsel. Set up an appointment with a therapist or a counselor. Ask your primary care doctor to recommend a therapist or ask parents you know for recommendations for a counselor.Be willing to speak honestly and freely about your feelings of guilt with the therapist or counselor. Sharing your feelings with a trained professional can give you a sense of comfort and help you cope with these feelings more effectively.

, As you speak to others about your worries and your guilt, try to work on accepting your situation. Think of all the positives of having one child and remind yourself that you are lucky to have a child you love. You may think of positives like not having to deal with any fights between siblings, not having to divide your time between two children, and not having to worry that your child has to compete with a sibling for your attention.As you talk to other one child parents, you may also realize that your situation is completely normal and okay. You may have your own reasons for having one child and you should not feel pressured or judged by others. Draw on those around you as well as your own sense of self to accept and enjoy having one child.

Take care of yourself.",How to Cope with Feeling Like a Parenting Failure," Parents often believe that the way their children act is a testament to what type of parents they are. While this may be the case with some, not every child who misbehaves does so because of less-than-stellar parenting skills. Stop taking your child’s behavior personally and realize it is never too late to steer things in a different direction.


Your child’s bad behavior may be the result of a behavior disorder, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and disorders that are related to depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. Speak with your child’s pediatrician if you are concerned this could be the cause for behavioral issues.;
, Putting yourself down and feeling like you are a less than adequate parent won’t help the situation. In fact, these negative emotions will only hurt you and your family in the long-run. Feeling stuck and defeated in these emotions prevents you from moving forward and getting the help you may need for your child., You know your kids better than anyone. After all, you created them. Unless you are physically, verbally, or sexually abusive towards them, you are likely the best person for the job. Although you may think you can do better, you are doing the best you can, and that is likely all they need, and want., Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, it's difficult to overcome negative views about yourself on your own. Having an impartial professional help you identify negative patterns of thinking can help you recognize all your strengths as a parent and feel better about yourself. Talk to your primary care doctor for a referral to a mental health provider who can help you with these issues.

, You may believe that being a good parent means that you don’t have to discipline your child, but in fact, it is essentially the core of parenting. Letting your child do whatever he wants, including hurting others and being disrespectful to you, without having to suffer any consequences doesn’t benefit anyone, especially the child.Parenting isn’t about agreeing with everything your child does, but helping the child to learn boundaries and becoming a better person because of it.

, If you’re a successful soccer player or excel in physics, but your child doesn’t, it doesn’t mean you’re doing something wrong. Instead of focusing on your child’s achievements and feeling bad when they aren’t what you hoped they would be, provide unconditional love and encouragement for what they are trying to do.Successful parenting doesn’t mean your children are successful in sports or academics, but that they try their best and are good people.

, Some parents look at their job as a competition against all other parents. They often believe that the more they do, the better parents they are. This is not the case. Knowing that you are doing the best you can do is all that matters—not how many cookies you made for the bake sale or how many times you are elected as PTA president.Enlisting the help of a support team can work wonders. Asking people to help with carpooling or watching the kids so that you can get groceries by yourself isn’t a sign of weakness or a sign that you are any less of a parent. It shows that you know what is best for your children, which isn’t a parent who is overwhelmed and stressed all of the time because of trying to do too much.

, Feeling better about your parenting can be achieved simply by looking to other parents for consolation. Talking to them may help you realize just how common some of the issues that crop up in your household really are.


Invite some parents from the PTA to play golf, come over for wine, or start a book club. Make a point to ask them about some of the challenges they face as parents. You might say, ""What's the most frightening/confusing/frustrating situation you've ever been in with your kids?"" and listen. You might be surprised to find that you all are going through similar experiences.
Also, make use of their presence to vent some of your own frustrations. Don't feel too guilty about it. Sharing your burdens with others can be quite cathartic, and actually make you feel more positive in the end.

, Instead of thinking about how often you put your kids in time-out or how many fights you broke up during the day, think of all of the positive things you accomplished.Ask yourself how many times you made them smile, how many books you read, or how often you heard “I love you” during the day. Thinking of the good things that happened instead of just the bad things may help you realize you’re doing a great job.

, You can only be yelled at by a toddler so many times before you take disciplinary action. You’re not a failure because you aren’t able to constantly stay happy and calm-tempered all of the time.When you stand back and take a look at what a person can reasonably handle in this type of situation, you’ll likely see you’re on par.

, You can’t expect to feel good about your skills as a parent when you feel depleted yourself. Taking time out for yourself is necessary in order to be a better parent for your children.


Getting time alone every now and then can give you a chance to miss your children. It can also improve your mood and perspective which, in turn, can improve your children’s lives.Consume a balanced diet. Get plenty of exercise. Develop a stress-management toolbox of coping skills like deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation. If you build in healthy strategies into your day or week, you will feel more positive and have a better outlook about your parenting.

Collect the trimmings.,
Choose the bases.,
Use soaking floral foam.,
Push the trimmings into the foam.,
Add decorations, if desired.,
Keep the trees watered.",How to Make Tabletop Christmas Trees1," Purchase evergreen trimmings or clip them from trees and shrubs in your own yard. If you’re gathering your own materials, fill a shopping bag with three- to six-inch cuttings. If you’re purchasing materials, look for cuttings at local garden centers or nurseries, and ask which ones will hold up well indoors.Examples of plants you can collect trimmings from are spruce and holly. If you have outdoor plants that already need trimming, like boxwood or arborvitae, you can upcycle their trimmings!;
, You can use short, sturdy decorative vases if they are able to hold water. Otherwise, place vessels of water inside of larger decorative bowls, pots or pedestals.For example, place tumbler glasses inside of pots, or nestle small vases into the centers of ornament-filled bowls. Be creative! Use items you already have or buy containers to suit your tastes.

, Get foam blocks that are about as long as you want each tree to be tall. You may want to cut them down to size, into one rectangular block per tree. Saturate the foam completely. Trim each one with a knife, from a rectangle shape into a cone shape. Keep the tops of the blocks flat.The foam won’t show, so don’t worry about making the shape perfect.

, Start at the bottom and put the longest pieces in first. Continue all the way up, choosing smaller pieces as you get higher on the trees. Put one or a few plant pieces at the very tops.Keep scissors or wire cutters on hand and trim “branches” down wherever needed as you’re arranging.
Fill in any gaps until the floral foam is fully concealed.

, You can brighten up your trees with artificial berry branches, strings of brightly-colored or metallic beads, and light-weight ornaments. Another idea is to add small bows and/or miniature candy canes.

, Check the floral foam every couple of days. Stick your finger in between the trimmings to feel the foam. If it isn’t moist, add a little water to the foam.Plan to water your trees every other day.

Get graduated size cookie cutters, or plan to improvise.,
Use your favorite recipe.,
Ice the cookies.,
Add decorations.,
Put the trees on display.",How to Make Tabletop Christmas Trees2," You can find graduated cookie cutters at most craft stores where the cake decorating supplies are, or purchase them online. Stars are a great choice because their corners mimic the ridges of pine trees. However, you can use other shapes such as circles instead.If you don’t have the time or desire to get graduated cutters, cut out freeform circles or stars in graduated sizes. For example, make cookies with diameters roughly two inches, one and a half inches, and one inch. The more imperfect the cuts are, the more abstract your tree will look. You can even make them wavy!, Sugar cookie recipes are an ideal choice because they will be sturdy and take decoration well. However, you can use any cookie recipe you like: for example, you could use butter cookies, gingerbread cookies, or snickerdoodles. Alternately, if you don’t want to use homemade cookies, you can purchase cookies for this purpose at a grocery store or bakery.


If you choose a butter cookie recipe, make sure the cookies will be thick enough to be sturdy in your cookie stacks. A good dough thickness is a quarter of an inch., Royal icing is a good choice since it will dry hard and maintain its shape. Smooth icing onto the surface of one of your largest-sized cookies. Build your stacks by working from the bottom up, placing smaller cookies on top of larger cookies. If you are using star shapes, arrange them so that the points of the star are shifted for every other layer.If you have frosting remaining, drizzle it onto the trees., Place a small cookie vertically on the top of your tree, secured with icing. You can add sprinkles, colored sugar, or whatever edible decorations you like!For example, if you’re using star shapes, you can put a dome-shaped sprinkle where the points of the stars are.
Try cinnamon-flavored crystals or sprinkles in red, green and metallic shades.

, Arrange them all on a single platter, or give them each their own decorative dish. Add “snow” on their dish(es) with paper doilies or by sprinkling powdered sugar around their bases."
"
Choose pedestals, if desired.,
Arrange the bases.,
Add the main material.,
Place decorations on the treetops.",How to Make Tabletop Christmas Trees3," You can use candle bases, wooden spools, or no pedestal at all, depending on your preference. The wooden spools will take a little longer and require the addition of wooden discs, such as those found in craft stores. However, the wooden spools make a neat effect stacked beneath the trees like trunks.


Hot glue wooden spools together by gluing the top of one to the bottom of another. Repeat until you have the trunk height you desire. Glue the bottom spool to a wooden disk as a stand. Repeat this for each tree.Be careful when handling a hot glue gun, and follow the safety precautions that came with your glue gun. You can read more about glue gun safety at http://safety.ucanr.edu/files/3260.pdf.

, Get paper mache or Styrofoam cones. If you’re using wooden spools as pedestals, fit a wooden disc into or onto the bottom of the cone (depending if the cone is open- or closed-bottomed). Secure it in place with hot glue.Glue the end of the spool stacks to the discs on the bottoms of the cones.

, There are multiple materials you can pick from to make up the primary texture of your trees. You can apply ribbon, felt, or jingle bells to your cones. Cut any fabric material, as needed, and apply it to the cones using a hot glue gun. If you opt for ribbon or felt, glue a strip about two inches wide around the bottom of the base, and start your layers above that strip. Glue the layers on row by row, with the points of the fabric triangles facing down. Alternate where the downward points of the triangles overlap for each row.


If using felt, try muted neutrals like gray, white, and beige balanced out with some baby blue or soft green. Cut felt into triangles one and a half inches long.Consider ribbon colors in silver, gold, red and green, or go with any color theme you like! Cut ribbon into pieces about two inches each.Create a clean point in each piece of ribbon by folding its corners on one end and gluing them down in the backs.Hot glue jingle bells with every other row shifted, as if they were making up a brick wall. Give them extra flair by spray painting the whole thing white, or with a glitter sealant!, The options are endless as to what you can put on top of your mini Christmas trees! You can hot glue Christmas bows, ornaments, pine cones, or whatever decorations you like onto the tops.

Be aware of the impact crisis can have on your family.,
Enact a plan.,
Focus on the present.,
Limit your exposure to fear.,
Recall past stressful events and strategies used.,
Use stress reduction techniques.,
Keep your family calm.",How to Cope with Frightening Parenting News1," Depending on the type of situation, experiencing or receiving frightening parenting news can sometimes result in a family crisis. This is when the family is no longer able to function together as a unit, as they once normally did. There are many different types of triggers that can cause a family crisis, and all of them can affect all members of your family. Triggers may include:

A particular medical or mental health crisis with one of your family members.
A financial crisis from a loss of job, or other financial burden making it impossible to maintain payments of bills.
Substance abuse with one or more of the family members.
Relationship problems between family members within the family unit. This could include increased difficult relational interactions between people as they go through different transitions within their lives. For example, teenagers acting out as they explore their independence, or empty nesters trying to identify their new selves as their children go away to college.;
, Gather any emergency resources you have and spring into action. If you need an emergency bag or to get out of your town, gather items quickly and leave. If you need to act quickly and immediately, do so. If not, take a moment and plan what action needs to be taken. Should you grab the kids from school? Should you call other family members? Think about what action needs to be taken and where and how to feel safe.

First sit down, and write a breakdown of all of the problems that are associated with this family emergency. Breaking this family crisis into smaller bits instead of tackling it all at once will be easier to manage, and help you to cope with the situation at hand more effectively and efficiently.
Get necessary items. For example, if there’s an illness spreading, cover your children’s faces with medical masks.
Remember small essential items such as phone chargers, radios, and children’s items if you need to travel somewhere.

, A scary news story might make you fear for your safety or for your future reality. However, don’t overgeneralize these events to your present reality of ‘this how life is’. Think about the news and then ask yourself, “How does this affect me or my kids right now?”While something may be scary and make you question your or your kids’ safety, be realistic in how you approach the situation. Is it an actual threat to your family right now?

, Choose whether you want to watch the news or stay involved in what’s happening. While you may want to be informed, staying up-to-date with reporting may cause you stress and anxiety. It’s up to you how much information you want or how up-to-date you want to be on what’s going on. If the news feels overwhelming, take a break.If you need news information for your own safety, take the information, but don’t listen to the stories if they upset you greatly. Focus on getting through the stress first.

, Take a moment to reflect on previous serious concerns and recall how you got through them. This may help you to remember the different successful strategies you used that you could possibly apply to the current situation.

Sometimes, families may not be able to do this on their own due to being too overwhelmed in the moment. This is when you should ask for the help of other friends or family not impacted by this pressing event to help you recall some of these strategies.
If there are no other friends and families, you could seek the assistance from a professional counselor to help you brainstorm previous strategies you’ve used in similar situations.

, Taking good care of your body, mind, and spirit is important when you’re frightened and stressed. If you’re feeling frantic and need to calm down, focus on your breath and breathing. Put your attention on each inhale and exhale for 60 seconds to immediately calm your body and mind.You can also begin calming practices such as meditation, tai chi, yoga, or journal writing. Do something each day that helps you feel calm and centered.
Take a time out and step back to gain some perspective on the current crisis situation. While taking deep breaths and trying to refocus your inner self, think about what has already been done. Once you have fully relaxed, then take a notebook and pen, and write down the things you still need to do and don't hesitate to ask others for help.

, It can be difficult to keep your family calm, especially if you have young children and there’s a large emergency. Children can become fearful quite easily, so do your best to keep them calm. If the children are scared, fearful or melting down, try some things to bring some calm. Give them a glass of water, sing a song, have them squish some putty, or rock in a rocking chair.Let them know it’s important to be calm and not loud or tantruming.
For a more movement-oriented child, have some do handstands or yoga poses. You can also go for a walk or a run.

Keep your kids safe.,
Talk to your children.,
Validate their feelings.,
Encourage school involvement.",How to Cope with Frightening Parenting News2," If you’re concerned about your children’s health and safety, do what you can to keep them safe. If you’re concerned about their health, make an appointment with a pediatrician. If there’s an immediate threat to your children or family, keep them nearby or within reach via cell phones.

For example, if there’s a risk of serious infection, start preventative measures to keep your children safe. Treat symptoms immediately and seek medical attention.

, If there’s a situation that you need to clue your children into, do so gently and carefully. Children can create irrational fears, so be clear in explaining the situation and how it may affect them. Sit down with your children and get on their level. Use age-appropriate words and phrasing and ask if they understand you. Be direct and let them know, “Yes, you are in danger” or, “This is scary, but you won’t be hurt.”if your children are different ages, you may consider talking to them separately. An older child may handle more in-depth news while a toddler or young child may just need to know that there’s danger and that you’re worried.
Some things don’t need to be spoken of to children if it’s inappropriate. If a parenting tragedy occurs on the news, you may wish to turn off the television or radio so that they do not hear it.

, After speaking with your child, allow them to ask questions or voice their concerns. Children often want to know the immediate danger or threats, so let them know honestly. Show that you’re willing to listen to them without judging them, and don’t laugh at their questions or comments. Acknowledge the feelings they may have such as feeling sad, confused, angry, or frightened.Say, “I know this must be scary for you, and I’m sorry you have to go through this.”

, If there’s something the schools can do to help children cope with any threats, write or call your children’s schools to get their involvement. The school may issue warnings, hold an assembly, or take extra health precautions depending on the situation. Get involved with the school parent-teacher organization and make sure that student health and well-being is prioritized.

For example, if there’s a whooping cough outbreak, encourage the schools to send out letters and enforce health measures to protect other children.

Express your feelings.,
Speak with other parents.,
Get therapy.,
Join a support group.",How to Cope with Frightening Parenting News3," A scary event can make you wonder what happened, why it happened, and what the future will be like. Don’t ignore your feelings, as this can slow your recovery and ability to cope. There’s no “right” way to cope, and each person will have different thoughts, feelings, and actions. Find an outlet for your feelings that feels safe to you. You may want to listen to music, draw, paint, or sketch, go on a walk, or play with your dog.Your emotions exist whether you want to acknowledge them or not. Even intense emotions will pass if you allow yourself to feel them.

, Social support is important, especially during periods of stress. Talk with other parents when you’re feeling fearful as a way to gather information, garner support, and be there for one another. Parents tend to want what is best for their children, so meeting with other parents can be supportive and help with problem-solving.For example, hearing about a school shooting may make you feel fearful about sending your kids to school. Lean on other parents for support and strength and to voice your fears and feelings.

, Therapy can help you work through problems in a supportive environment. While there are different therapeutic approaches, you should feel supported and able to talk freely without judgment. If you’re struggling to express your emotions or cope with difficult feelings, a therapist can help you through your challenges.Find a therapist by calling your insurance provider, local mental health clinic, or getting a referral from your physician. You can also ask for a recommendation from family and friends.
Connect with a social work case manager if possible, depending on the severity of the crisis. Social workers are trained at helping people work through crisis situations. They are able to look at and support the entire family system, rather than focusing in on just one particular family member or issue. Social workers are fully qualified individuals to provide therapeutic interventions to address mental health concerns, issues related to medical concerns, substance abuse concerns, and any other dynamic family changes and concerns.

, Connecting to others with similar concerns, fears, and questions can be helpful during difficult times. A support group can help you connect with others, share your experiences, and listen to others’ experiences. It’s a place for giving and receiving advice, meeting people similar to you, and feeling less isolated and alone.Find a local support group by calling a local mental health clinic. You can also join an online support group.

Measure the length of ribbon.,
Fold the ribbon.,
Tie the middle together with the small piece of ribbon.,
Fix the ends of the bow.,
Cut out a piece of the hanging cord.,
Decorate the tree.",How to Make Tree Bows," Each bow needs approximately 70cm/27.5"" of ribbon length to make it a decent size. Cut as many lengths as you intend to make ribbons.


Also cut small lengths of the smaller ribbon that will tie the center of the bow together. Make as many small lengths as you are making bows.;
, Fold it into 2 loops, then pinch in the center. Check that the sides of the bow are even and voluminous. Fluff out if needed.


A fuller bow can be made using 4 or 6 loops. Increase the ribbon length if doing this.

, Glue in place for added strength.

, Check that the ends are sitting neatly and evenly. Cut each end in a ""V"" shape, to prevent fraying and to finish off the look.

, Slip through the middle ribbon and tie to form a hanging loop. The ribbon can now be hung on the tree.


Repeat for the amount of bows you've made.

, Either cover the whole tree in bows and leave it like that, with a star or angel at the top. Or alternate with baubles. Try to keep the bows the main feature of the tree, as this has the best effect.

For an interesting effect, make differently colored bows that complement each other. Arrange on the tree so that no two colors that are the same sit alongside each other; this will give the tree a very colorful effect.

Turn your stocking right side out.",How to Make Patchwork Stockings," This will form the main body of your stocking. Lay out your 2.5 inch squares on a flat surface to form rows that build a rectangular shape.You should assemble rows comprised of four squares. Make eight such rows, lining them up to form a rectangle.
Make sure no two pieces of the same color or pattern touch each other when forming your rectangle. This helps form a unique patchwork appearance.;
, To start assembling your stocking, you will want to sew together each row of four first. To do so, fold the rightmost square over the square next to it. You are left with two squares stacked on top of each other. Sew a line running down the rightmost side of these two squares. Then, fold the leftmost square over the square next to it. Sew a line running down the leftmost side of the two squares.When you're done, sew together the two squares that meet in the middle of your row. You should be left with one row, fully sewn together. Repeat this process for the other eight rows.
It's important you sew in a straight line when using your machine. One trick to help is to look at the line as it forms instead of your needle. Looking at your needle can result in you losing control of the stitching., You should now have eight rows sewn together. Starting at the top of your rectangle, fold one row over the other. Sew together the two rows by sewing a line running across the longer side of the row, sewing the side that faces upward. Then, fold the two attached rows over the next row down. Again, sew a line running along the longer side of the row that faces upwards. Repeat until all the rows are sewn together.Remember to back stitch when you finishing sewing a line together. To do so, press the back stitch button on your sewing machine. Stitch backwards for about an inch to secure your stitching., When you're done, you should be left with a rectangle made up of eight rows of four squares. Before proceeding, you should iron your rectangle so it lays as flat as possible. Place it on an iron safe surface and gently slide your iron across the rectangle until it lays flat.Adjust your iron's settings by fabric type. It's best to use a lower setting unless you're using natural fibers or polyesters for your stocking., To form the boot, you will again assemble several rows using your squares. These rows should come off of the bottom right corner of your triangle.You will use six patches here. Create three rows of two patches each.
Again, make sure no two patches of the same color or pattern touch one another. Remember where your toe will attach to the main body of the stocking as well when choosing your colors and patterns.

, Sew together each row by stitching the two squares of fabric together. Then, sew the top two rows together. When you're done, sew the bottom row to the top two rows. You should be left with a small rectangular shape made up of six squares., You want the two to line up with the bottom right corner of your stocking. Three squares on one side of your toe should line up with three squares on the bottom right corner of the stocking's body. Line up the toe and then fold the toe over the main stocking.Once the toe is folded over, sew the toe and body of the stocking together. Then, fold the toe back to its original place.
You should now begin to see your stocking take place. You will be left with a boot-like rectangular shape of fabric. Later, you will round out the edges to complete your stocking shape.

, From here, you want to sew together the full front of your stocking. To start, you will need to lay down the stocking you just made, the backing fabric, and the batting.Take your backing piece, which will be the lining of the stocking, and lay it down on a flat surface with the right side facing down. The right side means the smooth, soft part of the fabric.
Lay a piece of batting fabric over the backing fabric.
Place the patchwork stocking you just made, with the right side facing up, on the top of the pile.
Pin the pieces together. Always make sure to have the needle ends of the pins pointing inward to avoid pricking your fingers while you sew., You do not need to trim exactly for now, as you'll be trimming excess later. However, cut around the backing and batting fabric so you have the rough shape of your stocking. Make the outline about an inch or two wider than your stocking on all sides., You will want to sew along the seams made by each row and column of your patchwork pattern. Start by sewing six lines on either side of each vertical seam.There should be six vertical seams running down your stocking.
You should stitch two lines, approximately half a centimeter away from the seam on either side, sandwiching each seam.
This will sew the backing, batting, and your stocking together.

, You will want to sandwich your horizontal seams in the same fashion. You should have six horizontal seams on your stocking, each of which needs to be sandwiched between two sewing lines.Again, use your sewing machine to stitch two lines, about half a centimeter away from the seam on either side, to sandwich each seam.
This will further secure the backing, batting, and stocking together.

, There should be a little excess batting and backing surrounding the stocking. Cut around the outline of your stocking to remove all excess batting and backing. You should now have one uniform piece of backing, batting, and stocking forming the rectangular outline of your stocking., You should now round out the shape of the toe and heel so the front of your stocking looks more like a traditional stocking. You can cut around a round object, like a can, or simply use your own judgment. Cut the toe of your stocking into a round shape. Then, round out the heel.You should be left with a piece of patchwork fabric in the shape of a traditional Christmas stocking.

, You will now use your backing fabric to complete your stocking. Place the backing fabric on a flat surface, with the right side facing upward. Then, place your stocking on the fabric with the right side facing downward.Pin the two sides together. Remember to have pin needles pointing inward to avoid pricking your fingers.It's very important that the right sides of the stocking and the backing fabric touch each other. Make sure this is the case before proceeding.

, Sew along the outline of the stocking to secure it to the backing fabric. Sew around the boot and heel, but do not sew the top part of the stocking on the opposite end of the toe and heel. This will be the opening of the stocking, so it should not be sewn., Once you've sewn the backing and stocking together, trim around the outline of the stocking to remove any excess backing fabric. You should be left with a full stocking, turned inside out., Gently turn your stocking right side out. You should now have a beautiful patchwork stocking. You can use this as a decoration. You can also stuff the stocking and give it to a friend as a gift."

Find a pool noodle.,
Bend the noodle.,
Secure with fishing line.,
Create the stripes.",How to Make Giant Foam Candy Canes1," Red or white is best but any color will do as you can cover them to create the desired effect. This process won't ruin the noodle so they can be reused after the holiday season and thrown back into the pool or lake.;
, Measure the noodle into three equal parts. Only bend the top third of the noodle. This will create the cane-like shape. You’ll want to keep it in place like this for about 20 minutes. You can do this by simply holding it, sitting on it or placing books on top of it.


If you want to save time, simply eyeball the appropriate bend spot and bend according to your preference.

, Tie the fishing line around the two parts of the bend. This will ensure the shape holds.


You can always readjust the shape later if you don’t like it.

, If the noodle is red, use white electrical tape to create stripes or vice versa. If you’ve chosen another color like purple, you will cover the entire noodle in a solid color of tape first before creating the alternating colored stripes. Diagonally, wind the red or white tape around the noodle and presto! You’ve created a foam candy cane.


If you’d like your stripes to be extra precise, measure two to three inches for each stripe (or larger if you prefer giant stripes). Make a small mark with a pencil. When winding the tape around the noodle, let the marks serve as a guide along the way. This will keep your stripes even and a consistent size.

, To keep the PVC from wiggling around when bending, create a channel by placing small pieces of scrap wood along the outline. These should be placed about 4-5 inches apart on either side of the line you’ve drawn. It’s best to drill these in place so they don’t shift.

, Place your template on the ground and grab your ½ inch PVC. Measure the noodle into three equal parts. Using a hairdryer, begin to slide the PVC through the channel, heating it along the way so it’s bendable. Only bend the top third of the noodle.


If you want to save time, simply eyeball the appropriate bend spot and bend according to your preference.
Be careful not to hold the heat source at the same spot for too long as it could melt.
This will take several minutes so take your time.
Wait until it’s cooled before popping it out of the template.

, Depending on the size of your PVC pipe, you may need two noodles.

, Cover the seam where the two noodles meet (if applicable) first. Otherwise, go ahead and cover the entire cane with white duct tape.


Due to the curves and noodle material, the tape may not lay perfectly flat.

, Diagonally, wind the red tape around the noodle. You can further customize the decoration with glitter, bows, etc.


If you’d like your stripes to be extra precise, measure two to three inches for each stripe (or larger if you prefer giant stripes). Make a small mark with a pencil.

, Before you begin your snowflake, make sure you have all the supplies. You can buy a perler bead set at a local craft store, which should come with beads as well as a pegboard. For a snowflake design, you need to make sure you have a hexagon shaped peg board.You will also need an iron and iron paper. This is paper used to protect clothing and other objects during ironing. You should be able to find it at a local department store.
If you're using the snowflakes to make magnets, make sure you have small magnets to glue on the back of the snowflake. If you're using them as ornaments, get some fishing wire to hang the snowflakes from the tree.

, Place one bead on the pegboard at a time. Go slowly, as the beads are very small. It's not uncommon to have to try several times to place a bead on the board, especially when you first start out using perler beads.To make the outline of your snowflake, start by forming one horizontal line going from one corner of the hexagon to the other corner.
From there, make two diagonal lines going that intersect your horizontal line. These should also span from one corner of the hexagon to the opposite corner.
When you're done, you should have three lines intersecting. Each corner of the hexagon should be touching one of the lines. You will have a criss-cross pattern that looks like the bare outline of a snowflake.

, From here, you can fill in your snowflake however you want. If you're using a pattern, refer to your pattern here. If you're not using a pattern, use your imagination to make the criss-cross pattern resemble a snowflake.It's a good idea to add some embellishments to all six corners of your snowflake. Add small lines shooting out of either side of the corners, as this will help it resemble a snowflake.
Fill in the center a little. Many people like to draw a zig-zag line circling the center of the snowflake to fill it out a little.
Try looking at pictures of real snowflakes for inspiration.

, It's dangerous to iron on a surface that is not heat proof. You should place your peg board on something like an iron tray or ceramic tiles before ironing your snowflake.Be very careful when moving your peg board to a heat proof surface. You do not want to accidentally knock your beads over.

, Place a piece or iron paper over your snowflake. Using circular motions, gently run the iron over the peg board for about 15 to 20 seconds. This should fuse your beads together without melting to the point you obscure your design., After ironing your snowflake, you can peel off the iron paper. The snowflake should gently peel off the peg board as well when you do this. If it doesn't come off all the way, gently lift your snowflake to remove it from the peg board.Once your snowflake is off the peg board, turn it over. Flip the snowflake upside down and place another sheet of iron paper over the snowflake. Iron the other side for an additional 20 to 30 seconds.
Your snowflake is now done. Let it cool for a few minutes before proceeding to use it as a decoration.

, You can glue a small magnet to the back of your snowflake. After allowing the glue to dry, you can place the snowflake on your fridge or in your locker at school., If you want to use the snowflake as an ornament, or to hang it somewhere in your home, you can do so with fishing wire. Take a piece of fishing wire and feed the wire through one of the holes in the design.Fold one end of the wire and form a loop and then make a knot near the snowflake.
Trim the excess wire. You now have a snowflake you can hang in your home.

, If you want to decorate a binder, planner, or notebook for the holiday season, you can use your snowflakes. Use a little glue to secure your snowflakes on the cover of binders, notebooks, and planners. Allow the glue to dry completely before using these supplies."

Cut floral wire.,
Place beads on the ends of the wire.,
Curve the ends of the wire.,
Bend the middle of the wire.,
Cut out and attach the leaves.,
Repeat the process.,
Glue the sprigs together.,
Attach the bow.,
Add a hook.",How to Make Mini Mistletoe1," Using a pair of scissors or shears, cut three, two-inch (5 cm) pieces of 24-gauge floral wire. The lengths of the pieces do not need to be exact. However, they should be similar in length.You can purchase floral wire at your local florist or arts and crafts store.;
, Once you cut your wire pieces, slide four beads onto the ends of the wire, placing two at each end. Because you want the wire to look like mistletoe, the beads should be white. However, you can also use pink or red beads to give the appearance of berries.You will need six to eight beads for the entire project.
You can find the appropriate beads at your local arts and crafts store.

, Using your fingers or a pair of needle-nosed pliers, create a U-shaped bend about ¼ of an inch (2/3 cm) from the end of the wire. This bend will keep your beads in place. Make sure that the bend is curved enough to allow the beads to slide into the groove.You might also consider bending the wire around the bead to make sure that there is enough room.

, With your fingers or needle-nosed pliers, created a U-shaped bend in the middle of the wire. Once you have created the bend, the two ends of the wire with the beads should be parallel to each other. Make sure that the beaded ends do not touch each other., Take a pair of scissors and cut six to eight small leaf shapes out of some green felt. The leaves should be about ½-inch (1.25 cm) long. Then take a hot glue gun and attach three or four leaves directly above the beads.Be sure to leave enough leaves for your second sprig.
You can purchase felt at your local arts and crafts store.

, After you have made your first sprig, repeat the process to create a second sprig. Use your remaining floral wire, beads, and leaves. Remember that each sprig should have three to four beads and leaves., Once you have your second sprig made, glue it to the first sprig with hot glue. Place a small dollop of glue at the U-shaped bend in the middle of the first sprig. Then place the U-shaped bend of the second sprig on the glue, positioning the beads slightly away from each other.If you have some exposed wire, you can also cut out some more leaves and glue them on.
Do not put the beads directly on top of each other.

, Once you glue your sprigs together, take a 4 to 6 inch (10 to 15 cm) piece of ribbon and fold it into a bow. Then attach the ribbon to the same area where you glued the sprigs together. The ribbon will help hide place the place where you glued your sprigs together and make your decoration look more festive.Ideally, you should use a red ribbon. However, if you want to changes things up, you can also use a white ribbon.

, Take the remaining piece of floral wire and create a U-shaped bend at one end. Then take the hot glue and attach the unbent end of the wire to the back of the decoration. Try to glue it to the place behind the bow where you glued the springs together.Once the glue has dried, you can hang the mini-mistletoe on your tiny tree.

Use a template to trace mistletoe sprigs.,
Cut out the sprigs and glue them together.,
Attach beads and ribbon.,
Create a ribbon loop.",How to Make Mini Mistletoe2," Download, print and cut out the mistletoe template. Then place the template on top of a large piece of green felt and trace around it with a pen. To make one decoration you will need to trace three sprigs.You can use a regular pen or a fabric pen to trace the mistletoe sprigs on the felt.
You can find the template here http://www.essentials.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mistletoe-template.pdf


, Using a pair of scissors, cut out the sprigs and glue them together using a hot glue gun. Separate the springs a little and be sure to glue them together at the stem, not the end with the leaves, to create a bunch. The leaves should hang down with only a little overlap between them., Using the hot glue gun, attach six to eight white beads to the felt sprigs. Glue them together in small bunches of two and three so that they look like mistletoe berries. Then take about six inches (15 cm) of red ribbon and tie a bow around the spot where you glued the sprig stems together.Tying the bow around the spot where you glued the stems together is festive and will help hide the dark spot created by the glue.

, Take about three inches (7.5 cm) and create a loop. Use the hot glue gun to attach the loop to the backside of the decoration. Glue it to the same spot where you attached the springs and the ribbon.Once the hot glue dries, your decoration is ready to hang.

Soak your mistletoe sprigs.,
Trim your sprigs to the desired length.,
Insert sprigs into a floral foam ball.,
Add a bow and a hook.",How to Make Mini Mistletoe3," The night before you make your kissing ball, soak your sprigs of mistletoe overnight. Place the stems down in a jar or vase of water. This will help them stay green and fresh looking for your display.During the holiday season, you should be able to find mistletoe at your local home and garden store.

, To create a “mini” kissing ball, trim your mistletoe sprigs using scissors or gardening shears. Instead of using whole sprigs, trim and separate sprigs to the desired length. In the end, you will want pieces of mistletoe that are roughly half the size of normal sprigs.


A normal kissing ball has pieces that are about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) in size., Take a two-inch (5 cm) floral foam ball and stick the stems of the sprigs in it. To get the sprigs inserted into the ball, you may need to use a metal skewer or ice pick to poke starter holes in the foam. Insert the sprigs until you cover the ball in mistletoe.Before you insert the sprigs, you may want to soak the foam ball in water for 15 minutes. This will help soften it up.
You can find floral foam at your local florist or arts and crafts store.

, Take about a foot (30.5 cm) of ribbon and tie it around the ball, creating a bow on the top. Then take a piece of wire, about 8 inches (20 cm), and insert it halfway into the ball. There should be at least 4 inches (10 cm) of wire sticking out of the top. Create a U-shaped bend in the remaining wire to create a hook from which to hang your ball.Because mistletoe berries are poisonous, make sure to hang your mini kissing ball in a place where children and pets will not ingest the berries.

Cut and glue an orange triangle under the snowman's eyes.,
Create optional earmuffs.",How to Make Foam Cup Snowmen1," This strip of felt will represent your snowman's scarf. Once you've cut the strip of felt, make four to five cuts and create slits on both ends of the strip to represent fraying at the end of the snowman's scarf. You can use a variety of colors to set your snowmen apart.You can use construction paper as a replacement for felt.;
, Turn your cup upside down so that the small end is on the top. Wrap your piece of construction paper or felt around the foam cup three to four inches from the top, leaving enough space to create the snowman's face.Wrap your felt on a downward slope on the front of your snowman so that it looks more like a scarf.

, Use a black marker or dark pen to draw two circles above your scarf that will represent the snowman's eyes and mouth. Alternatively, you can cut out circles using black felt or paper and glue them onto your cup to represent the snowman's eyes.Another option is to use black buttons to represent the eyes.

, This orange triangle will represent the carrot nose for your snowman. Use a piece of felt or construction paper. If you don't have these materials, you can use an orange pen.

, Bend a pipe cleaner over the top of your snowman's head. Trim the excess pipe cleaner so that only a half inch (1.27 centimeters) hang down on both sides. Attach two pom poms or cotton balls on the side of the pipe cleaner with glue. This will make it look like your snowman has earmuffs.

Attach pipe cleaners to the sides of your body.,
Attach your body cup to the remainder of the cut cup.,
Create an optional hat.",How to Make Foam Cup Snowmen2," Cut the bottom of a foam cup to create the snowman head.Poke a hole through the cup to fit one blade of the scissor into the cup. Finish by cutting around the entirety of the cup. Do not bend your cup too much or it may crack or break. Do not discard the extra piece of the foam cup, because you'll be using this later for the base.


To ensure a straight line, use a marker or pen to draw a straight line around the cup before cutting.

, Draw a face on the cup using a black marker. Get creative and draw whatever shape and color of eyes that you want. You can give your cup different expressions by pointing its eyebrows up or down, or giving your snowman a smile or a frown.


For instance, eyebrows pointed down are representative of angry emotions.
Slightly raised eyebrows can make your snowman look surprised.You can also create your snowman's face by cutting out pieces of felt or construction paper and gluing them to your cup.

, Punch a small hole towards the bottom of your snowman's head and put a brass brad through the hole. Put the snowman's head over the lower portion of another, uncut foam cup and push the brad through the second cup. This second cup will act as the snowman's body. Bend the brads inside of the second cup so that your head will stay attached to the body of your snowman.


You should be able to tilt your snowman's head to the left and right.

, The pipe cleaners on the side of your snowman will represent its arms. Get some black or brown pipe cleaners and cut them three to four inches long. Stick the pipe cleaners in the side of the body piece of your snowman. Fold down the pipe cleaner inside of the foam cup, and attach it to the interior sides of the cup with tape.You can also create hands by cutting out smaller half inch pieces of pipe cleaner and attaching them to the ends of your arms.

, Use the other end that you cut out to serve as the base of your snowman. Lay the base cup on a flat surface and position your snowman over it. Use another brass brad and puncture the side of your snowman's body and attach it to the base. Bend the brads inside of the cup to secure the body in place.

Staple several foam cups in a circle.,
Staple another layer of cups on top of your ring.,
Continue to staple and stack cups until you have half a sphere.,
Create more rows on the bottom of the ring.,
Create a smaller ring of cups.,
Stack and staple cups until you have another sphere.,
Attach the smaller sphere to the larger sphere of cups.,
Ball up pieces of construction paper for eyes.,
Decorate your snowman further.",How to Make Foam Cup Snowmen3," Form a circle with your foam cups on your floor. The size of the circle will dictate the overall size of your snowman, so keep this into consideration when laying them out. Once you have a good sized circle, staple each cup to one another while maintaining your shape. This should create a ring of cups that are attached to one another.The cups should be laying on their sides. Your goal is to layer rows on top of one another to eventually create a sphere.


Try to staple the cups so they lay as flat as possible on the ground.
Stapling the cups together on an uneven floor or table will make the final project lopsided.
You may need up to 24 cups to create your circular ring.

, Stack another set of cups on top of your initial ring of cups. Pull the cups around a half an inch in towards the center and staple them to the cups below them. Finish going all the way around the ring of cups.

, Continue to stack your cups and staple them to the cups below them. Pulling each row of cups in a half inch will make your snowman body begin to form a sphere as you add more rows. Once you cannot staple any more rows of cups, you should have a half sphere that will serve as the snowman's body.

, Now that you have a half-sphere, it's time to create a completely spherical snowman body. Staple more rows below your original ring of cups. Continue to do this until your snowman's body is complete. You should only need to create two or three rows of cups for the base.Make sure that your snowman can stand upright on its base without falling over.

, The next part of the project is to create the snowman's head. Do this in the same fashion that you created the snowman's body, but make a smaller ring of cups this time. Another thing you can do is use smaller cups to make this portion appear smaller.

, Repeat the steps that you performed to make the snowman's body, to make the snowman's head. Creating the smaller head should require fewer cups and take less time to complete.

, Staple the bottom row of cups on your head sphere with the top cups on the body of your snowman. You should now have a two-piece snowman with a larger body and smaller head.

, Take your balled up pieces of construction paper and put it inside of your cups on the head sphere of your snowman to represent eyes. You can also create a mouth using this same method., You can put a hat or scarf on your foam cup snowman to make it more unique. For the nose, you can use a cone created from orange construction paper or use an actual carrot. Before adding anything heavy to your snowman, make sure that it can carry the weight or you may break it.


Display your snowman on a shelf to keep it from being stepped on.

, Make a video of fluffy, falling snow by pouring this in front of the camera.









This also works as fallen snow. To make it more fancy, combine 4 cups (960mL) flakes, 1⅓ cup (320mL) liquid starch, several drops blue food coloring, and glitter.

, Punch small holes from white paper and use the punched circles as snow. This works best when blown in front of a fan.








, To refill a snow globe, pour in glycerine and small thermocol balls. You may use glitter or small beads instead of the thermocol.








, Mix ¼ cup (60mL) each of table salt and talcum powder. Spray the surface with spray-on craft glue or dab on white glue where you want the ""snow"" to stick. Sprinkle the sparkly mixture on the wet glue and allow to dry. Turn the project upside down to remove excess ""snow.""








, Start with white flour or baking soda. Add water one small spoonful at a time, mixing it up with a fork. Once you've formed a paste, cover the ground of a small winter scene. You can shape this into snowy hills and slopes with your hands. Sprinkle more flour over the top once finished.

Make salt crystals.,
Paint the surface.",How to Make Fake Snow2," Cut open a disposable diaper and remove the white granules; these are made from sodium polyacrylate. You can also buy it in powder or granulated form from the soil treatment section of a garden supply store. Powder makes fluffy ""snow,"" while the granules create slushy ""snow."" Mix in water little by little until you obtain the desired consistency









This may look more realistic if you put it in the freezer.
If it dries out, just add more water. If you want to keep it dry, reduce the amount of water and add salt.

, This melts quickly, so it will only work in a cold room. Pour the crushed ice in a big bowl, then stir in white paint. Add water slowly until the snow reaches the desired consistency.








, With a cup of water and a string, you can grow your own salt crystals. The longer you hang the string in the water, the larger the crystals will be. Arrange these to form clumps of sparkly snow.








, You can use paint to make a surface look like it's been covered with snow. Dip an old brush into any type of white paint. Keep your thumb on the bristles, facing toward the surface. Rub the bristles gently to spray the paint onto the surface.









Don't use a nice new brush, since rubbing the bristles will damage them.

Determine if you and your partner will have children.,
Discuss your finances.,
Talk about your sex life.,
Get to know your partner's family.,
Talk about the importance of religion in your lives.,
Determine if you have the same core values.",How to Decide If You Should Get Married1," You may already know if your partner would like to have children. If one partner wants children and the other does not, it is probably not a good idea to get married. In addition to discussing how many children you would like to have, you should talk about all the other issues that come with children.How will you discipline your children?
At what point in the marriage will you begin having children?
Is adoption or in vitro fertilization an option?
How will you split the child-rearing responsibilities (e.g. feeding, changing diapers, homework, etc.)
Would you be interested in having a nanny?;
, It is important that you talk about money before you get married. Not only do you need to know your partner's current financial situation, you need to know their attitude towards money and their future goals. If you and your partner are not on the same page, you need to develop a plan to get on the same page.The following questions can help you have the discussion:


Do you have any credit card debt?
Do you have student loan debt?
Have you ever filed for bankruptcy?
Are you a co-signer on anyone else's debt?
Will you put all of our money in a joint account? Will you have separate accounts?
Who will be managing the money? Will one partner manage or will you sit down and do it together?
What is your current income?
What are your saving habits?
Have you been planning for retirement?

, Sex is an important part of marriage. Whether you have sex prior to marriage or not, sexual expectations for your marriage should be discussed. How often would you like to have sex (e.g. daily, weekly, etc.) What will you do when one partner wants to have sex and the other one does not? How will you keep the spark going in the long term?Both you and your partner need to be truthful during this conversation. A premarital counselor can help you discuss sex if you and your partner are not able to have the conversation on your own.
What will you do if one person's sex drive greatly increases or decreases?

, You can find out many things about your partner by spending time with their family. Both positive and negative patterns tend to repeat themselves. Once you get married, your partner's family becomes your family as well.For example, if your partner's family yells during arguments, your partner may be a yeller as well.
If your partner's family never ate dinner together, but family dinners are important to you, your partner may not understand why you want to eat together all the time.
Patterns can be broken or worked on, but it will be easier if you know what you are getting yourself into., Religion is deeply personal. You and your partner may practice the same religion, different religions, or no religion at all. You should know the role of religion in your partner's life. If you and your partner practice the same religion, there may not be too much to discuss. However, if you practice different religions or one of you is more devout than the other, you may need to have more conversations.Discuss which religious holidays you will observe and how you will observe them.
Do you expect to go to church together every Sunday? Do you plan to raise your children in this religion?
If you and you partner practice different faiths, consider meeting with an interfaith counselor to work through any issues you may have.

, We often hear the opposites attract, but the most successful marriages happen between people who are similar. This is not to say that you and your partner must have the same interests, hobbies, and personality, but you should have a similar outlook on things such as money, work, children, religion, and sex.If you and your partner do not have the same core values, you may have a more difficult marriage and argue more.
For example, if one partner is a saver and the other is a free spender, the free spender may go out and make a major purchase without telling the other person. The argument then happens about the purchase, but the issue stems from having different attitudes towards money.

Identify how you and your partner fight.,
Think about how reliable your partner has been.,
Consider how well you and your partner communicate.,
Determine if the timing is right.,
Consider why you want to get married.",How to Decide If You Should Get Married2," Conflict is a part of a healthy relationship. You and your partner will not always be on the same page. The way you work through your conflicts indicates the health of your relationship.If you and your partner do not fight fair, you are more likely to have trouble down the road.Yelling, insulting the other person, criticizing the other person, and being aggressive are all destructive fighting behaviors that are not good for your relationship.

Active listening, calmly discussing the problem at hand, and being more positive throughout the argument are constructive ways to fight with your partner.
For example, if you have a disagreement about the dishes piling up, an unfair fight might include calling the other person lazy or useless and bringing up something that is not related to the dirty dishes. Instead the argument may be focused on creating some sort of cleaning schedule or finding out if one partner is feeling overwhelmed by other duties and commitments inside and outside of the home.

, Knowing that you can rely on your partner during the ups and downs of life is a good sign that the person is marriage material. You should be able to cope with your partner as life changes.How has your partner supported you through a tough time (e.g. death in the family, medical issue, work or school stress)?
Is your partner receptive to your help?
Do you know how to support and encourage your partner and vice versa?If your relationship has not been tested in this way, use your knowledge of your partner to imagine how the two of you would handle a tragedy.

, Effective communication is a vital for any successful relationship. You should feel comfortable expressing your wants, needs, and emotions to your partner. Your partner should listen to you and respect your view points. You and your partner should be able to laugh together as well as have those uncomfortable conversations.


If you are afraid or nervous to talk to your partner about certain topics, you may not have the type of open communication that is needed. No topic should be off limits.
You and your partner should not keep secrets from each other. You do not want to enter into a marriage being dishonest., Marriage is best if both individuals feel the timing is right. Both partners should feel ready and desire to get married because they have chosen to do so. Factors such as an unplanned pregnancy, family pressure, or peer pressure may make you want to hurry up and get married. However, these are not good reasons to get married.Timing is everything. You can marry the right person at the wrong time.
It is better to wait than to rush into a marriage.

, You should never be pushed or pressured into getting married before you are ready. Ask yourself why you want to marry this person. Are all of your friends married and you feel like you are behind? Have you been with your partner for a long time and feel like marriage is the next step? Do your parents and family members keep asking you when you are going to tie the knot?Write down all of the reasons that you want to get married right now. You may decide that you are ready to get married or that you do not want to get married. You may also decide that you want to marry your partner, but not right now.
You should get married because you believe that you have found the right partner, that the timing is right, you are ready to take your vows seriously, and marrying your partner is in line with your personal goals.
If you find that the majority of your reasons for getting married are due to external factors or a difficult life situation, marriage may not be the best choice for you.

Marry your best friend.,
Wait until you are at least 20 years old.,
Deal with issues before you get married.",How to Decide If You Should Get Married3," Married people are typically happier and more satisfied in life. If you are best friends with your partner, marriage will have an even greater impact on how satisfied you are with your life.Friendship is the foundation of a good marriage.


Are you and your partner truly friends?
A good friend is supportive, loyal, dependable, and accepts you for the person you are. You can be yourself around the person without fear of judgement.

, If you are a teenager and considering marriage, it is best to wait until you are older to get married. The older you are, the more life experience and wisdom you have. This knowledge can help you have a better marriage.If you get married before you are 20 years old, you greatly decrease your chances of staying married for a long time.If you are a woman, waiting until you are at least 25 years old when you get married decreases your chances of getting divorced or separated during the first 10 years of marriage., The same issues that you and your partner have before marriage will continue once you get married. Marriage is not a problem fixer. Both you and your partner should write down the strengths and weaknesses of your relationship and then discuss the ways you can work on those weaknesses together.


If there are issues that cannot be worked out, it is best to postpone any marriage plans.
Premarital counseling is a great resource that can help prepare you for marriage. This type of therapy helps you assess your relationship and address any concerns."

Accept your husband for who he is.,
Learn about bisexuality.,
Give your relationship a fresh start.,
Talk with your husband about what he wants.",How to Cope With a Bisexual Husband1," Your husband has the same qualities that you fell in love with, and his bisexuality is another quality that you may have recently learned about. It also defines who he is. As your partner, he needs your love and support, and your relationship will remain strong if you can accept him for who he is., Knowing more about bisexuality will help you understand your partner. There is no single model for bisexuality, since each individual is different in his emotions and feelings. A bisexual person is sexually attracted to two genders. This individual likely also loves individuals first, often with less attention to specific gender.There are a lot of myths about bisexuality, which can be harmful to your relationship if you don’t learn how these myths are just that – myths. Your relationship will strengthen if you understand the true nature of your partner’s feelings. Some of these myths are:Myth: A person is either gay or straight, not both.

Humans are complex and can have very different sexual orientations, including heterosexual (attracted to the opposite gender), homosexual (attracted to the same gender), bisexual (attracted to two or more genders), asexual (not attracted to any gender), pansexual (not limited in sexual choice), or skoliosexual (attraction to non-binary identified individuals).Myth: Bisexuals can’t be faithful.

A person can choose to be monogamous. A person’s sexual orientation does not determine his ability or desire to be in a monogamous, faithful relationship. The couple decides what it means to be monogamous.


Myth: Bisexuals have more sexually transmitted diseases.

The rate of STDs does not correlate to a person’s sexual orientation. Rather, it has to do with the individual’s care in protecting himself from STDs.



, Recognize that your relationship has entered into a new phase. If you want the marriage to succeed and continue, you need to be willing to make changes. Your husband is still the same person that you married, but now you know even more about his desires and feelings. Understand that you may need to start fresh, with new boundaries and new expectations about what marriage means for both of you., Your husband may have been struggling with his bisexuality for a long time. If he is just now telling you, he may have been trying to suppress his true feelings. He knows that you two trust and respect each other. He has taken a big step in being honest with you. Now you can take a big step by talking to him about what he wants. What does he want your marriage to be like? Does he want to have other partners? Does he want to remain monogamous? "

Know that communicating about sexuality can be difficult.,
Be open with each other.,
Talk about where you stand on monogamy.,
Set boundaries.,
Determine what you both want to share with family and friends.",How to Cope With a Bisexual Husband2," Both of you may find it difficult to have a conversation about sexuality. For your husband, this might be the first time he’s talked about his bisexuality. He may have been anxious and worried about you finding out, about keeping his feelings a secret, or about what other people will think. As for you, you may undergo worries and anxieties of your own, including feelings of inadequacy, concern about your relationship, or concern for how your family might react.


Being patient and understanding with each other is the best starting place for a conversation. Know that you love each other and want each other to be happy.

, For your relationship to work, you need to communicate honestly with each other. Set aside time every day or every week when the two of you can talk without being interrupted. Talk about your concerns in an open yet supportive way.This might include asking if and when your husband is making connections with other partners.Being bisexual doesn’t mean that your husband will automatically cheat on you. But if he is going to be with other partners, you two should be open about that. Lies and deception are not a good foundation for any marriage.

, When one partner is bisexual, the other partner may worry that the husband will be unfaithful. If your husband wants to be non-monogamous, and you agree to it, then support him in that.Many bisexual partners are in long-term monogamous relationships. Determine what you want for your relationship.

, Determine what you want in your relationship. This may involve setting some ground rules about other partners, or sexual activity that you’re both willing to participate in.Are you okay with your husband being with one other partner, or are multiple partners okay? How much do you want to be involved?

, As you and your husband begin to understand life together in this new phase, you may choose to share some of this information with family and friends. If you have children, think about how you’ll talk with them about bisexuality.


Remember that when you “come out” to your children, have an ongoing conversation about it so that your kids can ask questions and understand your feelings. Be patient and give them time to process the information."
"
Realize that you don’t need to make everything about sexuality.,
Make sure other areas of your life are fun and interesting.,
Explore your own sexual desires.",How to Cope With a Bisexual Husband3," Your lives will still go on, with work pressures, commuting headaches, grocery shopping, and so on. Your everyday life will continue much as it had before your husband told you about his bisexuality.

, Married life is about more than just sexual intimacy. Find hobbies and activities to do together. Travel together. Develop a fulfilling life together in many different ways., An open conversation about your partner’s sexuality and sexual desires is a chance to open up about your own sexual desires. Your husband is still attracted to you and wants you to feel free to explore what excites you.Many partners have experienced a sexual awakening when they find out their husbands are bisexual. Their relationships have grown stronger and more satisfying."

The ribbed hem will eventually make the cuff.;
, You can use kraft paper, wrapping paper, or even a paper bag for this.If you are having trouble getting the shape right, trace a Christmas stocking that you already own, or find a template online.

, Align the top edge of your pattern just above the hem, where the sweater starts. This way, then you fold the hem down to make the cuff, the stocking won't be too short.

, If your sweater is dark-colored, use chalk. Trace right along the outside edges of the pattern, without adding seam allowances. When you are done, set the pattern aside.

, Pin the sweater together, starting just below the hem. Sew it together using a long stitch or a stretch stitch and a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.Do not sew the hem part of the sweater just yet. This way, when you fold the cuff down, you don't see the seams.


Remove the pins as you sew.
If the material is fraying, go back, and sew along the edges (excluding the cuff) with a zigzag stitch.

, Cut the slits just above the start and end of your sewing, where the sweater ends and the hem starts. This will allow you to flip the cuff's seams out and sew them.

, If you need to, use your hands to push the sweater out from the inside, and reshape it. When you are done, your sweater should look like a stocking, with the cuff part un-sewn. Don't worry, you will fix that in a moment.

, Keeping the stocking turned right-side-out, pin the side edges of the cuff so that they are on the outside. Sew along them using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. It may look weird now, but once you fold the cuff down, you won't see the seams.


If the material is fraying a lot, go back, and zigzag stitch over the raw edges.

, This will hide the raw edges and the seams. If you need to, use a few drops of glue to keep the cuff down.

, How long you cut your ribbon or yarn depends on the size of your stocking. Bigger stockings will look better with bigger loops, and smaller stockings will look better with smaller ones. Be sure to use a color that matches your stocking!


If your sweater's collar is narrow enough, you can use that instead.

, If you are using a sweater collar, sew the ends of the collar together.

, Attach it about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) below the top edge of the stocking.


Don't have a needle and thread, or don't know how to sew? Use hot glue or fabric glue instead.

, Crochet a long chain using yarn in a matching or contrasting color. Tie it around the hanging loop of your stocking using a slipknot. Make two pompoms out of yarn, then glue them to each end of the cord.


Don't know how to crochet? Braid three pieces of yarn together instead.
Don't know how to make pompoms? Use store-bought ones instead.
Weave the cord around the bottom edge of the cuff instead for a different look.

Lead by example.,
Respect your partner.,
Speak uplifting words.,
Listen.,
Enjoy yourself.,
Offer a sense of security.",How to Convince Your Spouse to Follow Your Expectations," Your partner will observe your habits and behaviors and begin to imitate them. If you ignore your spouse and let your temper fly off the hook, your spouse will react poorly to you. If you show respect and affection, your partner will return the same to you. Make decisions that are in the best interest of both. No person can be ordered to do the bidding of another, but he or she may consent to follow in a loving relationship.;
, Your spouse did not vow to become your slave. You did not promise to follow his or her bidding either. When your spouse does not do as you wish, you should always respond with respect and love, never hostility. When you were married, you made certain vows of loyalty: to honor, love, cherish and so on. By your selfless behavior, convince your spouse of your sincere loyalty and respect.

, Never put down your spouse. Support your partner in public and in private. Speak words of blessing, never find fault. When you ask your partner to do something, use a tone of voice filled with respect and affection. Use words that allow your partner to make his or her own decision, and not feel coerced or manipulated. Speak as you want your partner to speak to you.

, The true secret of effective communication is not knowing how to express yourself, but learning attentiveness. When your spouse begins to speak, say, ""Just a moment."" Turn off all distractions, face your partner, make eye contact, then say, ""Go ahead. I'm listening."" It is possible to hear words and not actually be listening mentally. Listen to both the words and intent of your partner. Listen as you want your partner to listen to you.


When listening to your spouse, aim to understand their point of view. Understand the whole story before passing judgment or offering an idea.
Saying things like ""I see,"" ""Please continue,"" or ""I hear you"" signals to your spouse that you are listening, without requiring you to commit to an opinion.

, Lighten up. If every moment of every day is heavy and somber, you need to consider changing your style of approach to subjects. Spend time with your spouse when you do not discuss ""business"". Designate a time of day or place that you talk only about personal matters. Your partner needs a break from decision-making in order to make clear-headed decisions.

, Build a home environment where it is safe to disagree. Encourage your spouse to experience personal development and independent growth. A healthy relationship is not about dominance of one person or bending the will of another, but individuals coming to an agreement to submit to each other.

, If it is something like ""because I'm too tired to do all this work at my desk"", then kindly suggest that they have their priorities out of whack.

Same goes for being ""too sick"", ""too excited about something online"", ""too engrossed""; there is a time and place for everything!

, Let your spouse know that you don't like having the laptop in bed with the two of you, and that you consider the bedroom is not the place for a computer. Check out wikiHow's article on having a zen bedroom for some good ammunition for your discussion. Tell your spouse that you're concerned about the health implications of having electronic equipment so near, of having quiet time interrupted by an electronic gadget in a place of peace that you'd like to see work-free.

, Maybe your spouse has nowhere to sit with the laptop that is comfortable and relaxing; if so, consider purchasing a good chair and appropriate desk. If your spouse cites too much work as the reason, it is a good opportunity to suggest prioritising the workload and not bringing it to bed, to make a space between work and bedtime. Your spouse may not quite see what a workaholic they have become, or how much they are blurring the lines between being engrossed online and paying respect to a vital, daily ritual of bedtime.

, If your spouse is really adamant that there is nothing wrong with bringing the laptop to bed, consider compromising on weekend morning laptop lie-ins, or something similarly less intrusive. Insist, however, that bedtime is bedtime, and this does not involve sitting in bed with a laptop.

, Think about why your spouse wants to bring the laptop to bed instead of talking to you, or enjoying the time together. Perhaps it's time to re-inject a little fun into your bedtime routine...

Mention your biological clock.",How to Convince Your Husband to Have a Baby1," One thing you may want to think about before you talk to your husband about having a baby is any previous conversations you have had about them. This may be information you can use to help your case.


Did he say he wanted children before you got married? Did he say he never wanted children? If he said he wanted children, you can discuss this knowledge with him. If he said he never wanted to have children, you should discuss how you believed he would change his mind after being married for awhile.;
, During the process of convincing your husband to have a baby, schedule a block of time each week to discuss the prospect of a child. This achieves a few different things for both of you.


You both have time to step away and collect your thoughts before you talk again. You can even write down points to make, counterpoints, or new reasons to try to convince him.
Stepping away gives you both a chance to get your emotions and anger under control. This helps you be able to think logically and convince him calmly and rationally instead of getting emotional and angry and pushing him away from the idea.
Talking about it during a set time helps you refrain from nagging him. If you keep pushing him all day every day, you may convince him not to have a baby instead.

, If your husband is hesitant about having another child, ask him about his reservations. Figure out why he is hesitant. His fears may be valid, like if you are not in a financially stable place. Talk to your husband and find out what he’s scared of.Make sure to listen to what your husband says. Though you may want to have a baby, his feelings are just as valid as yours. Don’t dismiss his thoughts just because you want a baby.
If you believe you can have a baby despite his fears, discuss this with him. Come up with ways to make it work for your current situation.

, During your discussion about having a child, you should listen to your husband. While it may be hard to listen when he’s so against something you want, you are both partners for one another. He is one-half of the marriage and deserves to be heard.Ask him why he doesn’t want children. Don’t argue, but listen to his reasons without interruption.
Be polite to each other when listening to each other’s wants and feelings. Be respectful and don’t be judgmental about your husband’s opinions.
It may be difficult to stay calm when you are emotional about having a child. If you get too upset and start crying, that's okay. Take a few deep breaths before speaking. If needed, get up and take a brief walk around the house to diffuse your anger.

, Let your husband know that you have concerns about having a baby. Even if you want a baby, there are still concerns about bringing another member into the family. Sharing your fears may help reassure your husband and make him not feel so alone.Tell your husband if you are worried about how it will change the family dynamic, affect your other children, or how it will affect your finances.
Bring up all the other changes that may happen in your marriage, such as changes in your relationship.

, You need to show your husband that the two of you can successfully have a baby. One thing that may hold people back from expanding a family is finances. When you are broaching the subject with your husband, show him evidence that you are financially sound.

Be patient.",How to Convince Your Husband to Have a Baby2," Most men have dreams of teaching their children how to play their favorite sports. Others may dream of taking their kids hunting and fishing or working on cars together. Whatever your husband’s interests, use it to your advantage. Mention your future kids to him while he’s participating in his favorite activity to get him thinking about passing it on to his kids.For example, if your husband is into baseball, watch a baseball game with him. During the game, mention how great it would be to teach your children how to play baseball, dress them in a onesie with his favorite team’s logo on it, or take them to games.

, If you want a child, start discussing with your husband the exciting possibilities your future holds. Talk to him about what you’re looking forward to about having a child. Come up with stories and ideas about what you think your family will be like and what you think your child will be like.Ask him how he might feel teaching his kid to drive or watching his baby start walking.
Talk to him about what it might feel like to hear his baby say “Da-da” for the first time. Ask him about how it will feel to have a daddy’s girl or a son to bear his name.

, Give your husband time to adjust to the idea of having a child if he is reluctant. Having a child is a huge decision, even if you have children already. People come to huge life decisions at different speeds. You may be ready, and he may be in the future. Be supportive and understanding as you continue talking about having a kid.If you love your husband no matter his decision about kids, tell him that.
If you want to give him an ultimatum because you don’t want to be with him if you don’t have a baby, you should think about consulting a marriage counselor.

Avoid deliberately skipping birth control.,
Refrain from talking about babies all the time.,
Enjoy the family you have at the moment.",How to Convince Your Husband to Have a Baby3," Though you may want to have a baby despite your husband’s wishes, you should never skip birth control so you accidentally get pregnant. This type of behavior can lead to a lot of problems in your relationship, and further convince your husband not to have a baby.Lying about your birth control or manipulating your husband can lead to trust issues. The risk of getting pregnant is not worth potentially serious problems in your marriage.

, If you want to have a baby, you need to discuss it with your husband. However, try not to bring it up every second of every day. Nagging your husband about the baby is going to accomplish nothing but pushing him farther away from the idea.If your husband is resistant, leave it alone for a bit, then return to it later.

, Pressuring your husband for a baby won’t make anyone happy. Obsessing about wanting a baby when your husband doesn’t may lead to resentment or feelings of pressure that may lead him to never wanting a baby. Instead, focus on the family you have at the moment.Having a good, strong family now may convince your husband that he wants to expand it in the future.
If you already have one kid, enjoy the child you have. Let your husband enjoy that child. He may eventually decide he wants to add to the family.
If you don’t have children yet, having a strong marriage and being happy may lead him to wanting to expand the family.

Have compassion for your spouse's point of view.,
Hear your spouse out.,
Temper your reactions.,
Try mirroring.,
Give your partner the benefit of the doubt.,
Make eye contact and touch each other.,
Initiate intimacy.",How to Communicate to Save Your Marriage1," When you're feeling angry, isolated, or worn out, it can be difficult to see beyond your own problems. Your needs aren't being met. you feel you're giving more than you're getting, and you're at the end of your rope. But what about your spouse? How does he or she feel? As difficult as can be to wrench your mind from your problems to someone else's, this step is essential for better communication.


If it's hard to know how your spouse is feeling, ask yourself how you'd feel if you were him or her. How would you feel if you had your spouse's difficult work demands? How would you feel if your commute took 2 hours a day? For every obstacle your spouse is dealing with, ask yourself how it would make you feel.
Look at how your own behavior affects your partner. Is it possible that your behaviors are affecting your partner in a negative way? Every time you feel the urge to make a critical remark, put yourself in his or her shoes first. For example, when you give him or her the cold shoulder, think about what it would be like if your spouse ignored you when you walked in the door.;
, Communication is as much about listening as it is about expressing yourself. When your spouse tries to explain something to you, do you listen? Listening means really hearing what someone's saying and doing your best to understand his or her point of view. In doing this, you can take the conversation to a deeper, more intimate and honest level.


If your mind is running a mile a minute while your spouse is talking, and you're thinking up retorts before he or she finishes talking, you aren't really listening. Put your own feelings aside while your partner is talking.
Use encouraging body language to help your partner feel heard. Face him or her and have a pleasant open expression. Don't frown or act bored. You might be doing this without even realizing the effect you're having.

, Try to take the time to think before you speak. Think about the consequences of what you're about to say. Think about how to frame your words so that they are clear and honest, but not hurtful. Lashing out, interrupting, leaving the room, and shutting down are all unproductive reactions that will cut off communication instead of fostering it.

, Sometimes people have difficulty completely understanding what their partner is trying to get across. It's easy to misinterpret someone's words and end up feeling angry or hurt, and in the meantime your partner is baffled at your response. Mirroring is a practice that can help resolve this issue. After your spouse tells you how he or she feels, repeat your interpretation of what he or she said. Your partner should then acknowledge that that's what he or she meant. Have your partner mirror you as well. This will help you understand each other's communication styles better.


If one partner says, ""I feel left out when you go out on Fridays and leave me to stay home by myself."" The mirror response would be, ""What I hear you saying is that you feel lonely when I go out with my buddies on Fridays. I can understand how that would feel.""
If one partner says, ""You always say something critical when I try something new."" The mirror response would be, ""I hear you saying that I can be overly critical. I can understand how that would make you feel hesitant to try new things.""

, This is the person you married. Trust, honesty, and good intentions are the foundation of your relationship. Believe your partner when he or she tells you something, even if it's hard to swallow. Believing someone else's words helps that person feel heard, respected and loved.


Believe in your partner's feelings and emotions. Believe in his or her decisions. Respect his or her way of doing things, from handling problems at work to putting the kids to bed to cleaning the bathroom and making the bed.
If dishonesty has crept into your relationship, if you disagree with your partner on a fundamental level, or if you have good reason not to give him or her the benefit of the doubt, there are deep problems at hand. Seek marriage counseling so that you have the right tools for rebuilding trust.

, When your partner confides in you, look into his or her eyes. Move closer to him or her on the sofa. These physical expressions of intimacy will help your spouse feel more comfortable talking. Anger and disrespect are less likely to take hold of the conversation when you're feeling physically close.


You can communicate without speaking, too. Pull your spouse closer for a hug, or rest your feet on his or her lap. Not everything has to be spoken aloud.

, Having regular sex can help you and your partner feel close and compatible again. It will help you release tension and remember your love for one another. If you've been having communication problems, it might be hard to make the move. You might be afraid you'll be rejected. But if you don't give it a try, you'll drift further and further apart. The longer you wait, the harder it will be.


Make your partner feel safe and cared for. Don't bring up problems or pick fights when you're lying in bed together. That's your time to connect on a level that's deeper than life's daily annoyances or long-term obstacles. Protect that time.

Be open with your partner.,
Time important conversations wisely.,
Keep your emotions in check.,
Know the right way to argue.,
Begin your statements with ""I,"" not ""you."",
Say more positive things than negative things.,
Resist the urge to win.,
Lighten things up sometimes.,
Never dig out past conflicts, no matter how tempted you are.,
Don’t hesitate to say “I am sorry.” These are the wonder words that make your partner lose all anger.",How to Communicate to Save Your Marriage2," When you keep your problems or worries secret, they'll begin to build in your mind and become a wall between you and your spouse. You don't have to tell your partner every little worry, but when something is important, keeping it to yourself will eventually backfire. When you're open with your partner, you can work on ways to solve the problem together.


You know the difference between an insignificant matter and one that deserves your partner's attention. Be honest with yourself, even if it's difficult.
Depending on what your partner is like, there could be an actual drawback to saying too much. If your partner is the quiet type who doesn't like to discuss every little thing, be mindful of this and don't make mountains out of molehills.

, If you bring up an important issue at the wrong time, what could have been an intimate, productive discussion could quickly escalate into an argument. Don't try to have an important conversation when one of you is in a hurry, tired, hungry, or distracted. If it seems like one of these factors is always at play, try setting aside time for having a quiet talk. Make sure both of you come to the conversation ready to communicate.


Catching your partner off guard with bad news or a heavy topic can actually cause a physical reaction: the overproduction of the stress hormone cortisol. Your partner will feel flooded with anxiety, making it very difficult for him or her to participate calmly in a conversation.Consider planning a daily or weekly event during which you and your partner have time to talk without distractions. Weekend mornings or evenings after dinner are both good choices.
If your partner isn't in the mood to talk, don't force it. Ask if you can plan a later time to have the discussion instead.

, If you tend to break down crying right away or get flustered and angry during intimate conversations, your partner will come to dread them. Don't try to have a talk when you're feeling anxious and upset; wait until you feel calm and centered. You don't want to transfer your negative emotions to your partner - that's a recipe for an argument.


This is not to say that it's never ok to express your emotions with your partner - of course it is! Being emotionally closed off is just as bad or worse than expressing too much emotion. But keeping your feelings in check rather than dumping them all at once can help you get on the same wavelength when you're trying to communicate about something important.
Do your best not to yell at your partner in anger. Not only is this unproductive, it can make your partner feel afraid.

, Every married couple has arguments. It's when they spiral out of control into personal attacks and accusations that they become toxic to the relationship. It's very important to express yourself reasonably and respectfully when you're arguing. Never resort to screaming, name calling, or expressing disgust for your partner. You'll be doing the type of damage that's extremely hard to repair.


You know your partner's buttons; don't push them. Keep them completely off limits, no matter how angry and upset you are. The goal is not to hurt your partner, it's to make yourself understood. Being mean isn't going to help that happen.
There are a few things you should never utter to your spouse. Don't say ""I hate you."" Don't say ""Let's just get a divorce."" Don't say ""I never loved you."" Don't say any of those words unless you actually mean them, because once you say them you can't take them back, and you can bet your partner will never forget.

, Nothing brings on an argument faster than an accusation that begins with the word ""you."" ""You didn't pay that bill."" ""You didn't call when you said you would."" ""You messed up again."" This phrasing puts people on the defensive, flushed with bad feelings, and they usually react by upping the ante or closing down communication - neither of which is a positive outcome. So when there's a matter you want to bring up, phrase it in a way that doesn't sound accusatory. Here are a few examples:


""I noticed that bill hasn't been paid. Would you mind doing that this afternoon?""
""I understand how busy you've been, but I would really appreciate it if you'd help with the kids this weekend.""

, Research has shown that couples who say more positive things than negative things to their partners have stronger, longer-lasting marriages.For every criticism, have five nice things to say. Maybe it will feel like a struggle at first, but once you get in the habit, saying nice things to your partner will remind you both of the love you share.


Compliment your partner on things he or she did well.
Say something nice about his or her personality, like ""You're always optimistic. I love that about you.""
Say something sweet about his or her body.
Say ""I love you.""

, You and your spouse are on the same team. You joined in marriage because you wanted to face the world together, not make it harder for each other. There's really no such thing as ""winning"" a mean-spirited argument. Even if you successfully got your way, you lost, because being competitive with your partner erodes trust and chips away at a relationship's foundation.Even when you know you're right and your partner's wrong, you shouldn't take satisfaction in his or her ""defeat."" Instead, come back together and reassess your priorities so they're aligned again.

, Couples that laugh together and have fun together keep the spark alive for much longer than those who don't.Life is full of troubles, but it's important to focus more on the joy together. There's light to be found in even the darkest moments. If you're not one to joke around, your partner will be pleasantly surprised when you start making an effort to bring laughter into your relationship.

, There's nothing either of you can do about something that happened in the past. All you can do is change your future behavior. Don't dwell!

, In fact, it leaves no room for further debate. Be willing to concede when you were in the wrong. Stubbornness isn't going to help your relationship.

Establish healthy patterns early on.,
Practice self-respect first.,
Set ground rules for interaction.,
Use assertive communication.,
Get to know your spouse as a unique individual with a unique communication style.,
Try new activities together.,
Eliminate negative comments to each other.,
Realize that healthy relationships do have fights and disagreements.,
Prepare for a new baby.,

Avoid reactive communication.,
Attempt to empathize.,
Recognize that relationships change.,
Reassess what it means to ""win"" a fight.",How to Communicate With Your Spouse," Humans are creatures of habit, and once we fall into relationship patterns, it can be hard to change later on. Establishing healthy communication patterns when dating or even just friends can set a pattern for success later on.Our standards and expectations for relationships are formed early in childhood, and it is important to recognize influences on our communicative styles. Think about the type of family dynamics in you and your partner's homes growing up. Did your parents tend to yell every time they disagreed? Did they quietly fume and let resentment build up over time? Did they rationally and calmly debate through disagreements? While each couple has its own style for arguments, these styles can become patterns for their children, who carry them over into their own relationships down the line--whether or not they are healthy.View every relationship as a chance to model health communication patterns. Friendships and dating relationships, even those that are not serious or long-term, can be great for shaping our communication personalities.;
, While we often think about the importance of respecting others, in relationships respect has to extend to ourselves first.Learn to ask for what you need. We enter relationships because we have social, emotional, and physical needs. Those needs cannot be met fully unless your partner knows what they are, and although they may seem obvious to you, they may not be obvious to your partner.
Learn to say no. If you are being asked to overextend your time or resources, or if you are being asked to do things you are not comfortable with or that do not interest you, it is ok to say no. A good and loving partner will respect your ""no"" answer as much as your ""yes,"" and will not pressure or coerce you to do things you are not comfortable with. It's ok to need a break or time to yourself.

, Both partners must be on the same page in order to develop healthy patterns of communication, so these rules should reinforce mutual respect and reciprocity in communication and need to be enforced strictly. Some examples might include:


Absolutely no physical violence, pushing, or altercations. This must be non-negotiable!
No cursing or demeaning language. This includes any basic insults and curse words, but also particular phrases or terms that are particularly offensive because of the context in which they are used (for instance, a woman who has a poor relationship with her mother might find it particularly insulting to be called ""just like her mom,"" or a man who struggles with his self-confidence because of his body might find it hurtful to be said he is ""weak"").Studies show that couples who use abusive language report less satisfaction with their marriages and less accurately recall each other's behavior after a fight.Learn to *not* say what is on your mind. Editing your thoughts before you speak is an important sign of maturity, but something that can be very hard in relationships with those we are close to. We tend to feel that we are safe to say all the things on our mind. But sometimes those things are hurtful and would better be left unsaid. Personal jabs and hurtful comments are almost always better edited out of your comments.Make it a habit to say ""I love you"" every day. It might seem cliche, but saying ""I love you"" daily is a great habit to reinforce the relationship on a regular basis.
Accept ""time-outs"" or cooling off periods as a matter of course. If two people are angry, many things can be said in the heat of the moment that will be regretted later. Instead, agree on a cooling off period if things get heated, and revisit the issue later when cooler heads prevail.

, Assertive communication is an effective and diplomatic form of communication that is based upon a mutual respect for one another. It is direct and respectful. When you use assertive communication, you create win-win situations, improve communication, and build honest relationships. To communicate assertively, use ""I"" statements, keep your voice calm and firm, and maintain eye contact., There are endless combinations of possible histories, personality traits, intelligence levels, cultural discrepancies, pet peeves, tendencies, and styles that can contribute to the way two people relate.


It is often (but not always) the case that men and women have distinct communication styles. Men are often said to be quiet, logical, and contemplative, while women are considered to be more emotional and prefer to speak their minds. Of course this is an oversimplification, but points to the unique styles individuals often have: one spouse may prefer to communicate by saying everything on his or her mind, while the other may prefer to think about the issues and then briefly discuss the pros and cons. Neither way is ""right,"" but because spouses are partners, they will need to openly discuss expectations for communication and come up with strategies that will work for both partners.
Similarly, cultural differences between two people can lead to differing communication styles, which can create difficulty if both parties don't understand the differences. In some cultures, men are expected to be standoffish and gruff, and displays of emotion are considered weakness and the purview of women. In other cultures, men as well as women are expected to relate on emotional levels, and sharing feelings is not a sign of weakness.
Learn to appreciate the distinct things about your spouse that make them who they are, instead of viewing it as simply obstacles to greater marital harmony.

, Couples who engage in novel activities by trying new things together report higher satisfaction even after the end of the ""honeymoon period"" (or early marriage).These couples also have things to talk about that don't involve the mortgage payment or problems at work, which can make interpersonal communication more enjoyable and less stressful.


Some exciting activities to try can include couples painting sessions at a local art studio, picking up a new co-ed recreational sport, exploring a new type of ethnic cuisine through cooking lessons or restaurant excursions, dance classes at the local YMCA, or volunteer work at the local food bank or animal rescue center. Activities don't have to be expensive or adrenaline-inducing to keep up interest in a relationship; they just need to be novel.

, Instead of saying negative things to one another, strive to communicate positively, assertively, honestly, and respectfully with each other.


Common niceties like ""I love you,"" ""Good morning,"" and ""Have a great day"" count toward the positive total, so building natural and encouraging talk into your day can be a good way to increase these positive interactions.
Try a positive text message or voicemail once a week to boost your spouse's mood and increase your positive interactions.

, Even in the heat of an argument, try to include positive statements and compliments. Some examples of positive statements are:


""I appreciate that you cook dinner after a long work day.""
""I value your patience with my parents.""
""I was very grateful that you were able to go to the parent-teacher conference without me when my meeting ran late.""

, Certain life situations are known to cause strain and stress on a relationship, so open communication in anticipation of these times can help to prevent significant turmoil. The number one cause of marital struggle is not money, as most people think, but actually the addition of a baby to the family. This is due to a combination of lack of sleep, disruption of family schedules and routines, hormonal disturbances (for both men and women), and the uncertainty and fear that can come with such an enormous responsibility.Strategies to fortify a relationship during strained times include:


Arrange counseling sessions during the prenatal period. Counseling services should be obtained through licensed counselors. Having a trusted third person can help you to talk through your expectations for the postnatal period and the parenting relationship. Many couples find that they are unprepared to deal with differences of opinion about baby-rearing; for instance, in those early days when everyone is suffering from a lack of sleep, many couples find themselves fighting over who should get up for a middle of the night feeding or whether or not to allow the baby to cry itself to sleep. Discussing these scenarios beforehand and deciding how to handle disagreements in the heat of the moment can ward off unnecessary fighting.
Counseling can also help both partners understand their roles in a changing relationship. As a baby is added to a family, dynamics necessarily shift. For instance, a father may not understand the physical and emotional toll that giving birth puts on a mother, and a mother may not understand the emotional and psychological changes that take place in a new father.
If counseling is not available or out of the budget, read through a trusted parenting book (get recommendations from friends, family, or clergy). Highlight parts you particularly agree or disagree with for discussion, and talk through these and any discussion questions in the book.

, Humans change constantly throughout their lives, so its important that you keep up with who your spouse is becoming. Because just living with someone is not enough to guarantee that you truly get to know them, you must be intentional about this process.


Ask each other questions like ""What goals do you want to accomplish in the next year?"", ""How do you see yourself differently now than when we met?"" and ""What fears do you have about the next ten years?""
Set aside time each week for a date -- it does not have to be out of the house! Even 30 minutes during the baby's nap can be a great chance to reconnect.

, Reactive communication describes a common tendency during arguments for one or both partners to ""shut down"" mentally and stop listening to the things the other person is saying. It is an automatic response that becomes a habit because it tends to be easier to simply disengage than to engage in meaningful discussions on hard and emotional topics.


Avoid making decisions or pronouncements during reactive communication. Your brain is on autopilot and you might say things you don't mean, sometimes hurting your spouse or even ending a relationship.
If you feel yourself disengaging, ask for a brief cooling off period. Collect your thoughts, calm down, and re-engage in the conversation when you are feeling more in control of yourself.

, Remember that your partner does not view the world through the same lens you do, and is likely to perceive problems and situations in a very different way. Some things that are issues for you might not even be on your spouse's register.


Imagine the scenario from your spouse's perspective. Think, ""How would I view this situation if I were him/her, and how would I want my spouse to talk to me about it?""

, As individuals change and relationships move through stages, you might find that your needs or your spouse's needs change over time as well. Be sure to check in periodically to reassess whether your relationship is meeting one another's needs.Does your spouse feel that they are heard? Do you? What factors prevent you from feeling fully heard and understood?
Does your spouse feel satisfied with the amount that you share about your thoughts, experiences, and emotions? Do you? When and what might they share more?

, In a marriage, if someone ""loses"" in a fight, both people lose. A marriage is a partnership and both people need to feel validated and valued.


Fights and disagreements are inevitable, but train yourself to think that the optimal result is a ""win-win"" situation-- one in which both parties feel heard.Sometimes winning will look like a compromise. Other times your spouse will concede to your point, and sometimes you will concede to theirs. Its important that one person is not always ""winning"" fights by getting their way.

Even small daily interactions are important to healthy communication. Make sure to communicate small matters effectively from one day to the next.You may forget to communicate in the shuffle of day-to-day obligations. You may be caught up in your own worries or concerns over dinner or get caught up in your own hobbies at night.
Prioritize communication. The small daily bits of conversation matter. Make a point of asking your spouse how his or her day was. Share tiny details from your day as well. Day-to-day details can help reinforce your sense of commitment and affection. This can be as simple as saying something like, ""How was your day?"" when your spouse gets home.;
, You want to make sure that, when conflicts do arise, you and your spouse feel comfortable addressing these issues. One way to achieve this is by using daily communication to create a positive, safe atmosphere in which you both feel comfortable expressing yourselves.Fostering positivity does not have to be hard. It comes down to basic manners. Speak to your spouse with courtesy. Always remember things like ""please"" and ""thank you"" when speaking to your spouse so you avoid taking him or her for granted.
You should avoid negativity, even when your spouse is not present. Avoid venting frustrations about your spouse to others. Strive to speak of him or her in as positive a tone as possible.

, Relationships are based around respecting one another's emotional wants and needs. During daily communication, always share your basic wants with your partner.Some wants are easy to express. For example, you may find it easy to share when you want to have dinner or how you want to spend the weekend. Other wants can be more difficult to express, but they're vital to a healthy marriage.
Difficult wants can include things like wanting more affection in a marriage, or wanting a change in your sex life. Learn to express these wants instead of letting resentment build over time. The more authentic you are with your spouse, the closer to the two of you will feel.
Do not be afraid to pipe up when you have a want you need to express. For example, you can say something like, ""I sometimes feel like you don't ask about my day, even when I ask about yours. I would like it if you asked me how my day was more often.""

, Just as you want your spouse to respect your wants, you want to offer respect in return. Make sure you listen as much as you talk as you strive for healthier communication with your spouse.Put aside your point of view when your spouse talks. Do not think about how you're going to respond, or how you might defend yourself from criticism. Remember, listening is not about you. It's about the other person.
Empathize as your partner talks. Try to put yourself in his or her shoes and identify with how they're feeling. This way, you'll be better equipped to address the situation and change as necessary.
Practice active listening. Nod as your spouse talks. Ask questions if you don't understand something. When your spouse finishes a sentence, offer a brief summary. For example, ""I'm hearing you're a little stressed at work?""

, Physical communication is just as important as verbal communication. Show your partner you care by expressing love through physical affection.Do small things throughout the day. Hold your partner's hand. Kiss your partner on occasion. When the two of you are watching television together, do not hesitate to spoon your partner.
Perform random acts of service. For example, you could do the dishes or make the bed if these are things that your spouse usually does. This is a good way to show affection for your spouse.

, Oftentimes, a sense of competitiveness can get in the way of healthy communication. When preparing to talk over a conflict, try to let go of any feelings of competitiveness. Remember, the point is not to win. The point is to effectively talk over an issue with your spouse.Consider why you need to win. If you're insecure by nature, this may increase your need to win arguments and conflicts. You may also struggle with vulnerability. Be aware of these flaws so you can work on consciously letting go of your need to win.
Remember, winning will not make you feel satisfied. You will gain satisfaction from fostering a healthier relationship with your spouse and not through meaningless competition.

, You want to make sure you're ready to address an issue. Stop and ask yourself a series of questions to make sure you're going into the conversation with the right attitude.Do you want to connect with your partner better? Are you curious about your partner's perspective? Do you care how your partner may feel?
Make sure your goal is to reach a better understanding of your partner and not to convince him or her to agree with you. Go into the conversation in the spirit of cooperation rather than competition.

, Apologies are important for communication, and in a marriage. When addressing an issue, you may inadvertently hurt your partner's feelings. Your partner may also want to talk to you about something you did or said that hurt their feelings. Make sure to be receptive. You will not gain anything by being defensive.Remember, you do not need to intend to be hurtful to hurt someone. Just because you didn't mean anything by a certain statement or gesture, it could have hurt your spouse's feelings. Offer a sincere apology, regardless of your intentions.
You can say something as simple as, ""I'm really sorry that I hurt you. I'll try to be do better in the future.""

, These are statements framed in a way that emphasize personal feeling over objective fact. ""I""-statements have three parts. They begin with, ""I feel.."" after which you immediately state your feeling. Then, you state the action that led to that feeling. Lastly, you explain why you feel the way you do.For example, in frustration you may be inclined to say something like, ""It drives me crazy that you give me such a hard time when I go out with my friends. I feel completely smothered.""
You can rephrase that statement using an ""I""-statement to make it sound less judgmental. For example, ""I feel smothered when you get mad at me for seeing my friends because I need my own separate social life to feel happy and fulfilled.""

, It's okay to pause an argument. In fact, if you and your spouse are beginning to feel hostile, agree to take a break. Communicate this clearly. Say something like, ""I'm getting frustrated and I feel like we're not getting anywhere. I'm going to go for a walk and we can talk more when I get back."" Sometimes, a little space can allow you to regroup and calm down. You can then better address the issue later., After discussing an issue, ask yourself how you can improve in the future. You should always be willing to compromise and make changes to improve your marriage.Try to understand your spouse's point of view. What do they want you to change and why? What small changes can you make to make their life easier?
Find a way to make your spouse feel more valued and show that you heard their concerns. For example, maybe your spouse is concerned you don't value them as much as your friends. Try planning a date night for you and your spouse in addition to making plans with friends over the weekend.

, Yelling is never an effective means to communicate. In frustration, your voice may rise. You may think yelling adds passion and clarity, but in reality it just creates a tense situation. You set your partner up to be defensive rather than receptive.Be aware of the tone of your voice. Remember, your words should speak volumes and not your tone. Just because you're expressing anger or frustration does not mean you have to do so loudly.
Remember, you can always take a break. Try to do some exercise, like go for a walk. This can release tension and decrease the sense you need to yell.
Don’t call your spouse names either. This can be hurtful and it is not an effective way to communicate.

, Remember, you want to build your partner up. Everyone gets frustrated with their spouse, but try not to communicate with a constant stream of criticism. Try not to blame your spouse for things either. Negativity from criticizing and casting blame can build up over time and this may prevent effective communication.Everyone has bad habits. You may get frustrated if your partner, say, forgets to take the garbage out habitually or has a tendency to zone out at dinner.
When you start to feel frustrated about your partner's bad habits, make a list of their good habits in your mind. This will help you remember why you value them.

, The silent treatment is never a good option for dealing with conflict. You do not want to abruptly end a conversation, storm out of a room, or just withdraw physically or emotionally. Even when you're feeling frustrated, strive to keep conversation open., You do not want to become defensive when criticized. If your spouse dislikes how you're doing something, be receptive to what they're saying. Instead of making excuses and putting up a defense, make an honest effort to see their perspective.Remember, a simple apology can easily patch up a misunderstanding. For example, ""I'm sorry. I really didn't mean it that way, but I can understand why that's what you heard. I'll try to be more conscientious next time.""

Know him well.,
Talk to your friends.,
Meet each other's family.,
Live together first.,
Make sure not to rush into marriage.",How to Choose a Husband2," This is the most important factor in choosing a husband. Your choice must be well-educated. Make sure you know his personality, temperament, and goals before considering marriage.


If your partner is guarded, wait until he opens up to you. This may take some time but is a crucial aspect of a healthy, lasting relationship.
Some people marry men who they see as having the potential to be the perfect husband. This is often a mistake. While personal growth is always hoped for, it is never guaranteed. Marry the man you love now rather than one you think you can create., Your friends will be your most important sounding board when things start to get serious. Ask them for their opinions on your potential husband. If you consider them to be good judges of character, ask them if they have any reservations about him and take their words seriously. Don't worry if they have only minor or superficial issues with him, such as his appearance or career.

, If you have a close relationship with your family and they don't get along with your partner, this could be a bad sign. While it's normal for there to be some friction between a spouse and the ""in-laws,"" if your family has serious reservations, find out what they are. Address any significant problems before tying the knot.


Likewise, if he maintains contact with his own family but still doesn't want you to meet them well into your relationship, this could be major issue. Talk to him about it directly before taking things to the next level.

, Moving in together for a time before marriage can give you a better idea about what marriage to him will be like without making a much more significant commitment.However, make sure your relationship is healthy and well-established before moving in together. Cohabitation, just like marriage, can prevent couples who should split from doing so to avoid the hassle.Premarital cohabitation is considered immoral by many religions. If it goes against your faith, don't feel pressured into doing it.

, Ideally, the two of you should have been dating and/or engaged for at least two to three years. That is not to say that marriages with a shorter courtship are doomed to fail; only that most serious, potentially marriage-destroying issues will have shown themselves in two to three years.Remember that divorces can take a very long time to finalize and are often extremely costly, both financially and emotionally.

"
"
Make sure your values match.,
Find out how he feels about children.,
Take financial considerations into account.,
Discuss any chronic health issues either of you may have.,
Keep an eye out for red flags.",How to Choose a Husband3," This type of compatibility is why getting to know your partner is of utmost importance. Watch out if either of you feels passionate about an issue, whether it be religious or political in nature, that the other disagrees with. It may not be much of a problem now but will likely result in serious friction down the road. This is especially important if you choose to have children.


Another type of value to keep in mind is lifestyle. Make sure you have similar goals about how your life should be in the future. One partner shouldn't want to be a world traveler while the other prefers to stay put. If one partner demands a luxurious lifestyle while another prefers a more humble existence, they may not be right for each other. Unlike issue-based disagreements, these are not generally deal breakers for a relationship, only signs that you aren't ready for marriage just yet.

, It's best if you and your husband want a similar number of children in the same general time frame. It's a bad sign if one partner doesn't want kids, while the other wants a large family. Likewise, if you want time to establish your career first while your husband wants to be a father right away, you should probably hold off on marriage. This is another factor that you may feel will simply resolve itself when in reality will likely be a major source of marital strife.

, This does not mean that you should marry a man for his money. However, if he has a large amount of debt, things may not bode well for your financial future. Additionally, if his credit rating is poor, you will need to rely on yours alone if you decide to buy a house.Make sure you are comfortable with these factors before you get engaged.

, Like financial problems, medical issues, both physical and mental, can seriously impact a marriage. Caring for an ill spouse is often extremely taxing, both emotionally and financially. By being informed, you will be able to make an educated decision about your future.


Knowing his family's health history is also very important if you choose to have biological children together. Even if he is currently healthy, he may be a carrier for serious conditions. This is especially relevant if the same illnesses run in your own family.Marriage has a positive effect on one's health, with married people on average living longer and experience less severe medical problems. However, divorce has the opposite outcome, further demonstrating the importance of picking the right man before marrying., If he is emotionally withdrawn, possessive or jealous, or has no close family or friends, be wary and make sure you are mature enough to handle potentially difficult situations. If he has cheated on you, abandoned his children, lied to you about major issues, been cruel to others, or repeatedly demonstrated financial irresponsibility, he is probably not marriage material.Under no circumstances should you marry a man who is emotionally or physically abusive. Find a husband who gives you the love and respect you deserve.

Search for marriage counselors.,
Look up the therapist's location.,
Consider each counselor's availability.,
Compare costs.,
Check the therapist's education.,
Make sure the therapist is licensed.,
Ask about professional organizations.,
Compare strategies and treatment plans.,
Ask your therapist's opinion on divorce.,
Determine your therapist's values.,
Look for evidence-based approaches.,
Evaluate your progress.",How to Choose a Marriage Counselor," The first step in finding a marriage counselor is to see which counselors practice in your area. You can look up therapists in your local phone book, by searching online, or by using a reputable therapist database, such as Psychology Today's Find a Therapist page.Online databases let you search by area, by specialty, and by accepted insurance plans.
You can also ask your primary care physician for recommendations/referrals. If you trust your primary doctor, it's probably safe to trust her recommendations.If any trustworthy friends or family members have gone through marriage counseling, you might consider asking them for recommendations. However, you may not wish to do this if you don't want others to know you're seeking counseling.
A licensed marriage counselor will have the title Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT), but you can speak to a counselor that is not an LMFT and has relevant experience.
While a regular counselor or psychologist may have experience working with couples, it's important to find a therapist who has the specialized experience that you need. Ask the counselor about her training and credentials. Additionally, you should should ask which area of couples therapy she specializes — such as marriage counseling after infidelity.;
, Once you've found some counselors in your area, you should look up where each counselor practices and how you would get there. Depending on where you live, commuting from one side of town to the other (or even the next town over) might be very difficult. You may also want to factor in modes of transportation. If you do not own a car and rely on public transit, check a transit map to see how close to each counselor you can get, as well as how long that commute would take., Some counselors work within the usual 9:00 to 5:00 workday hours, which could make it difficult to meet if you work a job with rigid hours. Many counselors work on weekends or later in the day to accommodate working patients, although depending on your schedule that may be even less convenient.


If you're signing up for marriage counseling, you want to ensure that you and your partner will be able to make it to every session.
Choose a counselor whose practice hours coincide with your (and your partner's) schedule., A big factor in any medical treatment may be the costs associated with seeing a doctor, and therapy is no different. If you have health insurance, check with a representative from your insurance company to see if your plan covers counseling. You should also look into the estimated cost of counseling, both with insurance (if your plan covers it) and without.Check with your insurance company if counseling/therapy is covered. You may only be covered for therapists within a specified network or practice.
Ask the counselor you're interested in if he offers a sliding scale. Many therapists recognize that some people do not have a comprehensive insurance plan (or any insurance at all), and are willing to work with those patients at a reduced rate.

, In order to become a licensed marriage and family therapist, a counselor needs to have completed one of three educational requirements. A marriage counselor may have earned a master's degree (which takes two to three years to complete), a doctoral program (which takes three to five years to complete), or a post-graduate clinical training program (which typically takes between three and four years to complete).


Typically, after graduating from an accredited program, a counselor will complete a mandatory post-degree supervised clinical training program. This is usually required, regardless of the counselor's degree earned.
You may also find a PhD-level licensed professional counselor (LPC) or psychologist with extensive experience counseling couples.

, In addition to ensuring that a given counselor has the right background, it's also a good idea to confirm that that therapist is licensed. Depending on which state you reside in, a marriage counselor may be required to pass a state licensing exam, the national examination administered by the Association of Marital and Family Therapy Regulatory Boards (AMFTRB), or both.


You can often find information about a given therapist's licensing status by checking that therapist's website. If you cannot find that information there, ask the therapist directly.

, Though a therapist is not required to join a professional organization/association, it's usually a good sign when a therapist is a member of one. A therapist's membership indicates that she has a personal interest in counseling, as well as a desire to continue to learn and adapt her practice with new trends in the field.One of the biggest professional organizations for marriage counselors is the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapists (AAMFT).AAMFT requires supervised training and mandatory coursework of all members to ensure quality and consistency.

, Different therapists have differing approaches to therapy. It's important to get a sense of how a therapist would proceed if you were to begin sessions with him.


Ask the therapist how he would want to proceed with treatment, and whether he uses any particular therapeutic modality in his practice. Then read up about that treatment plan to see if you think it could help you.A good therapist will suggest different techniques and treatment strategies for you to work on at home between sessions.
Find out about the therapist's projected treatment plan. You should specifically ask how many sessions you can expect to have, how long each session will last, and what kind of timetable you can expect for results., It may seem like a strange question to ask a marriage counselor you're interested in working with, but it can also be a very important thing to know. Some marriage counselors urge their clients to leave the marriage when things get rocky, either because of the therapist's beliefs or her unwillingness to continue working through problems. This may be the mark of a poor therapist for your needs, especially if you're committed to working through your problems no matter what.You should specifically ask the therapist at what point she considers divorce to be a viable option.

, Each therapist brings his own set of values to the practice of marriage counseling, which can be good, bad, or neutral. However, those values shouldn't intrude on your therapy in problematic ways. It's important to determine what your therapist's values are to ensure that he will be a good fit for you and your partner moving forward.If a therapist says there is only one way to have a successful marriage, you should consider finding someone else to work with.
Ask a therapist you're interested in what his personality is like. That may give you some insight into how well he'd fit with you and your spouse.Determine what kinds of patients the therapist works with before you describe your problem. That way you'll know whether he can help you right off the bat.
Describe yourself, your spouse, and your marital problem(s). Ask the counselor how he thinks the first session or two might go when dealing with that problem to get a sense of what to expect.

, There are many therapeutic approaches that are generally recognized as being effective and medially-sound. It may be a good idea to find out what kinds of therapeutic approaches your counselor uses to see if it would fit well with your needs. Two common evidence-based approaches to marriage counseling are Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy and the Gottman Method.Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy works to rebuild the foundation of a marriage by focusing on repairing trust, fostering emotional intimacy, and rekindling feelings of love and affection.
The Gottman Method works to rebuild a marriage by first changing the behaviors of each partner. This method emphasizes communication skills, conflict resolution, strengthening the friendship within a marriage, and being more caring/considerate partners to one another.

, Marriage counseling should not feel like a never-ending pursuit. Early in the counseling, you and your partner should set concrete goals with your therapist so that the ensuing sessions have some direction and focus. Each subsequent session should have those goals in mind and should work to help you and your partner find ways to meet your goals.You won't see results overnight, but if you haven't seen any improvement in your marriage after several weeks' worth of sessions, you may want to consider looking for another therapist.A good therapist should make both spouses feel respected and heard. If your therapist takes sides or ""gangs up"" on you or your spouse, you should consider looking for another therapist.Don't get frustrated. Saving a marriage takes time and effort from both you and your partner, you won't be able to do it alone. If the therapist you're seeing isn't helping you reach your clearly-defined goals, it's worth your marriage to find one who will.

Know what a DNA test can do for your family tree search.,
Know that it DNA tests work best when you are from:


Large families with many many cousins






Ethnicities with lots of data and researchers






Ethnically mixed families, so you can easily figure out what side of your family is related to someone you find.







,
DNA tests can also be helpful in proving if you and someone else have the same paternal or maternal line.,
Start with one of the Family Finder tests.,
Know that you want to order Your DNA test from one of the big three.,
Decide which company to order the DNA test from.,
You will be OK with either of the three companies.,
Order the test.,
Take the test.,
Results come by via Internet within a couple of weeks.

,
Understand more about your DNA.,
Scan the DNA company's database for matches.,
Realize that mixed ethnic background makes finding relatives easier.,
Look closely at the lists of people the DNA company provides to you.",How to Use DNA Tests to Trace Your Family Tree," DNA Tests are best in finding the cousins you don't know you have.


The jackpot is finding say, a 3rd cousin you didn't know about, who has lots of information on ancestors you didn't already know about.






Many of these people have taken a DNA test already and are registered with the DNA companies. So, the DNA test will not only tell you who are your distant cousins, but also let you contact them.





;
,,

They can prove if two people with the same surname have an identical ancestor on the male line.






They can also prove if two people have the same maternal line.







, These tests (also called autosomal tests) give results for all of your DNA, not just the male line or the female line. They are therefore better for tracing more recent ancestors.


The family finder tests will find people you are related to, but don't know, typically 3rd or 4th cousins. These people are most likely to have family information you do not have.
There is another kind of test that you usually don't want for family tree research. Y Chromosome tests and X Chromosome tests are helpful in testing what National Geographic calls your ""Deep Ancestry,"" where your family was from many hundreds or thousands of years ago. This is very interesting but not as helpful as finding distant cousins.
The Y Chromosome tests are helpful when you are trying to prove a shared male ancestor. For example, they can help if you are trying to prove the father of a direct-line ancestor on the extreme paternal line (following the surname). If known male descendants of the “supposed” father match the your DNA (if you are male) or your father's DNA (if you are female), then it proves you have a common ancestor.
Similarly, 23andme now lets you find out your percentage of Neanderthal DNA. This is also highly interesting, but again not going to help you trace your family tree over the last couple hundred years or more.

, Smaller companies may or may not have better technology, but to trace your family tree, you need to order from one of the larger companies.


The larger companies will match your DNA with people related to you that have also taken the test from them. Smaller companies are much less likely to find a match, simply because they have less people in their database.

, Family Finder tests are available from all three of the large companies:


Ancestry.com
23 and me
FamilyTreeDNA

, Your decision on which of the three to use is a bit more personal preference. 23andme has some interesting features (notably, disease identification), but these other features are not helpful for most family tree purposes.


African Ancestry and Oxford Ancestors are very good services for those tracing their more distant roots in Africa and the UK, but are not as good for family finding.
You may find a certain company has a better service for your ethnicity. 23andme has a project to better classify DNA of people from Sub Saharan Africa. So if you are trying to trace African DNA, they might be the best match for you.
Consider looking at more than one company. If you are extremely determined, you could take tests from more than one of these companies.
23andme data can be imported into Family Tree DNA. You will have to pay $50 to do that.

, You can order the test using the website of the company you choose. It will come in the mail in a week or so.

, The test is a ""spit test.""

Open the test tube and spit into it, filling to the line.






Seal the test tube.






Put the test tube and information back into the envelope and mail it back.







,, Before looking at your results, you may want to read up on the DNA of the location of your ancestors for more background.


For example, if you are looking at ancestors from the British Isles, you could read Saxons, Vikings and Celts.There are similar titles for other ethnicities.

, You will probably find an overwhelming number of matches, but the key is to contact the right people to help build out your family tree.

It is best to organize before talking to distant relatives that you will find online. Get the family names and locations of your ancestors that you are trying to trace.






Ancestry will often send you a list of hundreds of your 4th-6th cousins, this is not very helpful to look at unfiltered. They will show a family name of a DNA match, which does make things easier to trace.







,

As an example, if you are half Caucasian and half Asian, and you find someone is a cousin who is Asian, you immediately can guess which side they are on.
If you are 1/8th or 1/16th of an ethnicity, but do not know what side of your family that ethnicity is, you can find out by having either your mother or father take the same DNA test.

, The most promising results are 3rd or 4th cousins, especially if you can find a family name in common.


You are looking for ""Goldilocks"" relatives, not too close and not too far. You will learn most if you can find a relative that is closely related enough so that you can trace your exact relationship and merge your family trees.

"
Think about your goals.,
Consider your religion.,
Decide on individual or group.",How to Choose a Premarital Counselor2," There are a number of reasons why couples may choose to go to premarital counseling. You and your partner should clarify your specific goals so that you can find a therapist who is most capable of meeting your needs.

For example, some couples may require premarital counseling as a criteria before marrying within a specific religion or at a certain religious location. Others may desire better communication skills or conflict resolution techniques. Still, others may simply want to strengthen their relationship on all counts to reduce their chances of divorce., Are you getting counseling because of your unique religious or spiritual beliefs?

Furthermore, if you and your partner have different beliefs, you might locate a counselor who has experience working with interfaith couples.

, The two most common formats for premarital counseling are individual and group. Individual therapy involves just you, your partner, and the therapist. This is a very unique and personalized format. Group therapy may include you and your partner along with a few other couples.


Group therapy enables you to learn vicariously through the problems of other couples. Plus, you can find support from others who are preparing for marriage."

While anyone with a background in relationship dynamics may be able to help you, you will get the most help from a professional who has been trained as a marriage and family therapist or who has a certification in premarital counseling.
Also, ask how many couples your prospective counselor has worked with. You’ll want someone who has a wealth of knowledge and experience rather than someone who has only worked with a handful of couples., Once you’ve narrowed down a few candidates (maybe one or two), arrange to have an initial session with them. Come prepared with a list of questions, such as the therapist’s theoretical orientation, their belief system, and their approach to working with couples. Ideally, you should feel as comfortable with this professional as you do your family physician., After you’ve scheduled one session, sit down with your partner and discuss your comfort level with the professional. It’s very important that you both feel safe and capable of sharing sensitive or intimate information with this person. So, only move forward with the sessions if you both feel comfortable with this person.


Feeling like therapy is a safe place is quite significant as many couples may see a therapist for premarital counseling and continue to see them throughout the life of the marriage as new issues arise., Premarital counseling isn’t necessarily a walk in the park. For most couples, these sessions will bring up difficult issues that must be resolved for the benefit of the marriage. Both partners should begin therapy with the understanding that it will be challenging and uncomfortable at times. Both must be willing to work during and after the sessions to enjoy lasting results."

Other times, however, anger and frustration can be due to minor annoyances that can be let go.For example, if your spouse made a comment that hurt your feelings, this is definitely something to discuss. If you're annoyed by a bad habit, like your spouse occasionally leaving a dirty dish in the sink overnight, this is something you can let go.

, While thinking over the issue, try not to let your thoughts unfurl. It's easy to take a small thing, like who's going to do the dishes that night, and let it turn into you examining who does more chores in general. This can make small matters seem bigger than they really are. Focus on the single issue and how it made you feel."
"
Recognize when issues can cause longterm problems.,
Take note of the emotional toll the issue has.,
Figure out what's at stake.,
Talk out major life problems over small annoyances.",How to Choose Your Battles in Marriage2," Each time you're deciding whether or not to raise an issue, think about its longterm consequences. Is this something that could fester resentment in the future or is it something you'll be over in a few days? The answer to this question is vital to decide whether to discuss an issue.Say you're mad your spouse didn't invite you to a movie they saw with a friend. If your spouse usually spends time with you, this is likely something you'll get over.
Bigger issues can cause longterm resentment and frustration. If you consistently feel left out of your spouse's social life, and they failed to invite you to a major event, this may be worth a discussion.

, Fights and debates take a lot of time, effort, and energy. Each time you encounter a potential conflict, pause and ask yourself, ""Is it really worth the extra energy of fighting?"" If you're not that upset by the issue, you may not want to add more stress to the situation.For example, say your spouse is usually five or ten minutes late to events. While you may prefer to be more punctual, five or ten minutes is not a huge amount of time. The issue may not be worth pressing.
If your spouse makes you late by half an hour or more, however, this is fairly significant, especially if it affects your social life and relationships. This is a matter that may warrant an argument.

, In every argument, there's something at stake. However, what you have to gain or lose is sometimes minor. Spend some time evaluating the potential benefit of the discussion.If your spouse chews gum loudly, arguing over this wouldn't lead to major changes in your marriage other than your spouse abandoning a bad habit.
If your spouse consistently forgets to walk the dog, you're caring for the dog alone. Discussing this issue could lead to you getting help with a major responsibility and prevent resentment. This is an issue worth debating.

, In general, major problems should take priority over small annoyances. If you argue about every small issue, you and your spouse may not have the time or energy to resolve big conflicts. Fight your battles over major disagreements rather than subjective matters.For example, if your spouse prefers to stay up a little later than you, this is a subjective difference that can be ignored.
If your spouse consistently keeps you up at night when you need to sleep for work, this is a bigger issue that affects your life. It warrants discussion.

"
"
Be honest about your feelings.,
Look for win-win scenarios.,
Search for a compromise.,
Let go of what’s done.",How to Choose Your Battles in Marriage3," If you decide to talk things over with your spouse, be direct about it. It's important to express your feelings clearly so your spouse understands why you feel an issue is worth discussing.For example, say something like, ""I understand you're more of a night owl, but I work early in the morning. When you wake me up because you want to talk before bed, I don't have the energy I need the next day.""

, Think about ways both you and your spouse can get what you want out of the situation. Instead of finding a way for one of you to win, think about a mutually beneficial solution.For example, you simply staying up later is not reasonable. Instead, your spouse could agree to let you sleep at night and you could agree to make time to talk with them in the morning.

, In some situations, you may not be able to both get exactly what you want. However, if you both sacrifice something small, you can reach a reasonable compromise.For example, your partner prefers to stay in on weekends while you like going out with friends. You could agree to stay in Fridays and go out Saturdays.

, Once something has been addressed, you have to let it go. If you and your partner have a fight, that should not come back up in the next disagreement. Focus on the compromise or win-win scenario you came to and try to live with this instead of continually pressing the issue.For example, do not keep pressuring your spouse to go out on Fridays if you promised to stay in one night a week. You should honor the agreement you made and accept this difference.

Remind yourself that emotional abuse is not your fault.,
See a therapist.,
Decide which boundaries you want to set.,
Decide on consequences.,
Tell your parent about your boundaries.,
Follow through with consequences.,
Put your own health and happiness first.,
Surround yourself with positive people.,
Take care of your health.,
Use positive self-talk.,
Decide how much contact you can have with your toxic parent.",How to Stop Making Excuses for Toxic Parents," Get some space so you can gain perspective on your parent’s behavior and your relationship with them. If you’re around toxic or abusive behavior all the time, you may get used to it. Taking a break can help you get a clearer-eyed look at what’s wrong.If you still live with your parents, creating some distance can be tough. Try joining extracurricular activities that keep you out of the house, spending time with friends who have healthier family dynamics, and arranging your sleep schedule to minimize the amount of toxic behavior you’re exposed to.
If you no longer live at home, try a time-out from contact with them, including texts, phone calls, and visits.;
, Coming to terms with a parent’s toxic behavior can be difficult emotionally. Allow yourself time to experience a range of feelings, and avoid judging yourself for those feelings.Anger, sadness, guilt, and relief are a few of the emotions you might experience.

, It’s not uncommon for toxic people to be abusive as well. Remember that abusers are acting out their own pain. If you’ve been abused by your toxic parent, know that their behavior is not your fault and not a reflection on your own character, no matter what they may have told you., Growing up with a toxic parent can create emotional complications and relationship difficulties later in life. A mental health professional can help you unlearn negative thought patterns, adopt good coping strategies, and build stronger relationships.

, A good boundary protects you emotionally and physically. Think about the way your parent makes you feel. Commit to setting boundaries that shield you from the impact of their toxic behavior.For instance, if your parent insists on calling you every day, you might decide to limit your calls to once a week. Remember, you do not have to pick up the phone or immediately respond to texts.

, Consequences are the actions you take when someone does not respect your boundaries. Think about what you will do if your parent disregards your wishes. Choose consequences that you are prepared to follow through with.The best consequences follow naturally from the other person’s actions.
For instance, if your toxic parent calls you and starts berating you for not wanting to have a phone conversation every day, you might decide to hang up the phone.

, Meet with your parent and have an honest conversation about what you need from them. Be kind, but stay firm. Make sure to also tell your parent what you will do if they don’t respect your boundaries.Have the conversation at a time when you and your parent are both calm.
Your parent may get angry at you for setting limits. Don’t let them guilt you into backing down. It’s your right to create boundaries you’re comfortable with.
Frame your concerns using “I” language. For instance, instead of saying “It’s not reasonable that you expect me to spend an hour on the phone with you every day,” try saying, “I feel stifled because of how much we talk, and I’d rather schedule a chat once a week instead.”

, Your parent may try to test your boundaries. If they don’t take your wishes seriously, carry out the consequence you promised.If you fail to follow through with a consequence, your parent will think they can continue violating your boundaries with no repercussions.

, You can’t make everyone happy, and trying to please a toxic parent is often a fruitless task. Instead, make it a priority to maintain your own happiness.Learning to value yourself can be difficult if you grew up with a toxic parent. If you struggle with your self-worth, a therapist can help you restore it to a healthy level.
You may also find that you feel guilty, even when you have done nothing wrong. If this is the case, your therapist can help you overcome those feelings.

, Friends and family members who build you up can help undo the damage of being raised by a toxic parent. Seek out people who make you feel worthy of love and respect.Many people who were raised by toxic parents find themselves subconsciously drawn to other toxic people later in life. Evaluate your current relationships to make sure they are healthy.

, Emotional trauma can be hard on your brain and body. Repair your physical health by eating right, getting enough cardiovascular exercise, and establishing a meditation routine.Avoid eating foods made with processed sugar and flour. Instead, eat plenty of vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Make sure to get enough omega-3 fatty acids in your diet, too.
Meditation helps you build new neural pathways, which can help reverse the damage of a toxic upbringing.

, If your parent spoke to you harshly or criticized you frequently, you may be in the habit of speaking to yourself the same way. Create a new habit of talking to yourself gently instead. For instance, if you make a mistake at work, tell yourself something like, “It’s not the end of the world. Everybody makes mistakes, and now I know how to do better next time.”
Start a journal containing positive messages. When you're struggling or feeling down, reread your positive messages.

, Some people can reach an understanding with their toxic parent and build a healthier relationship. Sometimes, though, the parent’s behavior is too negative to fix. If your parent refuses to listen to you or cooperate with you, consider whether cutting off contact with them would be the best choice for your mental and emotional health."

Make a pedigree chart with all the information you know.,
Interview family members.,
Search through family photos, clippings, and documents.,
Keep things organized.",How to Trace Your Family Tree1," A pedigree chart provides vital information (full name, birth/death dates, birth/death places, marriage date(s)), beginning with you and branching out to your parents, your parents’ parents, and so on. Siblings, step-parents, etc., are typically excluded.In the traditional pedigree chart format, your name is written on a line centered on the left edge of a sheet of paper, with your vital information below the line.
This line then splits and branches off into two lines, one for each of your parents. These lines then split, making four lines for each of your grandparents, and so on. Multiple sheets are added as needed.
You can find pre-made, printable sheets to make this process easier. Search for a ""printable pedigree chart"" online. There are also templates available that let you type in the information and save or print out a chart.
Fill in all the information you can gather as you go. If you need to skip a line or some details, keep going and try to fill in the missing information later.;
, Gather as much information as possible firsthand before digging into your research. Ask the oldest family members available to you to discuss their ancestry. You’re bound to discover some new and interesting things about your heritage.


Don’t take everything said to you as flawlessly accurate, however.You may expect a little fuzziness of recollection in an older person, but also remember that human memory is not a data recorder. People can forget facts -- such as a painful family secret, like illegitimate parentage -- for so long that they become their truth. Trust but verify.
Consider recording your interviews. Not only will this aid in your research, it may offer you a nice family memento when that older family member is no longer with you., Now is the time to start browsing through those boxes in your grandmother’s attic. You probably won’t be lucky enough to find an existing family tree or history, but browsing through photo albums, diaries, scrapbooks, etc., should produce some valuable genealogical information.


Look on the backs of photos. People often write names and dates that could prove useful.
If you have names but are short on birth/death dates and other similar information, newspaper clippings and the sort can prove useful in setting up chronologies. Being able to establish when your great-grandparents celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary can give you a better idea on date ranges for other life events.

, Collecting family information is more enjoyable than organizing it, but without the latter the former will be less useful as you construct your family tree.


Make photocopies or scans of pictures and documents. You may want to use them as part of your family tree, and they will be more handy this way regardless.
Enter information into a database as you gather it. Find a format that works best for you.
If you’d prefer to keep the computer out of things at this point, index cards still work just fine. Make a new card for each person you uncover; place name, birth/death dates, and relationship to you on the blank side, and notes and information on the lined side of the card. You can lay the cards out on the table or floor to make a large pedigree chart as you work.

Visit cemeteries.,
Examine government records.,
Go to local libraries.,
Pay for genealogy services.",How to Trace Your Family Tree2," If you know where your grandparents or other relatives are buried, visit the cemetery and take a look around. You may find that they are buried in proximity to other relatives you didn’t know about.


If you can’t read the information on older stones, contact the cemetery to see if they have any records that could help you.
If you don’t know where to start with cemetery searching, there are grave index searches available online, such as findagrave.com and others available through most genealogy websites.

, Birth, marriage, and death certificates can provide details on on dates, parentage, place of birth or residence, and even occupation and other information sometimes.


Court records, anything from adoption requests to property transactions to criminal proceedings, can be a treasure trove of information as well. Some of this may also be information less likely to be gleaned from family interviews and photo albums.
The information available, request process, and record availability will vary by government authority, but generally you want to start by making a request to the vital records office in your ancestor(s) county of residence. Call or visit the county website(s) for information. You may need to visit in person to view certain records.
Again, if you don’t know where to start with this, look into websites that can provide digital copies of these records.

, Visit the library closest to where your ancestor(s) lived. You are likely to find useful information and librarians who are eager to help with genealogical searching.


See if they have local newspapers on microfilm or, if you are lucky, digitally scanned. If you have a narrow date range to search within -- you know roughly when your great-great grandmother died, for instance -- scanning through the local gazette for an obituary might help.
Look into local and county histories as well. Many American counties compiled local histories on or around the national centennial in 1876, and these can prove to be a treasure trove of information on early families (They are usually indexed as well.).Inquire whether the library has a genealogy or research librarian. Many local libraries practically double as genealogy libraries, so they are accustomed to helping people locate relevant information.
If your ancestor(s) lived near a college/university or a historical society, by all means visit those libraries as well.
See also How to Trace Family Genealogy at the Library.

, You may want to do all the work yourself but can’t, especially if it requires distant travel. Or, you may find that genealogical research is more time-consuming than you thought it would be. Sometimes the best option is to hire an expert to do at least some of the work for you.


Local libraries, historical societies, and genealogical libraries/societies should be able to provide leads on genealogists for hire and/or provide those services.
You may be hesitant to pay to fill out a family tree, but remember, any way you do it -- paying an expert, traveling and taking the time to do the work yourself, or subscribing to a website -- substantial genealogical research costs money."
"
Look into free resources.,
Sign up for subscription or pay-as-you-go websites.,
Connect with other family history searchers.,
Build your family tree with care.,
Use science as an ally.",How to Trace Your Family Tree3," Eventually you’re almost certainly going to have to pay for the information you need, but gather what you can without paying first. It may save you a month’s subscription fee.


Government record resources are one avenue to consider. See, for instance, this list at usa.gov. See also the lists of free and pay sites here and here.
Many subscription websites, such as ancestry.com offer free trials, so you can sign up and make the most of it before (or without) paying.
If your ancestors immigrated during the late 1800s or early 1900s, the Ellis Island website provides a useful passenger search.

, Ancestry.com is the most popular, but there are other options as well.


If you have immigrant ancestors and don’t want to travel internationally, these may prove essential.
These sites generally offer not just search functionality but also organizational assistance and the ability to view and connect with existing family trees.
Ancestry.com, for example, provides easy access to U.S. Census records, which can be essential to figuring out when and where your ancestors lived, and (depending on the census) what they did for a living, when they arrived in America, and so on.
Remember, however, that census records are sealed for 72 years, so as of 2015 you will have access only up through the 1940 census no matter what resource you utilize., This is one of the great benefits of pay and free websites. You can connect with others who may be facing the same search issues, may have information you need, or may even be a relative you didn’t know about.


There are exceptions (as always), of course, but in general, amateur genealogists are a helpful bunch who want to share what they have uncovered. Draw from what they have found and share what you have found as well.

, Bad information on one ancestor can send your family tree completely off course. And who wants to find out that one little mistake turns your whole presumed ancestry into someone else’s?


Last (and first) name spellings were not as standardized until modern times, with the explosion of government record-keeping. Search for multiple variations of a last name when you hit a “dead end.”
Keep an eye out for multiple people with the same name as well. If you have an ancestor named John Smith or Mary Johnson, for instance, you are more than likely going to have to do some sleuthing to figure out which one born in Ohio in 1879 is your great-great grandparent. If you’re not sure, follow multiple lines back and see if you can find useful clues in prior generation(s).
Verify information gleaned from other researchers as well. They almost certainly have good intentions and believe their information is accurate, but they can lead you down the wrong path as well. Rely first on your own research.

, If you have little information on your ancestry, or just want a better picture of your ethnic heritage, there are multiple genealogy websites that now offer do-at-home DNA testing. They generally involve spitting into a tube and mailing it back. Strange to say, but maybe a little saliva is all it will take to get your family tree back on track.

Think about the decision.,
Even though you must stand strong about your convictions, prepare yourself for the reaction.,
Create an action plan that will make mom still feel part of the birth.,
Consider areas where you could compromise.",How to Tell Your Mom You Don’t Want Her in the Delivery Room," Why don’t you want mom in the delivery room? There may be several reasons why having your mom parked in the delivery room sounds like a terrible idea.


She’s hysterical. If your mom reacts to emergency situations like Shirley MacLaine in the film “Terms of Endearment” you will really need her to wait outside. Having her demand that the doctor make you comfortable or running around in a panic will only make you feel worse and possibly scar you for life.
She’s too nosy. The last thing you need is for your mom to be parked at the end of the bed, texting the gory details to Aunt Bea and her Bunco group while you push.
She’s too bossy. You want to be in charge of the birth, but you know that mom will take over and start ordering people around.
It’s all about mom. Somehow this glowing moment will end up being about how it impacts her life--or she’ll faint and the doctors and nurses will be more concerned with her wellbeing than the emerging child.
She’s too rough. If mom likes to tell you to “suck it up” when you are in pain or upset, having her tell you to get over labor pains may not help your situation.;
, Of course you should skew your presentation about why she should wait outside based on previous experience, but you should still be prepared to take on whatever will come your way.


Crying. Will she go for the pity party and start weeping, talking about how she’ll be dead soon and only wanted to witness the birth of her grandchild?
The silent treatment. Will she be so mad that she won’t speak to you until you give in or the child is ready to take college entrance exams?
Outright anger. Are you going to be facing a hurricane of wrath complete with screaming and yelling?
Passive aggressive. She seems to be taking it fine, but then there’s that dig during your baby shower about how chubby you’ve gotten or how you are making bad decisions with regard to your birthing plan.

, With her potential reaction in mind, craft a strategy that allows you to save face but still get your way.


Make something up. Tell her that the hospital only will allow your significant other in the room (but if it were up to you, you’d totally have her in the room). Confirm with the hospital that either this is true or if they will help to perpetuate your lie.
Ask her for a big favor. If you make mom feel as if you have an important job for her during delivery, perhaps she can get past not being in the room. Ask her to be in charge of taking post-delivery photos, taking care of your significant other during the process or even request that she handle the family pet.
Tell her how you feel. Only go with this strategy if you think you can get away with it unscathed. However, sugar coat how you feel. If mom is totally annoying and hysterical during intense situations, tell her that you just want to have the doctor and your man in the room so you can focus and concentrate.

, If she is completely heartbroken, consider if there are ways where you could include her. Perhaps allow her to stay in the room with you while you go through labor but maybe not during the actual delivery. Or allow her to come back into the room immediately after the baby’s cord is cut and is being checked by doctors. Think of what may happen during delivery and consider if there is any room to include her.

Ask your parents about their childhoods.,
Ask their opinion.,
Share things with them.,
Ask for their help and advice.,
Try to understand their stresses.,
Ask people who know your parents to talk about them.",How to Understand Your Parents1," You weren’t there for your parents’ childhoods, and you might learn something especially interesting or cool about your parents’ experiences. Knowing about their experiences and childhoods will also help you to understand them better currently. Here are some questions you could ask:


What was your childhood like?
How would your parents have described you when you were in high school?
What advice would you give to yourself when you were my age?
Which family tradition did/do you love the most?;
, Exploring your parents' beliefs and opinions can give you insight into how they see the world. If you are watching the news together, try asking their opinion about some of the stories. Find out their political views and their stance on current events. If something is going on with a friend or at school, ask what they think about it. For instance, you could say something like, ""There's a new rule at school that says girls' skirts have to go past their knees. What do you think about that?""

Don't stop at asking their opinion — ask them why. Understanding why they take a certain position can give you more understanding on how your parents reason through things and how they see the world.

, Even if these everyday things are small, such as what you ate for lunch or a funny thing that your friend said to you, your parents will love hearing these details about your life. They might even start to share the same type of information in return, and you will then understand them better. The more you communicate with your parents, the more you will, in time, begin to understand them.You could say something like, ""Mom, the funniest thing happened to me today, and I want to tell you about it.""
Or you could try, ""Dad, I'm so glad you're home! I taught our dog a new trick today that I want to show you.""

, Your parents probably would love to help with your problems, from your relationship troubles to what you’re wearing to the office Christmas party. But you first need to tell your parents that you want advice from them. Getting your parents’ perspective on one of your problems will both help you with your problem and help you understand your parents’ point of view more.Try asking about career advice. You could say, ""Dad, how did you decide what you wanted to do with your career? I'm feeling lost.""
Or you could try something like, ""Mom, I feel like my friend Annie is upset with me. What do you think I should do?""

, Your parents might have bigger problems than you think they do, and these problems could be affecting your relationship. Whether they are having trouble at work, are worried about something, or want to lose a little bit of weight, you should ask your parents if anything has been on their mind recently. Hearing about these problems will help you understand your parents better., Another way to truly understand your parents is to learn about them from a different perspective. Talk to your grandparents, your siblings, your parents' siblings, other family members, and your parents' friends. Ask them to tell stories about your parents, and ask them questions.


For example, you could say, ""Grandma, do you have any funny stories about Dad from when he was little?""
Or, you could ask your mom's friend, ""Sue, do you think that my mom likes her job?""

Spend quality time with your parents.,
Do what they love with them.,
Spend time doing everyday things with them.",How to Understand Your Parents2," Living in the same house as your parents is very different from spending quality time with them. Instead of watching TV together or just hanging out in the living room, ask your parents to do an activity with you.Here are some suggestions that might help you find something fun to do:


Go out to eat.
Go bowling.
Play mini golf.
Play a board game.
Do an arts and crafts project, like painting pottery.

, Your parents probably have things that they love to do, whether it’s playing the guitar, taking spin classes, or gardening in your backyard. Spend some time doing what your parents love with them. Taking an interest in their passions will help you get to know them on another level. Here are a few examples of things you might like to do with your parents:


Cooking or baking
Hiking
Biking
Listening to a book on tape
Playing musical instruments with them
Traveling

, Sometimes the smaller moments, like going to the grocery store with your dad or helping your mom water the plants, will help you understand more about what your parents’ day-to-day lives are like (especially if you don’t live with them). Here are some examples of little things you can do with your parents:


Give your dog a bath
Cook dinner
Water the plants
Garden

Empathize with your parents.,
Use the PEN method to talk with your parents.,
Think about your role in getting along with and understanding your parents.",How to Understand Your Parents3," Empathy is a hard skill to learn, but it is rewarding because it allows you to gain a deeper understanding of other people. Here are some ways to cultivate empathy:


Listen to what you parents are saying. Try to imagine what they are feeling and ""put yourself in their shoes.""
Ask questions. This will make you more engaged in the conversation and let your parents know that you are listening.
Make yourself vulnerable. If applicable, share your own experiences with your parents. Open up to them., The PEN method — Pause, Empathy, Need — is good for having difficult conversations with your parents. If you feel yourself becoming upset with your parents, first you should pause. Don't say anything you will regret later. Then, empathize with your parents. Think about how they feel: if you were in their shoes, what would you be thinking and feeling? Next, express your needs to your parents. Say that you want to understand their perspectives, but you also have your own needs that you must express. Communicate calmly with your parents if you're having a difficult conversation.


Try saying, ""I understand that you are worried about my safety when I stay out late, but it's important to me to socialize and go out with my friends.""

, Rather than focusing on what your parents could do better to improve your relationship, focus on what you can do. Could you help with the dishes or call a little more often? Brainstorm ways to get along with your parents that will also help you to understand them.For example, you could offer to cook dinner for your parents, or plan a hiking day with them. Take care of all of the logistics.
Help with the housework, or offer to do them a favor around the house. Ask if their fence needs painting or the family dog needs walking.

"
Do It Now.,
Be Sensitive To Their Needs.,
Communicate With Them.,
Consider Them In Every Decision.

,
Don’t Play Favorite/ Some cultures in different parts of the world dogmatically or subtly encourage the idea of preferring one parent above the other.,
Appreciate Them: In his book ‘The Science of Getting Rich’, Wallace D. Wattles asserts: “The whole process of mental adjustment and attunement can be summed up in one word: Gratitude.,
Do Not Be Demanding: We are living in an age when is not easy to make a living.,
Forgive Them: “Do Yourself a Favor, Forgive” is the candid opinion of author Joyce Meyer in a book of that same title.",How to Pamper Your Parents," It has often been said that procrastination is the thief of time. The more you delay doing something the less you feel like doing it. If there is anytime you need to take care of your parents it is now or never.

Being nice to your parents should not be a burden to you either as single or married. Remember that bringing you up from infancy through adulthood was never an easy task either. If you live with your parents let them enjoy your presence for the time being.



 


Do not wait until they are indisposed before you assist them. If you want to buy something you know they will like, buy it now. Someone who deprived his parents of wonderful gifts while they were alive and now buys them expensive Rolex watches to tie around their lifeless wrists at death, lay them in gold caskets, buries them in marble tombs has waited for too long. He has just succeeded in impressing the people who gather for the funeral to register their condolences, not the deceased parents. After all they are dead and can’t see what’s going on.;
, Traditionally, many people only respond to people’s requests when those requests are verbally expressed. The truth is we cannot deny the fact that at times actions speak louder than voices. You need not play passive game with your progenitors, try as much as possible to be proactive with them.


Read John C. Maxwell’s “Everyone Communicates, Few Connect” and Steven R. Covey’s “Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People” for details on how to be sensitive to the unspoken needs of others and how to be proactive. Being sensitive requires you listen to your parents when they are not speaking words.
You can do this by trying to understand their temperament (Read Tim LaHaye’s “Why You Act The Way You Do?” for details on temperament), likes, dislikes, mood swings, moments of depression, strengths, weaknesses, fears and heart desires for you.
When you are sensitive to them by way of understanding you make it easy for them to manage your affairs especially if you are still very much young. You won’t necessarily make them spank you or scold you every time because you will behave yourself. And you know if you often save them the headache of trying to fix you each time you fall apart due to silly mistakes you can avoid if only you follow instruction then you incidentally prolong their lives.

, Talk to your parents often but don’t talk back at them in the middle of an argument or misunderstanding. Don’t start calling your parents names because they don’t seem to understand your stand on an issue. Calling your parents idiots, assholes, son of a bitch sounds very ridiculous, disrespectful and unethical no matter how popular the idea may be. This kind of attitude can curtail meaningful communication.


Be the first to greet them in the morning. Be the first to ask them if there is something else they would have you do for them when you are through with a particular task. Be happy to welcome them back home from work or from journey.
Communicate your desires, decisions and options to them. Don’t hide sensitive information that you know may break their hearts if they eventually become aware when it is too late. Cases such as child molestation, rape, threat and nightmares should be wisely communicated to your parents. This is not to scare them but to show them you trust them to make the best decision about your situation.

,, I have heard some elders teach it to the younger generation telling them that it is impossible not to play favorite with your parents only if you don’t make it known verbally. But they forget to tell them that even if you don’t tell people what you are doing it doesn’t prevent them from seeing what you are doing. Like I said the other time ‘actions speak louder than words’. If you secretly help or favor your mother much more than your father, it is just a matter of time that you will be exposed. Besides, you are sowing a seed of discord and disunity which you will definitely harvest. Try to understand that the marital vows your parents exchanged with each other on their wedding day make them one before God. So do not help your dad separate from your mum because of perceived favoritism from your side. Pamper your parents by helping them protect their marriage not to destroy it on the altar of favoritism. Understand that a father is different from a mother not because one is important than the other but because they have different roles to play in conjunction to make life better for you.

, First, you believe that there is one intelligent substance, from which all things proceed. Second, you believe that this substance gives you everything you desire. And third, you relate yourself to it by a feeling of deep and profound gratitude”. Many children are kept in poverty, child labor, human trafficking, shop lifting, pocket-picking, burglary, malnutrition, child molestation, juvenile delinquency facility, orphanage and endless struggle for survival partly because they lack moral, spiritual and financial supports from their parents. Some kids lost their parents while some others had indifferent ones. Did you ever stop to notice that your case is different from all of these? Do you think it’s just because you are a smart kid or it’s just your destiny to be this way? This is just a mystery you don’t need to unravel before you appreciate your parents. They have been through a lot for you. They have had sleepless nights for you. They have bled for you. They have starved themselves because of you as the case may for different people. Appreciate them not occasionally but always. Thank them for every little gesture of love. Thank them for each meal that is served on the table. Thank them for the cloths. Be grateful to them for giving you a ride to school or to the picnic. Appreciate them for accommodating your homeless or touring friend. Let them know how much you appreciate the kind of education they afforded you. My friends if you can think deeply, I’m sure you will have a million ways to say thank you to your parents.

, The last thing your parents expect from you is to be too demanding. Don’t imbibe the idea of asking for too much. You are not being fair to them if you always ask them to give you things you know down deep within your heart that they cannot afford simply because you want to impress your peers. Think about it. Which is more important to you? Your parents’ health and longevity or what your friends say about you? It’s time you recast your priorities. Put first things first. You need to differentiate between urgency and importance. Your father can’t be a social worker with a five-figure-salary and expect him to buy you a car like your friend’s dad who is the Chairman and CEO of a multinational company. Let your parents’ happiness and health be your priority above how rich or influential anyone perceives you.

, You can not afford to continually carry the same load of malice, hate, hurt and disappointment you've been carrying against your parents for so many reasons. Perhaps your parents either intentionally or unintentionally did not send you to the school of your choice, did not provide you with something you requested at the time you needed it, did prefer one or all of your siblings above you at one time or the other, sided with a neighbor at the face of a particular allegation among many others. You will do well and release yourself from under the weight of such heavy loads if only you can gather your wits and confront them politely with all the stuff they did to you that you never liked and tell them you forgive. How else can one pamper his parents than that? Remember we all make mistakes.

Set up emotional boundaries.,
Implement physical boundaries.,
Give options.,
Encourage your parents to be honest with you.",How to Spend Time with Difficult Parents As an Adult1," Difficult parents often tend to criticize and nit-pick. Tell them certain subjects are off limits and stick with your rules. Bending even once shows them that you are not strong in your convictions and will allow your parents to walk all over you.


For example, you could say to your parents, “I am raising my children the best way I know how. I appreciate your concern, but I don’t want to talk about how I raise them with you. I would appreciate it if we don’t discuss that topic.” Stay respectful but firm to attempt to avoid arguments.;
, Do your parents constantly push their way into your life? Do they show up unannounced, call several times a day, and expect you to attend every event they have and come over every time they need you? If so, it’s time to create some rules.


For instance, you could tell your parents to give you at least a day’s notice before they come to your house. That they are permitted to call once a day, but no more. That you will make events when you can, but you don’t want to hear grief when you can’t. Setting these boundaries can help to establish the type of relationship that works for you., If you are taking care of your mentally or physically ill parent, they may resist or resent your help. One way to get around this is to allow them to help in some decisions when it comes to their lives. Offering them options helps them feel they have some control, which may improve their attitude. Try to respect the needs they express, and if possible, try to foster an open discussion so that everyone feels heard.


Allow them to pick what days of the week they take a shower, visit the doctor, or engage in any other activity they do regularly. They can also help pick what meals they want to eat and what clothes they wear. Having this sense of purpose may make them less difficult to deal with.Allowing options also helps older adults maintain a sense of autonomy. They want to feel independent and avoid being a burden. By providing options, you are also providing a sense of self-control.

, Sometimes parents are difficult because they agree to do something they’d rather not. As a result, they have an attitude and act resentful during the process. To combat this, tell them to be honest with you, instead of holding a passive-aggressive grudge.


After you ask them to do something, you could say, “Please be totally honest with me when answering. I’d rather you tell me ‘no’ than do something you don’t want to. Then it’s not enjoyable for anyone involved.”
Saying this may help them feel that being honest is helpful, instead of harsh.Understand that your parents may not be directly vocal about why they are being difficult. Ask them questions and try to get to the underlying reason of their displeasure.

Determine what you want from the relationship.,
Set the bar low.,
Accept what you get.",How to Spend Time with Difficult Parents As an Adult2," Before you begin to work on your relationship, you’ll need to decide what your end goal is. Then you’ll need to determine if what you want is realistic. Attempting to have a relationship or need fulfilled that is essentially impossible will only cause heartache and frustration for you.


If your parents treat you badly, and have always treated you badly, expecting them to perform a full 180 is likely futile. Wanting them to simply not criticize you constantly or be respectful of your life choices is a more attainable goal., If you’re already at your breaking point and can’t see your relationship getting any worse than it already is, having low expectations for your parents’ change is where you should start. Preparing yourself for the worst can stop additional hurt from occurring. If your parents actually do more than you expect, you may be pleasantly surprised.


For example, if you just want to spend more time with your parents, set a goal of one extra visit per month. Starting off small won’t be such a disappointment if your parents don’t follow through with their promises., The truth is, you’re not going to change your parents. Attempting to try to change them, the past, and anything else will likely only make the situation worse. Instead, accept the small improvements that may occur, or simply accept that nothing is going to happen. At least you know you tried."
"
Make visits short.,
Bring someone along who keeps you calm.,
Forgive, if you are able to.,
Go to therapy together, or separately.,
Decide if maintaining the relationship is worth it.,
Resist the temptation to react and engage.,
Talk to your siblings.",How to Spend Time with Difficult Parents As an Adult3," If your parents are difficult, you can protect your sanity by keeping all visits with them short and sweet. Don't cross your fingers and expect a weekend stay will go along smoothly. Set parameters that prevent their difficulties from getting under your skin.


For example, you might arrange to visit with other family and friends whenever you come home. That way, your parents are more understanding when you have to cut the visit short.
It may also help to stay in a hotel rather than bunking at their house, and rent a car so that you can find activities around town for when you and your parent need a break., Sometimes, a supportive friend can be just the armor you need to face difficult parents. If you have a empathetic friend or partner who understands your family dynamic, it may be wise to invite them with you to visits.


This person can serve as a buffer to minimize your parents' ""acting out."" They can also change the subject when things get tense, or make you laugh when you get upset.
You might say to a friend or partner, ""Would you mind going to visit my parents with me next weekend? I need someone there for support. I'll treat you to a nice dinner!"", Deciding to forgive your parents for their past and current mistakes can take a burden off of you. It allows you to let go of the hurt and grief you have held onto, and possibly move forward. Those who hold grudges are the ones who get hurt, not the ones who the grudge is against.


Consult with your religious advisor or therapist if you have difficulty with forgiveness. They may be able to guide you towards the path of letting go., Talking to a therapist may help you to repair your relationship with your difficult parents. Or, at the very least, it may help you to accept what happened and move on. Having your parents attend a session with you could assist you in understanding each other, which could improve your relationship.


When approaching your parents, you could say, “I really want to repair our relationship. What we have done in the past and present isn’t working. I think we owe it to ourselves, and our relationship, to go to therapy together.” If they don’t want to go, simply accept their decision and go alone., Sometimes, walking away from a relationship is the healthiest thing you can do. If your parents are toxic and attempting to be in their lives only causes pain and hardships for you, cutting ties may be the best decision. Cutting someone out is a major move, so you’ll need to think long and hard before you do so.


Recognize what the repercussions of cutting your parent out of your life are before you do so. Consider how it will affect your siblings, children, partner, other family members, and your conscience. Decide if you will feel guilty for doing so, and if that burden is worth it.
On the other hand, cutting ties may help you release resentment and hatred. Carefully weigh the pros and cons before making such a big decision., Sometimes, people are difficult because your reaction is reinforcing their negative behavior. Knowing that they were able to get under your skin and upset you may give your parents the satisfaction they need to continue the behavior.


Instead of reacting, simply acknowledge what they say or do, and move on. Over time, your mature responses may be what it takes for them to stop. It may also be helpful to take inventory and see if you are acting difficult, as well. Being difficult with others will often cause them to react in kind to you.

, If you have siblings, they likely have the same relationship with your parents as you. Ask them about their experiences and how they cope. They may be able to offer you insight on how they deal with your difficult parents. If nothing else, you can be sounding boards for each other.


For example, you could say, “I have a hard time dealing with our parents when they are being difficult. Do you find that they act this way with you? If so, how do you handle it?” Confiding in those who are going through the same thing you are can make you feel better and more optimistic about the relationship."

Be clear on what went wrong.,
Do some self-reflection.,
Put the ball in your own court.,
Contact your child.,
Write a letter.,
Accept limits they set.",How to Mend a Relationship With an Estranged Son or Daughter1," Before you attempt to reconnect with your child, it may be helpful to find out why your adult child is upset or angry with you. You may be able to get the information directly from your child, or you may need to find out from someone else who knows the situation. In order to mend fences, find out the problem first.Once you have a sense of what has gone wrong, you will have some time to think through your next steps, and what you want to communicate to your son or daughter.
Reach out to your adult child and ask. You could say, “Renee, I know you aren’t speaking to me right now, and I would like to know what I have done to hurt you. Could you please let me know? It’s okay if you don’t want to talk to me, but please write or email. I can’t fix the problem if I don’t know what it is.”
If you do not hear a response from your son or daughter, you could get in touch with another family member or mutual friend who might know what’s going on. You could say, “Jack, have you talked to your sister lately? She’s not speaking to me, and I can’t find out what the problem is. Do you know what’s going on?”
While discovering the reason behind the estrangement would be optimal, be aware that you may not be able to find out what is going on. However, don’t let that stop you from pursuing reconnecting with your child.;
, Spend some time thinking about the reasons behind the estrangement. Was it triggered by something from the past? Has there recently been a huge change of life that caused the rift (such as a death in the family, or a birth of a child)? Perhaps you even refused to communicate with your child for a period of time, and now find your child unwilling to communicate with you.


Keep in mind that many adult children become estranged from their parents because of their parents’ broken marriage. Children from a broken marriage experienced their parents prioritizing their happiness over the needs of the child (even if the divorce was for the best). Often, in these types of situations parents may speak badly about the other parent not realizing that their children are absorbing everything that is being said. This can have a drastic negative effect on the type of relationship an adult child may have with their parents. Especially, if there was was one parent that had little to no contact during the child’s upbringing. Adult children of divorce may be dealing with the pain of feeling like a low priority to their parents., Whether you have done anything wrong or not, parents are generally the ones who have to take the first steps toward reconciling with their estranged children. Look past the unfairness of the issue and leave your ego behind. If you want to reconnect with your child, know that you will need to be the one to reach out...and continue reaching out.Whether your child is fourteen or forty, they still want to know that they are loved and valued by their parents. A way to show you love and value them is that you are willing to fight for your relationship. Keep this in mind if you struggle with the unfairness of the burden of work it takes to reconnect.

, While you may want to meet with them in person right away, it may feel less intrusive to your son or daughter if you reach out via phone call, email, or letter. Honor their need for distance and give them the opportunity to respond at the time of their choosing. Be patient and allow a few days for your child’s response.


Rehearse what you want to say before making a phone call. Be prepared to leave a voicemail, too. You could say, “Tommy, I would really like for us to get together to talk about how you’re feeling. Would you be willing to meet with me sometime?”
Send an email or text message. You could write something like, “I understand you’re dealing with a lot of pain right now, and I am so sorry that I have hurt you. When you are ready, I hope you would be willing to meet with me to talk about it. Please let me know when you are. I love and miss you.”

, Your child may be unwilling to meet with you. If that’s the case, you could decide to write them a letter. Apologize for the hurt you’ve caused, and acknowledge that you understand why they feel the way they do.


Writing a letter can be therapeutic for you, too. It clarifies your feelings and helps you regulate your emotions. Plus, you can take as much time as you need to get your words just the way you want them.Suggest that the two of you meet when they are ready. You could write, “I know you are upset right now, but I hope that, in the future, we can get together and talk about this. My door is always open.”

, Your adult child may be open to communicating with you, but not be ready for a face-to-face meeting (and may never be). They may only want to email you or talk on the phone. Avoid guilt-tripping your child while keeping the door open for future encounters down the road.


If you are in an email-only relationship with your adult child, you could write, “I’m very happy that we are communicating via email these days. I hope we can get to the point where we feel comfortable reconnecting in person, but no pressure.”

Arrange for a meeting.,
Let your adult child lead the conversation.,
Listen to your child without judgment.,
Shoulder your share of the blame.,
Avoid discussing your feelings about the estrangement.,
Apologize.,
Consider family therapy.",How to Mend a Relationship With an Estranged Son or Daughter2," If your adult child is willing to talk with you in person, get together in a public place for a meal. Sharing a meal in public is a good idea, as you will be more likely to hold your emotions in check, and sharing a meal with someone is an act of building community.Make sure it is just the two of you meeting. Do not bring your spouse or other supportive person along. It may give your son or daughter the sense that they are being ganged up on.

, Listen to your child’s concerns without arguing against them or becoming defensive. They may also come to your meeting expecting an apology right away. If you sense that is the case, do so.It may be helpful to start off your meeting with an apology to let your adult child know that you understand that you caused them pain, and give them a sense of “leveling the playing field.” Once you apologize, you could ask your child to tell you more about what they have been feeling.

, Remember that their point of view is valid, even if you disagree with it. Healing can occur when a person feels listened to and understood, and you remain open to their perspective.Listening without judgment and defensiveness allows a person to be honest in their responses. What you hear may be extremely hurtful to you, but understand that your child probably needs to say it and get their feelings out.
You could say, “I feel so terrible that I made you feel this way, and I want to understand. Can you tell me more?”

, Understand that you can’t get far in reconciliation without acknowledging how you may have contributed to problem. Adult children want their parents to take responsibility for their actions. Be willing to do so, whether or not you believe you are/were wrong.While you may not understand why your son or daughter is upset with you, recognize that they are. Don’t try to defend your behavior. Listen instead, and apologize for causing them pain.Try to understand where your child is coming from. Showing empathy doesn’t mean you agree with someone, just that you understand their perspective. Understanding their perspective is an important part of resolving conflict.You could say, “I know I pushed you a lot growing up. I wanted you to be successful. But I can understand how you thought that I was never happy with you. That is not at all what I intended, and it is not at all true. But I can see how my behavior made you think that.”

, While it may seem unfair, now is not the time to bring up your sadness and pain around not being able to communicate with your child. Recognize that they needed some space to deal with their emotions and sort some things out. Bringing up your feelings of sadness, anger, and resentment may make your adult child feel like they are being guilt-tripped, and they may feel less likely to re-enter into a relationship.You could say something like, “I’ve missed talking to you, but I know sometimes you need to take some space.”
Do not say anything like, “I’ve been so depressed that you haven’t called me” or “Do you know the agony that I have been through, not hearing from you?”

, A good apology must clearly name what you did wrong (so that the listener knows you understand), express remorse, and offer to make amends in some way. Offer your son or daughter a heartfelt apology that acknowledges the pain you have caused them. Remember, apologize even if you believe your actions to be correct. The point is now about your child’s pain, not whether someone is right or wrong.You could say, “Tina, I’m so sorry I hurt you so badly. I know you had to deal with a lot when I was drinking. I feel terrible that I made so many mistakes in your childhood. I understand you wanting to keep your distance from me, but I hope we can work through it.”
Do not make any attempts to justify your action when apologizing, even if you believe you have a legitimate excuse for the action you took. For example, “I'm sorry I slapped you five years ago, but I did it because you talked back to me,” is not an apology and puts the other person on the defensive.
Remember that an effective, genuine apology apologizes for your action rather than someone else’s reaction. For example, “I’m sorry that my behavior hurt you,” is an effective apology. “I’m sorry if you got hurt,” is not. Never use “if” in an apology., If your adult child is willing, you may wish to seek out family therapy together in order to discuss your feelings in the presence of a trained professional. A marriage and family therapist will guide family members to identify dysfunctional family behaviors and develop their own solutions to a problem. Family therapy also works to acknowledge and enhance the connections family members have with each other.Family therapy is generally short-term and focuses on one problem plaguing the family. You or your child may be encouraged to see a therapist separately to focus on individual concerns.
To find a marriage and family therapist, you could ask your family doctor for recommendations, ask your community resource center or health department, or look online for a therapist near you.

Start slowly.,
Recognize that your child is an adult.,
Avoid giving parenting advice.,
Seek counseling for yourself.,
Be persistent, but not overbearing.,
Let go if necessary.",How to Mend a Relationship With an Estranged Son or Daughter3," Resist the urge to jump back into a relationship. In most cases, a broken relationship won't mend overnight. Depending on whether the root cause of the estrangement is mild or severe, it could take weeks, months, or even years to return to “normal.” You may also find a new normal.Keep in mind that you may need to have several hard conversations about the estrangement as both of you process your feelings. It is unlikely that you will have just one conversation, and then everything will be back the way it was.
Increase contact slowly. Meet your child alone in public places at first. Don’t invite them to loaded family events, like holiday parties, unless they seem ready and willing to attend.
You could say, “We’d love to have you join us at Thanksgiving, but I completely understand if you don’t want to. No hard feelings if you don’t, I know you need to take your time.”

, Your child is now an adult, capable of making their own decisions. You may not agree with some of their decisions, but you need to let your adult child be independent and live their own life. Meddling in your adult child’s life may have caused your child to put some distance between the two of you.Don’t offer unsolicited advice. Resist the urge to fix your child’s life and let them make their own mistakes.

, Parents can be easily upset by outside parenting advice, however well-intentioned it was meant to be. Do not offer your opinion unless asked. You’ve already raised your children, now give the next generation a chance to raise theirs.Let your child know that you will respect and defer to their parenting values and wishes. For example, if your grandchildren are limited to an hour of TV a day, let their parents know that you will abide by that rule in your house as well, or ask them first if it the rule needs to be broken.

, Dealing with an estranged child can be a very stressful, painful event in your life. It may be worth seeking out a qualified mental health professional to help you deal with your emotions and develop effective communication and coping strategies.You may wish to find a therapist who specializes in family issues. Keep in mind, however, that your individual therapist may refer you to a different therapist if you would like to have you and your child work out your issues with a counselor present. This is so the counselor can remain objective.
You may also be able to find assistance in online support group forums. You will be able find other people dealing with similar issues, and can talk through your problems and share success stories.

, If your son or daughter is refusing to respond to your attempts to communicate, keep trying. Send cards, write emails, or leave voicemails, letting them know you are thinking about them and want to talk.Make sure you give the person some space, however, and respect their need for privacy and distance. Contact them no more frequently than once a week, and reduce contact if you find out that your adult child finds this intrusive. But continue to stay in touch.
You could say, “Hi, Marisa, just wanted to say a quick hello and let you know I was thinking about you. I hope you’re doing well. I miss you. You know you can come to me whenever you want to talk. I love you.”
Don’t try to visit them. Acknowledge their boundaries and keep up with less intrusive forms of contact.

, Your adult child may see even your less intrusive attempts at getting in touch as overstepping boundaries and being too much. They may still not want to have anything to do with you, even if you have apologized and acknowledged your actions. In that case, it may be best to come to a place of acceptance for the sake of your own mental health, and step back from pursuing a relationship.Put the ball in your child’s court. Send a note or leave a voicemail that says something like, “Peter, I understand that you want me to stop contacting you. Though it upsets me, I will respect that and will not contact you after this. If you ever want to reconnect, I will be here, but I will honor your wishes and not be in touch again. I love you.”
Keep in mind that reconciliation may be difficult in cases of substance abuse, mental illness, or an unhealthy relationship in your child’s marriage/partnership (for example, your child is married to a controlling spouse). Your estrangement may only be the result of these problems, but you may not be able to do anything about it until your child addresses these underlying issues.If your child requests no contact at all, consider finding a therapist to help you work through your grief. This is difficult terrain to navigate, and you may find yourself needing additional support.

Accept that your child sees life from a different perspective.,
Accept each other’s differences.,
Respect their right to disagree with you.",How to Mend a Relationship With an Estranged Son or Daughter4," You all may have lived in the same house and spent most of your days together, but one person’s perception of a situation could still be completely different than another’s. Acknowledge that your adult child’s recollection or perspective is just as valid as yours.A person’s view of the situation may be totally different based on age, the power dynamic, or closeness of relationships. For example, moving to a new city may have been great for you, but your children may have struggled because they had no choice but to tag along.Separate realities are a part of family life. For example, when you were a child, your parents may have taken you to a museum. Their memory of the day may be of interesting exhibits and a fun family outing. You may remember being too hot in your coat and that the dinosaur skeletons scared you. Neither your or your parents’ recollection is invalid, they are just different points of view., You may be estranged because one, the other, or both of you do not approve of the other’s life choices. While you may not be able to do much about your child’s attitude toward you, you can show your child that you accept them for who they are, no matter what.Take steps to show your child your change of heart. For example, if your child is gay, and you belong to a conservative congregation, find a congregation that is more liberal and accepting. #*You could let your child know that you are reading a certain book to try to understand their point of view.
If your child is not speaking to you because they disapprove of your life choices, it will be more difficult. Be firm and confident in who you are, and keep showing them you love them. Do your best to keep communicating with them and looking for opportunities to see them.

, You don't have to change your opinions or beliefs, just refrain from showing disrespect for theirs. You can disagree with someone and still respect and love them. Not everyone’s opinion needs to be the same.Honor their differences of opinion as best you can. If you are religious and your adult child is an atheist, for example, you could decide to skip church the weekend they are visiting.
Find different topics of conversation than your contentious issues. If your adult child starts to engage you in conversation on topics that have made you argue in the past, you could say, “Will, let’s agree to disagree on this for right now. I think the only thing we do when we talk about this is upset each other.”

Distance yourself from your toxic parent.,
Take responsibility for your own emotional health.,
Build up your self-esteem.,
Practice good self-care.,
See a therapist.",How to Move on from a Toxic Parent1," Getting some space from your parent will help you feel confident enough to stand up for yourself as an adult. Even if you don’t want to cut off contact with your parent, reduce your communication and visits for a while. See how you feel when your parent has a less prominent role in your life.Often people in toxic environments don’t realize how dysfunctional the people around them are. If you’ve spent a lot of time around your parent in the past, distancing yourself may provide some much-needed perspective on your situation.
For example, when you spend some time apart from your mother and find others sources of support, you might recognize how little support she provides. Or, even more, you might notice that she not only doesn't offer support, but requires it from you.;
, If one or both of your parents are toxic, you will have to give yourself the support and care they should have provided. This isn’t an ideal situation, or a fair one, but the sooner you accept it, the sooner you can move on from your parent and work on healing yourself.Avoid holding out hope that your parent will see their mistakes and work with you to repair the relationship. If they were going to change, they would have done it a long time ago.
Don't think that distancing yourself will miraculously change them, for instance. You need to be okay with getting time and space for your own emotional well-being--not simply to force them into changing.

, Challenging your negative self-talk is an effective way to start repairing the damage of a toxic upbringing. If your parent frequently made fun of you or put you down, you might be in the habit of criticizing yourself harshly – maybe even in their voice. Practice shutting down this critical inner voice and reminding yourself of your strengths instead.For instance, if you catch yourself thinking “I’m nothing but a burden,” shut that thought down and replace it with, “I help my friends when they need it, and I’m productive at work.”
Make a list of all your best attributes and slide it into your wallet or post it on your bathroom mirror. Review the list whenever you start doubting your abilities.

, As an adult, you’re no longer dependent on your parents to take care of your physical and emotional health. Recognize and honor your own needs by adopting a healthy lifestyle and making time to relax.Several healthy habits that can make a big difference in the way you feel include eating a clean diet, getting eight hours of sleep every night, and getting some exercise most days of the week.
You can take care of your emotional health by meditating, writing in a journal, or working on a creative hobby.

, A mental health professional can help you work through your feelings towards your toxic parent. With their guidance, you can learn to respect yourself, cope with the pain your parent caused you, and move on with your life.Talk to your family doctor in order to receive a referral for mental health therapist who can help with your circumstances.

Think carefully about whether to go no contact.,
Avoid putting yourself at the mercy of your parent.,
Take control of conversations.,
Let your parent know what behaviors you won’t accept anymore.,
Walk away if your parent disrespects your boundaries.",How to Move on from a Toxic Parent2," Making the decision to “divorce” a toxic parent can be very difficult. In some cases, cutting contact might be necessary for your mental health and happiness. In other cases, you may be able to maintain a relationship by setting better personal boundaries with your parent. Make this decision with your long-term well-being in mind.It might help to write out a pros and cons list. Write out all the benefits of getting distance with your parent versus any disadvantages you can think of. You might include pros such as ""Peace of mind,"" while cons might be ""Missing their presence.""

, If you decide to maintain your relationship with your parent, establish that you are an independent adult now. Don’t put yourself in situations where you won’t be able to leave if you need to. Instead, set limits on when and where you’ll see your parent.For instance, don’t stay overnight at your parent’s house, and don’t let them drive you places. Consider meeting them in public instead of at home, so they’ll be less likely to say or do something hurtful.

, If your parent tends to hijack conversations by belittling you or bossing you around, change the topic instead of letting them continue. If that doesn’t work, tell them you have to go, and break off the conversation.For instance, if your mother is criticizing the way you’ve redecorated your house, you could redirect the conversation by saying, “I like how the living room looks now. What did you do last weekend?”

, Set boundaries for what you’re not willing to live with. Then tell your parent what you need from them and what actions you will take if they don’t respect your boundaries.For example, say something like, “Dad, it’s not okay with me that you insult my husband when he’s not here. I need you to stop doing that around me, or I’ll have to leave.”
Only set consequences that you can enforce. For instance, don’t threaten to leave unless you are prepared to do so.

, If your toxic parent ignores your requests, remove yourself from the situation. Stand up for yourself by walking away, hanging up the phone, or following through with another consequence.Your parent might try to test your boundaries to see if you really mean what you say.
If your parent repeatedly disrespects your boundaries and seems unwilling to make an effort to cooperate, consider decreasing or ending your contact with them.

Cultivate relationships outside your family circle.,
Choose friends who are emotionally healthy.,
Look out for any toxic behaviors you may have inherited.",How to Move on from a Toxic Parent3," Spend time with your friends regularly, or make new friends by reaching out to co-workers, classmates, and other people you see often. Social support is an important part of emotional health, and having a few good friends can help heal the hurt caused by a toxic parent.Take the initiative and join groups, classes or activities with people who have similar interests as you. Introduce yourself and ask questions about them. Choose to be with people who value your presence and who make you feel good about who you are as a person.

, People who grew up with toxic parents often subconsciously choose friends and romantic partners who recreate the same dynamic. Take a look at your social circle and evaluate whether your relationships are built on mutual liking, helpfulness, and trust.If you discover that you have some toxic friendships, it’s probably best to distance yourself from those people.
Listen to your instincts when selecting new friends. Do you often feel uncomfortable, pressured, or frightened around them? Do they shame you into doing things you don't want to? Stay way from these types of people.

, You might not like to think about it, but it’s possible that you could have learned some toxic behaviors from your parent. Abuse and toxicity often run in families because children learn from the adults around them. Be aware of your own behavior and take steps to correct any negative habits you notice in yourself.Having a few learned toxic behaviors doesn’t mean you’re a toxic person, especially if you are willing to work on making changes.

Invite your child-free friends to your child’s birthday parties and events.,
Ask your friends to babysit or participate in school fundraisers.,
Plan shared events in kid-friendly venues.,
Make plans even if you might have to break them.,
Ask your friend to come over if you can’t leave the house.",How to Stay Friends with Non‐Parents After Having Kids1," You might assume that your friends wouldn’t want to go to a kid’s birthday party or a child-filled holiday celebration, but think again! Your friend is your friend because they love you and want to spend time with you, period. And if they don’t want to go, they’ll simply decline the invitation. Either way, it doesn’t hurt to ask, and chances are that your friend will appreciate the invitation as an expression of effort and inclusion.If your friend accepts, you can be extra considerate by providing some adult beverages, having a few other child-free friends in attendance, and making some one-on-one time for your friend at the party.;
, Just as a simple party invitation can express your desire to see, include, and embrace your child-free friend, a request for help can also be a meaningful gesture. You’re showing your friend that you still want them to be a part of your life, even if that life has changed since the time when you first became friends. Again, if your friend doesn’t want to babysit or help out with a school event, they can always decline, but at least you’ve reached out and tried to include them in your family life.For example, ask your friend to come over while you run an errand or go to a meeting, or see if they’d like to walk around the neighborhood with you and your child to sell candy bars or collect signatures on a petition.

, It can seem like adult- and kid-friendly zones are mutually exclusive; families with kids go to parks, bowling alleys, and pizza restaurants, while child-free adults go to bars, clubs, fancy restaurants, and nice house parties. If you think of it this way, socializing with your child-free friends can seem almost impossible. But, if you find venues and events which cater to both age groups, you can seamlessly combine family and friend activities.For example, barbecues, camping, and sporting events are great activities equally comfortable for kids, parents, and people without kids.

, Some parents find themselves drifting apart from child-free friends because they they think their hectic family schedules won't permit a meet-up. Rather than risking the need to flake out on a friend, they don’t make any plans at all. If you do this, though, you guarantee you’ll miss out on friend time, whereas taking the chance can occasionally pan out.If you’re worried that your friend will feel miffed or upset if you have to cancel, talk to them! Chances are, your friend is already more than aware of your demanding schedule, but if you don’t think they’ll understand, be clear about your scheduling issues ahead of time and warn them that you might have to cancel.

, Being a parent can mean that you don’t have much time to spend outside of the house. Whether you live in the country, the suburbs, or the heart of the city, it can be too much of a time crunch to meet your friend for lunch or for a drink at a bar. Ask instead for your friend to come over to your house so that you can chat and still be at home for the kids.Be sure to appreciate your friend’s effort! After all, they might have preferred to meet at a bar or café just like in the old days, but they’re making the compromise in order to see and catch up with you. Show your appreciation by supplying the wine and snacks, or buying your friend some flowers or candy.

Ask yourself if you always feel like the parent.,
Think about their health.,
Consider logistics.,
Reflect on your responsibilities.,
Decide whether you've made substantial effort.",How to Handle Emotionally Needy Parents1," Do you often feel like you are the only grown up when dealing with your parents? Are they fixated only on their needs, asking you to help fulfill them instead of taking care of themselves?? Has it been this way for a very long time If this is the case, then your parents may be emotionally immature and you will need to set strong boundaries, work on your own reactions, and stop expecting them to change.If you feel like your parent has become more needy due to declining heath and being unable to functionally take care of themselves, then you will need a different approach. This will require greater sensitivity, and you will likely need the support of siblings and any other family members, as well as outside help.;
, If your parents' neediness is something new, you need to take their overall health into consideration. New behaviors indicate that something has changed in their lives. Ultimately, your parents may want or need extra emotional support because of their deteriorating health.When thinking about this, consider:


Do they have a medical problem? A recent diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening disease may cause a parent to seem more emotionally needy. In the end, they may just want to spend more time with you, or they may need extra support.
Have they been diagnosed with a cognitive or psychological problem? Parents with Alzheimer’s or other cognitive problems may need extra help and may come off as needy.
Do they have mobility limitations? For instance, are they wheelchair-bound or have a related problem? If a parent is unable to move themselves around, they may feel frustrated and want more emotional support., When putting together your plan of how to deal with your emotionally needy parents, you need to consider basic logistical facts. Ultimately, logistics will determine a large part of how you’ll deal with your parents. Consider:


How close you live. If you live far away, you may have to attend to your parents over the phone and via email. Let them know that you simply can’t visit them as often as they’d like. Let them know this by saying “Mom, we live so far apart and my responsibilities make it so I can’t visit as much as you want.”
If they can travel independently. If they can’t travel independently (and you live far away), you’ll have to be up front about the limited amount of visiting you’ll be able to do. Say something like, “Dad, I want to visit more often, but I can’t get away as often as you would like.”If you have siblings or other family members who can help out. Work out a schedule with your siblings to ensure that your parents needs are being met without any one sibling doing all the work and getting burned out.

, After logistics, your personal responsibilities will help determine the level of attention you can devote to your parents. Ultimately, you simply may not be able to provide the attention they demand.


Do you have dependent children? If so, you may be limited in the amount of time and care you can offer your parents. Let your parents know that your parental responsibilities limit the amount of time you can share with them.
Are you financially restricted? If you don’t the financial resources, you may not be able to visit your parents as much as you like – tell them.
Do you have substantial work obligations? If you work a lot, hold several different jobs, or travel frequently for work, you may not be able to dedicate as much time as they want. Your parents should know this fact., Once you've assessed the situation, spend a little time thinking about whether you've acted as a caring and responsible child. This will help you determine if you're partly to blame or if your parents are indeed needy. Before deciding, ask yourself:


Do you visit or contact your parents as much as your siblings or your peers? If you don't, you might be neglecting your parents.
Do you respond to your parents in a caring and loving way? For instance, if you seem annoyed or rushed when you talk with them on the phone, they may feel neglected.
Is the contact you have with your parents mutual? For instance, if your parents are always calling you, and you don't call them independently, they may feel taken for granted."

Ask questions about your friend’s life.,
Be mindful of insensitive words.,
Limit your child-centric and mundane talk.,
Select special pictures of your children.",How to Stay Friends with Non‐Parents After Having Kids2," Your child-filled life can be so crazy and time-, energy-, and thought-consuming that you don’t even notice how often you talk about it. While your friend is probably happy to listen to your troubles and triumphs, be sure to reciprocate and find out about what’s going on in their life.By the same token, don’t assume that your friend is swimming in fun and frivolous free time, or that their own concerns can’t compare with your own now that you’ve got children. Make a conscious effort to be empathetic and remember how jam-packed your life was, even before kids.
This goes for your social media interactions as well! You might take for granted that your friends tirelessly ‘like’ your Facebook posts and comment on your pictures, but ask yourself if you show the same interest and support in their social media posts.

, Ask any childless person whether or not their parent-friends have ever said something hurtful, and they’ll probably respond in the affirmative. Think carefully about certain common phrases, such as “Don't you want a family?” or “Gosh I’m so jealous of all your free time!” Seemingly innocuous, these statements implicitly assume that without children a person lacks a family, and that a person without kids is automatically less busy than parents.In particular, be careful about statements regarding work, time, commitments, and values. For example, even if you think saying, “Now that I have a baby, I can’t believe I used to think a career was important!” is an expression of how much you love your baby and nothing more, think again! To the child-free friend, you’re critiquing not only the value they’ve placed on work, but also their whole set of priorities and the very meaningfulness of their lives., Your friends—be they parents or not—care about your life and want to hear about it. That being said, even the most selfless and patient friend can get exhausted by a barrage of largely unrelatable potty time and burping stories, so be aware of how much time you spend on these mundane topics. After all, you can share all the kiddie-capers you want with your parent pals.Instead, pick a few of the funniest playtime stories, and also try to include some non-child-themed subjects, such as work, movies, or food.

, Every parent loves to photograph their child, and there’s no reason you shouldn’t take as many photos as your heart desires. Though your parents and in-laws are probably eager to see every one of them, your friends could probably live with just a smattering. Pick out a few next time you meet up and flip through them for your friend, but don’t spend all your together-time on family albums.


Conversely, ask to see pictures of your friend’s life! Even if they don’t have kids, their phones are probably chock-full of pictures of siblings, nieces, nephews, parents, pets, travel, friends, and adventures which they’d love to show you.

"
"
Schedule special dates and friend-time.,
Call, email, or text your friend when you can’t meet in person.,
Make thoughtful gestures expressing support when you can’t talk.",How to Stay Friends with Non‐Parents After Having Kids3," Unless you have a full-time nanny and household staff, your friend-time has probably been seriously restricted since having children. This change is natural and understandable, but you should still make an effort to get together occasionally if you want to remain close friends.For example, book a babysitter one night and go to dinner and a movie just like the old days! Or do something new and explore the local farmers market or a gallery opening. Just make sure the planned activity allows for plenty of conversation.
If you can’t get a babysitter, have your friend come over after kids’ bedtime so you can watch an R-rated movie and catch up.

, The daily demands and logistics of parenthood can mean that you rarely get to see your non-parent friends. This doesn’t mean you have to lose all contact, though. Even a short text or an email of a funny YouTube video can show your friend you’re thinking of them and haven’t forgotten them in the fog of family life.Texting and emails can be great ways to stay in frequent communication, but don’t underestimate the power of a good, old-fashioned phone call. Next time you’re waiting in line at the market or doing the laundry, ring up your friend for a ten-minute chat.

, Your child-free friends have probably spent many hours babysitting and listening to your parenting woes—not to mention the presents they’ve probably purchased over the years for you and your family—so think about returning the favor! Show how much you appreciate your friend despite the differences in your lives by making a special, caring gesture.


For example, send a care package full of coffee, wine, and snacks, buy them a workout gear or weekly meal subscription box, or mail them a gift certificate.

Avoid letting them control or manage your life.,
Accept emotionally immature parents.,
Talk to them about how their emotional needs are problematic, if necessary.,
Limit contact, if you need.",How to Handle Emotionally Needy Parents2," While it may seem mean or callous to limit the information your parents have about what you’re doing, you may need to do so to stop them from turning into ever-present and overbearing figures in your daily life. If you have ruled out a medical cause as the reason for increased ""neediness,"" or this has been an ongoing issue, you may need need to set very clear limits, or boundaries, with your parents.


All contacts should be mutually-agreeable. Don’t let your parents dictate what or where you do something.
Don’t let your parents know every detail of your daily schedule. If they do, there is a chance they could be present much more than you’re comfortable with.
If you’re an adult, make it clear that you don’t want to micromanaged.
Let them know that it is not okay to stop by your house, apartment, or dorm randomly. For instance, say “Mom, I love you, but I’m an independent person with my own life and responsibilities. I’d appreciate it if you’d give me some personal space.”, If your parents have a long history of being needy and interfering in your life, then you may need to simply accept that this is who they are. Instead of trying to change them, focus on how to protect yourself. Decide what you will and will not accept from them, and let them know that there are consequences for violating those boundaries.For instance, you might say, “Mom, I'm happy to go shopping with you once a month, but I don't have time to do it every weekend.” Or you might say, “Dad, I love seeing you, but you cannot continue to let yourself into my house whenever you feel like it. You need to call first and we can agree on a time and place to meet. If you do it again, I am going to ask for my emergency key back.”
If your parents try to draw you into arguments, set a boundary by walking away. Say, “I'm not willing to discuss this any further.”

, There may come the time when you need to sit down with your parents and have a serious and prolonged conversation about their emotional needs and your life. If this happens, you need to explain how their actions and neediness interfere with your need to be an independent person.


Schedule a time to talk with them, like over a coffee or a meal.
Explain to them that while you love and care for them, their neediness or behavior is causing problems for you. For example, say “Mom, while I love you, the amount of time you want to spend together is causing me to neglect my own duties as a parent and a professional.”
Allow them to explain how they feel. For instance, say something like “Mom, am I misunderstanding your needs?”
Ask your parent if there is any underlying problem they want to talk about. You might discover that there is something like a recently diagnosed medical issue that has been influencing their behavior.
Make sure to explain to them the importance of your personal boundaries., At some point you may need to limit contact with your parents. Ultimately, this is a final and extreme step if communication and other ways of interacting with them have failed.


Limiting contact may be necessary when you have parents that are mentally ill or abusive.

If your parents are ill, then this may require an initial period of increased contact. For instance, as you work out their care (for instance, dividing the work between family members, hiring a nurse or other outside help, or moving them to a nursing home). You want to make sure their basic needs (including company and human contact) are being met and that they are getting the necessary medical care for their illness.
If your parents are simply overbearing and refuse to honor your boundaries, then you may need to call them and explain that their actions have driven a wedge between you. For instance, say ""Mom, I've explained to you how your actions are negatively impacting my life. I think we need to both take a step back.
Limiting contact needs to be a unilateral step — you take it on your own without input from your parents. Don't allow them to try to negotiate with you.
Explain that limiting contact will last a certain amount of time, or until you think they will permanently change their behavior. For instance, say ""Dad, I'm very busy over the next month. If you can respect my autonomy, I'd like to get together next month.""
As part of limiting contact, you may need to recommend that your parents seek psychological help or support from a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist."
"
Be polite.,
Share how much you care about them.,
Have a complete and productive conversation.,
Initiate regular contact.,
Make the most of your visits.",How to Handle Emotionally Needy Parents3," Whenever you talk to your parents, you should be polite and loving. While their neediness and actions might frustrate you, you need to remember that they love and care about you. Use this opportunity to return the favor by showing them politeness and respect.


Don’t be abrupt or short when you answer their phone calls or emails. Instead of saying something like “I don’t have time for this now, mom” say “Hi mom, I’d love to chat right now but can’t. Can I call you back later?”
Avoid snapping at them. While you may be very frustrated with their neediness, do your best to never snap at them. Never say things like “Mom, I just can’t handle your neediness anymore!”
Remember that you can’t take back mean things once you say them., Under almost all circumstances, you should make sure that you share your feelings about your parents with them. Ultimately, by letting them know that you care about them, too, you may relieve some of the stress and anxiety they are suffering that is causing them to be needy.


Tell your parents you love and care about them whenever you talk to them. For instance, whenever you call, say something like “Mom, I was thinking about you and wanted to touch base.”
If your parents end a conversation with “love you,” you should reciprocate. This probably means a lot to them., Parental neediness problems may be resolved simply by having complete conversations with your parents. By having complete, full, and productive conversations, you'll show that you care.


Ask them about their lives. For instance, ask them about their parents or their experiences as children.
Demonstrate that you care about their opinions. For example, ask them advice about parenting, budgeting, or home improvement.
Let the conversation progress naturally. For instance, try not to wind down a conversation or end it prematurely. Your mom may simply enjoy talking about many seemingly insignificant things with you.
Make time to talk, so your conversation is not rushed. For instance, set a one hour block aside to talk to your parents every Sunday afternoon, and avoid calling when you're doing something else, like driving your kids to an activity., A great way to deal with emotionally needy parents is to head them off by making sure you keep in contact with them. By calling them on a regular basis, you’ll let them know that you care about them. You’ll also take control of the situation and establish a routine.


Call them once a week around the same time. By calling at say, Friday at 5pm, you’ll establish a regular time during which you can call. This way, they’ll know when to expect your call and might feel better about it.
Send them a greeting card occasionally, especially if they don't use a computer. Even if you only write a few lines, it is a gesture that can say a great deal with a few words. It's also something they can look at and re-read if they need reassurance.
Consider sending them emails, if they can access them. Don’t underestimate the impact that a thoughtful email may have for your parents.
Send them text messages, if they can access them. While text messages are easy to send off, they might mean a whole lot to your parents.
Try to establish a regular schedule when you’ll visit with your parents. For instance, if you live in the same city, try to visit with them every Sunday, or more regularly if you want.Notice any significant changes in your parents' speech, ideas or approach to you. This may indicate a shift in their mental or physical well-being. Don't be too quick to assume they are just being annoying or demanding — really listen to what they are saying.

, The best way to make your parents feel attended to is to use every visit as an opportunity to spend quality time with them. By making the most of the time you spend with them, you'll potentially reduce their neediness.


In-person visits are perhaps the most impactful way to show that you care. If you don’t visit your parents regularly, they’ll begin to feel as if you don’t care about them.
Make sure you focus your attention on them and ask them questions about how they’re doing when you visit them. For instance, say something like ""Anything new in your neighborhood?""
Ask them questions about their interests, their friends, and their health."
"
Paint a positive picture of your in-laws for your parents.,
Avoid telling your parents negative things about your in-laws.,
Tell your parents about your in-laws’ habits and quirks.",How to Help Your Parents Get Along with Your In‐Laws1," If you talk to your parents about your in-laws, you’re creating expectations – positive or negative – for when they eventually meet each other. Set the stage for positive future interactions by telling your parents about your in-laws’ good qualities.Establish common ground ahead of time by pointing out similarities between your family and your partner’s family. You might provide an example like ""They are very family-oriented--just like us. They have Sunday dinners with the entire family each week.""
If you dislike your in-laws, try to find something positive to say anyways. For instance, tell your parents that your mother-in-law is great at organizing events, not that you think she’s overbearing.;
, If you complain to your parents about your partner’s family, they might dislike your in-laws before ever meeting them. You don’t have to love your in-laws, but it’s best to reserve your venting for your friends, not your parents.If you’ve already told your parents what you don’t like about your partner’s family, do damage control by bringing up things you do appreciate about your in-laws.
Remember, you are striving to build lifelong relationships and your parents deserve to make up their own minds about their new in-laws.

, Every family has their own idiosyncrasies and sensitive subjects. Give your parents an idea of what they can expect when they meet your in-laws, and let them know if there are any topics they should avoid bringing up. Ask your partner to give their parents a similar heads-up.This step is especially important if your families are from two different cultures or have very different outlooks on life. Something to the effect of ""My new father-in-law works at the university, so he's quite brilliant. But, be warned: he'll drag you into hours' long conversations about insects.""

Introduce your parents and in-laws before they meet in person.,
Choose a neutral, relaxed location for the first meeting.,
Prepare topics of conversation ahead of time.,
Steer clear of controversial topics of conversation.,
Pick up the check if you’re eating at a restaurant.",How to Help Your Parents Get Along with Your In‐Laws2," Help your parents and in-laws break the ice ahead of time by introducing them to each other over a phone or video call. If they are reluctant or tech-averse, even an email or a handwritten note can help your parents and in-laws feel more at ease when meeting each other in person.Although age-old tradition dictates that the groom’s family should reach out to the bride’s first. Many families choose to break this tradition. In most recent years, it’s perfectly fine for you and your partner to initiate a meeting between your parents if you want to. Respect any cultural factors that you or your partner deem important. Starting out on the right foot here, can make a world of difference through the years!

, If you and your partner share a house or apartment, consider inviting your parents there. Other good places for the first meeting could include a casual restaurant, an outdoor barbecue, or a coffee shop. Avoid meeting at your parents’ or in-laws’ house, which might make the other set of parents feel out of place.Plan the first meeting around either food or an activity of some kind. This will minimize awkward silences and give your parents and in-laws something to bond over.
If you’re making a meal, be sure the food will appeal to everyone. Check with your partner about whether their parents have any dietary restrictions or dislike certain foods.

, Meeting new people can be a little awkward for everyone, so you and your partner will probably have to carry much of the conversation during your parents’ first meeting. Think of some things to talk about ahead of time, so you can fill in gaps in the conversation smoothly.One of the best ways to spark conversations is to find common ground between your parents and your in-laws. For instance, you could tell your car-loving father-in-law that your dad also likes to work on classic cars.
Another great conversation starter is to talk about the family composition on each side. For example, you can ask about their other children, siblings, grandchildren, etc.

, To prevent any unintentional offense or hurt feelings, avoid hot-button topics like politics, religion, or controversial news stories. Keep the conversation light, positive, and relatable.When in doubt, you can always talk about pets, food, or the weather.
You and your partner should identify controversial topics on each side before your parents and in-laws meet, and plan to avoid these topics.

, You and your partner can avoid any awkward situations when the check arrives by paying the bill yourselves. Find the waiter and give them your credit card ahead of time.This is an especially good idea if there’s an income discrepancy between your parents and your partner’s parents.

Have your parents and your in-laws help with wedding planning.,
Invite your parents and in-laws to casual family get-togethers.,
Ask your partner to help resolve conflicts with their parents.,
Avoid expecting your parents and in-laws to become best friends.",How to Help Your Parents Get Along with Your In‐Laws3," Many couples introduce their parents and in-laws to each other after announcing their engagement. If this is the case for you and your partner, find ways to involve both of your families in planning your wedding.


Working towards a common goal will give your parents and in-laws a sense of camaraderie and a chance to get to know each other better., If your parents and your partner’s parents live nearby and enjoy each other’s company, invite them over occasionally for dinner or an activity. Chatting over a meal or playing ping-pong together can foster a sense of family bonding., Your partner knows their family best, and they probably have a good idea of how to handle disagreements with their parents. If you or your family run into conflicts with your in-laws, ask your partner to step in and help you smooth things out.You might say, ""Honey, I think your Mom was a bit insensitive about my family's religious views. Would you mind talking to them about that so we can prevent problems in the future?""

, It’s great when parents and in-laws hit it off, but realistically, that’s not always possible. Do your best to ensure your parents get along with your partner’s parents when they get together, but don’t try to force a connection if it doesn’t happen naturally.Also, don't feel like it is a personal failing if your two families don't click. Remember, it is your relationship with your partner that is most important. Letting go of your expectations may help make it easier to accept whatever happens.
If it's clear the two sides detest one another, you might consider only inviting both sides to big events. It might be nice to split holidays or vacations between families to keep down confusion.

You can place items and pictures that represent important moments in your lost loved one’s life on this table. Others choose to do a memory slideshow where pictures scroll on a screen throughout the celebration.Aside from a slideshow or memory table, you could decorate with pictures from the person’s life, keepsakes that they cherished, or other items that reflect the life of your loved one.;
, Have small tokens placed out where guests can take one. Make sure it is small enough to keep in a pocket or purse. When the guest carries the token with them, they will encounter it throughout their day (like when they reach in their purse) and remember your loved one.A coin of some kind or a small bead chain would make great take aways.

, A collection of memories can add substance to the celebration, and allow guests to share their favorite memories with your loved one. That said, many guests will not be comfortable sharing their stories in front of everyone. Have a journal out so that each guest can write something in it to contribute to the memory of your loved one.Another great idea for sharing memories is to have a memory jar and notecards out. The guests write their memories on a notecard and place them into the jar.

, It is important to allow people to grieve in whatever way is culturally acceptable. However, some extreme forms of grieving might frighten young children, such as sobbing or screaming. If you are worried about children being frightened by these displays of grief, then you may want to prepare a separate room or space for any children who will be in attendance.You can provide things like games, coloring books and crayons, and toys for the children to enjoy.


Another part of staying child friendly is to avoid the irresponsible use of alcohol. While it is acceptable to have alcohol at the event (if you prefer), no one should be permitted to drink so much that they lose their sense of reservation. Also, anyone who is driving (especially with children in the car) should not consume alcohol.

, This type of celebration is meant to complement or replace a traditional funeral where the grieving process is generally consumed with sorrow for the death of a loved one. While a celebration of life is still a way to grieve, the focus should be on the happy moments of your loved one’s life instead of the painful moments after their passing. To keep things upbeat, include their favorite music, or music that reminds you of them. You also might consider having a dance floor or other ways to keep people moving about., People often express some preference as to how they would like to be remembered when they pass. Make a genuine effort to honor these preferences during the celebration of life. It will make the celebration more meaningful and reflective of the life your loved one lived,For example, your loved one might have expressed wanting a ceremony in the woods. In this case, you could hold the celebration of life out in nature, or if the weather is too cold, in a lodge or cabin surrounded by woods.

, Starting with the guest list can give you a good idea of what the celebration will look like. Write down the name of anyone you can think of that might want to attend. Anytime you think of a new name, write it on the list. You can reach out to these guests as you plan the next stages of the celebration., Here is the first place your guest list can come in handy. Contact guests on the list, especially those who were particularly close to your loved one, and ask them for dates that they could possibly attend. This is especially important for guests that will be traveling long distances.A great way to do this is to get everyone’s email address and send out a poll (e.g. Doodle Poll) that gives guests an array of possible dates. Each guest can select any of the dates that they can attend, and you can set a date based on the results.

, Your venue will also be dictated by your guests. Obviously, you need to select a venue that is large enough to house all of your guests, but you should also consider things such as handicap accessibility and how child friendly your venue is before deciding. You can also make a shortlist of venues that would serve the celebration well, and ask your guests for their input.Some possible venues include churches, schools, outdoor spaces (parks, campgrounds, etc.), and a host of other unique spots that might house a special celebration.

, One of the perks to a celebration of life is that it is free flowing. That said, you can make things go much smoother by having some agenda made. Send this agenda to all guests ahead of time, or hand it out as guests arrive. The order of events should include things like:


When does the celebration start?
When will each speaker speak?
When will food be served?
When will any other special events take place?
When is the celebration set to end?

, Not all celebrations will have formal speakers. If you do want guests to speak, you should ask them ahead of time so that they have time to prepare something to say. If someone prefers not to speak, remember that many people are fearful of public speaking, especially in such an emotional setting., If there will be multiple food options, an RSVP can help you determine how many of each option will need to be prepared. Another common way to hold a celebration of life is to ask guests to bring specific dishes, such as salad or pie. These special dishes often reflect the favorite foods of the loved one who has passed. For an even more free flowing event, you could request that each guest bring a dish for a potluck at the celebration.You can also ask guests to bring drinks, plates, napkins, etc.
It is not necessary to serve food at the celebration, but you should make it clear to guests that they need to eat before they arrive.

, As you plan the event, others may offer advice or suggestions. You are not obligated to change the celebration multiple times at every guest’s request, but be open to good ideas that can make the celebration more meaningful. After all, many of your guests were close to your loved one as well and can offer great insight into their life.


For example, if someone were to suggest hanging pictures from your loved one’s favorite art collection during the celebration, you could acknowledge that as a good idea and incorporate it into the celebration.

, Keeping pictures in photo album is a great way to preserve the memory of a person, but does not stand out on a day to day basis. One way to celebrate a person’s life in the comfort of your home is to hang pictures that remind you of them. You can hang a picture of the person, or even a picture of something they loved.For example, you could hang a picture of the person’s favorite scenery, or their most cherished piece of artwork.

, By creating a small space in your home to keep some of your loved one’s favorite belongings, you will be celebrating the things in life that they cherished. For example, you could clear off one shelf of your book shelf to keep their favorite books. This gesture can even be as simple as keeping their favorite coffee mug in the kitchen or dining area.

, Some people paint masterpieces in their lifetimes, others build beautiful things. What all people have in common is that they express themselves in some way, and it touches the people close to them. Save something that your loved one created in their life that was significant to you, even if it is as simple as a handwritten note that says “I love you.”Sometimes the things they created might not be durable (e.g. a handwritten note), but you can have these things preserved in other ways. For a note, you could scan it to the computer and have a digital copy. The digital copy could even be used for engraving or reprinting onto a more permanent surface like metal or glass.

, Build a small monument to honor your loved one. This could something as simple as a bench outside, or a rocking chair inside. You can also choose to plant a tree or flower that reminds you of your loved one. This way, there will always be something to remind you of them., Another way to honor your loved ones is to talk about them. Share their stories and memories with other people who knew them. You can even utilize the internet to create a page in remembrance of your loved one.Another great way to share stories is to use social media. Posting about your loved one and asking others to share their stories can involve many people in the conversation and capture a wide variety of memories.

, Choosing a specific day to celebrate the person may help. This will allow you to treat the day like a holiday for that person and focus on what they meant to you. Try celebrating the person's life on a significant day, such as the person's birthday or on an anniversary.

Accept that you and your parents may have different opinions.,
Avoid trying to prove your point.,
Let go of past grudges from childhood.,
Don't let them negatively impact your work or relationships.",How to Disagree with Your Parents As an Adult1," When you’re interacting with your parents, remember that they may have different ways of thinking about work, money, family, and life. They may also have different political, social, and religious views than you. Focus more on acceptance and tolerance than on arguments.You can’t control how others act, but you can control how you act.
Accepting differences, even if they’re things you don’t agree with, lead to fewer arguments and more open communication.;
, While you may feel like you’re right or have the correct facts, sometimes pushing your thoughts on others can make them feel judged or upset. Open and effective communication doesn’t mean proving who’s right and who’s wrong.


Arguments with your parents shouldn’t be battles of power when you’re an adult.
Talk about the facts or your views without accusing them. This way, you’re able to disagree without assigning blame or judgment. For example, say, “I know that we may not see eye to eye about my work, but I see the value in what I do and am happy with the work I’ve chosen.”
Try asking your parents about their perspectives as well. This way you can gain more insight about why they hold the positions that they do and it will not seem like you are being disrespectful. Say something like, “What is your perspective in this situation?” or “How do you see things?”

, You may feel resentful or upset about the way you were raised by your parents. This may come out in different ways as an adult. You may find yourself getting into arguments more often with your parents, or try to avoid them altogether.Understand that your parents may not be able or ready to address past grudges from childhood.
Seek support from other friends and family when you’re feeling upset with your parents. Avoid isolating yourself.
If these grudges are getting in the way of having interactions with your parents, consider professional help through a counselor or support group. This way, you can better handle your interactions with your family in the present.

, Your parents may have certain views about what you should be doing with your life, and who you should be dating. Avoid letting your frustration over arguments with them spill over into your relationship with your partner or spouse, or cause you to get upset with your co-workers.


Separate your parents from your day-to-day work and social life.
See your relationship or your work as a positive outlet away from your parents.
If you feel that your disagreements are affecting your relationship with your significant other for example, talk with your significant other openly about the struggles you are facing with your parents. Or, find other supportive friends to help provide reassurance.

Work with a therapist.",How to Clear Your Regrets Before Dying," Think about your regrets and why you regret them. What went wrong for these regrets to happen, and where do you take responsibility?What emotions are triggered as a result of regret (anger, sadness, grief, loneliness)? Are these important for you to deal with before you die? If so, how will you choose to deal with these emotions?


Decide how you want to resolve your feelings and why it’s important to do this. Do you need to take action? How so?
For example, you may regret living far from your family and feel lonely and sad. You may choose to take action and invite family to visit or take a trip to visit them before passing.;
, Through regret, you can learn how your behaviors have brought negative consequences. Feelings of regret can lead to you take action.This can be especially true if you are nearing death, as you realize that your time is running out. If you experience regret, do what you can to find fulfillment.


For example, you may regret not traveling to different countries. Use this as fuel to start traveling now. You may not be capable of traveling the world, but you can see things you've never seen and have new experiences.
If your time is near, take the opportunity to clear the air with those you love and let them know how you feel. For example, if you regret not spending enough time with your grandchildren, leave a legacy for them. Write letters, record audio messages, or send cards as a way for them to know you as they grow up.

, Instead of focusing on the negatives of regret, focus on the lessons you learned and how those lessons contributed to your life.A motorcycle accident that left you with major injuries may have taught you the preciousness of life, or a big fight with a friend may have helped you realize how you get emotionally triggered or how much that friend means to you. Whatever your regrets, examine how they influenced you and your life trajectory.


While your regrets may hit you deeply, try and see what positive effects these life experiences may have had for you.
In fact, you may want to try to have gratitude for these moments. Think about how these moments, difficult as they may have been, gave you the chance to learn, change, and grow.

, Don’t let your regrets affect your self-esteem or turn into a depression. If there’s something you can do nothing about, don’t let it ruin you.Remind yourself that no matter how much you want to, you cannot go back in time. Accept what is and let it go.


If you find yourself saying, “If only….” remind yourself that you cannot relive the past. You can, however, take steps in the present to accept those things and perhaps make amends.
For example, if you wish you had done something differently (like not worked so hard), recognize that you did the best you could at the time. Accept how you lived your life and that you made mistakes.
If you wish you had spent more time with your family, you can try to reach out and spend time with them now.

, If you feel like blaming yourself for the regrets you have, be gentle with yourself. Consider all the factors that led to your decisions: perhaps you had limited knowledge, were under stress, or felt pressure and made a poor decision. Admit that you made a bad decision or failed to do something. Blaming yourself is a not a positive way to deal with the situation, and may make you feel worse.For example, if you have a bad relationship with your sibling, you may feel regret and blame yourself for not being a better brother or sister. While it may be true that you could have done better, say to yourself, “I didn’t know then how I’d feel now. I know I made mistakes, but I cannot place all the blame on myself, as that was a previous version of myself, locked in circumstance.”

, If you previously left some things unsaid that you still wish were out in the open, say them now. You may regret not saying “I love you” enough or not apologizing when you needed to apologize. While you cannot go back and undo your actions, you have the opportunity right now to share your honest feelings with people.Vulnerability has the ability to challenge you and transform your life.If you’ve struggled with being vulnerable and sharing your feelings, it’s not too late to start now. Open up and say, “I treated you badly, and I’m so sorry for that. I know I let you down. It hurts me to know how much I’ve hurt you.”

, It can be meaningful to clear the air with friends and family members before passing. If you’re not sure where to begin, start with this formula: express your regret, explain what went wrong or what social norm was violated, take responsibility, say “I’m sorry,” offer a repair, and request forgiveness.For example, say, “I regret not spending more time with you when you were a child. I know you wanted me in your life and were sad that I wasn’t there. It was my fault for not prioritizing you, and for that I am sorry. I know we cannot go back in time, but I want to spend time with you now and appreciate who you’ve become. Please forgive me.”

, Acknowledge your mistake and take responsibility for it. You may feel guilty, and that’s okay. Yet, remember that doing bad things does not make you a bad person.Acknowledge all truths to a situation and then choose to forgive yourself.


For example, you may regret working too much and not spending time with loved ones. Admit that you made choices that negatively impacted your loved ones, and those choices make you feel bad. Yet, you likely made some good choices in your relationships, too. See the good with the bad, and say, “I made choices I regret and feel bad about them. I recognize these as mistakes, and I choose to forgive myself.”

, Even if people chose not to forgive you for your mistakes, forgive them for theirs. Acknowledge other people’s choices and decisions, even if they hurt you, and choose to forgive them. Forgive the things that people have done against you. Let go of your anger and resentment without feeling like you need to minimize your negative experience.If you’ve asked forgiveness from someone who is unwilling to give it to you, understand and forgive this person for still harboring negative feelings toward you.
If someone has hurt or offended you, now is a good time to forgive and let go. Write a letter and say, “You really hurt me, and I’ve held it against you. No, I see that it’s important that I let that go and forgive you.”

, Sometimes people don’t realize until the end of life that you can choose to be happy. Maybe you spent much of your life unhappy, but make the choice from this day onward to choose happiness.Even if you cannot change the past, you can make each day a happy day.


Fill your days with activities you enjoy. Start new activities that you’ve always wanted to do. Aim to find happiness in as many moments as you can.

, You may regret shutting people out of your life or not prioritizing relationships more throughout your life. Take advantage of the time you do have by calling in the people you want to spend time with and the relationships that matter to you.If you’ve not spend quality time with family and friends, now is the time to do it. Instead of looking to the past, look to the present and the future to bring that fulfillment.

, You may regret actions or feelings you have toward someone who has already passed. Now, you may understand their situation and the urgency more clearly. You may regret the way you treated someone in their passing and realize now that you wish you could do it over. While you may not have the opportunity to work things out face-to-face, consider writing a letter to the person. State what happened, what you wish would have happened, why you wish it was different, and include an apology. Then, see if there is a way to honor that person’s life or death.


For example, you might regret getting drunk, driving, and killing someone. Write a letter to that person and become an organ donor to honor that person’s life.

, Use your remaining time in a meaningful way. Try asking yourself — What have I learned? What can I teach others? Consider using creative expression to explore where you are in the present and get unstuck from the past. Try painting, writing letters, journaling, quilting, music, drama, or other forms of art to express your emotions. Getting in touch with your artistic side can help you communicate and release emotions and regrets, allowing you to be present and enjoy the time you have left., When those regret thoughts pop, remind yourself to refocus on you are proud of, the things that made you happy, and what made your life fuller. For example, if you regret not going to med school when you had the ability because you were too busy with family. Think about your family and the joy you have felt with them. Remind yourself that you made them a priority because it was most important to you. Be thankful for that., If you’re having a hard time dealing with your regrets and are looking for some guidance, consider getting therapy. A therapist can help you work through your feelings and use specific techniques to help you cope. By using a cognitive behavioral approach, you can begin to change your patterns of thinking to reduce feelings of regret.


You can learn to replace negative thoughts with more positive thoughts that can help you move forward and not keep you stuck in the past."

Be respectful and assertive.,
Avoid depending on your parents as an adult.,
Step away from arguments that go nowhere.,
Establish boundaries when they disagree with who you're dating.",How to Disagree with Your Parents As an Adult2," Disagreeing with your parents doesn’t always have to be an uneasy or awkward experience. Focus on being respectful and polite, rather than angry and frustrated. As an adult, you have more rights to assert yourself. Say what you need to say, just be careful and thoughtful in how you do that.Keep in mind that you are not obligated to be accountable for other people’s feelings, but responding with kindness and compassion is still a good idea.


If you are not able to stay calm, excuse yourself until you’re ready to talk in a more respectful way.
When your parents say something that you disagree with, avoid being passive or aggressive in your approach. Show your parents that you have a difference of opinion in a direct and concise way.
Let’s say your mother is trying to tell you how to spend your money in a certain way, and you want to take a different approach. Consider saying, “I hear what you’re saying, Mom, and I respect your thoughts on the matter. But I have learned another approach, and would like to try that instead.” Or, ""Thank you for your helpful information, it is appreciated and I will take it into consideration, but....""

, As an adult, independence allows you to make your own decisions, express your own opinions, and establish yourself. Independence also gives you greater freedom to disagree when you have arguments about money and career choices.The more self-reliant you are financially, the more at ease you’ll feel with making your own choices and expressing a different opinion.
Make small but clear steps towards self-sufficiency. That way, when you are arguing with them about life choices such as becoming an artist rather than an accountant, you'll have proof of your efforts towards independence.
Use social and financial support from your parents for important turning points in your early adult life like college, but avoid depending on them each month to help you with your bills. The more they control your expenses, the easier it is for them to make arguments against your life choices.

, Your parents may have particular views about child-rearing or relationships. They may make this a point of conversation that ultimately leads to arguments. Try being the bigger person on hot-button issues like relationships and family roles. Respectfully move on from the argument that seems to go nowhere.If you and your parents have a fundamental difference, be willing to let go of changing them.
Set boundaries about when they can step in and get involved, and when it's not okay.
If they are trying to press you about how to discipline a child, remind them that you are an adult and have a right to choose how to discipline your own child. Consider saying, “I know that we have our differences. Please respect that I am an adult and a caring parent for my kid. I hope that we can move on from this, and respect each other’s views.”

, In addition to arguments over finances, career choices, and parenting, a common source of contention may be about your romantic relationships and dating. While it's important to be respectful of their input, make it clear your life and your relationships are yours, not theirs.


Parents often want to give advice to prevent the same mistakes that they may have made.
Hear them out, but make it clear that ultimately your romantic decisions are your own. For example, say, ""I know that you want to provide advice, and I understand what you're saying. I hope that you can respect my decision and support who I'm dating.""

"
"
Be patient.,
Listen attentively before reacting to what they say.,
Express your feelings calmly.",How to Disagree with Your Parents As an Adult3," Staying grounded can help you to navigate disagreements with your parents. Listen to your body and pay attention if you find yourself getting anxious or upset. The more aware you are of these physical and behavioral symptoms, the better you can control them with time.


Patience takes practice. Practice stopping yourself before getting too upset with them.
Avoid getting defensive or reacting quickly when they make an accusation. Learn to express yourself through patience rather than frustration.
For example, if your mother makes a negative comment about what you're doing that makes you upset, stop yourself before reacting. Consider saying to her, “I’m sorry you feel that way. I don’t want to get into a battle about who’s right and wrong. Can we try to talk this through in a respectful way?”

, Stop and think before you start to attack what they said or did. If they're trying to seemingly give advice, give them a chance to speak. Don’t talk over them. Listen until they’ve finished their thought.The more times that you give them an opportunity to speak, the more times you can help to teach them to also listen rather than talk over others.
Be open-minded about why they may be saying or acting a certain way. Give them a chance in the same way you would want them to give you a chance.

, Avoid yelling, screaming, or bad-mouthing them as a way to make your point. While getting upset will happen from time to time, avoid making it the common way of communicating with your parents.Use ‘I’ statements to express your feelings about what’s bothering you. For example, say, “I feel frustrated when you express dissatisfaction with the person I’m dating.”
Show your parents that you are mature and able to express your thoughts without getting immediately upset.

Respect their wishes even if you don't agree with them.,
Give them things to look forward to – on a daily basis.,
Do more of what the dying person enjoys, not what you enjoy.,
Stay positive, and above all, avoid arguing with the person.",How to Care for a Dying Person1," Whether they want painful care that seems almost hopeless or they don’t, or whatever else they are requesting, you should respect the wishes of the dying in almost all cases. Allow them some sense of control in their last days.


If there is nothing medically to be done, or they don’t want a very painful regimen with limited chances of success, respect their desires. If a certain medicine has an annoying side effect, it´s okay if you want to tell them why it´s important for you, as a loved one, that they take the medicine. Don´t tell them they have to take it, though, and ultimately respect that it's their call.
If the dying person doesn't want visitors, don't visit and don't make arrangements for other visitors. Allow them to be alone if that's what they want. You can try to lift their spirits up, but there will probably be times they need to feel sad or even sorry for themselves. Be kind and patient at such times.;
, Make sure the conversation isn’t always about death and dying. Rather than focusing on their lack of a future, make the present as good as possible. Give them something to enjoy every day.


Keep their hopes focused on immediate gratifications that make ""living as long as possible"" motivating. Give them a few daily. Talk about nice things that you can do together the next day, even if it's just a quiet visit or maybe reading another chapter in a book together.
If he or she does not have many food restrictions, talk about something nice you can have for breakfast of lunch; if there are food restrictions, mention the Sunday comic strips from the newspaper or something like that. If you don´t live together, set a date for your next visit, and make sure that date is not too far away.

, If he or she likes music you hate, let them listen to it. If he or she loves a certain book or poem, read it to them.


Finish the dying person's bucket list. If he/she has a bucket list or wish list, help them get their wishes to come true. You don't want a dying person to die with regrets.
Don't be sad or depressed. If you are sad, he or she will be sad, and when the person dies, he or she will want you to live happily. It's okay to be a little sad, but a lot of sadness will not help you at all. And it doesn't help them. Keep their final days filled with joy as much as possible.
Enjoy most of your time together. Caring for someone can be difficult. If you're not leaving at least a daily moment for both of you to enjoy, resentment builds up. Have a daily moment that reminds you why you are caring for this person. Never do it ""because I have to, and nobody else will.""
If the dying person is too sick, weak or upset to do anything with you, avoid putting additional pressure on the person. This will likely exacerbate his or her symptoms.

, Dying people are sometimes crabby or even cruel, since they may be responding in fear of the dying process or just physical pain. Don’t take the bait. Even when you feel frustrated by the dying person's actions, avoid getting into arguments that you will regret to remember someday.


Ensure that you remain strong and positive in front of them despite their physical and mental state. This ensures they remain calm and content without having the emotional upset of worrying and upsetting you.
Don't fight them, even if they are wrong. If they are asking you to do something that can't be done, say yes, try, and fail. They need to feel like they can still suggest, and control a few things. Agree for anything that is not a life or death situation. If it is life or death, maybe agree, and then say you just couldn't, and you´re sorry. Arguing will just be tiresome for you.

Listen more than you talk.,
Keep them as comfortable as possible in all ways.,
Let them be independent in some tasks if that's what they want.,
Look after yourself too.",How to Care for a Dying Person2," If he or she can speak, listen. It could be comforting to remember and chat about good memories, happy times, or to look at old pictures together.


It's nice to have good talks; elderly people, for example, love sharing stories and experiences. You could ask them questions like ""What are your best childhood memories?"" or ""What are some of the most important lessons you feel you have learned over the course of your life?""
If you want to know if they are in pain, ask. Don't guess. If they can communicate, listen to what they say about their care needs.See what they are feeling, what they want, what they think is best for them, what they want to still do, and what they feel needs to be said. Don't tell them what you think they need. Listen to what they say they need. If they bring up spirituality, encourage the conversation on their own terms., Make sure they have the correct supplies if they're in any pain (such as morphine drips and regular medication). You can ask a doctor if they feel they can't talk to one themselves.


You can also do basic things such as keeping them warm and bringing them anything they need for support, such as extra pillows. Show them love. Paste drawings or cards nearby, and invite his or her loved ones to make new ones.
Make sure you communicate with them about what they need to be comfortable - their needs are the most important thing at this time. This could be bringing certain foods and drinks they want, fluffing their pillows, or something else. People who are dying may prefer a quiet room.Take some time to read about the final stages of life. This will help you understand what they are going through physically and how to respond to different situations.

, It may be a struggle for them, but it will make them feel better about themselves if they can at least do some simple things on their own.


Sometimes they can be embarrassed about becoming weak and incapable of doing simple things like sitting up, so they might not want someone watching them all the time.
You must remember that their mental health is very important at this stage. If they're the leader of the family, reassure them that everything will be in order when they've passed.
The things they do on their own could be small gestures (such as picking up the TV remote or brushing their teeth).

, Don't feel as if you must have all the responsibility as other people can usually be there to give you a hand. It is extremely hard to care for a dying person, and it will be emotionally draining for you, but it will mean the world to them that you are helping and that you care.Understand you can learn a lot from dying people. To know that there will be a point where you will no longer be here too should cause you to reflect. It should allow you to place things in perspective, find out what really matters, and give yourself the motivation to make changes.
Understand you may need a break from care giving sometimes. That's okay. Don't be hard on yourself. You need to stay emotionally replenished so you can care for them best. There are many support groups for people caring for the dying. Ask at your local hospital for one of them. It can be very helpful to speak to people who understand what you're dealing with; vent to those people, not the dying person.

"
"
Don’t forget the power of human touch.,
Understand you may need to accept help.,
Keep them clean and hygienic at all times.,
Treat them as living, not dying, people.",How to Care for a Dying Person3," By staying with the dying person in their final days or hours, you can comfort them with your words or by holding their hand.Some adult children will snuggle in bed with their dying parent and this close contact may be comforting to a dying mother or father.
The simple act of physical contact—holding hands, a touch, or a gentle massage—can make a person feel connected to those he or she loves. It can be very soothing. Warm your hands by rubbing them together or running them under warm water.
As death scares many people, some will tend to avoid the dying person. However, it's these very moments that can be turning points for the better in the lives of people. So, make sure there is much support around this dying person, and don't be scared to keep them company with others until they do die. Knowing that people were there for them will comfort them.

, This will depend on the situation and stage. Stay organized, as caring for a dying person can be a lot of work. Keep a planner for doctor´s appointments, medicine calendars, and keep it visible. Have a board.


Accept help, but don’t let others control the situation. We all have loved ones who are always there to help, as long as it´s on their terms, and with their conditions. You don´t need this. Say thank you, but make sure they don´t add more pressure than they take off.
Educate yourself on their symptoms, the best medically suggested response to them, and on the dying process in general. Help them educate themselves too, if that's what they want.If you are not the person responsible for the care, and want to offer help, offer help, not control. Help in their terms, not yours. The best way to help, is by accepting the terms the one responsible establishes.

, We all know how nice it is to have just had a bath or a shower. If the person is too large for one person to manage, then a close friend or nurse may be helpful to give a bed bath.


Consider hospice care or a nurse. If you can afford it, hire a nurse for tasks that may be embarrassing for your dying loved one. If you can´t afford it, never do it angry.
Don’t leave a dying person alone for long periods of time. And make sure there is someone close to them in the room, even if this is done in shifts. You want them to feel the presence of family and loved ones, not just caregivers they aren’t that connected to.
Put them in a wheelchair if they are always in bed. That way they can have some fresh air, and see a new face. Ask them how they feel in case they do not want to stay outside any longer. By these loving gestures, they still feel like they are a part of the world and that you care.

, Give them their dignity. Don’t be fooled into thinking there is nothing to learn from a dying person, or that the dying process is just all pain and horrible. While it can be traumatic, witnessing death should change you.


When caring for a dying person, remember that they are still there. Do not treat them as if they are already dead, or are not there. For example, it can be very hurtful for the dying person if you talk about them or their condition with someone else, while they are in your presence.
Don't bring up the dying thing unless they do. Just hold their hand and be there for their last breaths. Stay positive and don't show sadness in front of them. Talk to them as if they are cognizant of what's going on around them. They might be or they might not be, but don't assume that they don't hear what you are saying. Mend any fences with them that you need to. Even if you think they don't respond to you, they know what you've said.

Greek Orthodox: while most flowers are accepted, white flowers are often chosen as a preferred option.
Jewish: flowers are not typically displayed at a funeral home where the service for the deceased is held; instead, it is more common to send flowers to the family members’ homes. However, you should not take flowers to a Jewish home sitting Shiva.Baha’i: most types of flower arrangements are acceptable; there are no specific recommendations or styles to avoid.
Buddhist: most types of flower arrangements are acceptable; there are no specific recommendations or styles to avoid.
Hindu: instead of floral arrangements, garlands are more commonly seen at Hindu funerals. Ask the funeral home about the possibility of sending a garland instead.
Muslim: the acceptability of flowers at an Islamic funeral varies across the faith, and therefore it is important to ask about the desires of the bereaved before sending them.

, Different types of floral arrangements are sent by individuals with different familial proximity to the deceased. Consider this when choosing an arrangement of flowers to send.


Choose a casket spray or wreath if you are from the immediate family. Alternate arrangements from immediate family can include table arrangements, swags inside the casket lid, and heart-shaped arrangements.Choose a standing spray or informal arrangement if you are a member of the extended family.
Send a spray, wreath, basket arrangement, bouquet in a vase, or a live plant if you are a close friend or colleague. Friends can send flowers directly to the funeral home or to the home of the family member that they wish to comfort, while business associates can have flowers delivered to the work of the family member., Flowers can be used as a way to subtly recognize that which the deceased loved to do in life. Choosing a unique bouquet with a special meaning to you is a great way to honor the life of the deceased.


If the deceased loved the outdoors, send a basket of rustic wildflowers.
If the deceased always dressed in yellow, consider sending a bouquet of yellow flowers.
If the deceased was an avid gardener, consider sending a plant that can be planted by the family outdoors to honor their loved one. Potted plants have symbolic meaning because they will continue to live and grow., While there is no hard and fast rule regarding the types of flowers that should be sent to funerals or homes of the bereaved, there are many traditional favorites. Here are a few suggestions of flowers with meanings that may be appropriate for the funeral setting:


Apple Blossom: better things to come
Lilies of the Valley: return of happiness
Ivy: eternal fidelity
Hybrid tea roses: “I’ll remember you”
Roses (red): love/respect/courage
Roses (pink): grace/gentility
Roses (light pink): admiration/sympathy
In addition, certain flowers may be appreciated by certain cultures. For example, Chrysanthemums may be especially appreciated by Asian families., When choosing flowers, especially for an emotional event like a funeral, it is advisable to consider flower colors, as these may be noticed by some of the deceased’s loved ones.


Pick white flowers to represent peace and reverence.
Choose blue flowers to represent comfort and calm.
Avoid green flowers. These represent health and good fortune, a meaning which is not appropriate for the event at hand.
Red flowers should be avoided at Buddhist funerals. Instead, white flowers are preferred., For example, many funeral homes have rules about sending floral arrangements in vases that may be prone to tip over and spill and/or break. This includes glass vases. If in doubt, call the funeral home to ask if there are any preferred ways to display flowers so that you can convey this when you place your flower order.

, Visiting a local florist can be a great way to make sure you are sending the right type and right arrangement of flowers. Florists will often be quite well-versed in composing various types of floral arrangements for funerals. If you are from a small town, the florist may know the deceased or bereaved personally and may be able to offer additional advice.


Provide the florist with information about the deceased, including the name and the date, time, and location of the funeral service.
Prepare your message for the card that will be sent with your arrangement. The most common and simple note is “I’m/We’re sorry for your loss” or “With deepest sympathy.” However, you may choose to write a longer and more personalized message.

, Sending flowers from an online website has become increasingly common and may be more convenient than making a trip to a local florist. Most online flower ordering sites have a link to order sympathy and funeral arrangements online, where you can add in all the same information that you would tell your florist.

, This website will deliver to the location where the funeral service will be held or to the family’s home.


Try www.ftd.com to order plants as well as flowers, sprays, and wreaths. FTD has a very nice collection of potted plants to choose from if that is what you desire.
Visit www.1800flowers.com and choose “Sympathy for Funeral Service” to choose an arrangement of funeral flowers that fits your taste and budget.

, While most floral arrangements are sent directly to the funeral home that will hold the viewing of the diseased, it is also appropriate to send flowers to the family’s home., Many times, groups of friends, such as a social club, a luncheon group, or business colleagues, decide to send a floral tribute as a group. When a group of individuals go in together on the purchase of a floral arrangement, it can often be larger and potentially more noticeable than many small arrangements.


Sign the card with the flowers as a group, for example, “The Accounting Group at X Business” or “The Smith Family.”

Know the difference and meaning of gasket caskets and non-gasket caskets.,
Figure out your budget, then do some online shopping.,
Select what you want on the interior.,
When choosing a casket exterior, after choosing the color and material of your taste and what you think better suit the deceased, think about how thick and durable you want the casket to be.,
Don't forget to bring an objective third party with you when shopping for a casket (A friend or coworker works best).",How to Buy a Casket," Simply, gasket sealed caskets mean that the casket is sealed from dirt and debris and does not allow gasses and air to escape. If you are burying your loved one, the casket gasket might not make much of a difference because it will be exposed to water underground, which will rot a rubber gasket. If your loved one will be in a mausoleum, DO NOT get a gasket. It will cause the body to decompose at a faster rate, but for longer, usually damaging both the casket and the mausoleum itself. Caskets with gaskets are also usually upwards of $700 dollars more than caskets without.;
, Decide on what style you want, and find a casket online that fits in your price range. Caskets are generally made form metal (steel, stainless steel, copper, bronze) or wood such as oak, cherry, mahogany, and others. Print out what you like so you can bring the examples with you to the funeral home.

, Keep in mind that fabrics will last much longer than anything painted or glued on, which usually disintegrate within a year. The Interior Caskets generally have a variety of interior options to choose from. The interior of the casket is commonly made with fabrics such as velvet, cotton crepe, satin crepe, and others. A crepe means that the fabric is slightly thin and has a wrinkled appearance. You will have many color choices such as white, blue, pink, beige, gold, silver, and others.

, If you want it thick, then 18 gauge is the way to go. If your loved one was petite, then 20 gauge is probably fine. When choosing a casket interior, keep in mind the color and fabric type you think best suits the occasion.

, Not only is it important to your mental health to have someone who is not in the same state as you there for emotional support, but they can also keep you from over-spending because of the vulnerable state you are in."

Consider why you want to amend the death certificate.,
Find out your eligibility.,
Know the time limitations.",How to Amend a Death Certificate1," Incorrect information on a death certificate is important to change. Not only does it affect demographers' data, it may impact an insurance settlement. You should get organized at an early stage by identifying all details you need to correct on the death certificate. It is possible, and imperative, to amend any and all incorrect details of the death certificate.For example, a death certificate with an inaccurate veteran status may affect death insurance claims you file with armed forces aid associations.
Incorrect dates, misspelled names, and other personal information should always be corrected.;
, Anyone is eligible to initiate the amendment process if they find information they know to be incorrect and get the necessary signatures. However, some states have restrictions on who can actually file the paperwork. If you are not eligible to file death certificate amendment paperwork, contact those who are. Tell them what is wrong and how you can give evidence to back up your claims.


For example, in Michigan, only a certifying physician or medical examiner can amend medical details such as cause of death., You can always amend death certificates as long as you have evidence to support your claims. However, the manner in which you file the amendment paperwork is more restricted as time goes on. This varies state-by-state, however in many cases it means only being able to file through your state's central vital statistics and vital information registry.


For example, in Minnesota, the funeral home can only amend the death certificate in the first year after death. After 5 years, only the state registrar can process and file your request."

Figure out which state the death certificate was registered in.,
Download the forms you need.,
Pick up any remaining forms in person.,
Mail the envelope.",How to Amend a Death Certificate2," Look on the death certificate if you are unsure. Depending on where you live, you might be able to contact the office online through the state government's website. Many states now have the applicable instructions and forms accessible on their website. Some states give you a choice whether to you’re your amendment request through state or local government.Amending a death certificate is not yet a process you can complete on a website or online interface. You still have to mail amendment request forms most likely because you have to present the original copies of your supporting documentation. However, most states now have the information and resources you need on their webpage.

, You will need to fill out a form telling the state how the death certificate needs to be changed. Some states require you to complete an application for amendment form before you can amend the death certificate. Your state’s website should tell you what procedures you will need to follow. Look over the forms before you continue so you can ensure you have all the items and information you need in each stage of the process.


You have to provide documentation to support your claims. These have to be the original copies with all the authorization needed (such as signatures, seals, etc.). They have to be intact and legible.
For example, if you are amending the deceased's death certificate to indicate his veteran status, you will need to find their discharge certificate. Supporting documentation could also be their birth certificate, if a date or location is wrong on the death certificate.
You will also have to remit the requisite amendment fee., You may not be able to access all the forms online. Phone your office of vital statistics or records and ask where you can pick up other forms. If you have all the information you want to complete the amendment on-site, you can fill out the form and submit it in person. If not, take it home and make sure you have all the documents in order.

, Be sure to include any and all necessary applications, forms, supporting documentation, and fees. Once you have confirmation of receipt, you may need to wait a matter of days or weeks while they process the request. Take care to use the mailing method outlined by the office."

Go to the local registrar.,
Visit the funeral home that handled the deceased's funeral arrangements.,
Contact the informant directly.",How to Amend a Death Certificate3," Look at the death certificate to see which local municipality it was registered in. This may be the county office of vital statistics, department of health, licensing center, county recorder, among other things.


You can only use this method through the first five years after the date of death in some states. Check time restrictions in your state before beginning any amendment process., A funeral director will contact the person who provided the information (informant) for the death certificate. If the informant agrees, the funeral director will make the application for amendment for you. You can find the name of the funeral home on the death certificate.

, Since the funeral home will ultimately be contacting this person, you may be able to go to them directly. Make sure there are not any legal restrictions on your contacting this person. As with visiting the funeral home, some states only accept this method up to a certain date after the death.Informants are often family members. They could be fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, partners, etc.

Figure out the size you need.,
Decide on a price range.,
Research the company before you purchase an urn.,
Check the rules of the cemetery.,
Research the laws for scattering ashes.,
Take traveling into account.",How to Buy an Urn," If you plan to keep the urn of ashes for display, then it would be best to purchase an attractive, yet durable vase. Consider the area and the room in which you plan to display the piece, as this may influence the material you choose. For example, urns can be made of many different substances like wood, stone, ceramic, metal, or glass.If you are burying the urn or placing it in a mausoleum, keep in mind that you may be limited in the material you choose.;
, If the deceased was a lover of nature or an environmental advocate than going the eco-friendly route with a biodegradable urn is a good idea. These urns may also require fewer restrictions as they will degrade and disappear wherever they are outdoors. You can even buy an urn which incorporates the deceased’s ashes into a growing memorial tree., Think of the personality and hobbies of the deceased, were they big on sports, nature, the arts? Perhaps they were a veteran or religious. All of these things should be considered when choosing the theme or design of the urn. Similar to the numerous materials, urns can also be engraved or decorated with varying pictures, quotes, or patterns. Keep in mind that the price will also vary depending on what you choose.You can even display pictures of the deceased or family members on an urn.

, These urns are much smaller, with a capacity of 35 cubic inches. They are usually used when you plan to split a loved one's ashes amongst family. However, you can also use them if you are planning to scatter, bury, or intern some of the deceased's ashes and want to retain the rest. Keepsake urns come in a myriad of styles, from the basic vase shape to stars, hearts, birds, and butterflies., Though the height and width of an urn can be important, the most important aspect of an urn is containment. The general rule in regards to measuring an urns capacity is that one pound of body weight is equal to one cubic inch of ashes. So, if the deceased was 150 pounds, then they would require an urn that could hold 150 cubic inches. However, it is usually best to purchase an urn that is slightly bigger, just in case.If you are planning to place the urn in a mausoleum, then the outer size of the vase is also important.

, Depending on the type, size, and material, an urn can cost anywhere between $30-$500. Some may even cost upwards of a thousand dollars. Due to these costs, it’s important to consider how much money you are willing to spend on an urn. Funerals can be expensive so look over each piece of the service and allocate a set sum for an urn. This will also help you narrow down what kind of urn to buy.There’s a possibility that the deceased left funds behind for this during their estate planning process.

, As funeral costs can be a considerable burden, it’s best to make sure that you are getting your urn from an established and fair company. Before you buy, look at how many years the company has been in business and what their record is for customer service. They should be knowledgeable, accessible, and offer you a guarantee in case the urn breaks.


You can either purchase an urn from a funeral home or online. Both places should have a wide variety to meet your needs.

, Whether you plan to bury the urn in the ground or inside a mausoleum, you may be required to purchase a specific kind of piece. For example, many mausoleums will not accept wooden urns or anything besides plastic, ceramic or metal. While ground burials require urns made of metal, bronze or wood.Be sure to check the rules of the cemetery as some mausoleums may also require an urn vault. This is an ornate box in which the urn will sit.
Also, they may require a set size, as each niche has its own height and width.

, If you plan to scatter the deceased’s ashes somewhere, such as a sea, lake, river, or even a park, make sure you look over your state's law before your proceed. In most states, you can scatter ashes over land on private property as long as you have governmental permission. However, scattering over water is often subject to federal law. For example, the Federal Clean Water Act requires remains scattered at sea to be at least three nautical miles from the coast.Ashes that are scattered over the ocean must also be in a biodegradable container.

, If you plan to travel by plane in or around the U.S., make sure to consider the TSA requirements before you purchase an urn. It will have to pass through an x-ray machine before it is allowed on a flight, so the material you choose for the urn is very important. For example, wood, glass, plastic, and non-lead lined ceramics are the best choice for air travel.You can bring the urn as a carry-on or as checked baggage. However, not every airline allows you to check urns as baggage, so make sure you research beforehand.

If you discovered a deceased loved one and know that they wished to be cremated according to their will, go through some general price lists with a funeral director and compare prices, then select the one that best suits you or the families' needs.;
, Take the social security number and other details about the deceased to the funeral home for the arrangement conference where you discuss the funeral and cremation plans.


If the deceased wanted to have a viewing or you and the family agreed for a viewing, notify the funeral director about this in the arrangement conference so they can organize the cremation after the funeral or viewing service.

, Get the body of the deceased transported from the site of death or storage to the funeral home. The funeral provider shall also help you secure certified copies of the death certificate, arrange for a notice in the newspaper, and look after other necessary paperwork.

, Obtain a medical certificate by a doctor stating the cause of death or certificate by the coroner in case there has been coroner’s post-mortem examination.

, For a cremation to go further, there is usually a considerable amount of paperwork because of the nature of the process. Obtain the contract from the funeral director upon their prompting, you can request them to go through the fine print with you.

, The cremation of the body is done with the remains in a container - the funeral home can help you with selecting the right size and fit. If you need a casket for the funeral or viewing service but do not want to purchase it, consider renting a casket.

, There are many different cremation urns that you can choose from if you wish to store the remains for memorial reasons. You can ask the funeral director what the most popular choice is, as that is usually the one that is most ecological.

, You may ask the funeral home for permission to be involved in a witnessing service so that you can witness the cremation if you want to. Some crematoriums, however, do not allow this.

, After the cremation has been performed, dispose of the cremated remains by burying in a burial plot, placing in a columbarium, or entombing in a mausoleum. You may also opt to scatter the ashes in a scattering garden, national park (if the local laws allow it), private property (with the owner’s consent), etc. The cremated remains can also be floated in water or scattered by plane.

Perhaps they had specific requests for the service or perhaps they explicitly requested not to have a service at all!
Check here if you need to probate a will.;
, Once you've consulted the will, think about the deceased and the kind of service they might have wanted, as well as what the family would like. Like people, no two memorial services are the same; they reflect the diverse personalities of the deceased and their loved ones. In order to plan mouse the most appropriate kind of service, it is essential to do this kind of pre-planning. While no two services are quite the same, here are a few general types of services.


Funerals are usually held very soon after death, as the body is made available for viewing by mourners. While funerals are not necessarily religious, they do tend to be so, and are a good type of service to have if you and your family want something more traditional.
Memorials can often be held any amount of time after a funeral, either for a more public audience, for loved one's who could not attend the funeral, or to emphasize a different aspect of remembrance. Conversely, many often elect to have a memorial in place of a funeral. Either way, the body is not present at a memorial and the purpose is to remember the deceased and allow loved ones time and space to grieve.
Life celebrations are a newer form of memorial service in which the emphasis is less on grief and more on, as the name suggests, celebrating the life of the deceased. These events tend to be quite lively, with jokes on and toasts to the deceased made instead of tearful remembrances. As with memorials, the body is not present at a life celebration., Coping with grief is difficult enough without the extra responsibility of planning a service. While many families have that one person who organizes and is on top of everything (if you are reading this article you may be that person), it is important not to leave the responsibility of planning the memorial service all up to one person. Assign responsibilities for different things, such as sending out invitations, booking the venue, and so on. This is important for three reasons:


So that no one person is saddled with the weight of so much responsibility, preventing them from having any time to mourn properly
So that everyone has the opportunity to help. Think of in the old days when people passed around a shovel so each person could dump a little bit of dirt on the coffin in the ground. The symbolic act of helping ""bury"" the loved one is important for everyone's grieving process.
While this is surely a difficult topic at this time, funerals and memorial services can be expensive. This financial burden should not by default fall on one person's shoulders.

, Memorial services should be planned in consideration of any family members who have traveled from out of town. Set a date close enough to the funeral or anniversary event that visiting friends and family can attend. Doing so will allow those grieving to share memories.

, Arrange a memorial service at a location that is large enough to accommodate the number of people you've invited.


Know how many chairs will be needed for everyone who has RSVPed and how many tables are required for food and floral arrangements.
Be sure to have a podium for a guestbook.
You should also consider whether the deceased would have wanted a memorial service in a place of worship or a nonreligious building.

, Stay organized when planning a memorial service by making a list of all friends and loved ones of the deceased for sending out invitations. This will ensure that you send invitations to everyone you think is likely to want to attend and will avoid the faux pas of forgetting someone important.


You may also need to assist with organizing accommodations for people coming from out of town. Consider compiling a list of local hotels to provide guests, as well as whether you and anyone else might be able to host out-of-town guests at home.

, Make the memorial service a reflection of the person whose memory you're honoring by choosing decorations and music the individual would have liked.


Use floral arrangements with the person's favorite flowers or colors and compile a play list of favorite songs or types of music to be played throughout the service.
Consider adding any other mementos that you consider properly reflect the person's life.

, Ask friends and family members of the deceased for input about special touches that will best help remember their loved one. The people who knew the deceased person the best will be able to give you ideas for songs, colors, decorations and mementos and help you with pictures and keepsakes to create a memorial.

, A key component of many memorial services is having a series of guest speakers who can provide their personal perspective on the deceased person's life and the legacy being left behind.


Contact individuals you would like to speak at the memorial service well in advance to verify that they're willing to speak and to give them time to gather their thoughts.
Ask them if there are any particular resources they need to help them speak, such as a microphone, a screen, etc.
You might also consider choosing specific readings which reflect the personality of the deceased readings to give to speakers.

, Many people want to remember the memorial service and choose to hire a professional videographer and/or photographer. You can use services like Yelp, Angie's List and even Craigslist to find recording professionals. Alternately, a loved one in attendance may wish to do this themselves at the service.

, As you get closer to the service date, or even after it, you might want to publish an obituary for the deceased. This is something many people want to do, for a number of reasons, but particularly as one more way to remember the person who has passed.


Additionally, an obituary can be a means of announcing the passing of the person, as well as information regarding their memorial service if done beforehand, to the general public, in case the deceased may have had friends unknown to you.
Just call or send an email to the newspaper you would like to publish the obituary to get started.

, It can help the grieving process to have something you can look at with your eyes and hold in your hands to remember your loved one. Consider some of these ideas


At your service, place a blank poster on a wall or table for people to leave their personal expressions and condolences in writing and drawing.
Create a page on a website like Tributes.com to upload photos, remembrances and other contributions from the bereaved.
Have guests bring small objects to share with others their memories of the deceased. For example, they might bring photos, articles of clothing, or trip souvenirs given as gifts by the deceased.

, If you have talent in writing, music, visual art, or some other type of art, you might like to write a poem or song, make a painting, and so on, as a tribute for the deceased. If you are not an artsy type but would still like to tribute them in this manner, find a poem or passage of writing written by a favorite author of the deceased and read that instead.

Dress conservatively.,
Arrive early.,
Don’t sit in the front rows.",How to Act at a Funeral1," When attending a funeral, always dress conservatively. Do not wear flashy outfits, bright colors, baggy clothing, or low-cutting blouses or dresses. You do not have to wear all black, but at least dress in darker colors, like dark blues, greens, and grays. As a general rule of thumb, dress business casual when attending funerals., Try to attend the funeral 10 minutes early. This will enable you to find seating and sign the guest book. If you sign the guest book, be sure to sign your first and last name; you can also state your relationship to the deceased, i.e., friend, coworker, colleague, or teammate., In general, the first several rows of seating are usually reserved for immediate family members, relatives, and close friends. If you are not a close friend, family, or relative, sit in the middle or in the back of the venue.

"
Turn off distractions.,
Offer your condolences to the family.,
Don’t be afraid to grieve.,
Listen respectfully to the eulogy.,
View the open casket only if you are comfortable.",How to Act at a Funeral2," It is recommended that you either keep your phone on silent in your purse or your pocket, or completely turn off your phone. You do not want to interrupt the service with a ringing cellphone.


It is also considered poor taste to be on social media during a funeral, like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or Snapchat. It's not the end of the world. Photography, unless authorized, is usually disapproved of during the funeral service.

, It is appropriate, and welcomed, for you to offer your condolences to the family. There are various ways to offer your condolences, but the conventional thing to do is to either send or bring flowers to the funeral, or you can verbally express your sincerest sympathies to the bereaved. The important thing is to act normal.


Before bringing flowers to a funeral, check with the family members or with the funeral director if it is appropriate.
You can offer your sympathies by saying, “I am very sorry for your loss” or “I am here for you and your family if you need anything.” If you are at a loss for words, you can simply offer a hug or bring a sympathy card., It is OK and acceptable to cry at funerals. Crying is a healthy, normal response. However, if you begin to cry uncontrollably, excuse yourself until you can regain your composure.

, While eulogies are a common procedure at funerals, not all funerals have eulogies. For example, in Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, eulogies are discouraged. However, if you are attending a funeral where someone gives a eulogy, listen respectfully to the eulogy. If you are distracted while the eulogy is taking place, others might take offense to this.Generally, laughing at funerals is unacceptable unless it is warranted. An occasion for when laughing is warranted is when the eulogizer recounts a funny memory about the deceased. However, stay on the safe side by following the family’s lead., Some services might have an open casket. If this makes you uncomfortable, you are under no obligation to approach the casket. If you do want to approach the open casket, but think you might become emotional, consider asking someone to walk with you to the casket."
"
Learn about the religion's customs beforehand.,
Do what others do.,
Don’t take offense by religion.",How to Act at a Funeral3," There are times when you might find yourself attending a religious funeral, where you are unfamiliar with the religion's customs. In order to avoid embarrassing or inappropriate situations, do some research beforehand on the different customs for that religion. For example, it is unconventional to bring flowers to a Jewish funeral.For Catholic funerals, it is conventional to send a mass card to the family of the deceased., If you are unsure about what is appropriate at a funeral service, do what others do; stand when people stand, and sit when people sit. It helps if you sit at the back of the venue so you can follow the other’s lead., Remember, you do not have to do anything you are uncomfortable with. If you are attending a religious funeral whose denomination you are not a member of, you do not have to sing or pray with everyone. Instead, bow your head in a respectful manner as if you are reflecting.

Prepare all essential biographical data for the deceased.,
Add a portrait or picture of the departed.,
Write or choose the tribute text.,
Consider adding multimedia items.,
Invite family and friends to visit and share their memories or sympathy.",How to Make an Online Memorial Tribute," You have various options here, ranging from starting your own website to using existing memorial sites. Here are some suggestions:


Create an online memorial with its own domain and keep it updated over the upcoming years. Be sure to make at least part of it interactive to let mourners leave their own messages of love and memories.
Use a customized memorial site. There are quite a few sites that allow you to create your own memorial for someone. When choosing such a site, read the terms and conditions carefully and be sure that the site's approach and underpinnings are supportive of what you want for the memorial. Also, see whether it's free or if there is a cost involved – this may make a difference to your choice. When assessing an online memorial site, check that it has full multimedia, free online obituaries, forums and possibly also articles and resources for dealing with grief and condolence guestbooks. Again, having interactive ability for mourners to leave their memories is an important element too.
To find such a site, do a search online for ""Online Memorial Sites"" and you'll get many returns, or ask other people for their suggestions through social network sites like Facebook and Twitter.
Use a photo, blog or Facebook account for keeping photos and comments in one place. This may not be as flexible as other options but it can be useful for creating a quick and functional memorial which can be developed into something more substantial later.;
, Even objects, papers, and beloved places can be captured through the art of photography, so don't limit yourself. Consider all the things that mattered to your loved one and that are representative of your loved one. Prepare to add these items to the online memorial by assembling them, finding them, photographing them, and making any needed visits to places and people, etc. The following steps walk you through some of the basic things that are helpful to include.


Don't feel too pressured to get everything into the memorial straight away. The biography can contain as little or as much information as you like, as you can always update or add more at a later date. Moreover, provided you've made the site interactive or enabled a facility for any mourner to be able to email you additions for the site, you can make the building of the memorial more open to all and therefore more reflective of the many ways the deceased was perceived by different people in the deceased's life.

, This information should include such things as birth date, death date, full name and places associated with life events. Aim to fully document the life of the dearly departed without getting bogged down in irrelevant or trivial details.


If there are details missing, don't be afraid to ask visitors to help out where they can.

, A well-chosen photo of the departed paints a thousand words and offers the most personal connection with visitors to the memorial. Even better is to choose a range of photos covering various life stages of the deceased's life. Different visitors will respond to different eras of photos, depending on when they spent time with the deceased.


Provide the ability for visitors to upload photos for sharing. If you're concerned about what might be uploaded, have them vetted or emailed to you before allowing them to show live but at least provide the means for all who might have photos.
If you don't have a digital photo, you'll have to digitize a conventional photo. To do this, you'll need access to a scanner for copying a photo onto your computer. If you don't have a scanner, it's very likely that a friend or family member does and are willing to help you. Also, most print shops and office supply stores will be happy to scan photos onto a CD for a small fee.
Alternatively, carefully take a photo of the photo and upload this image. Good digital cameras can make decent reproductions using this method.

, This text is the essence of your memorial. It can be the funeral eulogy, a poem or your own thoughts and memories. It's your memorial, so take time to reflect, remember and share how you felt, or feel, about your loved one. Telling a story which stands out in your mind about the deceased is always a good start.


As with the photos, ensure that others have the space to add their stories and comments about their experiences of time spent with the deceased. The more opportunities that you provide for others to give input, the more well-rounded the memorial will become.
Try to add quotes that the deceased loved or that sum up this person's outlook on life.
Ask people to share their first, best and last memories of the deceased.
Leave space open for the addition of writing at any time by anyone.
Be sure to add essays, poems, notes, etc. of worth that the deceased wrote. Personal writing is valued by people who loved the deceased.

, Multimedia items can make the visitor's experience even more interactive and enhance the memories of the deceased's life. Multimedia items include video, audio and photo albums. Although not all people have access to video or audio clips of their loved one, it is becoming more common to film or tape the people in our lives. If you do have such recordings and you're willing to share them, visitors to the memorial will be able to enjoy a different dimension of the departed loved one.


It is advisable to keep the size of the video to a minimum for quick and convenient download by visitors. Some people have difficulty viewing videos, so be sure to add instructions.
Again, invite anyone with multimedia items to contact you if they'd like them to be added to the online memorial.
Old family movies on celluloid and in other non-digital forms can be transferred to a digital form by photography specialists. Look up local specialists in the Yellow Pages.

, Have ready a list of emails or other means for alerting people that you'd like to send invites to. Ask them to pass the invitation on to others that they know knew the deceased too.


Consider making a timed event when you can bring a group of interested family and friends together online to share memories in real time. Use Skype or a video site or Facebook or Twitter to arrange this and to run it. It's a bit of work getting a time that's convenient to many but it's worth it for the feeling of togetherness that this can create, especially for people who live far away or if you're holding it as an anniversary memorial event.
Ask for feedback. This can be an important source of knowing what you might need to change about the site to make it easier to access, read or to improve the content, etc.

Blacks, greys, browns, tans, and muted blues are all acceptable. Bits of white are okay if you can't avoid them.;
, These can be found in drugstores, card shops, and gift shops. You can also buy a blank card to write a message of sympathy to the bereaved, and you can write a small note of a funny time you enjoyed with the deceased.

, While not required, it is a nice gesture and will be greatly appreciated by the bereaved.


If you want to donate money, check the obituary to find out where the bereaved is requesting that donations be made to. This organization will send a lovely card to the bereaved saying your name and the name of the person in whose memory you donated.

, Wakes usually last several hours, and this is so that everyone gets a chance to stop in. If you didn't know them well, you're not expected to stay the entire length of time, but at the same time, it's distasteful to be in a rush to leave.

, This is more in the case of the death of a distant family member, where you may see close cousins, siblings of yours, etc. that came for the same purpose. You may then stop and chat with them.


There will probably be photos and/or a slideshow set up containing pictures of the deceased enjoying him/herself during happier times. If so, you can look at these with others and say: ""Hey, I remember that!"" or ""Bob always had such a great sense of humor."" or ""Wow, I'll really miss those Monday night football games over at Larry's place."" Wakes are for reminiscing and remembering the good times.

, Exit through the same door you came in through.


If the bereaved are no longer in the receiving line, you may stop to say goodbye to them, or go up to the casket for a final goodbye.

Collect pictures of your loved one.,
Record your memories.,
Think about their favorite things.,
Include messages from family and friends.,
Find quotes.,
Organize your material.",How to Make a Memorial Book1," Find all of the images you have of your loved one, and go through them. Pick out which ones are most meaningful to you, your family, and the friends of the deceased. Photographs should represent their life, personality, and milestones.


If the photos are digital, you can organize them in files on your computer. You might organize them by date, theme, or relevance. Or, you can put them on a flash drive and print them out.
If the photographs are physical copies, you should scan and digitize them before putting them in a book. This saves the original while giving you plenty of copies to work with. If you do not own a scanner, check out your local public library to see if they offer scanning services.
If you are having trouble choosing, you can look for the major milestones of their life: baby pictures, graduations, weddings, award ceremonies, vacations, and other big events.
Invite family members and friends to add their photos to the book. You can do this at the funeral service, through letters, or over email.;
, Think of the happiest moments you had with the deceased. Write these down in detail. These memories will be immortalized in your memorial book. You should also ask family and friends to write down their own unique stories. You can ask people:What is your favorite memory of the deceased?
Is there something that the deceased told you that you will always remember?
What kinds of traditions did you have with the deceased?
How long did you know them for?
How did you first meet the deceased?

, You can decorate the memorial book with other images and items that remind you of your loved one. These can be newspaper articles they were featured in, awards they won, images of their favorite hobby, or their favorite things.


For example, if your loved one was an artist, you might include a few images of their artwork.
If the deceased loved animals, you might include a few pictures of their favorite pets.
You might also include things that represent historical events that they witnessed.For example, you can add news articles of elections or tickets of famous concerts.

, In addition to memories and stories, you should write your loved one a heartfelt goodbye that shows how much you love and miss them. These notes can help you process your grief, and they are a permanent testament to how much the deceased was loved. Make sure to ask for contributions from others as well.For example, you might write, “Dad, I think of you every day. You were such an inspiration in my life, and I still love you so much. While I miss you dearly, I hope that wherever you are, you’re peaceful.”
You can also try writing a letter to the deceased where you tell them things that you never got to say. For example, you might write, “I was always too proud to admit how much I looked up to my big brother, but now I just want to say, you were always my inspiration.”Include the obituary and eulogy. If you don’t want to start from scratch with the person’s life story, you can take the obituary and eulogy from their funeral. These can be copy and pasted into your book., Quotations about death, love, and family can help you define how you are feeling in eloquent language. They are great ways to decorate and fill a memorial book.If your loved one had a favorite poem or prayer, you can include those as well. Some general quotes include:


”Unable are the loved to die for love is immortality.” --Emily Dickinson
“The song is ended, but the melody lingers on.” --Irving Berlin
“It is not length of life, but depth of life.” --Emerson Ralph Waldo, Choose a theme to help organize your book, and break the theme down into four or five different sections. Think about what stories and photographs will go in each section. Your theme might be the story of their life, or it might focus on childhood, marriage, or hobbies.


If you are arranging sections chronologically, make sure to include the dates that are associated with each picture and story.
You can have different sections marked by different titles. For example, “Love of Her Life” can be the title for a section on your loved one’s marriage. “Never forgotten” can be the title of a section on their funeral."

Order copies.",How to Make a Memorial Book2," There are different applications that you can use to design your book. Some, such as iPhoto and Adobe InDesign, will help you format and design the layout, but they will not print the book for you. Other services, like Snapfish and Shutterfly, will offer basic templates for you to upload images, and they will print and ship you the final product. Think about your needs, skills, and timetable to choose an application that will work best for you.


If you want a service that will give you premade templates and print the book for you, Shutterfly, Snapfish, and Bookify offer basic layouts.
Photo editing programs such as Adobe InDesign, Lightroom, and iPhoto can be used to make more advanced, personalized pages. You can then upload these files to a self-publishing service such as Blurb to have them printed., The size of the book will determine the price of the book as well as how many pictures you can put inside of it. Common sizes include eight by eight inches, eight by ten inches, ten by eight inches, and twelve by twelve inches.


An eight by eight book will have no more than six to eight pictures per two pages, while a twelve by twelve book can have up to ten or twelve.Most photo books will start at about twenty pages per book, regardless of size, although you may be able to pay for extra pages.
Photo book services tend to start at around fifteen to twenty dollars for a basic eight by eight book, whereas a twelve by twelve book can start at around sixty dollars. Extra pages, special bindings, and shipping can add to the price.

, If you are using a photo service, such as Shutterfly or Bookify, to create your layout, you will have the option of choosing from many templates. These free templates will show you how the pictures will be organized on the page, and they may even have room for text or graphic illustrations. Each page can have a different layout, and you should look over all of your options carefully.

Choose a book.,
Print out your photographs.,
Gather important documents.,
Write your messages out.,
Arrange your memorabilia.,
Decorate the book.",How to Make a Memorial Book3," Scrapbooks typically have blank pages where photographs can be pasted or taped onto the page. Furthermore, you can typically buy extra pages to add to the book. When selecting a scrapbook, think about its purpose and design. You might want a small and portable scrapbook, or you might want a big one that can fit many pictures onto one page.


You can buy scrapbooks at art stores or stationary stores.Most scrapbooks will come with properly sized sleeves and paper pages. You can also buy additional sleeves or pages.
Photo albums are different from scrapbooks in that they have individual sleeves for each photograph. Photo albums do not typically have space for other documents. If you want to use a photo album, you can hand write your memories on the back of the photograph.

, You can use a professional printing service or your own printer to produce the photographs. To make sure that they last a long time, you should have them printed on a heavy weight of glossy paper. Choose acid free paper with a neutral PH.You might want to print out multiple copies of each image just in case you make a mistake.


If you print the photographs yourself, you can find glossy photo paper at an office supply store. Be careful while cutting out the images to make sure that your lines are straight.

, Scrapbooks are a great place to include all of the important documents of your loved one’s life. This includes newspaper articles, certificates, artwork, and other items from throughout their life. You can paste these directly into the book.


Be careful with originals as you may not have a copy if you make a mistake or tear it.
Make sure that this memorabilia is flat so that you can fit in the scrapbook.You can also include items that represent their life. For example, if your loved one was a gardener, you might include a pressed flower. Or if your loved one taught gymnastics, you might include a pamphlet from their gym.

, You can write your special messages to the deceased directly on the page or glue them on. You can either hand-write your words on card stock or paper, or you can type up your words and print them. Cut the words out of the paper before inserting into your scrapbook.


If you are handwriting messages or dates, you can use brightly colored pens. Gel pens, permanent markers, and fountain pens are a great way to add a personal touch to the scrapbook.

, Once you have printed your photos and messages, you can start to organize them on the page. Before you glue anything, organize the photographs, letters, and other memorabilia on the page to see how they look together. Rearrange the items until you have a design that you like. You can adhere the item to the page with glue, tape, glue dots, or photo corners.


If your scrapbook came with page protectors, slide the page out of the sleeve before adhering your items to the page. Allow glue to dry before sliding it back in.

, You can use paper, ribbons, pens, and stickers to decorate the scrapbook. Think about the personality of the deceased. What images and decorations represent them best? Look at your local stationary store or craft store for options and ideas.


Letter stickers can be used to spell out titles for each section.If your loved one had a favorite color, you can find that color in card stock. Use the card stock to frame or outline photographs. To do this, trace the photograph on the card stock, and then create a border of about half an inch outside of that. Cut out the card stock, and paste the photograph to it before putting it in the scrapbook.
If your loved one traveled frequently, you can find stickers of different flags and places to put next to their travel pictures.
While your scrapbook probably came with plain paper pages, you can also buy colorful pages or pages with print designs.

Find an online forum.",How to Survive the Death of Your Child," You're entitled to whatever feelings come up. You may experience intense anger, guilt, denial, sorrow, and fear, all of which are normal for a bereaved parent. Nothing is off the table, nothing is wrong. If the urge to cry comes up, just do it. Give yourself permission to feel. Keeping your emotions bottled up is just way too hard. If you keep your emotions inside, you'll only make yourself feel worse about the saddest thing you have ever experienced. It's perfectly natural and even healthy to let yourself feel everything you can about this loss, because this will put you on the path to accepting it. You won't ever fully be able to get over it, but you'll be able to build the strength to deal with the death of your child. If you don't embrace your feelings, you won't be able to move forward.;
, There is no timetable to your grieving process. Every individual is just that: an individual. Bereaved parents may experience many of the same emotions and difficulties; however, each parent's journey is different depending on personality and life circumstances.


For years, we relied on the popular notion that people progress through five stages of grief that begin with denial and end with acceptance. The new thinking is that there is no series of steps to be completed in the grieving process. Instead, people experience a grab bag of feelings and symptoms that come and go and eventually lift. In a recent research study, scientists learned that many people accept the death of a loved one right from the beginning and report more yearning for the lost individual than feelings of anger or depression. Because the grieving process is so personal to each individual, couples sometimes find themselves at odds because they can't understand the other's way of dealing with the loss. Understand that your spouse may have different coping mechanisms than you do and allow him or her to grieve in the way that suits them.

, During the grieving process, many people will experience a state of numbness. In this state, the world may seem like a dream or seem to go on separate from them. People and things that once brought happiness evoke nothing at all. This state could pass quickly or linger for a while; it's the body's way of offering protection from overwhelming emotions. With time, feelings and connections will return.


For many, the numbness begins to wear off after the first anniversary of your child's death, and then true reality can hit very hard. Many parents say that the second year is the most difficult.

, Some parents find the thought of returning to work unbearable while others prefer to throw themselves into the daily activity and challenges that work offers. Find out what the bereavement policy is at your workplace before making your decision. Some companies also offer employees paid personal days or the opportunity to take an unpaid leave.


Don't allow fear of letting your company down force you to return to work before you're ready. According to the executive director of the Grief Recovery Institute, companies lose about $225 billion a year due to reduced productivity as an after-effect of grief. ""When someone we love dies, we lose the ability to concentrate or focus,"" Friedman said. ""Your brain doesn't work right when your heart is broken."", If you find comfort in the beliefs, teachings and rituals of your faith, turn to them now to aid in your grief recovery. Know, too, that the loss of your child may damage your religious beliefs, and that's ok. In time, you may find that you're able to return to faith; either way, if you have been a person of faith, believe that God is big enough to handle your anger, rage and sorrow.

, Wait at least one year before making any major decisions. Don't sell your house, change locations, divorce a partner or alter your life significantly. Wait until the fog has lifted, and you can clearly see the options available to you.


Be careful of impulsive decision-making in daily life. Some people adopt a ""Life is short"" philosophy that propels them to take unnecessary risks in the pursuit of living their lives to the fullest. Monitor your behavior to be sure you're not engaging in potentially harmful activities.

, The phrase ""Time heals all wounds"" may sound like a meaningless cliché, but the truth is that you will recover from this loss in time. Initially, memories will hurt you to your core, even the good ones, but at some point that will begin to change, and you'll come to cherish those memories. They'll bring a smile to your face and joy to your heart. Grief is similar to a roller coaster or the ocean's tide.


Know that it's okay to take time off from grieving--to smile, laugh and enjoy life. This does not mean you're forgetting your child; that would be impossible.

, While your impulse may be to blame yourself for what's happened, resist the urge. There are simply forces in life and nature that cannot be controlled. Beating yourself up about what you could have, would have, should have done is counterproductive to healing.

, For some parents, all they want to do is to sleep. Others find themselves pacing the floors at night and staring blankly at the TV. The death of a child takes an extreme toll on the body. Science has shown that a loss of this magnitude is similar to a major physical injury, so you absolutely need rest. Give in to the urge to sleep if you have it; otherwise, try to establish a nighttime routine--warm bath, herbal tea, relaxation exercises--that can help ease you into a good night's sleep.

, Sometimes, in the days immediately following your child's death, relatives, and friends may bring you food so that you don't have to cook. Do your best to eat a little each day in order to keep up your strength. It's difficult to deal with negative emotions and everyday activities when you're physically weak. Eventually, you may have to return to making your own meals. Keep it simple. Bake a chicken or make a big pot of soup that can last for a few meals. Find healthy takeout options in your neighborhood and restaurants that will deliver to your home.

, Whether or not you're finding it difficult to eat, try to drink at least eight glasses of water a day. Sip on a cup of soothing tea or keep a refillable water bottle with you. Dehydration is physically taxing, and your body is already being taxed enough.

, While it's understandable that you may want to blot out the memory of your child's death, excessive use of alcohol and drugs can aggravate depression and create a whole new set of problems to deal with.

, Some parents find that a sleep aid is a necessity, and that anti-anxiety or anti-depression medication helps them better cope. There are many varieties of these medications, and finding the right one that works best can be a daunting task, and one best undertaken with the help of a physician. Work with your doctor to find what works for you and to make a plan for how long you'll be on medication.

, It's not uncommon for friends to pull away during this grieving period. Some people simply do not know what to say, and those that are parents may feel uncomfortable with the reminder that the loss of a child is possible. If friends urge you to get over your grief and try to hurry you through your grieving process, set boundaries with them regarding what is and isn't an acceptable topic for conversation. If necessary, distance yourself from those who insist on dictating your grieving process.

, A couple of weeks after the funeral or at a time that feels right to you, invite friends and loved ones to a party or dinner in honor of your child. Make this gathering about sharing the good memories everyone has. Invite people to share stories and/or photos of your son or daughter. The gathering can be at your home or choose a place your child loved--a park, playground, or community center.

, There are companies that provide web space where you can share photos and videos of your child and even record his or her life story. You can also create a Facebook page that memorializes your child and restrict access so that only family and friends can see it.

, Gather photos of your child, artwork, report cards, mementos, and organize them in a scrapbook. Write captions or stories to go with the photographs. This scrapbook is something you can look at when you want to feel close to your child. It's also a way to help younger siblings learn about their brother or sister.

, You can provide funds for a project in the name of your child. For example, you may be able to donate to your local library asking them to purchase books in honor of your child. Depending on their policies, they may put a special label in front of the book with your child's name on it. Think about activities and organizations that represent the kinds of things your child liked or cared about.

, You can contact the development office at a university or work with a community foundation to set up a scholarship fund. You need about $20,000 to $25,000 to endow a scholarship that pays out $1,000 every year, but each institution sets its own rules.A scholarship fund also give your friends and family a way to honor your child by making a contribution.

, Depending on the circumstances of your child's death, you may want to get involved with an organization that calls attention to a particular cause or advocates for changes to our legal system. For example, if your child was killed by a drunk driver, you might want to join Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD).


Be inspired by John Walsh. After his six-year-old son Adam was murdered, he went on to help sponsor legislation to toughen laws on those convicted of violence against children and hosted a TV show focused on catching violent criminals.

, October 15 is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day, a day to honor and remember babies who died during pregnancy or as newborns. At 7 p.m. on that evening, participants around the world light a candle and keep it burning for at least an hour. Because of different time zones, the result is what's been described as a wave of light that spans the globe., Birthdays may initially be intensely painful, and you might choose to simply do your best to get through the day. On the other hand, some people find solace in celebrating their child's life on this special day. There are no right or wrong ways to do this--if it would give you comfort and allow you to celebrate all that was good, funny and bright about your child, then plan a birthday event.

, A good therapist can be helpful, especially if it is someone who specializes in grief counseling. Look online to find someone in your area. Plan to interview therapists over the phone before committing to a session. Ask about their experience working with bereaved parents, their process for working with a client, whether they incorporate a religious or spiritual component (something you may or may not want), their rates and their availability. Based on the circumstances of your child's death you might be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). If so, locating a therapist who has specialized in PTSD training and counseling would be helpful.

, Knowing that you're not alone in your grief and that others are facing similar challenges can be comforting. Bereavement support groups for parents are available in many communities; check online for groups near you. These groups offer a number of benefits including the chance to tell your story in a supportive, non-judgmental environment, a decreased feeling of isolation and people who validate and normalize each other's emotional reactions.


Groups are of two varieties: time-limited and open-ended. Time limited groups typically meet once a week for a pre-determined amount of time (six weeks to 10 weeks) while open-ended groups follow more of a drop-in format in which attendance may vary from meeting to meeting and the meetings may occur less frequently (monthly, bi-monthly).

, There are many forums online dedicated to supporting people living with loss; however, be aware that many include all types of loss (parents, partners, siblings, even pets). Look for one that is specifically for parents grieving the loss of a child in order to receive better understanding of your specific loss.

If the deceased is found in the middle of a road, do not attempt to move the body to a safer location, stay with the person until the paramedics arrive and signal to other commuters to divert around the scene.
If the deceased committed suicide via electric shock, be mindful of any live currents that could potentially be fatal to you as well. If you find the deceased in the bath or similar location, having shocked themselves, it's best to wait outside of the house for professionals to arrive and remove the hazards.;
, In some instances people have found that their intuition was a little off, having discovered that the individual had only been unconscious or injured. Insure that you check for vital signs on the person to determine if the casualty is still living, and be prepared to perform resuscitation.

, As soon as you have checked the person's vital signs (even if they are still living), contact your national emergency telephone number to have paramedics come and begin the process of handling the deceased. You may be in a highly emotional state, and the operator will be aware of that, just try as best as you can to tell them what's occurred and follow their guidance for possible life saving measures.

, While you wait for the paramedics to arrive, have a closer look at the entire setting and see if you can find any clues that match a possible cause of death. You're certainly not the case detective, but you can do your own research so that you can convey the information accurately to the professionals involved in the case.


You might find that the individual had an asthma inhaler close by, was reaching for medication or in more cases than you would expect, they were in the bathroom.
If the deceased committed suicide and/or are hanging (due to asphyxiation) or there is a copious amount of blood, avoid attempting to pull the body down onto the floor by yourself. Keep your distance and perhaps wait outside for the medical professionals or coroner to arrive and do their business.
Avoid removing, shifting or touching any objects in the room or at the scene of the death - in case the coroner finds the tragedy as suspicious.

, When the ambulance arrives, show them where you found the deceased person. They will do a medical examination to determine if the person is able to be recovered or if the individual has in fact passed away. You can help the paramedics out by conveying information to them about the situation, such as that they have an asthma inhaler in their right hand.


Avoid taking charge of the situation and just let the professionals do their job.

, In most cases the paramedics will contact the coroner to do their examination and study the scene to determine if they believe the death was natural or suspicious. Help the coroner by conveying vital information about the deceased and answer any questions they may have about your discovery.

, Once the body has been removed by a removal specialist and is on-route to either the morgue or hospital for storage, you can get in contact with immediate family and let them know what has happened.


It's a very hard thing telling someone that they have lost a loved one, and even more so discovering someone having passed. Understand that you might still be in shock mode and it's okay to cry or react in whatever manner.
There may be an opportunity for the family to visit the deceased at hospital if the body ends up being there. They can open up a room for you or your family to visit and say their farewell prior to the funeral service.

, It's a traumatic experience discovering a deceased individual and especially if they were a loved one, however, there are a handful of people in the world that provide a service that is there in the most disturbing times like this. Get in contact with a local funeral director and organize a time for you and or a few immediate relatives to attend a funeral arrangement conference where you discuss possible avenues to take when it comes time for either burial or cremation.


If the deceased person is a relative and has life insurance, these funds can be accessed by the next-of-kin for the funding of the funeral.
The deceased may also be entitled to a work and income funeral grant or other financial assistance.

, Finding a loved one having passed, or an individual who has died, is a highly emotional ordeal and the only way the process of recovery can truly begin is if you are respondent to grieving and have a good cry when you feel prompted. Don't hold back, let the emotions flow.

To find a qualified probate attorney, you can contact your local or state bar association. Ask for a referral.After you get a referral, you can call and schedule a half hour consultation. Most lawyers offer consultations for a reduced price or for free.;
, Your government’s requirements may be posted online. You can search by typing “your state or country” and “procedures missing person declare dead.” Many states publish their legal codes online.If you find your relevant code, read it and take notes. The code should tell you what steps you need to take.

, A person does not need to be missing for a certain amount of time to be declared dead. Instead, the government may state that after a certain number of years a person is “presumed” dead. This means that you don’t need to submit any evidence showing the person is actually dead once enough time has passed.For example, your government may state that a person is presumed dead if they have been missing seven years. If you have had continuous lack of contact for more than seven years, then you don’t need to show that it is likely the person is dead.
However, you don’t have to wait seven years. For example, someone might have witnessed your spouse be swept over the side of a boat and dragged into the ocean. In this situation, the court might find that there is sufficient evidence to conclude the person likely died.

, Only certain people can petition for a declaration of death. The precise list of people who are authorized to petition the court will differ by country and state. In England or Wales, for example, the following people can make a claim:spouse or civil partner
parent
child
sibling

, If someone saw your family member in imminent danger of death, then you should get witness statements. For example, someone might have seen your relative fall into the ocean or enter a building that collapsed. If the body cannot be found, you will need witness statements to describe the imminent danger faced by the missing person.


You should have witnesses sign an affidavit, so that you can submit this person’s testimony to a court when you petition for a declaration of death.

, If a police report was filed about an accident or disaster, then you should get a copy. You can submit it with your petition.To get a copy of any police report, see Obtain a Police Report.

, Generally, you have to make a concerted effort to find a missing person.You cannot just sit back and wait for the missing person to contact you. To show that you have made a diligent search, you should do the following:Notify law enforcement that the person is missing.
Hire a private investigator to search for the missing person, if you can afford one.
Advertise in newspapers or periodicals that the person is missing and provide contact information so that people with information can contact you.

, Your government’s law will tell you which court to file your petition with. Generally, you will need to petition the court in the county where the missing person last lived.This county might not be where you live today.


For example, your spouse might have disappeared when you were living in Cook County, Illinois. After seven years have passed, you have moved to North Carolina. You will have to get a court in Cook County to declare your spouse dead.

, Your court may have printed “fill in the blank” forms that you can use. You can find these forms by checking online or with the court clerk.It is probably easiest to search the Internet first. If you don’t find anything, stop into your local probate court.

, Generally, you can file the petition by stopping into court and asking to file. In some places, you may be able to file by mailing the petition to the court.


Always be sure to keep a copy of the petition for your records.
Submit copies of supporting evidence along with the petition, such as police reports or witness affidavits., You usually have to pay a fee in order to file the petition.The fee will vary depending on your country and state. Look at your form: it should contain fee information.

, Your court may require that you send copies of your petition to people and institutions which have an interest in whether the missing person is declared legally dead. For example, you might have to inform any of the following:the missing person’s spouse or civil partner
other family members of the missing person, such as siblings or children
any organization with an interest in the missing person, such as an insurance company

, Your government probably also requires that you advertise the complaint in a local newspaper.The purpose of advertising is to notify others in the community that you are trying to have the missing person declared dead. If someone in the community objects, then they can raise their objection at the hearing.


The length of time the advertisement must run will differ depending on your law. Read your government’s requirements.
In England and Wales, for example, you must advertise in a newspaper located near the missing person’s last known address. The advertisement must appear within 7 days of your application. The UK government’s website has a sample text you can use.
In Ohio, for example, you must advertise once a week for four weeks in a newspaper located in the county where you filed your petition.

, You will probably have to file proof of the advertisement with the court.The court will not go looking on its own. Instead, you should save several copies of the newspaper and submit the advertisements to the court.


There may be timelines involved. For example, you might have to send the advertisement to the court five days before your hearing, or earlier. Check with your court.

, Within a couple months of submitting your petition, you will probably have a hearing in court. You should take a copy of your petition as well as any supporting evidence, such as police reports/witness statements.Another family member or a member of the public might show up to challenge the declaration of death. If enough time has passed so that the presumption of death applies, then the challenger will have to produce evidence that the missing person is alive.There may be several hearings, especially if someone challenges your petition or if the court does not think you have performed a diligent search.

, You can only get a copy of the death certificate if the judge declares the person presumed dead. You can ask the court clerk about how to get a copy and how much you must pay for each copy.You should get several copies. You may need to show copies to a trustee, insurance company, or a bank.
You should also keep a copy for your records.

Reflect on memories of your deceased friend.,
Don’t micromanage your friends feelings.,
Offer help to your friends.,
Accept and ask for help when needed.,
Continue to check in even after it’s been a few months.,
Have a sleepover.,
Schedule meals together.,
Keep traditions alive.,
Create a book club.,
Spend some time in silence.,
Get help for your friends when necessary.,
Be present.,
Make a set routine.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Grieve a Friend's Death with Mutual Friends," After your friend has passed, get your friends together to reminisce. Reflect on your past memories of them. Be honest about how you are feeling. Laugh if you feel so inclined or cry if you need to. Listen to your friends as they share their memories, too.You could start off by saying “Do y’all remember when Charles fell off of his bike when we were at the park that one day and we all couldn’t stop laughing? That was one of my favorite memories of him and of us all together.”;
, When having these discussions, remember that you experienced the friendship differently than they did. They had their own personal relationship with your deceased friend that, though you witnessed, you were not fully a part of. If you feel that they are being too emotional or perhaps even not emotional enough, avoid trying to make them behave differently or telling them how they should feel.For instance, perhaps one of your friends has been acting very standoffish and it might appear that they don’t care. Remember that you don’t know what’s going on in their head or how they experience and handle grief. Check in with them regularly to see if they are okay.

, After this loss, there will be some days that you will feel stronger and more productive than others. During this time, see if you can be of any assistance to your friends. Check in to see if they need any errands run or if they would like you to bring them some food. Helping others will help you work through your own grief., Just as there will be times that you can offer help, know that it is okay to ask for help, too. If you’re feeling particularly down in the dumps, don’t shy away from asking for help. If your friends are offering some assistance to you, accept it and return the favor later.You might call or text your friends and say something like “Hey everyone, I’m feeling a bit down in the dumps today. Anyone wanna come over to keep me company?”

, After the initial sting of this loss, you might begin to get back into the groove of life, which is normal. However, know that grief is a lifelong process, particularly over someone you were close with. Continue to reach out to your friends weeks and months after the loss to see how they are doing and maintain your friendship.One great way to keep in touch with everyone is to establish a group text that you can use periodically.

, After the loss, you or your friends may not want to be alone very much. Whether you are a teen or a grown adult, consider spending a night or two together to comfort one another and provide some relief.You can listen to music, cook dinner or order out, watch a movie together, or just spend some time talking.

, Alone time can be good in sorting through grief after a loss, but having meals with someone can be a nice break from sadness. Cooking for yourself each night can seem daunting, but you and your friends could consider taking turns cooking a larger meal each night. This way, you don’t have to worry about cooking every day and you get to spend time with friends., Perhaps you had some traditions within your group like going to see a movie once per month or taking an annual beach trip. Continue to keep your friendship strong despite this loss by maintaining and growing these traditions.

, Another way that you can work through your grief together is to start a book club with you friends. Consider selecting a book about grief or loss in general. Get together weekly to discuss your reflections and thoughts about the book., Your time with your friends does not need to always be filled with meals, books or chatter. Sometimes, silence is the best medicine. Don’t feel the need to talk constantly or plan activities. Plan some time to just be together without words or structure., Though it is good to try to help your friends through this difficult time, especially if they are taking it worse than you, don’t always feel the need to rescue them. Know that you don’t have to be at your friend’s beck and call every time they reach out to you. Enable them to find additional systems of support.If you feel that your friend needs help beyond what you are able to provide, consider seeking help for them. Call a friend to help you or even call 911 if they are violent or suicidal.

, It can sometimes be easier to avoid your feelings of grief by submerging yourself in work or some other activity. However, in order to heal, you must be fully present. Don’t try to stifle your feelings; express them instead. Take some time each day to be alone and cry, journal, meditate, or reflect. Give your friends your attention when you are together and be sure to keep up with your other responsibilities., Though grief is important, be sure you are attending to all of the things that you need to do. Each day, write out a list of all of the things that you need to do the next day. Try to keep your routine as uniform and normal as possible in order to restore some calm to your life.For instance, you might have to go to work, pick up your child, cook dinner, and then clean up your home each day. Try to stick to this routine while incorporating time just for you.

, Know that self-care is critical. You cannot care for others nor can you process your grief if you do not take care of yourself. Be sure to eat at least two meals a day. Keep your hygiene up by showering at least once daily and keeping yourself neat and well kempt. If you can, exercise as well."
"
Accept there is no 'right' or 'wrong' way to deal with this.,
Keep talking about how you are feeling as much as possible.,
Also be aware you may need time to yourself.,
Create mementos or items to celebrate and remember your brother or sister.,
Remember you are not the only person to be grieving and other people's actions will be influenced by this.,
Look for counseling or other professional help.,
Specifically ask not for pity.,
Whenever you are talking with someone, don't act unusually or bring up the topic.,
Grieve but not too much.,
If someone gives you a present reminding you of your late sibling, keep it.,
Make a little ""memory gift"" yourself.",How to Deal With Your Brother or Sisters' Death," You may feel numb or in disbelief for some time. You may feel like you should feel sadder. You may feel like you couldn't ever feel sadder than this. You may want to scream and shout. You may want to lock yourself away alone. All of these are normal feelings and it's perfectly ok to feel this way. Do not put pressure on yourself to feel a certain way.;
, It may not always be easy to put into words but try to explain to others around you how you are feeling. Close friends and family will want to help you as much as possible but won't always know how, so telling them how you feel and how you need them to act around you will help them to figure out how best to help you.

, Whilst it is good to keep talking to others as much as possible, you may also need some time to yourself to process your own thoughts and feelings. This is perfectly ok. You may find that going to a particular place helps you to focus your thoughts - this may be a place that was special to your sibling, your brother or sister's resting place, a quiet park, or even your own room. You may also find writing down your thoughts and feelings helps you to get things a little more straight in your mind.

, This could include getting involved with their funeral arrangements by helping to pick the songs or readings. You may even want to read something out yourself. You may not feel up to contributing to the ceremony much and it may only be later on that you feel you can start remembering your brother or sister without it seeming too painful. There are lots of ideas for items you can make to help you keep their memory alive; scrapbooks, memory boxes, photo albums, poetry, playlists. The more personal they are, the better they will be for you when you want to spend some time remembering your sibling and the good times you had together. You may also find spending time doing projects with other members of your family can help you cope - these projects may be totally unrelated to your brother or sister but can help give you something else to focus on whilst still in an environment where you are still surrounded by other people who know what you are going through.

, Other siblings, your parents, cousins, grandparents, friends, aunties and uncles will all be touched by your brother or sister's death in different ways. Remember this and treat their wishes and emotions with the same respect you want yours to be treated. You may get asked a lot how your parents are coping, and this may seem hurtful and disrespectful if it feels like people are ignoring your feelings over that of your parents. These people are just trying to help and may not feel comfortable asking you directly how you are feeling. But always remember that your emotions, and your ways of grieving and coping, are just as valid as anybody else's.

, This is a serious event to happen in your life and there is no shame in seeking outside help. There is lots of support out there and many people find comfort in speaking to people outside of their friends and family. From group meetings to one-on-one sessions, telephone lines and internet forums, there are plenty of places to go to if you feel you need to. Your doctor will be able to point in the best direction.

, Sympathetic glances every once in a while are okay, but most people who have just been through such an ordeal don't appreciate pity like most people mistakenly think they do. If you make it clear right away, people will try to avoid doing something to displease you, especially at a time of suffering.

, That results in pity, which is something you absolutely do not want.

, This also includes not wallowing in self pity.

, Don't throw it away or rid of it any other way. Later on, when the grief has gone away a little more, you'll crave memories, and a gift that reminds you of your sibling would be the perfect thing to take out right then.

, These include scrapbooks, photo albums, dedication websites, etc. Keep your late sibling in your heart constantly.

Accept the fact that your crush is gone.,
Go ahead and grieve, shed your tears, and let the pain wash over and through you.,
Put your thoughts down in a journal or diary.,
Find out if there is an online page dedicated to the person who has died.,
Write a letter to the person, tell them everything you ever felt about them, and how it feels to lose them.,
Talk to your friends about what you feel.,
Go and pay your last respects, either at the funeral, or if you cannot deal with that level of emotion, to a place you associate with the person.,
Tell your parents, a very close friend, or a pastor if you belong to a church about your hurt.,
Get back into life.,
Tell your parents if you feel at the least like you just can't deal with this on your own.",How to Deal With Your Crush's Death," This may be the most difficult part, especially if you had deep feelings for that person, and you never had an opportunity to share those feelings.;
, This is difficult, but it is an unavoidable part of the process. The depth of the hurt reflects the depth of your humanity, and your love for the one who has died.

, List each thought you have about the person, and after you have written it down, think about it, even immerse yourself into it. Until you do this, you will not be able to get past it toward acceptance and peace.

, Often there will be memorial pages, with blogs or links so you can write your feelings for the world to share anonymously. If there is not, you can begin one.

, Seal it in a plain envelope with no name or address, and put it in a safe place. This will verbalize your feelings, and make them a permanent part of your own history and memories.

, If your feelings are too personal or you think it would be embarrassing, you can talk in general terms about it, but you need to share what you are feeling, and receive support from people who care about you.

, Drop some flowers there, or something you believe they would like, sit and let another flood of tears flow over you if you need to, then walk away with the knowledge that you are beyond the place where you can give them any more.

, Do not let depression become a prison for you. It is normal to feel depressed for a time, and the feelings of grief and regret will continue to come around for a long time, even the rest of your life, but again, that is just a reminder of your own humanity, and your care for another person.

, Return to school, and other activities you are expected to be involved in. It may seem hard to do at first, but being engaged in something challenging, productive, and familiar will allow you to focus on things at hand, and not your regrets.

, There are counselors and other professionals who can offer help in healing from your loss if it is too much for you.

See a therapist to cope with identity or self-esteem issues.,
Know that you will never stop missing her.,
Realize that your sense of identity has changed.,
Celebrate the time you had to spend with her, if she passed.,
Maintain your relationship with her through letters.",How to Deal Without a Mother (Teen Girl)," Trust consists of the major building blocks of any relationship.However, the fact that your mother is not in your life may cause you to become distrustful of others. This may be very hard as you have grown up without a bond with your mother, and that’s where we often learn to trust others. Make a true effort to trust others and open yourself up to be more vulnerable. This may not happen all at once but closing yourself off can hurt future relationships. Be open with others about your misgivings and fears, it will help them to know what you are worried about and how to help ease your feelings. You may be surprised at how far others will go to help you if you just ask.
Take baby steps. Share something slightly intimate with someone you have an established relationship. Assess the person’s reaction. If the person keeps your confidence and is supportive to you, then you can gradually share more and more with this person. Try this method with several people in your life, such as family members, close friends, and your favorite teachers.;
, Due to feelings of loss about your mom, you may try to push other family members away. Be aware that you may do this and try to resist pushing these people out. While your dad, grandma, or aunt cannot replace your mom, these relatives can provide you with a sense of family.Building relationships with your grandmother, older sister, uncle, or other guardian does not mean you have forgotten your mother. However, this can provide you with some form of nurturing and support that you are lacking.

, Make a commitment to yourself to let others around you into your life. You may find a teacher or coach who attempts to take on a parental role in some form or another. Or, you may find a mentor from an outside source like Big Brothers Big Sisters or a community organization such as a church group. Take on a mentor and slowly try to build trust with this person.


Developing strong, healthy bonds with others during your teenage years can reduce the risk of you engaging in unhealthy behaviors and help you develop better social skills., Whether you have lost your mother to death or she is not available emotionally, there are many support groups of people in similar situations.A support group will help you understand that there is nothing wrong with you and you are not alone in entering adulthood without a mother. If your mother left the home, you may feel like there was something wrong with you so she could not love you. Talking with others in the same situation will help to show that this is a common misconception.

, A young woman who has lost a mother may quickly become independent. While this can be a positive trait, you must also be willing to relax the reigns and let others help you.


You may find it is hard to trust others if your mother violated your trust by leaving. Make an effort to allow others to help and not force the rejection from your mother onto them. You may also find yourself drawn to a destructive relationship since that is what you grew up with.
Recognize this unhealthy pattern and take steps to overcome it so that her absence does not leave a negative mark on your development., It is not unusual for you to be overly sensitive in your feelings and even to avoid getting close to others because you fear they will just leave or die. You might appear hard on the outside, but, on the inside, you are filled with fears of abandonment.Avoidance is a big issue when trying to deal with the feelings of loss. This means you may feel like it is better to not have friends or date because you know the people you get close to will let you down. Try to talk to someone about those feelings (e.g. sibling, best friend, aunt, etc.) and come to understand that they do not transfer to everyone else in your life.

, Growing up without a mother may change the way you feel about families, but don’t fall into the trap of thinking you cannot be a good mom one day because your mom left.If your mother left due to negative behaviors like drug addiction or factors like mental health issues, recognize that the cycle needs to be broken to avoid making that same mistake. Many times, for example, a teen mother will become a grandmother very early as her daughter is more likely to become a teen parent. You can break the cycle of the negative behavior.
Take some time to think about the beliefs and values that are important to you in life. You might value family, honesty, loyalty, and many other things. Try to create a life that allows you to uphold these values.

, Your sense of self-worth could be severely impacted by not having a mother figure in your life. Because your mother is not there to guide you, you may become overly critical of yourself, jealous of other girls your age, or withdraw from social situations completely. Being open to talk about these feelings and not allowing them to overtake your life can help.


A professional counselor or therapist can create a supportive environment for you to discuss these matters and help you build a stronger self-esteem and resolve your identity issues., You may feel a variety of emotions depending on why your mother is not in your life. Even if your mother abandoned you and you are angry or sad about this, you will probably also never stop missing her.You may go through a variety of emotions and certain triggers will bring those to the forefront. Things like a birthday, anniversaries or even Mother’s Day may trigger feelings. Don’t be surprised if these dates bring out a much stronger reaction than you expect, you may never fully move past not having your mother.

, Not having a mother suddenly means having a hole in your life where she used to be. If you have grown up without a mother, you may not have enjoyed the nurturing relationship many young girls may share with the moms. Expect that such a major person missing from your life will or has changed many things about who you are and how you view the world.Take some time to figure out how you identify without your mother. If she has passed away there will probably be a continued discussion with family about her. This may be different if she is gone for other reasons; they may just stop talking about her all together.
The death of a parent and losing a parent due to them leaving probably feels very different though you grieve in both cases.

, You will probably feel sad for quite some time after her passing but don’t be afraid to also be happy when you remember the time you shared together.Many people enjoy writing a journal to record memories or small events you may remember during your daily life. There will be things around you that remind you of her, write those happy memories down so you can enjoy them later.
You might also visit her grave and speak with her in this way. Another option is to celebrate her life by looking through pictures of her many memories.

, You can’t ask for your mother’s advice, feel her warmth in a hug, or even see her disapproval at a choice you made. But, you can share the trials and tribulations of your life with her. Develop a regular habit of writing to her whenever you miss her most.


These letters can be useful for both a mother who has passed and in the event that your mother is still living but not involved. You need to feel you have shared certain things with her regardless of why she is not there.

High schoolers, on the other hand, can understand the finality of death and its causes.

For example, after witnessing Sept. 11, some younger children might associate death with walking into tall buildings.Be truthful -- minimizing or ignoring negative emotions will only confuse your child later on., Don't make up stories, or wait to tell them ""at the right time"" for fear of hurting them.

, Like many adults, children have a hard time expressing themselves or knowing when to speak about serious subjects like death.

This helps you find the right tone and information for their maturity level., Talk to children about the good things that they remember.

, There are many myths out there about how a person should grieve. The reality is you need to grieve in the way that suits you. This may include crying, shouting, getting lost in your work, or sitting silently. Don’t hold yourself up to any comparisons about what grief should look like—just feel your feelings, however they come.


For example, you shouldn't look to deeply in how you grieve versus how others do. If you don't cry, that doesn't mean you didn't care about the person.
Keep in mind that the intense emotions (or lack of intense emotions) you feel is temporary. Grief—no matter how bad it feels—doesn’t last forever., You might want to withdraw from others because you don’t think they can understand.

Say their name.,
Request a keepsake from their family.,
Recall fond memories.,
Re-visit sacred places or recreate favorite practices.,
Make a scrapbook of your friend's life.,
Do something cool in your friend's honor.",How to Deal With a Friend's Death2," A lot of times when someone dies, others may have a hard time talking about them without getting upset. However, this makes those who do want to share stories feel isolated. If you feel comfortable talking about your friend, use their name in conversation. They lived and they were very important to you. That doesn’t have to change because they died., Holding on to an item that was important to your friendship can help you cope with your grief and feel closer to your friend. Reach out to their family in the weeks after the death. Ask if they will allow you to take a special item as a keepsake of your friendship.For example, you might take the book you lent them that they never returned, or the t-shirt they wore on the day you met. The best keepsakes will have symbolic value for the friendship.

, A great way to remember someone who has died is reliving the good times you shared with them. Spend some time thinking about special occasions you had with the person: birthdays, milestones, and even just days hanging out at home.Find others who were close to your friend, such as a boyfriend/girlfriend, sibling, or other friends. Talk to these people about them when you want to relive the memories.

, Another great way to your friend’s memory alive is by recreating the memories you shared with the person. Just because they are gone doesn’t mean you can’t continue to have lunch at the pizza parlor on Fridays or watch your favorite TV show. It might be hard at first, but you may find that visiting certain places or doing certain activities may help you feel closer to your friend.

, Include photos of your friend at different points in life. Also, include pictures of the two of you together. Write little captions or stories next to the pictures. Look at it when you are feeling down, and share it with other friends., If your friend liked riding their bike, find out when the next MS ride is, and ride in your friend's honor. Or, if they were a lifelong reader, start a book club in their memory. Raise money and start a scholarship fund in your friend's name. Find ways to honor your friend by keeping their legacy alive."

Stick to your routine.,
Redefine yourself.,
Spend time with supportive loved ones.,
Talk to a grief counselor.",How to Deal With a Friend's Death3," At some point, you will feel able to return to your daily life. Things won’t go back to normal, but you can cope with the adjustment by creating a schedule. Having structure can almost feel like a warm blanket when the world has otherwise spun out of our control. So, develop a routine that works for you and stick to it.Think about the things you typically do in a day and write them down in a planner. Allot enough time for different events and activities, like eating lunch or commuting to work or school. Try to keep a stable sleep schedule by waking and lying down at the same times each day.

, The time after a death often leads people to think about the meaning of life. Your friend’s death may have made you more aware of things within yourself you’d like to change. Take some time to decide what kind of person you want to be moving forward.For instance, maybe you didn’t feel like you spent enough time with family. If so, start making that a priority. Or, perhaps your friend’s life was cut short and you are more inspired to live your own life more fully.

, In the weeks and months after your friend’s death, it pays to surround yourself with positive and supportive people. This might be another close friend, a sibling, a parent, a teacher, or a spiritual advisor. You might talk about your grief or simply ask the person to support you in some way.For example, you might say, “I was preparing to apply to college when Jenny died. Can you help me get back on track with my applications?”

, If you can’t seem to resume your place in the world after your friend’s death, you may need professional help. Some people experience complicated grief. You may blame yourself for the death, stop going to school or work, neglect your appearance, and even have thoughts of suicide.

Be patient with yourself.",How to Deal With a Parent's Death," Don't be too hard on yourself and impose a timeline for getting over your loss. The Victorians took two to four years to mourn a death. While that doesn't have to be you, don't expect to be ready to get back into the swing of things after a few weeks, a month, or however much time you think you need. Instead, be patient with yourself and let go of the expectations you may have for yourself.


Try to keep in mind that grieving is a process. You'll probably be grieving in some way for a long, long time, though hopefully it won't always be this intense. Work through it in your own time.;
, Though it's normal to be depressed, remember that your parent loved you and wouldn't want this event to cripple your life forever. As you work through the loss, try to get back into doing the things you enjoyed before. Of course, this is easier said than done, but it doesn't mean that you should forget about the fact that your parent was happiest when you were happiest. This doesn't mean you have to sweep all of your negative feelings under the rug, but it does mean that you should make an effort to keep enjoying the little things as much as you can.


Of course, if you feel completely devastated by the loss and unable to get back into the swing of things right away, don't let the memory of your parent make you feel guilty about not getting back on your feet.

, They will always have been a big part of your life no matter what, even if they have passed away. Write down your memories together because as you go on you probably don't want to forget those moments in your life. You just have to know that they will never leave that place in your heart. Take comfort in the memories you have of that person without obsessing over not remembering every little thing. Just do the best you can.You can talk to the people who also knew your parent about him or her to keep the memory alive. You can also tell stories about the parent to people who did not know him or her, from time to time.
You can also ask family members questions about your parent to help understand all of his or her life experiences. This can add a new layer to your relationship with your parent, and can make your memory of your parent even more vivid.

, Be a little more gentle on yourself than you usually would. Take extra time to relax, try to find constructive distractions, and shut down any self-criticism for now. Though you may be filled with too much grief to care about your own well-being, it's important to get at least seven to eight hours of sleep, eat three healthy meals a day, and to get at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. It's likely that you'll be in need of energy because of your loss, and keeping your body in order will help you not feel so sluggish.


Of course, sleeping and eating well won't help you forget your parent completely. But it will make it much easier for you to go about your daily life while dealing with your loss.

, It's important to be aware of when you'll be the most upset and to know that you'll need extra support. For example, if you lost your father, you may need to spend some extra time with your loved ones on Father's Day; if you lost your mother, then you may get upset during certain activities, like shopping, that you traditionally did with your mother. Knowing what will make you upset will help you prepare to not be alone during those times., It's true that there are five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, but that doesn't mean that you have to neatly go through each of those stages in order to truly deal with the loss of your parent. You may be angry or depressed first, feel denial later, or bargain after you feel depression, and there's nothing wrong with that. Everyone grieves in his or her own way, at his or her own time., Your parent's death may make you realize that your marriage is a lie, that your career is meaningless, or that you should drop everything and become a pineapple farmer in Hawaii. While all of these realizations may be true, you should avoid doing anything impulsive or acting on them until you feel ready to make a rational decision. Making big changes in your life probably won't help you get over your parent's death any faster, and you may end up doing something that you regret.

, Nobody should be alone during a time of grief. When you're dealing with the loss of a parent, you may want to spend all of your time alone, curled up in a little ball. It's okay to have some alone time for a while, but eventually, you should make an effort to see some of your friends. It'll help you to socialize, get outside your own head, and have someone who can help you deal with your feelings. Make an effort to see the friends who care about you instead of shutting them out.


Remember that your friends are likely at a loss too, and they may not know exactly what to do or say. Appreciate the fact that they're trying.
This doesn't mean you should hit up the clubs or go to your best acquaintance's 30th birthday boozy brunch; you don't have to go out in big groups if you're not up for it yet.

, Talking to a family member after the loss of one of your parents can be one of the best ways of finding support. If you've lost one parent but still have another, spend as much time with that parent as you can. Your parent will be grieving, too, and will likely need your support. Though being around other family members may be painful because it will remind you of your loved one, it's far better than being alone with your pain.


Talking about your parent can help you ease the pain, too. You may not be ready to talk about that person, at first, but after a while, talking about him or her will make you feel better.

, Some therapists or counselors specialize in helping people deal with loss. If you feel like your grief is trapping you and preventing you from moving forward, you might want to contact someone for help. Though talking to your friends or family members can be a big help, sometimes getting the perspective and aid of a person outside of your personal situation can help you take a new approach to your life. Therapy is definitely not for everyone, but that doesn't mean you should be skeptical of trying this approach.


A grief counselor may also be able to suggest some new approaches for dealing with your grief. Though there's no one magical solution, getting multiple opinions can help you find the right path.

, There are many support groups for people who have suffered the loss of a parent. You may feel like there is only so much your friends, or even your other parent or other beloved family members can say, because they cannot completely relate to how you are feeling. Don't be embarrassed about needing some outside help, and look into support groups in your area. You may meet people who are crucial to helping you move forward.

, If you're religious, then spending more time at your organization of choice, whether it's a church or a synagogue, can also help you think of the bigger picture and to help you in your grieving process. Your organization likely has plenty of events, from barbecues to volunteer activities that you can participate in, and you can try to be active within your organization to spend some time with like-minded people and working for a greater good.

, Though you may think this is ridiculous advice, no one is saying that a kitten is going to replace your mother or your father. However, taking care of a pet can make you feel good and needed, and like you're less alone, and can bring you a tremendous amount of joy. If you're feeling very lonely, and especially if you've been talking about getting a cat or a dog for a while, then you should go to your local pet shelter and bring home a puppy or a kitten to take care of., Once you get back into the swing of things, start mixing it up. If you do the same thing you always did, then you're more likely to keep mourning your parent during certain times of the day. Find a way to switch up your schedule, whether it means going to a new coffee shop to do work, or spending the time you spent on the phone with your mom doing yoga. This doesn't mean you should avoid doing anything that reminds you of your parent, but it does mean that changing your daily schedule can make you move on faster.


Try something completely new. If you want to break up your routine, take that painting class you've been meaning to take, grab some coffee with the neighbor who has been asking you to hang out, or even catch up on the last season of The Good Wife. Treat yourself. It doesn't even have to be something that will improve your mind or body.

, Though it's good to mix it up, it's also important to return to your favorite activities if you want to come close to feeling whole again. Whether you loved to paint, write poetry, or work at your local soup kitchen, don't deny yourself your favorite activities just because you think you're too sad to do them. Soon you'll see that you can find some happiness -- even if only a little bit -- in doing your favorite things.


If you don't have the heart to do something you used to do with your parent, such as hiking or running, bring a friend along if you really want to get back into it.

, This is not the time to drink heavily and hit up the dance floor with your girlfriends. Though it may make you forget your problems for a little while, alcohol is a depressant, and it may make you feel worse, whether it's when you're coming down from it in the moment, or the next day. You can have a drink or two if you're feeling up to it, but try not to alter your mental state too much. And if you're thinking about taking prescription drugs to deal with the pain, talk to your doctor about whether or not this is a good idea for you.

, Try to fill your schedule with as many meaningful activities as possible. Attempt to see a friend at least a few times a week, and to do something social as often as you're feeling up to it. Make sure, also, to leave the house at least twice a day, no matter what. It's also important that you spend time working or being in school, exercising, and doing the things that matter to you. If something fun is coming up, mark it on your calendar, so you have something to look forward to. Having a busy and active life will make you feel better about everything, even if you have to motivate yourself to keep going strong a bit.


This doesn't mean that you should force yourself to be busy 24/7 so you don't have time to sit and think about your parent. Instead, make sure that you do factor in some alone time into your schedule. As long as not all of your time is alone time, it's important to have some time to be alone with your thoughts, even if they aren't happy ones.

, It's important to focus on doing some relaxing things as you go through the process of grieving. This is the time to spoil yourself a little, and to spend time doing things that make you feel better, even if only a little bit better. Here are some things you can do:


Write your thoughts down in a journal. Writing daily can help you get in touch with your thoughts.
Try yoga or mediation. This can help you center your mind and your body.
Spend time out in the sun. Get out of that coffee shop and go read outside instead. A little bit of sunshine and fresh air can go a long way.
Reread your favorite novels. Take comfort in them.
Listen to some soothing music. Nothing too jarring, please.
Go for walks. Get some exercise while getting in touch with your thoughts.

, As you start enjoying your life again, make sure not to overburden yourself. It really can take months or years to even begin to feel like your old self again, and it's important not to rush it. As long as you have goals and are looking toward the future, it's okay to take the smallest baby steps toward your new life without your parent. You should know that while you'll never be able to fully get over your loss, you will be able to develop a new relationship with the parent you lost, in time.


Don't force it. Listen to what your mind and heart is telling you. If you're not ready to make big moves yet, then take your time. This is far better than overexerting yourself and crashing. The important thing is to know that things will get better, even if it takes a long time.

Some people take a lot less time than others when it comes to moving on after the passing of a loved one, and you shouldn't feel down on yourself if you feel like you've been in grief for a long time. The important thing is that you take the time to fully process your feelings instead of going through the motions of moving on right away, and repressing how you really feel.Know that there's no firm line you cross from grieving to ""moving on,"" and that moving on doesn't mean that you've forgotten your grandparent and are no longer sad about the loss. Every person should take as much time as he or she needs.
Of course, if many, many months have gone by, or even a year or two, and you feel like you're still so deep in grief that you're finding it hard to function, then getting professional help could be a way to move forward.;
, Another way to accept your feelings is to cry, scream, be angry, or just to do whatever you need to do to get your feelings out. You don't want to hold back your tears or repress your emotions because that will lead you to have a harder time coping down the line. You may be wary of showing your emotions, especially if a grieving parent or your other grandparent needs you for support, but you should let those feelings out some time, whether it's with a friend, an understanding family member, or by yourself.Taking time just to cry can be very therapeutic. That said, don't feel guilty or confused if you're not the crying type and you can't find tears even though you're deeply sad.
This can also be a good time to write in your journal about how you're feeling. It can help you channel your feelings in a more organized and quiet way.

, Don't think that there will come a point when you stop thinking about your beloved grandparent entirely. You can always keep him or her in your heart and memory. Allow yourself to think about the good times you shared, the conversations you had, and the trips you took together. And if you had some disagreements or bad times together, you can think about that too. It's not about only treasuring the good times and forgetting the bad, but about honoring the entire person.


Write down anything you remember about your grandparent. This can help you forever keep him or her in your heart.
Look at photographs of you with your grandparent to feel at peace.

, Of course, some times of the year or some places will make it harder for you to cope with the loss of a grandparent. Maybe you should avoid the lake where you used to go fishing with your grandfather, or the diner where your grandmother always took you to get ice cream, for a while until you feel ready to face your favorite places. Maybe Thanksgiving or Christmas will be especially hard because you associate those holidays with spending time with your grandparents. Knowing what those triggers are can help you either avoid them, or find extra support if you can't.


This doesn't mean that you should stop doing all of the things you loved to do with your grandparent forever. It just means you may need a bit of time away from those things until you feel more stable and at peace.
Unfortunately, some things like holidays may always be a little bit harder. But with time, as well as support from your family, you will be able to enjoy them again while thinking of your grandparent at the same time.

, One of the best things you can do to accept your feelings is to talk to your other family members about the loss. Your parents may really need your support, and you should be there for them. If you have another living grandparent, you should also be there for him or her through this difficult time. You can both share your own feelings while supporting your loved ones, and you shouldn't feel pressure to be strong all the time. The most important thing is that you should be present.Don't be afraid to share your feelings. Spend more time around your family members than usual instead of holing up in your room with your sadness. Even if they may not ask for your company, they'll appreciate it.

, One important thing to keep in mind as you deal with the loss of your grandparent is that you shouldn't forget to take care of yourself. Make sure you get enough rest — without spending all day in bed — eat three healthy meals a day, and take the time to go outside and to socialize. Taking care of other family members may be important, but you shouldn't completely sacrifice your own well-being in the processes. Showering regularly and maintaining your hygiene can also help you feel more in control of your life. Though you will still feel unsettled, sticking to a healthy routine can make a big difference.


Even if you feel absolutely horrible, just showering and putting on clean clothes can make you feel better than spending all day in bed without grooming yourself.
Getting enough rest can help you feel more in control of your emotions. If you're exhausted from not getting enough sleep or feeling wonky from sleeping too much, then it will be harder for you to cope.

, Once your parents or other family members are ready, don't be shy about asking them about anything you didn't know about your grandparent. Talk to them about where he or she grew up, what his or her job was like, what stories you may not have heard about him or her, or just any other details that spring to mind when your beloved grandparent comes up. Many grandchildren tend to think of their grandparents as kind old people instead of people with a rich history and background, especially if they lose them at a young age; having a sense of the whole person you lost can help you feel like you're more in control of the situation.


If your parent is ready to talk about it, ask what it was like for him or her to grow up in a house with your grandparent, and what memories he or she can share from childhood.

, Though not all grandparents love to reminisce about their lives, many of them do love to share stories of their childhood, their work, their home city or country, or what the world was like, back in the day. Get together with your loved ones and see how many stories you remember hearing from your beloved grandparent. Writing them all down can help you get a sense of the whole person, and can give you something to treasure forever.


You can even pass the notebook around, letting everyone write the story he or she remembers. Though it's impossible to get a full sense of the person you lost, you can find comfort in remembering these stories.

, Though your beloved grandparent may not have had a Facebook account that chronicled his or her life from birth until his or her final years, looking through a family album can help you find peace and to get a better understanding of the person your grandparent was. There may not be a million photographs available, so you should really linger over each and every photo and memory made by your grandparent. Go through the album with a family member, who can help provide some context, and take comfort in the fact that your grandparent lived a full and rich life.


If the photos aren't organized in a photo album but are sitting in a box, you can even make a project out of it and create a photo album that honors your grandparent's memory chronologically.
Of course, this activity will lead to some more tears. Make sure you're ready before you do it.

, Take a look at the gifts, photos, sweaters, books, jewelry, or other treasured keepsakes that your grandparent gave you. If it's something you can wear, wear it for a while. If not, display it prominently. Don't think that you have to get rid of these items or put them out of sight to ""get over"" the loss of your grandparent. You can keep them near and dear to your heart and honor the memory of the person you love.


If there's something special your grandparent gave you, like a pendant, a figurine, or a written letter, you can even carry it on your person for a while and turn to it for comfort. Though it may seem silly and symbolic, it can help you grieve.

, If you think that visiting the grave of your grandparent will help you grieve and have a quiet conversation with the one you lost, then you should make a trip there when you feel ready, either alone or with family members. If you're really young and haven't been to a grave before, then you should talk to your parents about it and see if you're ready. If you're older and think that this will help you honor the memory of the person you lost, then you should take this step if you can.


Bringing flowers or whatever is appropriate in your culture can help you pay tribute to the person you lost.

, You may also be able to honor the memory of your grandparent by talking to other people who experienced a similar loss. If you feel like your family members may be too emotionally drained to talk about it, you can talk to friends who have experienced a similar pain and who can help you get through this hard time. Though no two grieving processes are exactly the same, having someone to talk to can make you feel less alone.

, You shouldn't think that there's a negative connotation associated with the term ""moving on,"" or that it means that you will be able to cast thoughts of your beloved grandparent aside and happily move on about your life. It just means that, while you'll always have a special place for your grandparent in your heart, that you won't feel like the pain is completely holding you back from living your life.


Don't look at moving on as somehow being disloyal to your beloved grandparent. Look at it as a positive development that will help you live a healthy life.

, One thing you can do if you feel like you're in a rut is to switch things up a bit. If you do all of the same things you always did when your grandparent was alive, then you may find it a bit harder to move on than if you switched things up a bit. You can spend more time with your friends and family, take up a new hobby, or discover a love for volunteering or reading that you never knew you had.


Though you should avoid making drastic changes or big life decisions in a time of grief, making small changes here and there can help you feel like you're getting into a new and positive rhythm.

, Another way to feel more comforted and to move forward is to spend more time with your close family members. It's not a cliché that a death in the family can really bring loved ones closer together, and you should take this as an opportunity to spend more time with the ones you care about and to make more family-oriented plans. This can help you in the grieving process and can also bring you comfort and stability.


Maybe you don't normally come home for the holidays or you're not the type to talk to your parents on the phone multiple times a week. Try to increase the amount of time you spend communicating with your family and you'll see that it brings you strength in this difficult time.

, Though it's natural that you may want to avoid some of the activities you used to do with your beloved grandparent, such as hiking in your favorite wooded area, making dessert, or just watching baseball, after a while, returning to these activities should feel natural and should even make you happy. Don't avoid doing the things you used to love forever, or you may never feel like you're progressing with your grief. When you feel ready, venture out to do those things you loved to do on your own or with another family member or friend.


Though it won't be the same as doing the activity with your grandparent, it's a way to channel the fond memory you have about being with the one you love.

, If you feel like you're still grieving and feeling just as bad as you did when you first got the sad news after many months have gone by, then you may need to seek additional help. You can see a grief counsellor, go to group therapy, or even talk to a doctor if you feel like nothing is working. There's no shame in admitting that you need more help getting through this difficult time, and it will only do you good to take as many measures as you can to move forward.

, Though this may sound like a corny piece of advice when you're in the throes of grief, at the end of the day, there's nothing more true. Your grandparent loves you dearly and would want you to go on to live a happy and meaningful life while remembering all of the amazing times you shared. You may feel like you're in a rut, or you may feel guilty for experiencing joy, but the best thing you can do is to go on to enjoy your life while thinking fond thoughts of your grandparent.


Your grandparent's influence on your life will continue long after he or she has passed away. The best thing you can do for yourself and for everyone around you is to continue to enjoy your daily life while keeping your grandparent close to you in your heart and memory.

Give yourself time to grieve.,
Consider taking time off.,
Remember.,
Find a good listener.",How to Deal With Death1," The finality of the death may take a while to sink in, even if you were expecting the person to die. There is no ""normal"" timetable for grief; it is a personal journey.Let the emotions flow through you, and don't hold them in.


Many people feel that they shouldn't cry, get angry, or show any sort of emotion when someone dies. However, grieving is a natural and healthy part of dealing with death. If you must keep your emotions private, make time and space for yourself to be alone.
When you are alone, do whatever you need to do to release your emotions and stress. Yell, cry, write, ruminate; scream into the void from the top of a mountain; beat a punching bag with your fists until you can't feel anything else. Some people find it helpful to write their feelings down in a journal or a diary. This can be a great tool if you don't feel like sharing your feelings with someone else.;
, You may need time to grieve and process the situation without dealing with the complications of everyday life. If you need to take a couple of days off from work, speak with your boss and explain your situation. Tell your boss that you need a couple of days to recover from the loss, and most of the time he or she will understand.


If you are unable to take off work, make the most of your time after work. If you have kids, consider arranging for a babysitter to watch them. If your kids need to grieve, this will ensure that they are supervised, and if you need to grieve, this will give you time to be alone.
Taking some time off from work is healthy and perfectly normal in the wake of a death. It is not healthy, however, to quit your job, draw the blinds, and withdraw within yourself. You don't need to forget about the person who has died, but you cannot dwell on the death forever.

, The person you lost may be gone, but you still have your memories. Think of a happy or humorous memory that the two of you shared. Think about what you loved most about them, and why you loved that quality about them so much.


You can make a photo album about them and look at it whenever you miss them. It can bring up some unpleasant feelings but it can also help you remember those wonderful memories.
If this person was very special to you, consider telling your relatives, children, or friends about how this person positively impacted your life. You may even inspire someone else to be as kind, considerate, or passionate as the person you lost.

, You may feel better if you talk about it. Find someone who will listen to you without passing judgment. This person can be a family member, a close friend that you trust, or a licensed therapist. It can help to talk to someone who is not involved in the situation.


When you feel pain, it may help to get those feelings off your chest. Sometimes you just need an ear to listen to what you are saying. The listener doesn't need to do a lot of talking.
The person that you talk to must be someone you can trust that won't tell others what you said. It must be someone who will keep what you say in confidence. You have been through a traumatic experience, and you deserve your privacy. If you feel that there is no one in your life you can trust, go to a licensed therapist, counselor, or pastor.

You may feel numb, shocked, or unable to cry. You might also feel too sad to function right now. Your feelings are normal, and there’s no “wrong” way to feel.Allow yourself to feel your feelings and do not be ashamed of them. Keep in mind that it is a funeral and many people will also be feeling down during this time and that is perfectly acceptable.;
, Everything passes – good times as well as bad times. You may never feel like you’ve fully recovered from losing a loved one, but in time, you will be able to heal and move on with your life. Have faith that, even if you feel miserable now, there will come a day when you don’t feel so bad., Keep your expectations reasonable right now. It’s normal to be less productive at work or to let your chores slip at home when you’re dealing with an emotional blow. Prioritize your emotions and well-being before the funeral, and don’t try to force yourself to do too much else.For instance, you might need a bit more rest than usual, or you may choose not to socialize with friends as much. Figure out what you need and do that.
If you have a partner or close friend, then you might even consider asking if they would mind taking on a few of your chores to help take some of the pressure off of you during this time.

, You may not feel like doing it, but you’ll have an easier time coping if you stay healthy. Avoid sugary or oily comfort foods, which will make you feel worse. Instead, eat healthy foods that don’t take much time or effort to prepare. Try to exercise a little every day and sleep for eight hours every night.Low-effort, nutritious foods include hard-boiled eggs, string cheese, raw vegetables, and healthy dips like hummus.
If you find it difficult to eat full meals, try snacking throughout the day instead.

, Bottling up your emotions isn’t healthy, and you may have a harder time at the funeral if you don’t have an outlet for your feelings. Find a way to express yourself, either privately or to other people. Confide in a friend or family member, write in a private journal, or channel your feelings through art.You might even consider using an online forum to express your feelings to strangers if that feels helpful to you.

, If you aren’t already talking to a therapist regularly, set up an appointment. You may not be able to have your appointment before the funeral, but knowing that it’s coming up might help you feel a little more hopeful about the whole situation.A therapist can help you find your way through the combination of your depression and your grief.

, Having a close friend or partner beside you during the funeral can make the whole process more bearable. Plus, this person can act as a gatekeeper, stopping others from crowding you or getting you to a restroom or outside if you need some air. Make sure the person is someone who understands you and who will be supportive.


Ask someone you trust to accompany you. You might say to your partner, ""Sweetheart, I know you don't like funerals, but I would really appreciate it if you went with me. I need your support.""

, Use mindfulness techniques to center your attention on what is going on around you. Pay attention to the sounds, sights, and physical sensations you’re experiencing.For instance, think about how the flowers look or how the church organ sounds. You might even count the rows of chairs in the room. Or, notice how the seat feels against your behind.
You can also try grounding techniques to focus on the things going on around you. For example, note how the ground feels beneath your feet, or how the chair feels on your body. Or, start labeling things around you to focus your mind on the physical objects in your environment.

Mindfulness can help you avoid getting caught up in rumination.

, If you start to feel overwhelmed during the funeral, shift your focus to your breathing for a minute or two. Take deep, calming breaths, counting to four on both the inhale and the exhale. Imagine that you are inhaling a feeling of serenity and exhaling your negative emotions., It’s okay to cry at a funeral, and crying can actually help you feel better afterwards. Carry some tissues in your pocket or your purse in case you feel yourself welling up.If you find yourself crying uncontrollably, you may want to consider slipping out of the service for a moment of privacy.
It’s okay not to cry, too.

, Make a plan, even if it just consists of going home, lying in your bed, and listening to music. Give yourself something to focus on so you don’t find yourself at loose ends after the service is over.Plan to do something low-key and soothing. Go home and have some quiet time, or spend time with your loved ones.

, Not everyone else at the funeral will feel the way you do, and that’s okay. Some people may not seem depressed or particularly sad at all. Remember that everybody grieves differently, and there’s nothing wrong with you or them., If you have strained relationships with some of the other people at the funeral, or if you know arguments are likely to break out, do your best to steer clear. Avoid the people who tend to cause problems, and be prepared to step away from a conversation or leave the reception early if you need to.Try to keep things simple and have a plan in place so that you can leave if you feel the need.
For instance, if the conversation goes to a hot topic like insurance policies or wills, you might decide to go outside for some fresh air or make your exit.
Or, you could plan on leaving right after the funeral service so that you will have a set amount of time that you will be there.

, Sharing your feelings and your favorite memories of the deceased person can be a good source of comfort. Talk only as much as you’re comfortable with, and don’t feel pressured to talk at all if you don’t want to."

There is no right or wrong way to grieve. There is no time-frame in which grief ends. Try to open yourself up to the anger, sadness, confusion, or abandonment feelings that come over you. As time passes, you should begin to heal and feel better.


Some grandchildren may take a grandmother's death harder due to the duration and closeness of the relationship, the cause of death, or how other family members are reacting.Adults should be sure to demonstrate authentic grief and let any children or adolescents know that it's okay to cry or be sad.;
, Take some time for yourself to understand your thoughts about your grandmother's death. Write them down in a journal if you feel like that helps. Remember the good memories you had and the impact she had on your life. Ask others to share stories about the long, full life she had. This should bring you comfort knowing that her time on earth was filled with family, love, and interesting experiences.

, Attending the memorial service is a terrific way to get closure from your grandmother's death, and offer support to other family members.


If you are a minor, it will be up to your parents and your age as to whether you are allowed to attend the funeral or memorial service. If you have a desire to attend, express your opinion to your parents.
Then, they can explain to you what will happen at the service and determine if you will feel comfortable attending. They should know that attending the memorial can help you get closure and celebrate your grandma's life., Choose some of your favorite memories in the form of photos and mementos that you shared with your grandmother. Ideas for what to include in your box are endless--try using recipes, favorite song lyrics, or collecting short stories about her life to put inside. Decorate your box/book to your liking.


If you are younger person who was not allowed to attend the memorial service, this can be a creative activity that brings you closure. However, even if you did attend the memorial service, it could still be helpful to connect with your memories and talk it over with someone while doing this creative activity.

, Ask questions to come to an understanding of your grandmother's death. You might get closure by learning that, after a long illness, your grandmother is no longer in pain. Depending on your age, your ability to understand death will vary.Really young kids, around age 5 or 6, often think in literal terms, so saying ""Grandma went to sleep"" might make them worry that the same will happen to them when they sleep. Parents should reassure kids that they were not responsible for the death because some kids fear a death happened because of something they did.For example, the child might think Grandma died because he didn't visit her often enough.
Older children and adolescents above the age of 9 can often understand the finality of death and that everyone eventually dies.

, The grieving process is only intensified when you pull away and isolate yourself from others. Remind yourself of the people still here and that they, too, lost an important family member. Fight the desire to pull away or appear strong and seek comfort from loved ones who are also mourning., If you have religious or spiritual beliefs, now is the time to search out those verses or quotes that remind you that things will get better soon. Participating in religious/spiritual functions can further help you find closure, connect with others, and provide you with hope for the future.


Research has shown that people with strong spiritual beliefs--because of the principles described about human life and existence beyond--tend to resolve their grief sooner than those who do not.If you are a non-believer, secular rituals, such as packing up grandma's things or regularly visiting her grave, could help you resolve your grief and find comfort., A bereavement support group can help you and other family members come to terms with the loss. In the groups, you will be able to listen to and share your own feelings and stories with others who are also grieving. These support groups will provide coping resources for overcoming grief over the next several weeks and months after the death., If you find that you continue to heavily mourn the death and cannot function in your daily life, you may need to seek professional help. A grief or bereavement counselor can be effective with helping you process the loss of your grandmother and learn how to properly cope., The best way to feel better after losing a loved one is to remember the good times that you shared. The times you laughed, did silly things together, whatever fond memories you have of the person who has passed away. It also may be helpful to revisit your memory box or book as time passes, so that you don't forget all the great times you had with your grandmother.

, When we're mourning a loved one, it becomes easy to neglect ourselves in favor of lying in bed all day with a box of tissues. Try to get up and get outside to get some fresh air. Eat regular, balanced meals and aim for some physical activity a few times each week. Self-care activities also mean nurturing your body and spirit. Get a massage, take a relaxing bath with scented oils, meditate, write in your journal, or steal a few hours away to read a good book., Try to be there for your parents and siblings when you are all going through this. One of your parents lost their mom, which is a terrible loss to bear. Remind them that you love them and offer to do small things that bring them comfort like making tea or lighting a fire.

, It can be gratifying to know that your grandmother lives on in your memories. You can continue to celebrate her life by picking up some activity or hobby of hers and making it your own. Consider learning to sew if she was really good at it, or take the time to make some of her traditional family recipes when you cook or bake.

, You may feel guilty for having fun or laughing after your grandmother's death. You might think it's disrespectful to her memory to be happy. That's not true.

, Speak with family and friends as openly as possible. They know you are going through a really difficult time and it is important to share your emotions, your ups and downs and your fears with others. Remember that your inner circle of family members are probably experiencing similar emotions and maybe you can help one another through this devastating time. However, if you don't feel comfortable talking with family members or you feel that their own pain has locked them away from you so intensely, you should feel free to talk to your peers and people who can help at school such as counselors or a doctor. If you would prefer a more private setting try blogging or chatting online. It is best not to bottle it up inside; while you can still keep deep emotions and reflections to yourself, talking to some extent is vital to keep you connected with humanity and feeling the power of supportive friendships.

, Many young people feel an overwhelming need to protect their mother from pain. Yes, she will be suffering intensely but she needs you and you need her. Remember that your reluctance to speak with her may be interpreted by her as a need for her to avoid upsetting you by talking too much about the loss. As such, this can turn into a vicious cycle of both of you trying to protect one another and neither one of you actually opening up and actively talking through what has happened and sharing your pain. Acknowledge it first if your mother cannot and tell her that you do need to talk to her about your feelings of loss.

Everybody can imagine how terrible it must be to lose a father and they will be supportive.

, Remember the good things about your dad and look at photos of him. Put together a memory album and write down all the wonderful things you have experienced together. Other ideas include making a collage, writing letters to your dad and saving them or disposing of them in a symbolic fashion and making a DVD of times spent together.

, Over time your grief will change in the way that it is expressed. Few people ever truly ""get over"" the loss of a close loved one but most people find a special place in their heart that guards the memory and essence of the lost person for life. Accept that you will faced with the heartache of the loss of your father time and time again through life, especially on occasions where you would have expected your father to be standing by your side, such as graduations, sports events, a wedding etc. You will also lack the advice on finances, planning, socializing etc. that a father would have provided you. Accept these realities and do your own planning and find mentors who are supportive, caring and capable of assisting you in these ways.

, He may have died but you still continue to have a relationship with him. You will always be his child and he will always live on in your heart. Others will know the person he was through you; so treasure the memories and be ready to share them with others as time moves on.

However, it's also important not to put your life on permanent pause. Continue to pursue your dreams and focus on what you want to achieve in life. If there's one thing you can learn from death, it's that you should never take your life for granted. Live passionately, joyfully, purposefully, as if each day could be your last.

, You'll feel much more at peace with yourself if you can appreciate the good times without fixating on what could have been. Try to embrace the mistakes that you've made. After all, we are all human, and it's only natural to make errors. If you are genuinely sorry about something, sometimes that's the most that you can do.


Try to think rationally: is it honestly my fault, or was there something preventing me from doing that? Is there anything that I can do about it now, or is it water under the bridge?
If you still feel as though the blame falls to you, try talking to someone who was also close to the individual; they'll most likely comfort you and reassure you it wasn't your fault.

, If you are upset, there's a good chance that other people are, too. Be there for each other. Talk about the person who has died, keep his or her memory alive, and support each other through the difficult days that lie ahead. Try not to shut people out of your life, even if you feel the need to be alone. You will need your emotional support system more than ever in the wake of this disaster.

, Throw away or store everything that belonged to that person or pet: pictures, cards, papers, notes, letters, mattress, bedsheets, clothes, shoes, and accessories. Consider renovating or repainting the room that he or she slept in. If you are not surrounded by constant reminders of the past, you may find it easier to move on.


You can store things in an attic, basement, garage, or self-storage unit. The important thing is that you remove everything that reminds you of the person/pet out of your life as soon as you can.
Consider keeping a few items as sentimental reminders. Keeping a deceased loved one's jewelry, mug, or favorite book will help you remember; leaving all of his or her clothes in the closet may only serve to root you in the past.

, If you feel depressed, stuck, or overwhelmed by your emotions, it may be helpful to talk with a mental health professional.

Consider the five stages of grief.,
Identify the denial phase.,
Recognize the anger phase.,
Be aware of the bargaining phase.,
Ride out the depression phase.,
Accept the situation.",How to Deal With Death3," In 1969, Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross published a book called ""Death and Dying"" about her work with terminally ill patients. She developed a model for what she called the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Everyone grieves differently, and these stages do not necessarily unfold in a set order—but the model may give you perspective on your own process., The first reaction to learning of the death of a loved one is to deny the reality of the situation. It is a normal reaction to rationalize overwhelming emotions; indeed, denial is a defense mechanism that dulls the immediate shock. This carries you through the first wave of pain and bewilderment.

, As the masking effects of denial begin to wear down, you may be flooded by the painful reality of the situation. If you aren't ready for this pain, you may subconsciously deflect it toward others: friends, family, strangers, or inanimate objects. Try to maintain perspective and recognize this deflection. You can't help what you feel, but you choose whether or not to let these feelings control you., Many people react to feelings of helplessness and vulnerability by attempting to regain control. In terminal patients, this often takes the form of desperate measures to cling to life. In mourning, this often manifests as rumination: If only I had been there for her... If only we had gotten to the hospital sooner... If only, if only, if only.

, When the desperate bargaining subsides, you may be unable to avoid the reality of the situation. You may worry about the cost of the burial or feel an acute sense of regret. You may feel empty, sad, alone; you may despair at ever moving on with your life. This is part of the healing process. Take your time.

, The final stage of grief unfolds as you begin to move on. This stage is characterized by withdrawal and calm. Accept that your loved one has moved on, and acknowledge that you, too, must move on. Embrace the present as the new reality, and come to terms with the permanence of what has happened.Acceptance does not happen overnight. It does not necessarily mean that you are happy—only that you have moved beyond the denial, the anger, the bargaining, and the depression. Just like a forest that has burned slowly heals, sprouts, and blooms again, your life will bloom again with new hope. Give it time.

Arrange chairs in a circle.,
Start with introductions.,
Play Here Comes the Tray.,
Play Word Repeat, another memory game.,
Play Family History.,
Discussion questions.,
As a closing exercise, have each person write a note to the person on his/her right and pay them a compliment.",How to Play Non‐Physical Games for All Ages at Family Gatherings," Bring everyone at the dinner, lunch or gathering from the youngest to the oldest, into the room and, with a person in charge, announce the ground rules: speak clearly, be concise, and project your voice. Assist those who need a little help.;
, Each person must tell his or her name in rhyme. It's OK to use middle or last names if they lend themselves better to rhyming. For example, My name is Sue and I live at the zoo. My name is Bob and I'm no snob. Corny, yes, but it will get people relaxed and laughing.

, Who hasn't played this at a birthday party or shower? Distribute mini legal pads, pencils and bring out a tray with 10 or so common items on it. Have a volunteer, perhaps the person who chose the items and won't be taking part in the guessing, walk slowly circle the group for approximately 3 minutes. Tell the participants to take a long, hard look because after the tray is gone, each person must try to remember all items displayed and list them on their pads. If there are really young participants, work in teams of two. At the end, have the person with the most items listed read their list aloud to the group. Ask people to raise their hands if they accounted for the item. Decide who or which team came closest to remembering the most items. Prizes are optional, but make them small and insignificant. Fun is the order of the day, not loot.

, Start anywhere in the circle and have that person say a word associated with the holiday you are celebrating. For example, ""cranberries"" for a Thanksgiving gathering. The next person must repeat the first word and add another. ""Cranberries and gravy"" Then, perhaps, ""cranberries, gravy and mincemeat pie,"" continuing around the circle. After linking five or six words, people will start calling out helpful prompts and it might get a little silly. All the better, more laughs, more fun.

, It is a game that relies on achievements of various members. On a prepared handout, ask questions from the participant's lives, living or dead. Who fought in the Civil War? Who left home at age eighteen to became a secretary? Who wore a wedding dress made by her mother and aunt? Who went to Paris as part of a college course? Who, in the family made the best chili? Give

, If I Won the Lottery, how would I use the money? Who changed your life? Share the ""whys"" and ""hows"". Who was your favorite teacher and why? What advice did someone give you that you use today? Have a number of questions ready, read them aloud and allow time for everyone to give an opinion.

, Even if that person isn't familiar, perhaps a guest to the party, there will be nice things to write about them. ""Like the color of your sweater,"" ""Noticed how helpful you were with serving the dinner,"" and so on.

Ask the host of the gathering who will be attending.,
Talk about large political themes instead of specifics.,
Listen to all sides.,
Stay positive.,
Use hypotheticals.,
Watch your tone.,
Use humor.,
Know when to change the subject.,
Stay festive.",How to Talk Politics at Holiday Gatherings," Having an idea of the guest list will help you get an idea of which political opinions will be in attendance.;
, Holiday gatherings are meant to be light and enjoyable, so they are probably not the best time to analyze each line of a Congressional budget.


Discuss the unfair tax code, for example. All political sides will have their own reasons for thinking the tax code is flawed, but everyone will agree on that single principle. Other examples might include topics like the need for improved education and the necessity to support military families.

, Even if you do not like what you are hearing, everyone is entitled to an opinion. Allow people to finish their statements and thoughts.


Respond respectfully. For example, instead of saying ""you're wrong,"" say ""I understand where you're coming from. I always felt...""

, No one wants to attend a holiday party full of angry, yelling people. For example, if you do not like the president's politics and you are talking to someone who does, say something like ""I don't agree with much of his agenda, but the President seems devoted to his family and his country.""

, Instead of launching into a tirade or feeding into a disagreement, play a game of ""what if."" This can help diffuse politically tense discussions and give everyone a moment to reflect.


Ask people what they would do as governor, senator, school board member, etc. For example, when a political discussion starts to turn ugly, say ""what kind of bill would you have introduced?"" Or, ""what would be our foreign policy priority if you were the Secretary of State?""

, Political discussions do not always bring out the nicest sides of people. Stay calm, speak slowly and evenly and do not raise your voice. Yelling and name calling do not belong at a holiday gathering.

, Politics can be funny, and a holiday gathering is a good place to laugh about political missteps and jokes.


Talk about funny bits from satirical shows such as Saturday Night Live and The Daily Show.
Poke fun at issues and people in the news to keep political discussions less controversial. For example, instead of discussing a candidate's policies, laugh about his bad hair. Instead of discussing what Sarah Palin says on FOX News, talk about her short-lived reality television show.

, A brief political discussion is fine at holiday gatherings, but no one wants to start a fight or offend the other guests.


Steer the conversation to other topics if things get too tense. For example, ask about holiday travel plans, tell everyone you need gift suggestions for a hard to buy for family member or solicit interesting decorating ideas.
Eat and drink. Put a halt to an incendiary conversation by offering food, cocktails or coffee.

, Agree to continue the discussion as a later date and take time out to enjoy holiday music, introduce yourself to someone new or exchange a gift with someone special.

Explain why you want to have a family dinner.,

Tell everyone what's on the menu.",How to Get Your Parents to Have a Family Dinner," Sit your parents down and explain. Maybe you want you family to be more connected, or a family member in the military is about to be shipped out on assignment.;
, If your parent's job requires them to be away for long periods of time, suggest taking one night a week to have a family dinner. If your parent is an over-the-road truck driver and are gone for weeks or months at a time,or if they take frequent business trips, suggest having dinner the first night they get home from each trip.

, it doesn't have to be anything fancy, but people will be drawn to the idea of sitting down at the table if there are coordinating placemats, dishes, etc.

, Faux pas such as burping at the table can be excused, but you don't want Big Sister texting away to her beau of the week during dinner. There should also be rules about when you can be dismissed.

, If they know they're going to get good food, they will come. Try printing out a meal plan for the week and posting it in the kitchen, or get everyone involved in the cooking process.

Educate yourself about your child’s native culture.,
Share interesting information about your child’s native culture with them.,
Make it an open and celebrated topic.,
Enroll your child in a racially diverse school.,
Celebrate holidays of your adopted child’s native culture.,
Bring in cultural elements within the home.,
Encourage your child to share their heritage.",How to Help Adopted Children Connect to Their Native Culture1," The more information you have regarding your child’s native culture, the better equipped you will be to answer their questions and share insightful information. Information resources available online and at your local library are invaluable in helping you and your adopted child connect with their native culture. These resources include books (including photographic books), documentaries, websites, and videos online.Visit your local library and talk to the librarian about borrowing some resources regarding your child’s native culture.
For instance, if your child was born in Estonia, rent books and DVDs about Estonia from your local library, and type “Estonia culture and history” into your preferred search engine.;
, Showing your adopted child that you value and respect their native culture will make them happy and inspire them to do the same. For instance, if your child’s native culture is that of India, explain to your child, “One of the world’s greatest leaders, Mahatma Gandhi, is from India.”Ask your child if they have knowledge of the religious traditions of their native culture. For instance, if your adopted child is from India, you could ask, “Do you know that in India, cows are revered as sacred animals?”
Share inventions of your adopted child’s native culture with them. For instance, if your adopted child was born to Mexican parents, you could say, “Chocolate and popcorn are native inventions of Mexico.”

, Maintaining an open and positive relationship with your children about their cultural and ethnic background is a great way for them to adapt successfully to the duality of being born in one culture and raised by another. Explore, learn, and celebrate with your children their birth culture’s traditions, values, norms, and beliefs. Make an effort to incorporate their birth culture's celebrated holidays and traditions into your own. These techniques will help you and your children as they get older and are learning to develop their own self-identity., If your child is the only adopted child from a particular native culture in their school, they might feel out of place and isolated. If possible, enroll your child in a school that has a more racially diverse student body.Even if a school does not have students of the same racial background as your adopted child, a more diverse student body will allow your adopted child to have a range of friends who might be better-equipped to share and understand feelings and thoughts about racism or discrimination., Different cultures have different holidays. Check online for a list of holidays celebrated by your adopted child’s ancestors, or talk to others familiar with the holidays of your child’s native culture. Identify holidays unique to that culture and celebrate them with your adopted child.For instance, if your adopted child is from Korea, you might celebrate Chuseok, a holiday often translated as “Korean Thanksgiving,” by making foods traditionally associated with the holiday like songpyeon, a type of rice cake.

, Your adopted children may feel more comfortable and at home when they see that there are various elements related to their culture in their environment. Hang artwork, or bring in other home decor related to your children’s birth culture. Bring in music, movies, and culturally-specific foods for dinner. Explore these items with your children to help them feel the comforts of home in a safe and fun environment., Your child might take pride in sharing the history and culture of their ancestral land at their school during international culture celebrations. Your child might be interested in sharing information about their native culture at these events in the form of a brief presentation (accompanied by video or images), a performance of dance or music from their native culture, or by cooking and sharing food from their native culture.Direct your adopted child to tell their friends about their native culture.
Direct your adopted child to write about their native culture for homework assignments.

Enjoy yourself.",How to Stay Home During Family Outings," There are many reasons why you might want to stay home. If you can determine the reason why you don’t want to go, you will have a much easier time convincing your family to let you stay behind.


Are you feeling sick or unwell? Are you worried about picking up germs or infections?Do you need some time alone?Are you too tired to participate in your family’s activities?
Do you need time to finish important work?
Do you not like the activity that your family is doing?;
, If you quit a family outing, you might end up hurting your family’s feelings. While missing out on a movie or a walk might not be a big deal, you might find yourself offending family members if you skip on a family dinner or if you do not attend a wedding. Carefully think over the situation. You might discover that it is more considerate to go along with the outing than to stay home.


Have your family members been planning this outing for a long time?
Who might be upset if you missed out?
Is this outing for a celebration or a special occasion?
Willing you be meeting people who you haven’t seen in a long time?

, Think about what you might do if you stayed home. Determine if you would be more productive staying home than going out. Some things you might consider doing:


Catch up on sleep
Finish work
Do chores
Fix broken appliances
Exercise

, If you decide that you need the time alone, you might feel guilty for quitting on your family. Try to avoid this self-doubt. If you have determined that the benefits outweigh the negatives, you shouldn’t feel bad. Instead, remember that you can join your family another time. You will also be much happier if you are rested and relaxed.Solitude can help increase your productivity, concentration, and self-awareness while improving your relationships with others.You can tell yourself that, ""It's all right to do this. I need a mental health day for my own good.""
Remember that you will have other opportunities to go out with your family. You can tell yourself, ""It's ok to take me-time. I can make it up to my family later.""

, Do not wait until your family is out the door to tell them that you will not be coming. Try to anticipate when you will need time to yourself, and let your family know as soon as possible. This will ease their disappointment, and it will make convincing them much easier.You can say the week before, ""I know we were planning on going hiking this weekend, but I was thinking that I might stay home instead to catch up on work.""
If it is last minute, apologize for the sudden change of heart. You can say, ""I'm really sorry to do this now, but I'm not sure that I can come out to the beach with the family today. I'm really tired, and I need some time to myself.""

, You will need to talk to your family to let them know that you want to stay home. Instead of telling them that you are staying, you should frame your request as a question. This lets them know that you are willing to listen to their objections.You can stay, “I was wondering if it would be all right if I skipped out on this outing?”
You might also phrase it as, “I hate doing this to you, but I’m not sure I’m up for going out today. Would you mind if I stayed home?”

, You should provide a reason to your family for staying home. Let them know why you want to stay as well as what you will do while you’re home. Being clear and specific with your needs will increase your chances of success.You can say, “I’m so tired, and I think I would fall asleep during the movie if I went. I might just stay here and take a nap.”
You might also say, “I have so much work to do, and if I don’t get it done now, I won’t be able to spend any time with the family later.”

, Your family might be disappointed that you are staying home. Find a way to make it up to them. Show them that by staying home, you will be able to help the whole family. You might consider saying:“If I stay home, I can put away the dishes and clean the kitchen.”
“If I can get some rest now, I will be much better rested to help out with the party on Saturday.”
“If I finish my work today, I can take the kids out to the park tomorrow.”

, If you are a teenager, you might need to convince your parents that you can be trusted at home alone. Convince your parents that you are old enough to be home alone. You might point out that being home alone will help you become more independent.You can say, “I promise that I’m just going to stay here and do my homework.”
You might promise to do chores. You can say, “If you let me stay home, I will pick up the living room.”
You can also tell them, “I think that I am old enough to stay home by myself. I’ve proven myself to be responsible, haven’t I?”

, If your family lets you stay home, you should thank them. Let them know how appreciative you are of their actions. Wish them a good time on their outing too. These small gestures can prevent resentment from building up.


You can say, “Thank you so much. I hope you all have a great time without me.”

, You may have made some promises when you asked to stay home. Do not shirk these duties once your family has left the house. Instead, make sure that you do everything that you promised to do. Determine how long your family will be out of the house. Schedule your time effectively. You might want to do your chores or work as soon as they leave so that you have plenty of time left over to relax.


If you said you would do chores, do them first. Get them out the way early so that you do not forget.
Do not ask to stay home and then leave the house to do something else. Meeting up with friends when you begged your family to stay home might be seen as a violation of trust.
If you wanted to stay home to work, do not goof off. Try to finish the work so that you do not have to cancel on another family outing.

, A twenty to thirty minute nap can reduce stress, increase energy, and improve your mood.You might feel happier overall if you get a little bit of sleep while the family is gone. With no one in the house, you can even sleep on the couch if you want to.

, Even if you have to do work or chores, take some time for yourself. Do the things that you can’t do when there are other people in the house.Maybe this is your time to read, or maybe there is a creative project that you have been trying to finish for a while. Perhaps you just want to catch up on your favorite shows. Enjoy the silence, and take this time to yourself. You might:


Water your garden
Write in a journal
Work on your car
Dance to your favorite music

Make reservations early.",How to Pick a Family Reunion Location," This should include shared, group expenses rather than individual expenses. Coming up with an idea of per-head spending will help you to set a budget that suits everyone. This will help you to more easily choose a location that suits your needs.Choose one family member, or elect a finance committee, to calculate these costs. They will be responsible for budgeting and planning for expenses of the family reunion. They will also collect monetary contributions from the rest of the family.
Costs to keep in mind include food, transportation, lodging, venue rentals, and means of entertainment.;
, No family reunion is complete without a feast of some sort. Whether you want to have a cook-out, order in, or go to a restaurant, you will have to account for the cost of food during your reunion., Some family members may be traveling from far locations for the reunion event. Be considerate of their budgetary needs and financial situation. If you are splitting the cost of the event between several families, first ask them for a range of what they would be willing to spend on the event altogether, including their own transportation costs., While you may want to stay at a nearby relative’s house to cut back on costs, some families may want to stay in a hotel room or motel. Use these costs to determine the best location for your reunion.

If you’re looking for a cheaper option, you may want to consider a local campground, taking time of year and forecasted weather into account. Many campgrounds provide excellent activities for children, such as fishing, pools, and paddleboat riding.

, If you are renting a function or banquet hall for the reunion, there will be a fee. Call ahead of time to ask about the cost for a per-day rental. This will help eliminate some of the pricier location options.

Some venues offer additional options, such as decorations or a photographer that you can use during your event for an additional fee.

, Whether you are choosing to bring games and activities with you or participate in nearby attractions, such as horse riding, these costs can add up. Be sure to account for everything offered at each of your potential event locations., Consider the ages of the youngest members of your extended family, and choose a location that would interest them as well. While your uncle may think that a bar is a good place to meet, this location wouldn’t work for your cousin’s five-year-old daughter, for example.Age-appropriate venues can include a state park, a campground, a bowling alley, or a country club.

, If some members of your family are traveling far distances for the reunion, they will need somewhere to stay. Be sure that you take each family member’s needs and budget into account during this process.Choose a lodging location that is within each family member’s individual budget. Also, be sure that the lodging is located a reasonable distance from the main event venue and any additional activities. Nobody wants to spend the entire reunion driving from location to location.

, Local friends may have hosted their own family reunions, so do not hesitate to ask them for ideas. Your friends may even have connections or know of ongoing discounts in your area., If everyone gets a chance to offer their ideas, then they will feel more included in the planning process and will be more excited about the overall event. Tell them to email you or call you with their ideas, and conduct a family vote once all have been collected., As it is a family reunion, it would be great if every suggested place by each member is considered at least once. This will avoid conflicts later.

, Be sure that there are accessible restrooms for your family to use. You may want to consider a venue with a kitchen if you intent to do some cooking at the event itself. Ask whether the venue allows alcohol on its premises if you want to bring booze to your event.If you have a disabled family member, check that the facility offers amenities for disabled people, such as a ramp and a wheelchair-accessible bathroom.

, Check each place to see whether or not it has a minimum of two things of interest for each age group. If you would rather book a place that does not offer its own attractions, come up with games or activities that you could bring to the event in order to keep everyone entertained.Look for places that offer exciting things to do, such as boat rides or fishing. If you plan on bringing your own activities, try to find a place that has plenty of space for you to set these games up, whether it's a volleyball net or a water balloon toss.

, Have each family member email their selections to a chosen Vote Counter. This vote will eliminate places that more than a few family members are disinterested in pursuing., Venues can book up quickly, especially during the summer months, so be sure to call and make a reservation as soon as you can. Ask about any cancellation fees or security deposits, so that you have all of your bases covered."

Encourage your child to take up native artistic traditions.,
Show your adopted child traditional dances of their native culture.,
Share the music of your child’s adapted culture with them.,
Cook the food of your adopted child’s native culture.,
Introduce your child to other cultural practices.",How to Help Adopted Children Connect to Their Native Culture2," Many cultures have traditional arts and crafts that could help your child connect to their native culture. For instance, China is well-known for its calligraphy and brushwork. If your child demonstrates an interest in taking up calligraphy, you could provide a set of calligraphy brushes and enroll them in calligraphy classes.If your child is not inclined toward creating art forms of their native culture, they might still enjoy learning about them. Take your child to museums and cultural institutions where they can see art of their native culture on display., Many countries have unique dance traditions that could help your child connect with their native culture.For instance, if your adopted child’s native culture is that of China, you might be able to get your child lessons in traditional ribbon dancing through a Chinese heritage organization or dance instructor.Contact relevant heritage organizations and dance studios to find out if dance lessons pertaining to available.
If lessons are not available, help your child check out performances – either live or recorded – of their native culture’s dance traditions. For instance, if your child was adopted from China, you could run a word string like “Chinese traditional dance” through your preferred search engine.
Offer an age-appropriate explanation of the dance tradition so that your adopted child understands that the form of dance they are engaged in is from their native culture. For instance, when floating the idea of learning Chinese ribbon dance to your child, explain, “The Chinese ribbon dance is a traditional type of dance from China, where you were born.”

, There are several ways to introduce your adopted child to music of their native culture. You could provide your child with lessons for a musical instrument native to their birth country. For instance, if your child’s birth parents were from Armenia, your child might find that learning to play the duduk helps them connect to their native culture.Visit your local music shop to find out if they offer lessons in the duduk (or whatever the native instrument of your adopted child’s culture of origin are).
You might also choose to provide your child with recorded music. Visit your local library and ask for recordings of music from your child’s native culture, or check out relevant recordings online.
Offer an explanation and discussion (appropriate to the child’s age) to have them understand that the music or instrument is from their native culture. For instance, if you want to share the music of Armenia with your adopted child, explain, “This is music from Armenia, the country in which you were born.”

, Food is an important cultural product. If your child (and, hopefully, you) can enjoy a great meal inspired by your adopted child’s native culture, they might feel more connected to that culture. It might inspire them to try other dishes and learn more about their native culture.If you and your child don’t feel comfortable in the kitchen, locate an appropriate restaurant in your area and visit it. For instance, if your adopted child is from Ethiopia, find an Ethiopian restaurant in your vicinity and make a reservation for your family to eat there.
Do this regularly and teach the child about the culinary traditions of their native culture.

, Many cultures around the world engage in unique cultural traditions beyond artistic expressions. Contact organizations that encourage and promote your adopted child’s native culture and find out what sort of cultural practices they value that your child might also be interested in. If possible, arrange opportunities for your child to engage in these cultural practices.For instance, in certain Native American tribes, tanning hides is celebrated as an important skill. If your child is Native American, you could connect them to others who practice traditional Native American tanning.

Send your child to a culture camp.,
Encourage your child to learn the language of their native culture.",How to Help Adopted Children Connect to Their Native Culture3," For instance, if your child is from Ukraine, you might arrange for them to visit their home country. Travel with your child to the country of their native culture if they are underage or if they wish for you to do so.Some cultural heritage organizations offer financial help for kids belonging to particular ethnic traditions. For instance, the nonprofit Birthright Israel provides trips to Israel for Jews living outside of Israel., Culture camps are basically summer camps where kids of a certain native culture can meet other adopted kids from the same native culture. For instance, a culture camp might specialize in bringing together kids adopted from India in order to expose them to Indian dance, music, and cultural practices.Since every culture around the world is unique, the experiences offered by culture camps are also unique. It is impossible to generalize about what a culture camp experiences entails.
Your adopted child might get to try the food of their native culture, or get to dress in the traditional style of their native culture.Some camps offer guest speakers or natives of your adopted child’s native culture.
Other camps provide simple language lessons that help your adopted child learn the language of their native culture.
You can find more information about these camps online or from cultural enrichment or heritage organizations that promote the native culture of your adopted child.

, The best way to learn another language is through language immersion – that is, using the language all day, every day while living in a country where the language is native tongue. However, there are other routes through which your adopted child can learn the language of their native culture.For instance, if your adopted child’s parents were Vietnamese, locate Vietnamese language classes in your area.
If this proves impossible, find online resources to help your child learn Vietnamese.
Visit your local public library for language books that teach the language, or order books of your own through your local bookstore.
The best foreign language books will include a CD or digital download that allows you and your child to actually hear the foreign language.

Ask your caseworker for help.,
Get a mentor for your adopted child.,
Help your child stay in touch with their birth family.",How to Help Adopted Children Connect to Their Native Culture4," The process of adoption often puts you in contact with a government agent or representative of a nonprofit, known as a caseworker, to help your adoption process proceed smoothly. Your caseworker might be able to connect you and your adopted child to resources that could help your adopted child connect to their native culture.For instance, if your child is adopted from a Native American tribe, your caseworker could help you and/or your child establish a connection to that tribe or provide tribal resources to help your child better understand their heritage.

, Connect your adopted child with someone of their native culture to help them delve more deeply into what that cultural heritage means.Identify a local heritage organization that promotes cultural understanding of your adopted child’s native culture. Find out if the organization offers mentorship programs. If they don’t ask if the organization has someone that could be a mentor to your adopted child.For instance, if your adopted child is from Iraq, identify a local Iraqi or Arabic heritage organization through which your adopted child could meet a mentor. This person could answer your child’s questions and help them better understand Arabic and/or Iraqi history and culture.

, If you have the contact information for your adopted child’s birth family, your child might be interested in staying in touch with them, even from an early age. Encourage your child to write letters or emails and send pictures of them to their birth family."

Know when to go.,
Know where to go.,
Once you've decided on a date and which beach to visit, check the weather forecast carefully before setting out.,
Decide on whether or not you want to stay overnight.,
Pack accordingly.,
If you're driving, set out early to beat rush-hour or weekend traffic.,
Once you arrive at the beach, enjoy the day with your family!,
Pack a picnic lunch.,
Leave in the late afternoon.",How to Plan a Family Trip to the Beach," Depending on where you live and the time of year you schedule your visit, the weather conditions along the coastline can vary greatly. The preferred time to visit is in the summer, as the weather will be generally sunny and warm (in most places). But if that isn't possible, some beaches, such as those in Florida, can be visited comfortably year-round.;
, While many beaches are just what you'd expect - sandy, breezy, and along the coastline - others can be rocky, close to volcanoes (as may be the case in Hawaii) or pose another type of inconvenience or even danger. Browse the web for current beach conditions and make sure to look for any notices or warnings of potential hazards.

, You can easily do this by logging on to Weather.com or another forecast site and check out the weather for the day you'll be visiting. Unless you have hotel reservations, if the weather says rain or thunderstorms, try rescheduling your visit to a later date if circumstances allow.


Be aware that Hurricane Season runs from June 1st to November 30th each year in the United States. Plan your trip accordingly if you decide to visit in that span of time, and be prepared to cancel or leave early should you schedule your trip for the week a nasty hurricane pounds the coast.

, If the beach you'd like to visit is more than a 4-5 hour drive away, it may be worth it (especially with young children) to spend the night at a budget hotel or motel near the beach. Otherwise, just spending the day and returning home in the evening is more cost-effective on short notice.

, Bring along the following items, the first of which are standard beach attire:


Bathing suits
Cover-ups
Sandals, flip flops, or water shoes
T-shirts
A wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses to keep out the sunlight
Towels
Sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher
Insect-repellent

Aloe Vera gel for sunburns
Bottled water
A large tote or gym bag for these items, as well as plastic bags for wet clothes.

, You may not want to leave the house at 6 a.m., but it beats sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic for hours. Bring along a few games, books, toys, a fully-charged iPod, or some other form of entertainment to keep the kids occupied on the drive, as well as snacks and perhaps a pillow or blanket for resting.

, Go swimming, surfing, or scuba-diving, collect seashells, play around in the surf, make a sandcastle, etc.

, This will save you money and allows you to enjoy a homemade meal at the beach. Good items to include are sandwiches, wraps, salads, chips, pretzels, popcorn, cut vegetables, bottled drinks, and a packaged dessert (e.g. cookies or fresh fruit). While it's best not to go swimming directly after eating, you can safely return to the water after a few minutes or so have passed.

, Families with young children can put them down for a backseat nap on the way home, and leaving just before rush hour peaks will give you time to bypass the major roads before the rush begins.

Put smaller clothing items, like swimsuits and underwear, in clear, resealable plastic bags for compact storage and easy access.

, During your time at the beach, you might want to have beach chairs and umbrellas on hand to make your holiday experience more comfortable. Check with your resort or hotel to see what equipment they provide. If your resort has umbrellas or chairs, don’t bother packing them, especially if you are flying—they’ll take up a lot of room.

, Some people say travel during nighttime or during kids nap times but it doesn't make much of a difference either way.

, Make sure they don't get too sweaty though because otherwise they will be uncomfortable. Also make sure everyone has gone to the bathroom. Before you leave, go through the luggage once more to make sure you haven't forgotten anything.

, Also brinks snacks and some drinks. But make planned bathroom stops so that the kids can know when they should have their drinks so they won't have to hold it for a while.

Before you go, talk to your child and find out what they would like.,
While travelling, encourage your child to document everything in the small notebook, so they remember everything.,
Remember that the journal is for fun!",How to Help Your Child Create a Travel Journal," More creative children may want to draw pictures, others may want stickers or to write in colourful pens. This is their journal, so let them pick what they want and let creativity reign. Materials you may need are: Pens, pencils, a notebook/paper, glue stick (for pictures, menus etc), coloured pencils, stickers/other design products.


Children don't need leather bound books for their journals. A simple notebook or pages you design should work perfectly. If you choose to go the paper route, make sure to bring a folder for the pages so you can keep them all together and they don't get bent.
For on the go without a big bag, get a small notebook for bullet points of things you want to remember and a pen. This way you'll never forget anything and be able to fill it in all later without the hassle of pulling out a big notebook and taking time to write it out.;
, Later they can decide if they want to write about it all or only certain points. It's also important to remind your child about the journal as they may get excited and forget, even if they regret it later. Have a scheduled time for your child to do the journal each night. It will become a routine and you will not get it piled up. It will also be fresh in the mind so they'll remember more details.

, The entries don't have to be long if your child doesn't want them to be. Recording feelings/weather etc is also fun to add for later on. It doesn't have to be anything fancy.
