",How to Pack for a Tropical Summer Break As a Tween," This will make packing easier, as you don't have to worry about giving other people room for their clothes. You may have to persuade your parents. If you are going by plane, make sure that you're suitcase is the allowed size.

, Take at least one pair of underwear for each day you're traveling, and if you wear one, a couple of bras. Two or three pairs of shorts are essential. Bring some bright t-shirts and tank tops that you can mix and match. Also, remember to bring some pajamas!

, Usually, a pair of flip-flops, sandals and a pair of sneakers will do, but you might want to bring a pair of dress shoes just in case. Don't forget socks!

, Bring shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, facial cleanser, a hairbrush and don't forget sunscreen! Also, remember deodorant. It can be hot and sweaty at the beach.

Create a to-do list.,
Read.,
Draw.,
Try a new hobby.,
Learn a new language.,
Exercise.,
Spend time with friends and family.,
Take time to yourself.",How to Keep Yourself Busy During Vacation," For someone who wants to keep organized, it's a good idea to create a to-do list of things that you haven't had the chance to finish (or even start) before the vacation hit. Create a list of things you want to do, and prioritize them from most important to least important. Over the break, try and get as many of those things done as possible.

For example, a good to-do list might consist of watching your Watch Later videos on YouTube, hanging out with friends, finishing up the work your parents or guardians wanted you to do, and doing something you're interested in, such as reading or writing. It would be best to prioritize finishing up the work for your parents or guardians, and then you have time to do what you want.;
, While you may groan at the thought of reading because you have to do it all the time in school, reading can actually be quite productive. It helps to expand your vocabulary, and if you like to write, it can help to improve your writing skills, as well. You also get to choose what books you read, instead of having to read something that everyone else is reading that the teacher told you to read., You don't have to make anything that would go into a museum, but let your inspiration run wild! You can draw pictures, doodle, make random shapes, or anything you want., A lot of the time, people get bored over breaks because they don't have anything to do except for their typical daily routine. Try something new! Try playing a new instrument, drawing, writing, computer programming, sports, or anything else you want to try., It doesn't matter how old you are - anyone can learn a language at any time in their life! Pick out what kind of language you want to learn, and once you've decided on what language you want to learn, try websites such as DuoLingo to learn the language. You don't have to use a website, though - it's possible just to take notes and review using flash cards.

Some languages are more difficult than others. If your native language is English and you don't know any other languages, start off with something that uses the same alphabet of English - for example, Spanish or French. If you're up for a challenge, try a language like German or Finnish; if you really want to be challenged, try a language with a different alphabet entirely, such as Russian, Chinese, or Korean.

, You don't have to run a mile like in gym class; try just going for a walk or participating in a sport you enjoy. Exercise keeps you healthy, and it helps you spend time doing something fun., Over vacation, it's easy to neglect your friends and family and just get stuck on the computer all day long. Don't forget about the people closest to you! Suggest to your family the possibility of taking a day trip somewhere, or call up your friends and ask if they have any time to hang out. Even if they don't have time to hang out, don't drop communication with them. Texts and instant messages can go a long way., Once in a while, take some time out to treat yourself and do something to relax. For example, if you like soaking in a bath, take some time out to do just that; if you like to listen to music, listen to music. Regardless of what it is that you're doing, enjoy it and pamper yourself!"

Educate your child on the culture of the country you are traveling to.,
Understand the symptoms of culture shock so you can diagnose it and deal with it accordingly.,
Remind your child of the things you learned before the trip, once you reach your destination.,
Stick to the usual schedule, if at all possible.,
Be sure to bring tokens of home into the new environment, along with your children's favorite items.,
Integrate with the locals so that your culture shocked child can familiarize with the culture and get used to it.,
Remain positive, even if you feel frustrated by your child's behavior.",How to Help Your Child Cope With Culture Shock When Traveling," Go to the library and pick up books about the country itself, the rituals, the food, and the language. Learn a few lines of introduction just to get started. It is essential that your child understands the extent of the change in culture. The more the difference, the more time your child will need to prepare and learn. By educating in advance, you are minimizing the feeling of confusion, and in some cases, anxiety.;
, Symptoms of culture shock include headaches, diarrhea, nausea, insomnia, irritability and anxiety. If you feel that your child has culture shock, be compassionate and show patience. Allow your kid to express feelings, even if they seem negative. You cannot help if you don't allow your child to be honest about these feelings. Shutting her down will also create a feeling of resentment that will only enhance her culture shock.

, This will help your child find a sense of familiarity that relates the educational part to home, thus creating a connection that is secure.

, For example, maintain the same bedtime schedule and rituals so that your child can connect with home through the familiarities. You should also introduce new rituals that, in contrast, allow your child to connect to the new environment. Joining home rituals with new rituals will allow your child to transition into the new culture without losing touch with what's comfortable.

, So along with their blankets or stuffed animals, consider bringing along a couple of family pictures, a couple of small toys, and a book. Again, these items will remind your children of home and make the transition into a new culture easier to tolerate.

, You want her to slowly create her own bond with the new location so that it is not alien to her for long. Practice the language, if applicable, and encourage your child to learn more. Just don't force her if she is not ready to be a part of the new culture.

, Try to enjoy the culture change yourself and allow her to accept the new culture in her own time. If she sees your interest and curiosity, and she is not being forced to do the same, she is more likely to open up and become tolerant of the situation.

Plan the time of the flight.,
Use the in-flight entertainment, but don't rely on it alone.,
Bring an array of entertainment materials for your child.,
Reward your child for good behavior.,
Bring some snacks.,
Ensure variety in your child's activities.,
Have the kids become vacation planners.,
Create a photo project.,
Take a few minutes to review basic safety strategies with your kids.,
Consider renting electronic gadgets.,
Enjoy your flight!

",How to Fly With Kids," There is never an ideal time to fly long haul, but if you fly through the night, there is more of a chance that your child will sleep through at least some of the journey. This will make the journey -- as well as the time that you need to keep your child occupied -- seem a lot shorter.;
, Many larger airlines have in-flight entertainment such as films, music and even children's channels. However, there are times when it might be broken or unsuitable. The wearing of the headphones might also irritate your child.

, During the times that in-flight entertainment just won't cut it, you should always have alternative sources of entertainment on hand. Bring along items such as:


Portable video game consoles
An MP3 player, plus music and audio books
An electronic book that can be used softly
Coloring books, activity books and blank drawing paper - Do not forget the pencils and crayons!
Stickers - These are useful for making designs on blank pages while drawing.
Magnetic games - Buy the travel-size game kits available from many toy stores, service stations and airport gift stores.
Books to read together
Flash-cards and other learning items
Kid's puzzle books - Sudoku, crosswords, find-a-word, mad-libs, jokes, etc.
Print off some games to play on paper, such as tic-tac-toe, mazes or dot-to-dots. There are many such print-outs available on kids' sites online.
A couple of your child's favorite toys which are portable enough, such as stuffed animals or dolls

, Surprise and reward your child for his patience on long journeys. Wrap up a new toy and present him with it after he has proven that he has been well-behaved enough -- it's a shameless bribery, but it may work.

, Snacks can keep your children satisfied, which may encourage napping. Choose foods that aren’t packed with sugar and that won’t melt or crumble apart. Licorice, cracker sandwiches, cereal and granola bars are good bets. Try preparing these snacks in unique ways. Young kids will love cereal pieces strung onto yarn to form an edible necklace.

, Children hate being restricted. Once they're strapped in, they can't pick up toys they've dropped, or move about and look around as much as they want to. A child on a long-haul flight is a time bomb of energy. Vary activities as much as possible. Alternate between playing music, giving out snacks, playing with toys and reading books.

, Contact the tourism board or local chamber of commerce of your destination before leaving for your trip. Request travel brochures and tourist information. Arrange these in a folder for ease of viewing during the flight. Let the kids flip through the fliers and magazines while in flight to further prepare them and boost their enthusiasm. Give kids as young as eight a calculator and a budget. Then, let them work out a simple, affordable itinerary. Before coming back home, toss or recycle the pamphlets to lighten the load.

, Prior to the return flight, take your digital camera’s memory stick to a drugstore and pop it into a do-it-yourself photo center. Request one-hour prints. Then, purchase a small scrapbook for each child and let them record their memories with special pens while they stick down photos with double-sided tape. You’ll be pleasantly surprised at what they thought were the important moments of their family vacation.

, You do have a captive audience, after all. The excitement of new places can be overwhelming. Remind young ones what to do if they get separated from you, who they can trust and about safety in numbers. It’s also a good idea to have the kids help you make out a safety card that they can keep with them. The card can remind them of everything from the name of the hotel that they are staying in, to the first names of mom and dad.

, If traveling within a single country, it may be possible to rent electronic gadgets for the time that you will be in the air. Some entertainment companies rent DVD players, movies and headphones for use on vacation and during flights.

As you pass the cockpit, peek in!,
If they don't notice, keep trying to look in but don't stay in the front foyer long.,
As you board, step into the galley and address the lead flight attendant who is generally the one closest to the door.,
At this point the flight attendant will either usher you into the flight deck or knock on the door and ask the pilots if they have time for a visit.,
When you step into the flight deck, look to see if the pilots are busy with a checklist or a briefing.,
If time is short you can always wait until the flight is over and then come up to visit.",How to Get Into an Aircraft Cockpit (for Kids)," Hopefully, the pilots or one of the flight attendants will notice your child's curiosity and invite them to peek around the cockpit.;
, Don't make the flight attendants suspicious. Ask for permission to see the cockpit if you're not invited in.


Success generally depends on the proximity to the departure time. The closer to that time, the busier the pilots are and often cannot afford a visit. However, many pilots welcome the opportunity to have kids visit and to answer questions. Aviation is in their blood, and most pilots love to share their professional passion.

, Ask him or her politely, ""Hi, I'm very interested in aviation. Do you mind if I step into the flight deck and say hello to the pilots?"" Make sure you ask the flight attendant and do not just step into the flight deck. Although not illegal, it will not put you in the good graces of the cabin crew.

, As mentioned before, if the time is close to departure or the pilots are behind schedule you may not get a productive visit. Don't take this personally - wait until the flight is over and then ask to visit.

, If they are, it's best to wait until they are done. These tasks are very important and generally need to progress uninterrupted. When the pilots are done with their chores, knock on the door and say politely something like, ""Hi, I'm really interested in aviation. Do you mind if I look around/ask a few questions?"" Most, if not all pilots, will happily answer questions or show you the airplane if time permits.

, The procedure is the same.

Apply sunscreen to your toddlers' skin throughout the day.,
Dress your toddlers in beach-friendly clothing.,
Bring plenty of drinks and snacks for your toddlers.,
Keep an eye on your toddlers at all times.",How to Enjoy the Beach with Your Toddlers1," Sunscreen with a minimum sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 can prevent your toddlers' skin from becoming sunburned and causing them discomfort, even in overcast weather conditions.


Apply the sunscreen 30 minutes before your toddlers are exposed to the sun, and at least every 2 hours or immediately after your toddlers have gone swimming or become wet.;
, Your toddlers should wear clothing with built-in ultra-violet (UV) protection, and flip-flops or sandals to prevent their feet from becoming hot or injured from debris left in the sand by other beach patrons.


Bring extra sets of clothes for your toddlers so you can replace wet or sandy clothing if needed. Cold, wet clothing, or clothing full of sand can potentially make your toddlers irritable.

, Your toddlers will become hungry and thirsty throughout the day from playing in the hot sun and staying active.


Bring foods and drinks that are easily manageable for you and your toddlers on a sandy beach; such as pre-made sandwiches, crackers, and bottled water or juice boxes.

, Powerful waves, currents, and some sea wildlife are hazards that can prove fatal to any person, especially toddlers.


Keep your toddlers near you while they play in the sand, and only allow your toddlers to go into the water when you are alongside them.

Go snorkeling in the water.,
Play ball games.",How to Enjoy the Beach with Your Toddlers2," Talking a walk along the beach with your toddlers and examining shells and other wildlife can be an enjoyable and educational activity for your toddlers.

, With shovels, spoons, or your hands, you can build and mold sandcastles alongside your toddlers.

, With the use of an object such as a stick or shovel, your toddlers can write their names, or draw shapes and pictures in dry or wet sand.

, Digging holes is often a manageable task for toddlers, and can be made deep enough for your toddlers to sit or stand in, or deep enough for you to be buried by your toddlers.

, In calm waters, you can place masks and snorkels on your toddlers and take them swimming to search for coral reef, wildlife, shells, and other ocean wildlife.

, Playing catch with a beach ball or with other beach-related catching toys can be a fun activity for your toddlers and other family members.

, You have to cook dinner; why not do it together? A family cooking project: chocolate chip cookies, barbecuing, making smoothies, making applesauce, is low cost and is fun. For the kids, there are some great ""food craft"" projects that they'll probably enjoy, like creating brightly colored rice or pasta to eat or making fruit sushi.

, This can be a fun, thoughtful way to meet everyone's fun. On a rotating basis, each person has a day in which he or she is the ""special person"" and everyone else pitches in. For instance, if your father loves golf (even if you don't)maybe your family can create a putting green in the yard.

Building a relationship with your in-laws is very important so do make the effort to visit often and get to know them and allow them the opportunity to get to know you. Do not allow your brother-in-law's wife and her rotten attitude stop you from becoming a member of this family. Do not feel intimidated by the fact that she has been around longer than you. If she cannot handle the fact that there is a new girl in town then that is just too bad for her. You cannot control her thoughts and emotions.;
, You and your husband should invite his brother and sister-in-law over for dinner or set a date to go out on a double date (go bowling, see a movie, or meet for coffee). Use the outing as an opportunity to break the ice with your brother-in-law's wife. After all, she is your husband's ""sister"" and it would be nice if you could get along with one another. Allow your brother-in-law and his wife to see that you are a real person with only the best intentions. Make them aware of how important it is that everyone get along. Open up about how you felt becoming a member of this new family.

, Give them some time and space. Realize that you have given it all you have and that there is nothing left to give. You can only try for so long before your patience runs out. It is not fair to you to be treated that way so do not send out anymore dinner invitations. If they wish to meet with you then let them come around with an invitation.

, Your brother-in-law's wife goes out of her way to make you feel very uncomfortable. She rolls her eyes at you, she avoids conversation with you, and she gossips behind your back. The best thing to do is ignore this behavior during the first few months. Give her a chance to settle in with the reality that she now has to share the spotlight. If this crude behavior continues then you can either a.) ignore it b.) set up a family meeting to discuss the ongoing problem or c.) begin treating her the same that she treats you (eye for an eye).

, Let him know that you are aware that his sister-in-law does not like you. Also, explain to him how much it hurts you that she goes out of her way to make you feel uncomfortable. He does not have to ""fix"" the problem for you but he should be supportive and understanding. He may try to argue that his brother's wife is so ""nice"" and ""sweet"" but explain to him that her actions are different around you. She does not act in the same way. Luckily, your husband will not be so defensive.

, You have every right to build a relationship with your mother-in-law and father-in-law. Do not be intimidated.

, Let her know that you are aware of how she feels and that you do not appreciate her approach on the situation. Make it be known to everyone in your husband's family that they can talk to you about anything and that going out of their way to make you feel uncomfortable is completely unnecessary.

, If anyone in your husband's family is purposely excluding you from family events, especially for the sake of his sister-in-law, then show up with your husband anyway. Let them know that you are a couple and that you will not tolerate separation.

Set boundaries.,
If you don't have an answering machine or voice mail, get one (or both).,
Be aware of the pressure your actions will have on your spouse.,
Speak to your husband about their role in your relationship with MIL.,
Make a list of conflicts and come up with workable solutions.,
Encourage her to pursue some of the interests she has lost touch with.,
Encourage her relationship with her spouse.,
Give them a new role.,
It will only be a matter of time until MIL and FIL will age and need to depend on you and your spouse more for physical and perhaps financial support, so do try to set those boundaries and show them some love.

,
Recognize what she's dealt with.,
You absolutely need to be gentle with her feelings or you will lose support of your husband and you need to present a united front if things are to change.","How to Deal With Intrusive, Needy Mother In Laws"," Let MIL know that she needs to pre-arrange a visit in case your family is busy. Don't make decisions right away. Say ""Spouse & I will discuss and get back to you"". If she's not getting the point, remove her ability to intrude. Does she have a key to your house and uses it without permission? If so, calmly let her know that you need advance warning for a visit and ask for it back. If she refuses, discreetly change the locks.;
, Screen calls — you should be the one to decide when you want company — not the other way around.

, You have to be very gentle because you're putting them in a position where they have to deny the wants of their mother, and they have a longer history than you do. Talk with them calmly about your top 3 issues (don't just whine about them all) and ask for their support in changing the situation.

, Ideally they should be the one to set boundaries for their new family, as she will have to accept what they say, but you and they need to 100% agree on the problem, the expectations and the approach to change the situation. There is a lot of leeway for guilt and emotional manipulation in these discussions. Try to do the right thing by your husband and respect his relationship with his mother, but explain your needs for your family's personal space, autonomy, and your right to make your own mistakes since it's your life that you're living. You are old enough (and wise enough) to plan and live your lives without parental interference.

, Some of the behaviours may be directly offensive, others may be secret and manipulative. Open your heart. She's not a demon. She is just having difficulty emotionally separating from her son.

, Try to repair your relationship by going with her on some of these activities. She would have given up a lot to raise the spouse you love and now she doesn't know where to get her needs met.

, Remind her that she has a wonderful, long relationship (with someone other than her child!) and ask them how they've made it last.

, Perhaps tell MIL & FIL that you'd like them to cultivate a special relationship with their grandchildren. Would they like to mind them for one Sunday a month? This will give you time to improve your relationship with hubby to cope with the times that MIL drives you up the wall. Be sure to set boundaries about child cre, timings and the like and let them know that they need to respect your parenting style if you will spend time with them.

,, One can't live vicariously through the lives of others, but mothers are often asked to do that in order to raise children and support husbands. Her trying to run your life for you is a continuation of what she's done for the last few decades for her own family.

, If nothing works, consider moving. That might be an extreme step, but the happiness of your own family is important, and the distance may minimize unwelcome drop-in visits. But it also may mean extended sleep-over visits.

Respect your in-law’s attachment to your spouse.,
Give it time.,
Don't expect to change them.,
Consider their background.,
Find common ground.,
Be gracious about grandkids.",How to Deal with Difficult In Laws1," Your spouse is their little boy or girl, and always will be, no matter how grown up. Especially if you have your own young children, think about how difficult it will be to ""let them go"" as adults someday.Often what appears as undue criticism from an in-law comes from a parent's protective instinct. Many parents feel that their child’s partner has to prove that he/she is worthy. This usually comes from a place of love, mixed with anxiety.
Empathize with their sense of loss. They now have to share, and even cede, time with and responsibility for their offspring with you. Losing a child is a parents' greatest fear, and while this kind of loss is not so traumatic or final, it can be difficult to accept. The result can be overbearing or overly critical behavior.;
, Marriage is a big change for you and your spouse, and it is the same for your in-laws. Everyone needs time to adjust, and some rough patches in the adjustment period should be expected.


It may take your in-laws years, not weeks, to accept you into the family fold. Patience is your biggest ally in this process.In the ideal scenario (for your marriage, at least), you will likely be spending decades with these people, so allow some time to establish a healthy relationship.

, Take the Buddhist approach of accepting things you cannot change, such as others' ways of thinking. Don’t try to control other people’s actions and emotions, just your own.Think of your in-laws as family. As the old saying goes, “You can’t choose your family.” You didn't choose your embarrassing Cousin Joe and can't change your annoying Aunt Sylvia, so you just have to deal with them every so often.
Likewise, having no contact with in-laws is rarely an option, so accept that there will be contact and focus on strategies to at least make it more tolerable.

, Your in-laws were born and raised in a different environment than you. They come from a different generation at very least, and possibly from a different place or different ethnic, religious, socio-economic, or political background.


Differing political, religious and social perspectives based on these dissimilar backgrounds are common and hard to ameliorate. In many cases, it’s just better to avoid speaking about certain topics whenever possible. Don't bring up the President if it causes a dispute, and let your father-in-law's venting on the subject go without a detailed reply.
Differing views on child-rearing is one common result of differing backgrounds. Think about why your mother-in-law insists that children should be raised this way or that, even politely accept her advice with a ""that's a good idea"" even if you have no inclination to use it. Let her feel that her perspectives and experiences are valued., No matter how different you are from your in-laws, there are surely some shared interests. Focus on these commonalities; this small bit of ground can grow and change your relationship.


Any topic, however mundane -- sports, gardening, complaining about taxes, etc. -- can help to establish a bond of greater understanding.
A quick ""Hey, can you believe they lost that game last night?"" to change the subject from your poor job prospects, for instance, can work wonders.
One thing you surely share is a love for your spouse / their child and any children you have, so build from that starting point as needed., Parents of married adults usually want grandchildren, and are often not shy about making it known. The pressure may build over time or begin right after the ""I do's."" And if and when the grandkids finally do arrive, your in-laws will probably want to see (and spoil) them as much as possible.


If you are facing indirect (or direct) questions about when you're finally going to have a kid, try saying “We’ll make sure you’re the first to know when we’re ready to start a family.”Let them feel like a priority without letting them believe they have a say in the decision.
If you do have kids, you are the parents and you have the final say -- but be reasonable and allow a little leeway for grandparents. As long as your authority isn't being undermined, let the little things go.

"
"
Talk to your spouse about what’s upsetting you.,
Work as a team.,
Address the in-law directly.,
Clarify expectations regarding your children.,
Agree to disagree.,
Encourage them to speak freely.",How to Deal with Difficult In Laws2," He or she is used to her parents' quirks and foibles, and may be unaware of how they bother you. Be honest but diplomatic in sharing your concerns.


Use phrases like “I feel” and always avoid being derogatory toward the mother / father. Children, even when grown up, can get defensive about parents, especially when they hold close relationships.Strong communication skills between spouses will allow you to face many hard life-long problems, long after you find a workable solution for dealing with your mother-in-law's critiques of your less-than-spotless house.

, Even if your in-law's behavior bothers you and not your spouse, establish that you need to present a united front in broaching the subject. Your in laws are more likely to respond positively to comments and suggestions that come from their own child, or at least with his / her clear support.


Create family boundaries with your spouse. Discuss topics that won’t be shared with either set of parents, such as financial issues, sex, and family planning. Agree to enforce them together as a family unit.Talk to in-laws as a team, rather than alone. Large issues, news, and plans should be dealt with together in a united front., At some point, you're probably just going to have to tell them that their ""harmless"" jokes about your heritage or insistence on Christmas ""their way"" is a problem. When the time comes, be clear, firm, but calm.


Usually it is probably best for your spouse to be present to demonstrate a united front, but take the lead as needed so as not to demonstrate weakness.
Take the same tack as you did with your spouse, and speak in feelings rather than accusations. Try saying, “I realize you are trying to help; however, it hurts my feelings when you criticize me.”Brutal honesty can catch someone off-guard, but you must be brave enough to deal with backlash.

, If your in-law's dealings with your kids go beyond relatively harmless spoiling and countermand your rules and expectations -- watching TV shows you deem inappropriate, permitting excessive candy or snacks, etc. -- clearly but kindly bring your concerns to your in-law's attention.Let them know that you appreciate their affection for your children and eagerness to please them, but firmly but kindly remind them that ignoring your parenting rules undermines your authority with your children.
Likewise, if you receive constant, unsolicited parenting advice, use the ""that's a good idea, but ..."" tactic, clarifying that you value their perspective but need your parental authority to be respected for the good of the children.

, Yes, saying ""We'll have to agree to disagree"" might seem too cliché, but sometimes it is the best way to go. You don't agree on everything with your spouse, and you certainly won't with his/her parents, so accept that fact and move on when feasible.


Try saying, “I respect your opinion, but in this case I disagree.” Let them know you value what they believe and say., Allow your in-laws to air their problems in the open. Sometimes you just need to clear the air and start fresh.


Perhaps they are too emotionally smothering toward your spouse because they think you are too emotionally distant, for instance. Allowing them to tell you this directly may be the first step toward a mutual understanding.
Allowing in-laws to vent may offer a measure of respect, but it can also backfire and deepen the rift, so wait until you've tried less confrontational methods without success."

Realize when enough is enough.,
Opt out of interactions.,
Split the holidays.,
Know when to throw in the towel.,
Limit or end interactions with your children, if necessary.",How to Deal with Difficult In Laws3," If your in-law's insults or interference is taking a big toll on your self-esteem or your relationship with your partner, and more diplomatic methods have failed, it is probably time to get some distance.It is noble to want to keep the peace, not to ruffle feathers, to keep your spouse and his / her family happy. But don't allow yourself to be hurt or walked over.
Involve your spouse closely in this decision. Be clear as to why this is important and necessary.

, If a fight brews or you take an emotional beating every time you visit your in-laws, find ways to limit your time together.There's no law that says your spouse can't see his or her parents alone, at least sometimes.
Try not to lie about why you can't visit, but respectfully decline invitations every so often. Surely there is some work-related related reason you can legitimately claim, or job around the house that really does need done.
If you've declined one time too many with a flimsy excuse, you may just have to lay it all out there. Say something like ""Let's face it, whenever we get together things just don't end up well, so it's best for all of us if we stick to holidays and special events.""

, Especially if your in-laws don't get along with your family, remember that they don’t need to spend holidays -- or most other events -- together. And, in general, you are allowed to want to spend at least some holidays just with your spouse and kids, if you have any.


You and your spouse can decide on a clear schedule that splits all major holidays and summertime events. Consider rotating so that each side gets a regular turn for prime time on Thanksgiving Day, etc.Establish a tradition of taking a trip with just your spouse and kids for a major holiday or two each year. Neither side can accuse you of playing favorites.

, In the worst-case scenario, you just may have to cut off contact with your in-law(s). This is a drastic step, but if it salvages your marriage and/or your sanity, it is worth doing.


Clearly explain to your spouse that you feel disrespected, manipulated or abused and see no other alternative. Realize how difficult it will be for your spouse, but explain why you think it will benefit everyone in the long run.
""Breaking up"" with an in-law is no easier than breaking off a romantic relationship, and requires a similar mix of honesty, strength, and compassion.Even if they do not respect you, give them (and your spouse) the respect of telling them directly that you are cutting off interactions.
Your spouse is going to be stuck in the middle of this situation, no matter what. Try not to force an ultimatum -- ""it's me or them"" -- even if you expect to win it.Let your spouse determine how (or in the worst situations, if) he or she will continue the relationship with his / her parents without your involvement.

, If your in-law's behavior is having a negative impact upon your children, do what is necessary to protect them, including limiting or cutting off contact.


You'll almost certainly want to present a united front with your spouse on this subject. Cutting down contact with grandchildren is not likely to be taken well, but remember that your first responsibility as a parent is doing what is best for your child, not making everyone happy.
Laws on grandparents' rights vary by state and are in constant flux, but generally speaking, if the parents of a child are in a stable relationship together, grandparents have little or no visitation rights."

A Best Western in one city, for instance, might prohibit traveling with animals, while a Best Western 60 miles down the road in another town might offer pet-friendly rooms. Check with individual motels and hotels first.Note that pet-friendly hotels usually have a stipulation that pets cannot be left unattended in rooms. If this is the case in your hotel, be sure to make arrangements for any time you’ll be out and about.;
, Although some hotels and motels will allow pets in the rooms with you, some motels have kennels within the facilities that you can take advantage of in order to keep clean-up contained. When searching for a pet-friendly hotel, make sure you specify whether the facilities allow animals in-room or allow animals in a kennel.Instead of going to a single motel’s website, you can use travel search engines and input your pet-related needs to narrow down your options.
When searching, make sure you pay attention to any breed or weight restrictions.

, Some cities are known for being more pet-friendly, such as Portland, Oregon and San Francisco, California in the U.S.; Paris, France; and Barcelona, Spain. Although the city itself being pet-friendly does not automatically suggest all motels or hotels will be similarly accommodating, it does make it more likely to find pet-friendly locations.Most pet-friendly cities are well established as incredible vacation destinations, or are known as up-and-coming getaway destinations. There truly is no reason not to have a great vacation with your pets.

, If you have multiple pets with you or are hesitant to take your animals to a motel, consider camping on your vacation. Many large-scale entertainment venues have nearby campsites and camping provides both a great place for your animals to stay, and a budget-friendly sleeping option.While camping is great and provides the greatest likelihood of finding like-minded individuals, be aware that not all fellow campers will be happy to have loud or extremely friendly animals around. Keep a close eye on your pets.

, Renting out your home for others to vacation in is enjoying quite a moment, and many of these homes are created to be pet-friendly. If you are having difficulty finding a suitable motel or hotel, consider looking for an AirBnB home for the duration of your stay and enjoy the comforts of home alongside your favorite animal.Make sure you clear your pet (including size and breed) with the host of your vacation home. If you pet does any damage to the property, or you are not forthcoming about your animals, you will have to answer to the owners.

, Airline accommodations will vary, both in terms of policy and in terms of pricing. Some airlines will allow your animals to travel in the cargo bay within a kennel for a fee, while others will allow your animal to travel aboard the plane, as long as an animal fee is paid and your pet’s carrier can fit beneath your seat.Note that service and therapy animals are different. Airlines are required to allow service and support animals to fly with you without the use of a carrier.

, The easiest way to travel with your pet is to travel in your own car or truck, keeping your animal in a designated animal seat or crate. This is the best option for smaller trips, as a trip extending past 10-12 hours might be difficult for your pet to handle.Make sure you have plenty of food and water for your pet and stop often to let them relieve themselves.
Some pets do become carsick. There are pet-specific medications that can help combat motion sickness, so talk to your vet before you leave if your pet requires travel assistance.

, Amtrak, for instance, allows animals up to 20 pounds aboard for a small fee. This is a great way to travel if you are not comfortable taking your animal aboard a plane and cannot travel in a vehicle. Some train companies may not allow animals, and some routes may have greater restrictions, so be sure to check with the train company before traveling., Some cruise lines allow pets to come along for the ride. While these are not common, they do exist, and can be an excellent, fuss-free way to include your pets on your vacation plans. These are particularly wonderful for men and women who do not want to encounter difficulty finding transportation or living accommodations while traveling.If your pet is not familiar with travel, this may not be the best choice, as you cannot simply disembark or go home. If your pet is familiar with travel and water, however, this is likely to be a good fit for you and your family.

, Walking tours are excellent for pets, as they allow pets to get out into the fresh air, and give you some peace of mind when it comes to droppings. While not all walking tours are pet-friendly, many walking tours are creating specifically with animals in mind.Big cities are more likely to have pet-friendly walking tours, but smaller towns should not immediately be ruled out. Some abandoned towns and other out-of-the-way destinations will permit animals, as well.

, Some spas offer relaxation techniques for your beloved animals. Treatments might include the usual nail trim and wash, or might go so far as to offer animals massages. While some animals might not appreciate attention from strangers, others will do just fine, so pamper according to your animal’s comfort level.Some pet spas are more extravagant than others, so make sure you check with the closest pet spa to determine what types of services they offer. Some do little more than offer watching services, while others offer massages, play sessions, training sessions, and more.

, Not all beaches allow pets, but those that do can make wonderful getaway spots for you and your pet. You can even kill two proverbial birds with one stone by camping on the beach and making that your pet-friendly vacation., While this is an unconventional choice, getaways are becoming increasingly aware of families’ attachments to their animals, and some wineries have developed wine tours designed with animals in mind.This particular activity is largely limited to dogs, so if your pet is not the four-legged, barking variety, you may have difficulty finding a wine tasting or similar activity.

, Some national parks have strict no-pets policies, but most have designated areas for pets to camp and walk in. Take advantage of all that national parks have to offer by enjoying the beautiful scenery as you travel with your favorite furry companion.National parks vary greatly in how permissive they are about allowing pets, but all parks are dedicated to preserving natural habitats, so make sure you clean up after your pet during your visit.
Do not allow your pet to roam free at any national park, even if it is pet-friendly; your pets could unwittingly damage local plant life or endanger local wildlife if they are not kept on a leash.

, If your entire vacation is not centered around your pet, you can keep your pet at a local kennel while you go out for most of the day, then finish your night by visiting a restaurant with pet seating. Most of these venues offer outdoor seating for pets, so plan accordingly by dressing in cool clothes in summer or warm clothes in winter."

Be aware of your own culture.,

Listen.,
Teach your in-laws about yourself.,
Do not get between your in-laws and spouse.,
Have your spouse back you up on some issues.,
Give it time.,
Accept some disputes will be ongoing.",How to Deal with Cross‐Cultural Expectations from In‐Laws," The first step to navigating cultural differences is to be more aware of your own culture. Think about your own sense of cultural norms and your own personal belief system. If you're aware of your own culture, you will be able to compare and contrast your culture to other cultures in a calmer, more objective way.Discuss potential cultural differences with your spouse. Ask them for a heads up regarding your in-laws and how their culture differs from yours.
Read guides on your own culture written for those outside your culture. This will help you be more aware of any aspects of your culture that may seem off to your in-laws.
Think about how your culture could influence day-to-day interactions. For example, if you're American, you may consider it very rude to comment on someone else's weight. This is generally considered unacceptable in American culture, but other cultures may not consider such a comment rude. Keep this in mind when navigating day-to-day interactions with your in-laws if they, say, come from a culture where it's appropriate to be blunt about weight.;
, If you're getting ready to meet with your in-laws, keep expectations about body language in mind. Appropriate physical interactions are the foundation for a positive connection. If your in-laws come from a different culture than you, their expectations may be different from yours.Make sure you know if any normal physical interactions would be considered rude by the standards of your in-laws' culture. For example, maybe you typically greet family members with a hug. Your in-laws may come from a culture where hugging is seen as intrusive.
If you're unsure, you can ask. Ask your spouse about any types of body language that would be considered rude by your in-laws standards.

, Every culture has different expectations regarding food and drinks, so make sure you're aware of this when entertaining your in-laws. Some cultures, for example, do not eat certain types of meats or foods. Other cultures abstain completely from alcohol. Make sure you know any specific dietary restrictions before committing to a menu.When serving food, it's always a good idea to run the menu by your spouse first to make sure everything's okay.

, Differences in dress and attire can be a major source of conflict with in-laws. Your in-laws may come from a culture where a particular type of outfit is considered inappropriate or offensive. Make sure you're aware of the customs of your in-laws culture and try to pick something from your closet that would not offend them when getting together for family events.Remember, you don't have to completely change your style just to appease your in-laws. However, try not to wear anything you feel would really offend or shock them.
For example, if your in-laws come from a more conservative culture, go for something not too revealing (like jeans and a t-shirt) but wear colors and patterns you like.

, In some cultures, certain gifts can be seen as offensive. For example, in some Chinese cultures pointy objects, like knives or scissors, imply separation. There may also be customs regarding how and when gifts are presented in different cultures. For holidays and birthdays, make sure you follow any rules regarding gift giving carefully.You can always ask your spouse if a gift is appropriate if you're unsure.

, If a conflict arises, deciding whether or not to get involved is always a difficult decision. In general, it's a good idea to stay out of conflicts that do not involve you. For example, if your spouse is arguing with their parents, try to remain supportive but neutral.In some cases, a conflict may involve you. Unfortunately, you may not always get along with your in-laws. For example, your spouse may be arguing with their parents because of an issue they have with you.
In this case, get involved with the goal of smoothing things over and finding common ground.

, When a conflict arises due to cultural differences, you probably bring a variety of assumptions into the situation. Before you begin discussing the issue, pause and consider your own assumptions and how they affect the situation.Remember, there are multiple interpretations for every situation. Keep this in mind before getting angry or frustrated with your in-laws. Try to remember that your assumptions about behavior may be rooted in your own cultural biases.
For example, you're mad because your father-in-law did not make eye contact with you during a discussion. While you may feel he was being disrespectful or rude, eye contact may not be as big of an indicator of respect in his culture.

, Many people are hesitant to ask questions about another person's culture. However, asking questions can actually be helpful when you're attempting to understand someone else's perspective. Just make sure you do so respectfully and with the goal of smoothing over conflict and fostering a more positive family atmosphere.For example, say something like, ""In your culture, how do you typically handle conflict?"" or ""How do you prefer to communicate?""

, Some disputes are easily smoothed over. If you, say, served the wrong thing for dinner, this can be a quick fix. However, more serious disputes require continued conversation over the long term. If something is a continued source of conflict, share your feelings with your in-laws and calmly explain your expectations.Things like children, career, and money are often a source of conflict between different cultures. If your in-laws' views differ than yours in these areas, work on continually reminding them such things are highly personal and you and your spouse need to make your own decisions in these areas.
For example, say your in-laws expect you to have children very soon. Remind them that having a child is a personal choice and, while you understand things are different in their culture, you and your spouse are not ready yet.

, Always be willing to listen during conflicts. Even if you feel frustrated due to your in-laws' cultural expectations, stay calm and hear their side.Remember, compromise is important. Culture is a sensitive issue. Even if you radically agree with your in-laws' perspective on the issue, it's better to let them express their perspective than impose your own culture on them.

, Keep the conversation flowing by talking to your in-laws about yourself and your values. Let your in-laws learn about you so they understand how you operate and why you make the decisions you make. This will help foster a richer cultural understanding between all of you.For example, say you work on a computer a lot for work or school. Your in-laws are older and come from an area where people do not use technology that much. They worry you spend too much time online.
Teach your in-laws about your work. Show them what you do on the computer and explain your industry to them. This will help them see you as part of a larger community rather than isolated.

, Your spouse's relationship with their parents is important and should be respected. Even if you feel frustrated, respect your spouse's right to have a relationship with their in-laws. Allow your spouse to have the one-on-one time with their parents that they need and never pressure your spouse to take your side in a dispute., In some cases, you will need your spouse's support. Decisions such as whether or not you should work and when to have children are highly personal. You and your spouse should be on the same page, and your spouse should back you up when conflict arises.You and your spouse have likely already talked over major decisions. For example, you likely have some plan about whether to have children. In-laws from different cultures may have differing beliefs in these areas.
Talk to your spouse about how to address the issue together. The two of you should have an idea of what to say to your in-laws if they question your decisions on major life issues.
For example, you could both agree to say something like, ""No matter how much you want grandchildren, we're are going to be the parents. We've decided to wait for now, and this is the right decision for us.""

, If your marriage is new, it may take your in-laws a while to get used to things, especially if you come from a very different cultural background. Have patience and allow your in-laws to adjust to your presence in their family. With time, cultural differences will matter less as you all get to know one another as individuals., There are certain aspects of your culture that may always be a point of conflict with your in-laws. Certain differences may never be fully accepted. For example, if your in-laws are very religious and you are atheist or agnostic, this may always be a point of conflict. Work on accepting these differences and not letting them affect your marriage.Remember, your in-laws are people. They have their own idea of how the world works. If there are things about you they do not completely accept, it is not personal. Everyone is conditioned to see normal in different ways.
You in-laws' opinions are not fact. For example, if your in-laws keep insisting you really should raise your children in a church, you do not have to take this advice. While it may always be a source of tension, take a deep breath and remind yourself their opinion need not dictate your life and your spouse's life.
Separate your relationship with your spouse from your relationship with your in-laws. Remember, you married your spouse and not their parents. Focus on making your marriage happy if there are certain things you in-laws do not accept about you.

Discuss the visit with your spouse.,
Make accommodations.,
Set boundaries.,
Create escape times.,
Find entertainment for your in-laws.",How to Cope with Awkward Visits from Your in Laws1," For a successful visit, you and your spouse must be on the same page. As the visit is being planned, discuss all of the arrangements with your spouse. Also, talk about which aspects of your life your in-laws are and are not welcome to be involved., If your in-laws live far away, they are going to need a place to sleep. Make space in a spare bedroom, or turn another room into a temporary bedroom. If you’d prefer your in-laws stay somewhere else, help point them in the direction of comfortable, reasonably priced lodging.To ease the tension of suggesting lodging, offer to pay for some or all of it if your finances allow.

, You and your spouse need to agree ahead of time what involvement the in-laws can have in your daily life. Consider boundaries on things such as child rearing, housekeeping, and family decisions. Come to an arrangement that works for both of you and leaves you feeling comfortable and at ease with the impending visit.For example, it might be unacceptable for your in-laws to feed the kids junk food before dinner. Make this boundary known.

, If you know you’ll need a break from the visit, plan to do some tasks during the visit. You can arrange to run errands, take important calls, or attend a class or meeting during the visit. Be careful not to overdo it, though. Staying away for the entire visit would likely be seen as rude.Plan ahead with your spouse so that you each get a break from the pressure of entertaining your in-laws. You should each know when the breaks are planned to occur and what the other spouse plans to do with your in-laws.

, Instead of giving yourself a break, you can also consider giving your in-laws a break. Book local entertainment for them, or recommend a great restaurant. This will give you some space from the visit, and be seen as a kind gesture by your in-laws."
"
Maintain your boundaries.,
Communicate directly with your in-laws.,
Keep your family’s routine.,
Include your in-laws.,
Take some ‘me time’ when needed.",How to Cope with Awkward Visits from Your in Laws2," Whatever boundaries you set, you have to maintain them during the visit. It is generally best if your spouse addresses the boundaries with your in-laws when possible. This will show that you are both on the same page.For example, if your in-laws try to feed your kids candy before dinner, your spouse could step in and say something like, “The kids need to eat their dinner first, but they can have sweets after. That’s our rule.”

, When your spouse isn’t available to address boundaries, you should step in and maintain your boundaries. You should also make conversation with your in-laws directly and not leave it up to your spouse to do all of the entertaining. This will help build a relationship between you and your in-laws and make future visits less awkward.For example, if one of your in-laws says something that you find offensive, you could address it by saying something like, “Please don’t say things like that around me. You are entitled to your opinion, but hearing you say such things bothers me.”

, Keeping a routine helps everyone. However, this is especially important if you have kids because you need to maintain the sense of normalcy. Make sure that everyone is still going to work, school, and extracurricular activities during the visit. This will make the visit more enjoyable, and make it easier to return to normal life once the visit is over., Keeping to a normal schedule doesn’t mean that you have to exclude your in-laws. Let them come along to extracurricular activities with the kids. You could even enlist their help to drop off or pick up kids from school and/or babysit in the evenings. They will enjoy getting to spend time being involved with their family, and you may get a break, as well., You are not obligated to entertain your guests around the clock. If you need to unwind, you can take a walk or go to bed early. Just politely excuse yourself and take the space you need."
"
Let small things slide.,
Stand your ground.,
Avoid unrealistic expectations.",How to Cope with Awkward Visits from Your in Laws3," There will likely be points of tension between you and your in-laws. When this happens, make a conscious effort to decide whether it is worth holding your ground, or letting it slide. If the offense is not a big deal, don’t mention it. Your in-laws will leave and things will go back to normal soon.For example, letting the kids sit up late on a weekend and play board games with their grandparents is probably excusable.

, If you feel strongly that something needs addressed, you should address it. When your in-laws cross your boundaries, letting it slide will only make things worse. This gives the impression that your rules do not apply to your in-laws or in their presence.For example, if an in-law undermines your parenting, you need to address it immediately to avoid it happening again. You could say something like, “I make the rules for my children, and they will abide by them. That holds true when we have company, too.”
If your in-laws are around frequently, you might need to address things more often than if they only come around a time or two per year.

, Your spouse’s family likely did things differently than your own. Holidays, traditions, and day to day life might look very different for your in-laws. Allow them the space to be themselves and avoid putting the pressure on for them to conform to your way of life.Try to see things from their point-of-view. Just as you'd be upset if they forced you to change your holidays and traditions, it's unfair for you to be overly strict and try to force them to do things your way.

"
"
Evaluate the visit.,
Consider making adjustments as needed.,
Wait at least a month before having company again.",How to Cope with Awkward Visits from Your in Laws4," Once the visit is done, talk it through with your spouse. Discuss what things went well, and what things might need to be changed in the future. Try to keep a positive tone during the conversation so that your spouse isn’t too uncomfortable., Your in-laws may bring up important points while they are visiting. If anything is said that makes you rethink the way you do things on a daily basis, talk to your spouse about adjusting your routine. If the visit didn’t go so well, talk to your spouse about how to improve the next visit.For example, if your housing in-laws caused a great deal of tension, you could suggest that next time they visit you pay for a hotel room.
There is always room for improvement, so consider each visit a learning experience. Consider your mistakes and try to plan ways to avoid them on the next visit.

, Give your family time to resettle before you have company over again. This includes the in-laws that just left. Once everyone is back on schedule and settled down again, you can consider inviting more company."

Try to figure out why you are in such a hurry.,

Remember what matters.,
Always remember that you will eventually get what you want.,
Always have a positive outlook in life.,
Expect the unexpected.,
Give yourself a break.",How to Be Patient," For example: waiting for an important meeting to start! We tend to lose our patience when we're multitasking or when we're on a tight schedule, expecting the day to pass within only a few short minutes of busyness and chaos.


If you're stretching yourself too thin, you should reconsider your to-do list before you attempt to change your natural reaction to an overwhelming situation.
Try to spread out your tasks so that you're doing only one thing at a time, without leaving yourself twiddling your thumbs in eagerness of something to busy yourself with.

Delegate responsibilities to others if you can; this in itself may be a test of your patience, but you have to learn to share the load.;
, For example: when you are not doing anything! Impatience creeps in insidiously, and if you feel anxious, worried, or unhappy, you may not even realize that the underlying cause of these feelings is impatience. To reduce the frequency of impatience, it helps to be aware of it.


Which events, people, phrases, or circumstances always seem to influence you lose your cool? Sit down and make a list of all the things which cause you anxiety, tension, or frustration. At the core of most triggers is a reality that we have a hard time accepting. What are those realities for you?


, Being aware of your impatience also gives you a chance to learn from it and perhaps uncover a relationship or circumstance that is simply not healthy or constructive, and that you may have the power to change. Figure that out, and you can then think logically about the problem issue and decide whether or not your impatience is warranted or helpful. It usually isn't, but when it is you can then figure out ways to fix the root problem rather than simply feeling stressed about it.

, For one to two weeks, whenever you get that rushed feeling and the sense of impatience, write down whatever it is that feeling is associated with (Example: July 1 - astronomy class). Make sure that you take notes consistently and consecutively each time the feeling occurs.


You will notice that you are more aware of (and subsequently more prepared for) the feeling of impatience. You will also be able to observe the sense of impatience objectively and which events give rise to it.
You may come to the conclusion that circumstances surrounding the feeling are not causing you angst — the feeling itself is. In these ways, you will be able to better control impatience when it besets you.

, In the long run, developing patience requires a change in your attitude about life, but you can immediately make progress by learning to relax whenever you feel impatient. Take a few deep breaths and just try to clear your mind. Concentrate on breathing and you'll be able to get your bearings.

, If there isn't anything that you can do to resolve whatever has triggered your impatience, just let it go. Easier said than done, yes, but it's possible, and it's the only healthy thing to do.


Initially, you will probably find it difficult to let go if the matter is important to you — waiting to hear back after a job interview, for instance — but you should be able to alleviate impatience that's caused by issues of less consequence (i.e. waiting in line at the grocery store).
If you make a concerted effort to be more patient in relatively inconsequential, short-term situations, you'll gradually develop the strength to remain patient in even the most trying and enduring situations.

, People who are impatient are people who insist on getting things done now and don't like to waste time. However, some things just can't be rushed.


Think about your happiest memories. Chances are, they were instances when your patience paid off, like when you worked steadily toward a goal that wasn't immediately gratifying, or took a little extra time to spend leisurely with a loved one. Would you have those memories if you had been impatient? Probably not.
Almost anything really good in life takes time and dedication, and if you're impatient, you're more likely to give up on relationships, goals, and other things that are important to you. Good things may not always come to those who wait, but most good things that do come don't happen right away.

, Not focusing on what matters most in this life fuels impatience. Move the world toward peace by being kind, generous in forgiveness of others, being grateful for what is, and taking full advantage of what matters most. When other less important things fuel our impatience, taking time to remember any one of these items reduces our tendency to want something different right now.

, (This requires maturity and patience to understand and accept!) If you work hard at something, this may be the truth, but most of the time you have to be patient to get what you want.


For others, this may come as easy, but the only thing that matters is that you know how to occupy yourself, even in the dead of times.
Just remember, patience is a mental skill that you will never forget, so cherish patience as a major step for you in life. Impatience is something not to be proud of, but something that you should attempt to train yourself out of, before it is something that overthrows your life.

, Having a positive mental environment is very important in your ability to exercise a sense of patience. Remember that life is not a race, but a journey to be savored each step of the way.

, Yes, you have plans, but things don't always work out as planned. Accept the twist and turns in life gracefully. Keep your expectations realistic. This applies not only to circumstances, but also the behavior of those around you.


If you find yourself blowing up at your child or your spouse from accidentally spilling a drink, you're not in touch with the fact that people aren't perfect. Even if the occasion is not an isolated incident but is instead caused by their repeated neglect and carelessness, losing your patience isn't going to make it any better. That's something to be addressed with self-control and discussion if possible.

, The meaning of this is twofold.


First, take a few minutes to do absolutely nothing. Just sit quietly and think. Don't watch television; don't even read. Do nothing. It may be hard at first, and you may even feel impatient after a minute or two, but by taking some time out you can essentially slow your world down, and that's important to develop the attitude necessary to develop patience.
Second, stop holding yourself and the world around you to unattainable standards. Sure, we'd all be more patient if babies didn't cry, dishes didn't break, computers didn't crash, and people didn't make mistakes - but that's never going to happen. Expecting the world to run smoothly is like beating your head against the wall. Give yourself a break! and for children go outside and play it helps you to not stress on it!

Ask your partner if they know the reason for the dislike.,
Talk to the parents.,
Write down possible ideas for the cause of the dislike.,
Ask your partner to talk to their parents.,
Find an ally in the family.",How to Cope when Your Partner's Parents Dislike You1," Chances are, your partner knows the reason why their parents dislike you. They likely haven’t brought it up to you because they don’t want to hurt your feelings. But what they need to know is that by withholding this information from you, they are actually making you feel worse because of the discontent between you and their parents.


Say to your partner, “I feel like your parents don’t like me. Do you know why? I understand you may not want to tell me because you think it might hurt my feelings, but I really want to make a connection with them and if I knew why, I may be able to do that.” Telling your partner you appreciate their concern, but you really want to work it out, may be just what you need to find out the truth.Make sure that you listen to what your partner has to say. You may be misinterpreting your partner’s family members’ behavior as dislike, when they may actually like you.;
, Have an open and honest conversation with your partner’s parents about why they dislike you, if you can. Avoid being defensive or confrontational; simply state your reasons for why you think they don’t approve of you, and ask why. Attempt to remain respectful and polite throughout the entire conversation and you may get what you’re looking for.


Begin the conversation by saying, “Correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems that you don’t like me or disapprove of our relationship. I really love your child and I want to have a relationship with you, as well. Perhaps if you tell me what I’ve done to give you a bad impression, we can figure out a way to all get along.” You may not like what they have to say, so prepare yourself for a negative response. Try not to react, but instead be gracious and thank them for their time.Never stand for abuse from your partner’s family. If they are abusing you, such as by insulting you or calling you names, then stand up for yourself. Your partner should not stand for any type of abusive talk towards you either.

, If you’re not able to speak with your partner or the parents, it’s time to get honest with yourself. Make a list of the possible reasons for the dislike and then come up with solutions for the issues. Try having a trustworthy friend help you with this if you think they might be more honest with you than your partner. You may not be able to work this out on your own, but understanding the possible obstacles and challenges you’ll face may serve as a helpful starting point.


Your list could include religious differences, personality clashes, jealousy, or simply dealing with parents who will never be happy with the person their child chooses. Parents often believe that no one will ever be good enough for their child, and you may simply have to accept that., In a non-confrontational way, ask your partner to speak with their parents about the reason for their dislike of you. Chances are, they’ll be more open and honest with their own child than you, so you’re more likely to get somewhere by having your partner talk to them. If your partner shows resistance or doesn’t feel comfortable about talking to their parents, relay just how important it is to you that you get along with them.


Your partner could say to their parents, “I get the feeling that you don’t like my partner. I was hoping we could discuss why that is. I love all of you and really want us all to get along.” Although the talk may not solve everything immediately, it can at least serve as a chance to get a conversation going.It may take a while to resolve the situation.

, If your partner feels torn between you and their family, it can become a strain on the relationship. You can lessen the tension—and possibly warm up to your in-laws—by solidifying a bond with someone who is open-minded. Perhaps your partner has a sibling, cousin, or grandparent who is polite to you. Present your best case to this person and they just might be willing to defend you to the rest of the family. They might also be able to give you some insight into the parent’s typical pattern of behaviors and whether or not this is a common thing for them to do.


If that doesn’t work, at the very least, this person provides a safe harbor when you must attend family gatherings or events. Hang out or chat with them instead of feeling isolated all by yourself."

Could you be overreacting? Ensure that the source of the problem is not you before jumping to conclusions.;
, Is she mad at you because she thinks that you do not deserve her sibling? Did you do something in the past that caused her to lose faith in you?

, Your sister-in-law may not like you at all, but you have a responsibility to resolve the conflict to avoid family drama. You do not have to prove yourself to your sister-in-law, but attempt to explain your motives and reasons for past actions. Show her that you are a responsible husband/wife to her sibling, and demonstrate care and compassion even when she embarrasses you in front of family.

, Explain to your wife/husband that his/her sister is treating you poorly, and attempt to get your spouse to talk with her.

Tell your partner it’s important to defend you.,
Talk with your partner about what you can do together.,
Practice active listening.,
Stand as a unified front.",How to Cope when Your Partner's Parents Dislike You2," If your partner’s parents disrespect you, speak up and ask your partner to defend you. If your partner loves you, they should not allow their parents to act rudely or mean towards you. However, because it’s their parents, they may feel uncomfortable speaking up.


Although your spouse shouldn’t allow any talking behind your back, you should also avoid telling your partner to choose sides. Doing so puts them in an impossible position. Try to understand where your partner is coming from, but also ask that they don’t allow their parents to speak badly about you.Try to come up with some respectful but firm responses for your partner to use to defend you. These statements should be strong enough to defend you without insulting your partner’s parents.

, You and your partner are a team, so talking about how to battle this together is ideal. Supporting each other is crucial during this hardship, and if you’re in it for the long haul, this may be something you have to deal with for a very long time. Come up with a plan and then do your best to implement it.


For instance, decide that you will both not hold what the parents do against each other. Also, agree to let go of anything negative the parents do as quickly as possible. This will allow you to move on with your lives and be happy without holding grudges. Lastly, decide to always be honest with each other about the things that upset you. Doing this can help the both of you understand where the other is coming from and possibly avoid bad situations., One of the biggest barriers to healthy communication is the way you and your partner listen to one another. Too often, people listen with the intention of replying; they don't listen to understand. When you follow some basic principles of active listening you and your partner can get on the same page and strengthen your bond in the process.


Make occasional eye contact. Use open body language with your body turned toward them and your arms and legs relaxed at your sides.
Share your feelings using ""I"" statements like ""It makes me feel very small when your mom acts like I'm trash because I don't come from a wealthy family like yours. I really wish you would stand up for me."" By focusing on your feelings, you will be giving your partner a chance to come to their own conclusions regarding their parents’ behavior.
Now, give your partner an opportunity to respond. They might say, ""I'm sorry you feel that way, baby. My mom is very arrogant when it comes to money and status...""
Give your partner the chance to fully express their message and provide a summary afterwards, like ""It sounds like you're saying your mom does that with other people, too?""
Make sure you have fully received their message before providing your own response., In-laws have the power to make or break your relationship, but only if you allow it. At the end of the day, you can't force your partner's parents to like you. However, you and your partner can make sure this doesn't negatively impact your relationship by presenting as a unified front. When you come off as a team, the in-laws are less likely to challenge you.


Stand together about your principles and don't fold when they apply pressure. For instance, if you have already expressed a boundary that you will be visiting one family for Thanksgiving and one family for Christmas, don't even consider it if one family tries to negotiate this boundary. Simply have your partner say, ""Mom, Dad, we already told you our travel plans for the holidays. Please respect our decision.""
In addition, to being united when together, you should also maintain unity when apart. Both you and your partner should clarify what is shared with the family and what is kept between you. When you are in their presence, stand true to this in to send the message that both partners respect and value one another's privacy and decisions."
"
Set boundaries.,
Stay cordial.,
Anticipate and manage awkwardness.,
Encourage your partner to speak up for your relationship.",How to Cope when Your Partner's Parents Dislike You3," Work with your partner to come up with boundaries that you are both comfortable with. These boundaries may include time, location, and frequency limits for being around your partner’s parents. Understandably, you don’t want to be around people who don’t like you all of the time, and setting up boundaries can prevent major blow outs from occurring. Be kind when enforcing your boundaries, but also let the parents know you won’t be bullied.


For instance, if you and your partner have date night every Sunday, but your partner’s parents insist on you coming over for dinner, let them know you are unavailable that particular day, but could come over another day. Giving in just once may give them the impression that you are flexible with this and they may continue to try to impede upon your personal time., Be the bigger person when it comes to dealing with your partner’s parents and remain cordial. Don’t treat them the way they treat you, as that will only make the situation more difficult. Instead, remain polite and respectful and your maturity may help the relationship to get better.


Staying cordial also pertains to the way you speak to your partner about their parents. Avoid talking bad about them to your partner, even if your partner is voicing negative opinions about them. Your partner likely won’t appreciate you speaking unkindly about them, which can cause issues for your relationship., Once you and your partner start conveying boundaries, it is likely to become tense during family visits. Expect this ahead of time in order to prepare yourself for any awkward moments.


If someone in the family openly insults you, discuss with your partner beforehand whether you will ignore the insult or leave the environment.
If a parent is overly critical, simply try the adage of ""killing them with kindness."" Be extremely friendly and polite despite their obvious attempts to unsettle or anger you.
If one parent tries to guilt-trip you by throwing your boundaries back in your face, calmly repeat them without wavering. You might say, ""That's right, Mrs. Richards, we've decided to start staying in hotels when we come visit from now on."", Your partner’s parents may think that by bashing you, they will convince your partner to leave you. However, if your partner tells their parents that you are staying together no matter what, they may back off. The key is to talk to them in a respectful, yet authoritative way.


For example, your partner could say to the parents, “I know you love me and want what’s best for me. However, I have made decision to be with my partner. I love you both and I think we can live together peacefully as long as everyone shows respect. Do you think you can do this?” If the parents agree to this, it’s important to hold up your end of the agreement.Your partner might also express their feeling that being in a relationship with you is important to them and that they see you as an important part of their future. Your partner’s parents might ease up as a result out of not wanting to be left out of their child’s life.

Thank your in-laws for a wonderful time.",How to Cope With in Laws During the Holidays," This doesn't mean that you should be happy if your mother-in-law criticizes you less than ten times an hour. However, it does mean that your spouse's family is not your own, and that his parents, siblings, and other family members may have traditions, beliefs, and perspectives that are quite different from what you grew up with. Your family probably seems just as weird to your spouse as his family seems to you; maybe his father isn't as much fun as yours, but he can be just as kind. Know that you're not going to have the amazing time that you expect to have with your own family, but believe that you can manage to have some fun if you don't expect amazing things to happen., Get used to the fact that your spouse's family is quite different from yours, which can include everything from their religion to their love or hatred for watching football during the big meal. You can't change your in-laws, but you can change the way you approach the ways in which they are different from your own family. Don't tell raunchy jokes if they are conservative, and don't talk about how much you love your gun if they are liberal. Remember that, while you are still family, you are still technically the outsider, and you should be the one who has to adjust to what they think is normal.


The sooner you accept that you and your in-laws are different people, the easier it will be to stop being frustrated.

, This may be hard to remember when you're fighting with your mother-in-law about the right way to bake an apple pie, but in the end, the two people in front of you, however annoying or unpleasant they may be, have raised your spouse. They must have influenced him in some positive way and have given him some positive traits -- it's impossible to not be influenced at all by your parents, isn't it? The next time your in-laws annoy you just remember that they are the parents of your spouse, however imperfect they may be.

, Nothing will set the tone worse than complaining about the fact that you have to spend time with your in-laws in front of your spouse. How is this supposed to make him or her feel? Sure, your relationship with your in-laws may not be perfect, but if you already agreed to spend time with them, then what's the point of making a big stink about it? This will only make your spouse feel worse and will make him or her either lose faith in his or her family, or turn on you to defend his or her parents. Either way, it leads to no good.Think about it: how would it make you feel to hear your spouse criticize your own parents? Sure, you're aware of their flaws, but you love them with all your heart.

, At the end of the day, you'll go home -- or retire to the guest bedroom -- with your spouse, not with your mother and father in-law (thankfully). This means that you should stay on the same team as your partner, trying to make things as easy as possible for everyone and not turn on each other or pick fights. In the end, your partner is your best ally, especially during the holiday season, so don't turn on him because you're so unhappy about being where you are., The key to keeping your calm is to stay busy. Of course it'll be harder to deal with your in-laws if you have something else to do besides sit next to them and wait to get annoyed or offended. Maybe their lawn needs raking. Maybe you've been meaning to show your wife's grandfather how to work his new DVD player. Maybe you told your mother-in-law that you would help bake dessert this year. Finding an activity to do can help you bond with your in-laws, find common ground, and stay focused on something other than the tension in the air.


If you're helping out around the house, not only will you be distracted, but your in-laws will have to like you at least a little more for helping.

, Plan something for the whole family to do that doesn't cause a stir or take hours to explain. Maybe you can all play a simple fun board game before your Christmas meal, or you can all go for a walk after Thanksgiving dinner. As long as your in-laws don't see the activity as a way of taking over their usual plans, they will be grateful that you found something fun and different to do. Just check in with your spouse and your in-laws in advance to make sure that you won't be stepping on any toes.

, If your in-laws are visiting you, then you can make sure to incorporate some of their traditions into your celebration, whether it's saying certain prayers, making certain foods, or listening to Christmas carols. Maybe your in-laws like watching football before the Thanksgiving meal; would it kill you to turn on the television? Including your in-laws' traditions in your own celebrations will make them feel more included and happier to be visiting you.If you're visiting your in-laws, then maybe you can share one of your family's traditions with them, as long as it doesn't get in their way. This can be something small, like bringing a potato dish that has been in your family for generations.

, This is another way to stay busy and active during your time with your in-laws. Your holiday will be a lot more fun if you're not spending the whole time sitting together in awkward silence. Ask polite, friendly questions to make your in-laws feel welcome. Ask them about their jobs, their pets, their plans for the weekend, or about any recent trips they took. Don't make them feel like they're getting interviewed, but make sure to ask questions about their lives and to show genuine interest in their answers.If the question thing is getting old, you can also share some of your own experiences. Consider the stories you'll tell in advance to make sure that they are appropriate.

, Maybe you know that after four hours with your father-in-law, your head will be pounding. It's okay to admit that before the big day -- better, in fact, than being in denial about the space you'll need. So, make sure you can plan for a quick activity: stepping out to call your folks, going to the store to pick up some extra food or drinks, or taking your kids to the playground. Tell people about it in advance so it won't look weird when you go off on your own for a little while later that day.


Remind yourself that there's absolutely nothing wrong with taking some time away from your in-laws. This will be less insulting than sitting next to them, writhing with anger the whole time.

, Part of the reason that you may not get along with your in-laws is because they may suspect that you don't really care for them. Even if this is the case, if you want to get along and want things to be as pleasant as possible, then you have to smile at them, make eye contact, make small talk, and stay invested in your time together. Don't spend your time on your phone or checking your work email or reading a book in the corner of the room. Instead, be there with them and show that you value your time together -- however hard that may be.


Just bite your tongue and stop looking around the room for something better to do. This is your family now, and there is no escape.

, Giving your in-laws a nice gift can make them feel more welcome and happier to be in your presence. Make sure that the gift is appropriate and not too expensive, and ask your spouse what he or she thinks will be best. Maybe you can get a nice bottle of wine for your mother and father in law, or a nice set of golf balls, or even a painting you loved. Make sure it's something they would actually like and that it wouldn't make them feel obligated to return the favor.If you find a gift that works, you can give a version of it every time -- a nice bowl, beer stein, leather-bound book, etc. This also establishes a new tradition and will make your family feel more like a unit.

, Sure, you may not see eye-to-eye with your in-laws about, well, anything at all, but does that mean you have to argue about it? Of course not. Arguing won't make anything better, and you won't be able to convince anyone of how right you really are. Instead, you'll just be creating tension, angering your spouse, and making the situation even more difficult. This isn't the time to show off how much you know or to put people in their place; it's just the time to get along.


If you can't say something nice, stay quiet. This may be difficult, but it's much better than fighting.

, This is not the time to tell your mother or father-in-law what the political situation in your country is really like, why such and such proposition should be banned, or why your method of cooking a turkey is superior to theirs. Nobody likes a stubborn son-or-daughter in law, and you will only look like a know-it-all, not like someone who is making an effort to get along with his family. You may know that your opinion or way of doing things can be considered superior by many people, but your in-laws won't change their minds and they certainly won't appreciate your attempts to ""help"" them.

, Okay, so maybe you only drink Cabernet from the best that Napa Valley has to offer, and your mother-in-law only drinks wine from a box. Does that mean you should turn it down? Absolutely not. Just go with the flow and don't have a reputation for being a stick-in-the-mud. Sure, you won't get the luxuries you're used to around your own parents or in your own home, but that doesn't mean you should be stuck up about it.


If you really have to have certain foods or drinks, then offer to contribute to the holiday meal. Then you can have what you like without complaining about what your in-laws have to offer. Still, though, you should accept whatever they offer you.

, If you see yourself getting angry about one of your father in law's comments, or on the verge of getting in a brawl with your sister-in law, then it's time to excuse yourself for a little bit. Say you need to get some fresh air, make an excuse about calling in to work, or even just spend five minutes in the bathroom, staring at your own reflection. This is not a sign of weakness -- it's actually a sign of strength. Taking some time to yourself will give you the time to calm down and the perspective you need to approach the situation with a level head.


Take a few deep breaths before engaging in a conversation that you know will make you angry. This simple trick will keep you from saying something you don't want to say.

, Don't give your in-laws stupid flattery that you don't really mean. However, you should find something nice that you could legitimately tell them to make them feel like you are happy to be around them. If they have you over, compliment a new piece of furniture they got, or make sure to say that the food tastes lovely without overdoing it. If your mother-in-law got a new perm or your father-in-law lost weight, compliment them on how great they look. Everyone likes a good compliment and who knows, you might even get one in return.


If you find it really hard to compliment your in-laws, then you can prepare some comments to make in advance. This may feel forced, but it'll lead to better morale.

, Even if you had a mediocre, painful, or awkward night, at the end of the holiday, thank your in-laws for having you over or for making the trek out to your place. Even if you don't mean it, getting into the habit of being nice to them will make it easier for you to eventually find some common ground. They will remember you as being more polite than last time, and who knows, they may even leave with some fond memories of the experience -- and so will you.

, When you get home from work, instead of sitting down and watching TV, or taking a nap, or finding some other way to veg out after a long day at work, take the extra effort to sit down and talk with your kids about their day.

Go around the table, and each person shares his high points of the day, and low points. One or two or even three of each is good. And everyone should really listen. It’s fun, and a great way to connect.

, Pick a long-term goal to do together — for example, reading the first 5 books of Harry Potter aloud together. Doing this can teach your child about setting and achieving goals by taking small steps each day. A sports goal is also great — getting in shape for soccer, for example. Have a workout plan, and be drill sergeant, and a workout journal. It’s a lot of fun, and it bonds you together.

, Don’t be afraid to be a kid with them. Play video games, watch cartoons, play board games, have pillow fights, make a fort, play superheroes. Play at their level — don’t expect them to play at yours.

, Before Family Day, have a weekly Family Meeting. While this isn’t exactly one-on-one time, it’s a great way to talk about things with the kids, have fun with them, and include them in decision-making.

, Every now and then, just pull your child to you and hug them. Snuggle, be affectionate, squeeze them tight. That kind of physical intimacy is important — and the day will come when they don’t want to snuggle with you any more. Take advantage of it now.

However, if your friend says she needs some time to process things on her own first, then do not pressure her to talk. Give her time and just remind her that you are there for her if she want to talk.Try saying something like, “I know you must be overwhelmed right now, but I am here for you and I am willing to listen if you ever need to talk.”;
, If your friend has confided in you that she is pregnant, do not tell anyone without her permission. This is her news to share or not share, and telling people about your friend’s pregnancy could cause problems for her.


If you are worried because your friend has not sought help for her pregnancy, then you should talk to her about how you feel. For example, you might say, “I know this is overwhelming for you, but I am concerned about your health and well-being as well. I think you need to see a doctor, no matter what you plan to do about the pregnancy.”

, Your friend will need to decide what she wants to do about her pregnancy. It is her decision if she wants to keep the baby, put the baby up for adoption, or have an abortion. Do not try to sway her towards one decision or another, just ask her what you can do to help.For example, your friend might need someone to drive her to a clinic, help her find an obstetrician, or choose an adoption agency. To determine what she needs, you might simply say something like, “I am here for you. What can I do to help?

, Do your best to avoid telling her what you think she should do, what you would do, or what you think is the best solution. Unless she asks you for advice, do not give her advice.Instead of judging, ask her how she is feeling. She may be sick from morning sickness or emotional from keeping the secret. Let her tell you how she feels instead of you telling her how to feel.
Assure your friend that you still love her and this does not change your friendship. She is probably scared and needs to know things will be OK.Stress is hard on the baby so she needs to be supported to feel positive. It is OK to talk about the baby if she is going to raise the baby, it can be exciting to prepare for a baby.

, Your friend will have to decide between parenting the child, adoption, and abortion. It may be difficult to make a decision without fully considering each option, so you may want to offer to help your friend conduct research on each of these options.Try starting the research by asking her what options she is considering. Many people have strong feelings about things like abortion so she may not even be considering this option. However, if she is, help her to research the option.
Help your friend make a list of pros and cons as you research the options. For example, a pro of abortion might be that she can avoid having to tell her parents, teachers, and friends about the pregnancy. However, a con of abortion might be that she may have regrets later on or that she may risk medical complications.

, If your friend decides that she wants to raise the child or put the child up for adoption, then she will have to tell her parents about it. One way that you can support her is by offering to be there when she tells them.


Try saying something like, “I know you are worried about telling your parents. Would you feel better if I was there too?” If she declines your offer, do not be offended. She may just want to speak to her parents on her own.
Be prepared for her parents to get upset and have a backup plan if the worst happens and she is kicked out of their home. Is it OK for her to come to your house in the event of an emergency?
Asking your own parents for advice after she tells her parents might be useful as well. Your parents may know her parents and can offer support parent to parent. Having another adult know can also help to lessen the overall stress of keeping the secret. However, remember to make sure that you check with your friend first.

, Remember that the decision to end or continue her pregnancy belongs to your friend, not you or anyone else. If she asks you for advice, then you can provide it, but do not try to change her mind or impose your beliefs on her.


If your friend tells you that she has decided to keep the baby, try saying something like, “I know you must be really scared right now, but you will be an awesome mother!”
If she tells you that she has decided to give the baby up for adoption, try saying something like, “I know this must be hard for you, but you are going to give an amazing gift to some lucky couple!”
If she tells you that she wants to end her pregnancy with an abortion, try saying something like, “I know this was a difficult decision for you, but I love you and I will do what I can to help.”

, Part of being a friend is being there for the good and bad. Girls who are pregnant are more likely than ever to drop out of school, but being a friendly support may help her to stay in school.Many schools have special programs for teen parents. If your friend is interested, you can check with your guidance counselor to see if there is one at your school.

, While it’s important to be a source of support for your pregnant friend, you also need to maintain focus on school and your extracurricular activities. It can be overwhelming to see a friend struggling, but you need space to be who you are without dealing with her issue 24/7.

, You may feel angry with her for getting pregnant, jealous of the fact you will spend less time together once she has the baby or stressed out by the secret.You have every right to feel how you feel, but keep in mind your friend who is pregnant may not be the best person to talk about your feelings with. You may need to talk to a trusted adult instead of adding stress to her already stressful situation.

, Going through this difficult time with your friend may take a toll on you, so you may want to consider talking to a counselor. A counselor is a safe adult who can’t tell your friend’s secret, except in certain situations.


A counselor can offer advice and support, but she cannot tell anyone else about your friend’s secret unless your friend is in danger, such as if she is suicidal. If you tell the counselor that your friend is suicidal, then the counselor would be obligated to find out if that is true. If your friend is truly suicidal, then the counselor would have to report this to social services.
Keep in mind that talking to an adult will give you the opportunity to ask questions and get further information about resources that may help both your friend and yourself through this ordeal.

, Remember, teens that become pregnant are at risk to drop out of school and this affects your future. Take your friend's situation as a lesson to protect yourself. Even if your friend seems to be happy about being pregnant, the life of a teen parent is not easy.


Using condoms can protect you against pregnancy and STDs.However, keep in mind that abstinence is the only way to 100% protect yourself from teen pregnancy.

Notice how ""interested"" the piano teacher is during his/her lessons.",How to Choose a Piano Teacher for Your Child," Each piano teacher teaches different styles of music. Before seeking a teacher, you must establish the style you want. Some teachers may teach classical or jazz styles whereas others may teach new age or worship styles.;
, Each piano teacher uses a different teaching method. Some teachers will start with teaching your child how to read music before playing the piano and may use books and programs as guides. Other teachers may use the Suzuki teaching method, which focuses primarily on having your child watch, listen, and imitate the teacher.

, Some teachers may adhere to strict teaching styles, whereas other teachers may practice a more relaxed and less-structured style. If your child responds better to visual aids such as pictures, inquire about the teaching tools used.

, Some teachers may have basic knowledge, whereas other teachers may be advanced enough to teach your child as lessons become more complex. You may want to choose a teacher that can teach your child for an extended period of time.

, You may want to choose a teacher who is easy for your child to get along with and also makes them feel relaxed and at ease. If the personalities collide between the teacher and your child, the lessons may not be as effective.

, You may want to interview teachers with your child before you make a final decision. Take note of how they respond to each other and determine how comfortable your child is with the teacher. Some piano teachers may offer a free or introductory lesson for your child.

, Some teachers may teach from a studio or out of their home and may require children to remove shoes or wash their hands. You may want to ask how last-minute cancellations work and learn about attendance and make-up lesson policies.

, Each piano teacher will charge differently according to experience and materials needed. Some piano teachers may charge a higher rate to cover the costs of piano tuning and repair, lesson books, and in some cases, to help further the teacher's piano training and education. You may want to determine if the teacher will provide your child with training materials or if you will have to pay for them yourself. Understand all fees and costs upfront before deciding on a piano teacher.

, Be sure to note how often he/she leaves the room to call someone, use the bathroom, eat lunch, etc. If your piano teacher makes a phone call in several lessons, you may want to re-evaluate the quality of the lessons. The best piano teachers just teach for the whole time. Never ever leave your child alone with the teacher either. You need to watch the whole lesson because your child is not the teacher's son/daughter. There's always a chance the teacher simply couldn't care less about your child's progress in piano and take any chances he gets to be lazy (ex. offer him/her ice cream during the lesson).

Your lock should be on the outside of the door to prevent anyone from being locked inside. Of course, you should still childproof the rest of the bathroom in case the door is left unlatched.The simplest way to lock any door from the outside is a basic hook and eye latch, installed at adult height. This is also best for sliding and folding doors.
You can install a barrel bolt or similar latch on standard doors.
If you don't want to add anything permanent to your door, there are childproof door locks made to temporarily fit on any doorknob.;
, Make sure your bathroom windows are locked and that your child cannot reach them by climbing on furniture, fixtures, or towel racks., Bathroom cabinets and drawers often store very dangerous things--cleaning supplies, cosmetics, medication, and sharp objects. All of your cabinets should have child safety locks added, even if they are at adult height. Your child could climb up onto the sink or toilet and reach it. Keep everything inside a locked cabinet, including mouthwash, vitamins, natural supplements, and over-the-counter medications. These can be just as dangerous to children as prescription medicine., Your toilet is a drowning hazard--most small children don’t have the coordination to pull themselves out of a toilet once they fall in. Keep your toilet closed and locked with a special toilet lock at all times. Make sure everyone in the household, including visitors, knows to lock the toilet., Don’t leave razors, curlers, or blow dryers lying out on the counter--always unplug them and return them to a locked cabinet when you’re done. Don’t use electric razors or curlers while your child is in the bathroom. They could pull the cord and injure themselves on them., Buy a locking wastebasket or keep it in a locked cabinet. Children can rummage through the wastebasket and injure themselves on disposable razors, glass cosmetics bottles, or leftover medication., Water above 120 °F (49 °C) can scald a child, which could be fatal. Turn the temperature down on your water heater to prevent this. 120 °F (49 °C) is warm enough to wash dishes and clothing, but your child’s bathwater should be no warmer than 90 °F (32 °C)., If your child is toilet training, use a training potty that is appropriate for their size. A smaller child should be using one that rests on the ground instead of on the toilet seat, to minimize the risk of falling in. Do not keep training potties full of water when you aren’t using them., A bath seat can help prevent drowning by keeping your child secure in one position when in the bathtub. This is not a substitute for direct supervision--never leave a child alone in the bath for even a minute!, Grab bars can prevent slipping when getting in or out of the tub. These are especially useful if you have a child who is just learning to bathe alone, or if you plan to get in the tub with your infant., Children can be seriously injured by slipping and falling on slick bathroom surfaces. Add a rubber suction mat to the bottom of the bathtub and rubber-backed carpet mats to the floor., Kids splash around a lot, and water accumulation can cause dangerous mold and mildew! Clean your bathroom regularly with child-safe cleaners, and be sure to check under mats, inside potties and bath seats, and even on your child’s bath toys., If you have a glass shower door, windows a child can reach, or a large full-length mirror in your bathroom, replace them with safety glass. Any banging, hitting, or pressure on the glass could cause it to shatter!, If your bathroom counters or fixtures have pointed corners, your child could be injured on them. You can replace them entirely, but you can also install rubber bumpers on sharp corners to prevent cuts and bruises., Your towel rack looks like a towel rack to you, but to your toddler, it’s a perfect ladder onto the sink. Make sure that there is nothing your child could climb up on in the bathroom--this can include towel racks, shelves, and hampers., Tub faucets are at a perfect height to bump or even cut your baby’s head. Install a safety faucet or buy special tub faucet padding to go around it., GFCI outlets prevent shocks, burns, and electrocutions by cutting off the current if it detects a dangerous electrical imbalance. They are required for bathroom outlets in most newer homes, but if your home doesn’t have them an electrician can install them. All outlets should be outfitted with child safety plugs."

Communicate directly with your ex.",How to Co Parent With an Ex," You may have a lot of personal issues with your ex and your feelings remain valid, even after the relationship is over. However, now that you’re separated, you need to take a pragmatic view that places your child above all else. Learn to forgive your ex from their transgressions, even if they haven’t apologized.


To thoroughly forgive them, you’ll need to take a mental inventory of what makes you angry at your ex. Simply ignoring your feelings will not be a permanent solution as your anger will likely swell up again in the future when you’re reminded of your differences.Do your best to see things from their perspective. Acknowledging your own faults may be difficult but can help you empathize.
Considering aspects of their personality or history that may explain, if not justify, their behavior can help as well. This will make it easier to forgive.It may help to speak with them, separate from your children, to work out past issues that are still bothering you. However, forgiveness is a function that you have sole control over. If speaking with your ex will only flare up animosities, work through your anger on your own.;
, You may have trouble separating your emotions from your custodial relationship with your ex. Try thinking of them as a colleague rather than a personal relationship with your ‘business’ being the care of your child. Speak professionally and stay focused on pragmatic goals.Make requests rather than demands or statements of fact. Include reasonable explanations with your requests. For example, instead of saying “I need you to take the kids on Thursday nights,” ask “Would you be willing to take the kids on Thursday nights? My friends asked me to join a bowling league and I would like to do so.”
Practice active listening to demonstrate to your ex that you are hearing them, understanding their perspective, and respecting of their point of view. Ask clarifying questions and maintain a sincere body language when speaking with them to perform active listening., When you notice that your ex is going out of their way to provide excellent care for your children, tell them you appreciate it. This is a great way to build on positive aspects of your relationship and keep the focus on your children.


Say things like “I hear you did a great job with the bake sale last week,” or “I really appreciate you taking the kids to soccer practice.”

, If you are going through a legal divorce, you will have to go through negotiations to determine the provision of financial and material childcare and your scheduled share of time with the children. Whether you’re going through a legal separation procedure or not, it’s good to try and work out terms in an honest and pragmatic fashion.The most essential considerations are schedules for custody and the provision of money for childcare. These issues can be extremely complex and you may need to involve a mediator or your own attorney to represent your interests. However, you should at least start with a personal conversation to determine your ex’s expectations on these matters and express your own.With these most important issues, don’t sign any kind of legally binding agreement until you’ve had a lawyer look over it and advise you on the consequences., You need to consider things like PTA meetings and driving the kids to afterschool activities like sports. Consider all aspects of your child’s life and how the separation might affect them.


You also need to consider how you’ll enforce discipline and what kind of rules you’ll apply to the kids. Prioritize consistency both in terms of before and after the separation and between your two households., If there are areas of serious disagreement or issues that a judge has ruled as requiring adjudication like alimony payments or visitation, leave these out of your personal conversations. If you can’t resolve an issue, forcing a discussion about it will only cause unnecessary acrimony.

, Counselors are not only for couples but for anyone in a relationship, including co-parenting exes. If you’re having exceptional difficulty working through your issues with your ex, you may want to bring a relationship therapist into the picture.You may also want to consider counseling for your child if you think the separation is affecting their mood or behavior., While it may be tempting to protect your child from the events of your separation as much as possible, they will likely understand what is going on and failing to be forthright will only lead to confusion. This may be the most difficult part of your separation but breaking the news the right way could make things much easier going forward.Try to have the conversation with the whole family present. Make time to answer any questions they have and be patient and thorough when explaining the situation to them.Soften the initial shock of the situation. Start with something like “I don’t want you to worry. There is nothing to be afraid of.” If you think your child already has some understanding of the situation, you may want to ask what they think and then go from there.
Explain that you and your ex have disagreements and want to separate to be the best parents possible. Emphasize that nothing has changed in terms of your love for the child.

, For your separation to have as little impact as possible on your child, you’ll want to maintain as much consistency in your parenting style and in their routine as you can. Consider not only the child’s schedule but your general attitude and demeanor as a parent. When in doubt about how to handle a parenting situation, ask yourself what you would have done before the separation.Children need to have consistent rules and discipline before and after the separation. They also need to have consistency when they switch between households.It may be tempting to shower you child with extra affection or gifts. Of course, you should always show your child a lot of affection and consider how difficult a separation will be for them. However, going overboard can signal a lifestyle change that makes your child uncomfortable or simply result in them feeling entitled to special treatment., You should be regularly speaking with your ex to discuss issues with related to your child. Set up a regularly time to speak at least once a week, over the phone or in person. Always try to keep these discussions solely focused on your child and leave out


It might help to establish one conversation that includes new relationships or step-guardians and one without them.

, No matter how upset you are, never involve your child in the animosity. Never assign fault to your ex for the separation. Speaking negatively about your ex will not only risk the child lashing out at them or you but will also cause the child serious tensions and a feeling of being torn between the two of you.If you learn that your ex is speaking negatively about you in front of the child, be the bigger person and don’t retaliate in kind. Explain to your child that your ex is under pressure from the separation and is doing their best to get through it., Almost as important as refraining from disparaging your ex is encouraging your child to see your ex in a positive light. Say nice things about your ex whenever possible to demonstrate to your child that the end of your romantic relationship has not ended your co-parenting relationship and respect for each other.Encourage your child to appreciate the skills and parenting effort of your ex by saying things like “Isn’t your father’s cooking great?” or “Your mother did a great job coaching your little league team.”

, It can be difficult to adjust to seeing your ex with a new relationship but you’ll have to accept that this person will be a significant part of your child’s life. Your child is likely to take cues from your perception so showing your animosity toward them could lead your child to disrespect and resent them. This will not only cause stress for your ex and their new relationship but also for your child.Try to compliment the new relationship. Ask your child questions like “What is dad’s new girlfriend like?” and seem interested and impressed.
Tell them explicitly that they need to respect the new relationship as an authority figure. Say something like “Remember, mom and her new husband are the adults of the house. Show them both the respect that you would show me.”
If your child dislikes the new relationship, give them the chance to vent their frustration but encourage them to adapt to the new situation. Try to relate to them by saying something like “This is hard on me too.”

, This is a common mistake for separated parents that don’t want to deal directly with each other. Using them as a messenger will put your child in the middle of your conflict and force them to feel the tension of your relationship.Find more productive ways to communicate like email, phone, or even talking through lawyers.

Choose when to begin giving your child an allowance.,
Decide how much to give.,
Set a schedule for the allowance.,
Open a bank account for your child.Once you start giving your child an allowance, you can also help him or her open a bank account as a place to keep some of the money.,
Decide if you want to have the allowance be dependent upon chores.Some parents think it is important to give a child an allowance only of the condition that chores like making the bed, cleaning the dinner table, taking out the trash, etc.,
Consider tying an allowance to school performance.The considerations for this approach are very similar to those you must weigh when deciding whether or not to relate your child’s allowance and responsibility for chores.,
Set guidelines for how the allowance can be used.To teach your child the value of money, you will want to monitor how he or she spends the allowance, but don’t dictate the spending.,
Let your child make mistakes.You may be tempted to give your two cents on everything your child wants to spend the allowance on.,
Evaluate the allowance periodically.Every so often, consider the amount of the allowance you provide against your child’s age, needs, and level of responsibility.,
Explain if you need to lower your child’s allowance.If you are unable to raise an allowance, or must reduce it due to a financial hardship or your own budgeting needs, take the time to talk about this with your child.,
Create an allowance contract.When your child is old enough, consider drafting an allowance contract—a simple document that explains the terms of the allowance.",How to Choose an Allowance for Your Child," Many experts think that children are ready for an allowance by age 10.Others, however, say some children may be ready as early as pre-school.As a parent, it is up to you to decide when you want to begin giving your child an allowance; choose an age when your child understands what money is, and is ready to begin learning how to use it responsibly.;
, An allowance is typically considered to be an amount that is in addition to any that you spend on the child’s necessities. For this reason, there’s no strict guideline regarding what to give. It doesn’t have to be a large amount; even a small allowance can be used to teach your child the value of money, and will be appreciated.


Many experts say a rule of thumb is between $0.50 and $1 for each year on the child’s age. For instance, a 10-year old could receive between $5.00 and $10, while an 11-year old could receive between $5.50 and $11., Many feel that a weekly allowance payment is convenient.However, a monthly allowance payment has its own advantages; it will teach children the importance of budgeting and making money last, since they will have to wait longer for each allowance payment.Whatever allowance schedule you decide on, be consistent and don’t cave in to any requests for more money (unless it is for something essential or very important).

, This is another way to help the child practice money management. It can also be fun to keep up with the account and watch it grow.


You could encourage your child to put some or all of the allowance in a savings account.You could even offer to match part of whatever is set aside, as an incentive. For instance, you could tell your child that you will match 50% of the amount from the allowance that is put into savings. If your child puts $10 in savings, you will contribute 50% more ($5), so that $15 total can be put in savings.

, are completed. Others think that a child’s allowance should be independent of any required chores. Ultimately, you will have to decide what to do as a parent, and there are several things to consider:


You may want your child to understand the relationship between work and pay.
You may want your child to have a sense of responsibility and complete chores without any payment or other incentive.
You may want your child’s allowance to be a gift from you that does not depend on anything else.
Another approach is to give your child a base allowance, and then the opportunity to earn more by doing chores.If you do choose to relate your child’s allowance to chores, be consistent with the rule.

,


You may want to treat the allowance as a reward for when your child does well in school.
You may want your child to be self-motivated and strive hard in school without having to use an allowance as an incentive.
In the event that your child works hard but doesn’t do well, you may not want to “punish” them for trying by taking away the allowance.
Instead of tying an allowance to academic performance, you could also take your child out to eat at a favorite restaurant (or provide some other treat) as a reward for doing well at school.
If you do choose to relate your child’s allowance to academic performance, be consistent.

,


You might ask your child to use some of the allowance to purchase clothing, school supplies, or something else useful (rather than spending it all on entertainment). This will teach your child the basics of budgeting.
Encourage your child to think about using the allowance for a long-term goal.While “long-term” might mean something different to a child than an adult, you will still help yours by teaching him or her to think ahead. For instance, you can suggest that your child sets aside $5 at a time over a few months to help save up for a new bike.
You could continue to encourage your child to put some or all of the allowance in a savings account.
You might also encourage your child to donate part of the allowance to a charity or other valued cause, or at least to make occasional donations.

, However, experts suggest that you should generally let children their own make decisions about how to use an allowance.


Let your child make impulse buys, run out of money, purchase something that you know will fall apart, etc.Be consistent and say no if your child wants more money after spending all of the allowance (except for necessities or emergencies).
Eventually (and with your patient advice) your child will learn for himself or herself how to budget, how to buy for quality, and other important lessons.

, If possible, let the allowance grow with your child by increasing it every year (or at some other interval).Typically, as a child grows up, his or her needs and desires will grow as well, and so increasing the allowance makes sense.
However, you should also consider how responsible your child is; if he or she can manage money well, increasing the allowance might provide opportunities to show even more responsibility. Likewise, if your child needs more time to learn the value of money, you might hold off on increasing the allowance.

, Use the situation as a lesson, and explain that you are trying to manage the family’s budget. Your child will appreciate if you talk about what is going on.

, Though this might seem unnecessarily formal, it is a way to teach your child (especially a teen) about making agreements and sticking to goals. The allowance contract can include:


How much the allowance will be
How often the allowance will be paid
Any particular conditions for receiving the allowance (chores, school performance, etc.)
Any notes about how the allowance can be used (for example: no more than 25% on clothing, 15% devoted to savings, 10% set aside for a special goal)
Signatures from the parent and child/teen
A note about how often the contract will be reviewed (monthly, biannually, etc.)

"
Look for a guardian who shares your family values.,
Go for a guardian with a clean record.,
Choose a guardian with a loving personality.,
Consider trustworthy friends or family as guardians.",How to Choose a Guardian for Your Child1," When looking for a guardian for your child, think about a person who shares your values and philosophies on family. Consider the person’s moral values, educational values, and social values. Ask yourself, does this person align with my own values in these areas? You may want to ensure your child is taken care of by someone who matches what you believe in and what you want to instill in your child.You may also consider the person’s religious beliefs and values around parenting. Perhaps you’d prefer a guardian who shares your religious beliefs or the beliefs your child has been raised in. Or maybe you’d like the guardian to share your ideas around parenting and child-rearing.
For example, if you promote freedom of expression and freedom of belief to your child, you may look for a guardian who will do the same. If you are strict about curfew and doing chores with your child, you may want a guardian who will also be strict about these things.;
, Another element of character you should consider is whether or not the guardian has a clean record. You may want a guardian who does not have a criminal record or a history of breaking the law. The guardian may also have good standing in their community and be considered an asset to society.Make sure you consider the issue of a clean record from your own personal perspective and preference. Maybe you have a person in mind who has had a run in with the law in the past. You may not disqualify them right away based on this issue if they have other good qualities.

, You should also consider the guardian’s personality and whether they would be loving and caring towards your child. Ask yourself, is this person loving? Would they be a good role model for my child? Do they have the temperament to take care of my child?


You should also choose someone who appears comfortable around children. Make sure the person is able to be physically affectionate towards your child and show them love in words and actions.

, As you search for a guardian for your child, you should consider close friends, close family, and far flung friends or family. Keep your search broad and do not limit yourself to just close family or friends. Consider if a relative that lives further away might be a good candidate. Though moving your child to a different area might be disruptive at first, the relative may be a good fit in other ways and worth considering.Keep in mind children are resilient and will likely adapt to a new environment if necessary. Do not limit your search for a guardian to just people who live close to you or those who live in your area. Broadening the scope of your search could help you find the ideal guardian, even if they live in another state or area.

"
"
Look for a guardian who is financially stable.,
Go for a guardian who is healthy and mature in age.,
Choose a guardian who has the time and energy to care for a child.",How to Choose a Guardian for Your Child2," As you search for a guardian for your child, consider potential candidates who are financially stable and responsible. You may avoid choosing a guardian who has a high amount of debt, who does not have a steady job, or who does not handle their money well. Ask yourself, will this person be able to support my child financially? Will this person be a good role model in terms of money management for my child?Remember that caring for a child requires a fair amount of money and a steady income. You do not want to burden someone with caring for your child if they are not financially stable. You also do not want to put your child at risk by placing them with someone who cannot provide for them financially.

, Factor in the health of the guardian and confirm that they are in good health. The guardian should be physically and mentally well enough to care for your child and provide for them. You do not want the guardian’s health to put your child in danger or result in your child having to care for their guardian.You should also consider age of the guardian and make sure they are mature enough to care for a child. Having a guardian that is middle aged will ensure they have life experience and are able to conduct themselves as adults. A guardian that is very young may not be as responsible or as prepared to care for a child.

, Consider the guardian’s lifestyle and whether they will have the time and energy necessary to take care of your child. Ask yourself, is the guardian able to fit a child into their existing lifestyle? Does the guardian have the time and energy to devote themselves to raising my child?For example, you may have a close relative who is a workaholic and unable to find enough time to sustain a romantic relationship, let alone care for a child. As a result, they may not make the best guardian for your child.

"
"
Ask your child for their opinion.,
Talk to trusted relatives and friends.,
Speak to potential guardians.",How to Choose a Guardian for Your Child3," If your child is old enough to express an opinion, ask them who they would like as their guardian. Giving your child input on the decision may help you narrow down the list of candidates and make them feel like they are part of the process. They may also be able to identify a candidate that is suitable to be their guardian and be a good match for them.For example, you may ask your child, “Who do you think would make a good guardian for you?” or “Who would you prefer to have as your guardian if something happened to me?”

, Reach out to those you trust for guidance on choosing a guardian. You may speak to your parents, for example, and ask them how they choose a guardian for you. Or you may talk to a close friend and ask them for their opinion. Getting some perspective from those you trust could help you decide who the ideal guardian might be.You may make a shortlist of three to four potential guardians and ask friends or family for their opinion. They may be able to help you narrow down your choice to one person.
Keep in mind that though it may be helpful to get advice and guidance from others, ultimately, this is your decision. Try to go with your instincts and make an informed decision for yourself on who the guardian for your child should be.

, It may also help to speak to people you are considering for the role of guardian for your child. Make sure the potential guardians are willing to take on such a big responsibility and feel they will be able to be good role models for your child.For example, you may say to potential guardians, “Would you be willing to be a guardian for my child in the event something happens to me?” or “Would you be comfortable being a guardian for my child?”
One or two of your potential guardians may not be comfortable with the responsibility, effectively taking them off the shortlist. This is within their right. Checking with potential candidates before you make a decision will ensure you chose someone who is willing and able to be a good guardian for your child.

String a separate piece of yarn or thick string through the hole in each ornament.",How to Make Bird Seed Ornaments1," Microwave the water for about 30 seconds. The water should be hot to the touch but does not need to boil.;
, Only whisk the gelatin into the water long enough for it to dissolve.

, Stir the corn syrup long enough for it to dissolve.

, The two should be thoroughly combined.

, Use a large spoon to mix all ingredients well until a thick, sticky mass forms.

, You can use any cookie cutter shape you want, but larger shapes tend to be easier to work with than smaller ones and may attract more birds.

, Wax paper or nonstick cooking foil can also be used.

, You will need to work directly with the sticky bird seed mixture, and cooking spray will reduce the amount of seed that gets stuck to your skin.

, Press the seed mix into the cookie cutter with your hands until it feels firm and compact.

, Immediately remove it after inserting it into the seed to create a hole. The hole will allow you to tie the ornament onto the tree. You can create the hole anywhere, but the closer it is to the center, the sturdier the ornament will be and the longer it will last.

, Do so carefully, ""wiggling"" it free and gently holding the seed in place with your fingers if necessary.

, You may need to spray the cookie cutter with additional nonstick spray after every one or two moldings.

, Allow them to sit in a cool spot, such as a basement or refrigerator.

, Tie the string, leaving enough empty space to slip the loop over a tree branch.

, Heat and stir the coconut oil until it melts but does not bubble or boil.

, Mix well with a heat-resistant spoon until the seed and nuts are evenly distributed throughout the oil.

, The oil should be cool enough to prevent burns but not so cool that it solidifies.

, Position the twine toward the top of the cookie cutter rather than in the center. Most of the twine should hang out over the edge of the cookie cutter.

, Do this slowly to prevent spillage or burns, and allow the seed mixture to nearly reach the top of the mold.

, Do not refrigerate or freeze yet.

, Allow it to remain in the freezer for an hour.

, Hang it outside using the twine.

",How to Make a Star Garland," Keep the star shape simple. You might want to use the template provided here to trace around; resize as needed.


The stars can be all one size or varying sizes, big or small, it's up to you to decide what final look you want for the garland. In some cases, you might like to make the stars large enough to write names or messages on them, especially for recognition purposes.





;
,, Then punch a small hole in the center of each star. Use either a hole puncher or simply push a sharp point of a pen, pencil or similar object through it.

, If you are going to decorate the stars, do it here. Draw, paint, write, add glitter, glue on feathers, etc. Do whatever you like. Also realize that it's perfectly fine to do absolutely nothing by way of decoration––the stars will have a rustic, simple quality if you don't do anything to them.

, Adjust all the stars to sit evenly across the string. The length of the string should be determined by where you're hanging or draping it, and the amount of stars being added to it.


If you are creating a size pattern, such as two small stars, one big star, etc., be sure to follow your pattern with care; it's harder to take off errors than to get them on in the correct order in the first place.







, Then hang the star garland wherever it's needed. Some ideas for using it include:


Drape over a Christmas tree
Hang across an office or classroom ceiling
Dangle over a stair banister
Pin up across a whiteboard or wall space
Hang over a curtain rod or across window space
Adorn a table setting with it.

, Start drawing the icicles just above the fishing line so that the glue catches it. Leave a little bit of space between each icicle. This will allow the garland to be more flexible. You can make the icicles any length you want. You could even make them different lengths.


Use more pressure at the start of each icicle, and less pressure at the tips. This will make them taper, just like real icicles.
You can use regular hot glue or glitter hot glue. Shades of blue, iridescent, or silver would work best.

, This will give them some extra sparkle. Blue, iridescent, or silver glitter would work best.If you already used glittery hot glue, then you can skip this step.

, Wait for the glue to set first. Once it hardens and turns opaque, peel the tape away. Gently pull the fishing line off of the parchment paper. The icicles will come off along with the fishing line.


If you used glitter, carefully scoop the glitter back into its jar.

, Unroll another few inches/centimeters of fishing line. Tape down both ends of it. Use your hot glue gun to draw more icicles. Wait for the glue to set, then pull the fishing line off. Keep doing this until the garland is the length you want.

Move your fingers just below the flattened part, and pinch it again., Rotate the tube back to where you started. Move your fingers down, and pinch it just below the last crimped part. Keep pinching and alternating sides until you reach the end of the tube. It will have a sort of wavy, crimped look to it., You can make as many icicles as you want. It all depends on how long and how full you want your garland to be. The more icicles you make, the fuller your garland will end up.

, You can use any type of string you want. Silver thread or clear fishing line would look best, however. It would be a good idea to cut it a little longer than you want it to be. This will allow the garland to droop gracefully when you hang it up.

, These will allow you to hang it up. They will also keep the icicles from slipping off.

, Place an icicle behind the string, with the longer flattened end facing up. Make sure that the string is centered, then fold the foil over the string. Pinch the folded part firmly between your thumb and forefinger. Continue attaching icicles in a similar manner until your garland is full to your liking.

Break out of your routines.",How to Care for Your Husband," Some men are socially conditioned to avoid talking about their feelings. This can be damaging to the relationship, as it leaves a lot of important feelings unexpressed.If your husband has a hard time opening up, you may need to work harder to learn how he feels and what he needs in the relationship.


Let your husband know that you'd like to know how he feels. You may find it helpful to set aside some time on a regular basis in which you both talk about how you've been feeling.Don't judge your husband over how he feels, and don't jump to any conclusions based on what he tells you. You want to create a situation where your husband will feel safe discussing his feelings with you, and in order to feel safe he needs to know that you won't get upset or judge him for what he says.;
, Some people aren't comfortable asking for something unless the issue is brought up by someone else. If you're concerned that you aren't meeting your husband's emotional needs, talk to him about it and ask him what, specifically, he needs.Determine if your husband needs change (as in, feeling stuck in a rut or feeling unsatisfied with some aspect of the relationship), understanding (more communication, more of a willingness to see an issue from his perspective), or greater compatibility (more intimacy, more time spent together). These are three important keys in a successful and supportive relationship., If you need change, understanding, or greater compatibility, let him know, and work on these issues together. The relationship will not work if only one spouse is working on meeting the other's needs. A real, true partnership only exists when both partners are working to make each other happy and fulfilled.

, Once you've determined what your husband needs in order to feel loved and fulfilled, and you've communicated your needs, try to help give him those things. Ask him to work toward giving you what you need as well.If your husband needs change, work with him to find a solution. Try breaking out of your collective routines. Do something different together, like taking a vacation or learning a new hobby together.
If your husband needs understanding, spend more time talking with one another. Listen to how he feels and offer him supportive feedback.
If your husband needs greater compatibility, try to take more of an interest in his hobbies, and ask him to do the same with your interests. Work on spending more time together, and try to be more intimate with one another.

, In many successful marriages, each spouse puts the other person's needs first. This ensures that both spouses have their needs met, while simultaneously striving to make the other person happy. Everybody wins when both spouses work equally., If you're worried about meeting your husband's emotional needs, it's important to listen to how he feels.You should communicate with one another openly and honestly, and listen when he tells you how he feels.


Be an active listener. Process what your husband is saying instead of preparing your response before he is finished speaking. Encourage him to continue by making eye contact, nodding your head, and asking questions.Avoid critiquing your husband's feelings. Help him feel comfortable sharing his feelings without fearing that you will judge him or correct him.Talk about any behaviors that you or your spouse engage in that affect your relationship. You may want to initiate the conversation by asking if there's anything you could be doing differently, and then gently telling your husband if there are things he could be doing differently as well.Try to actively address any issues that are brought up, and ask your husband to do the same., If you're still having a hard time communicating with your husband about what each of you need, it may be that you and your husband have different styles of communicating and aren't picking up on each other's true feelings. If this is the case, one or both of you may need to adjust how you approach communication to better accommodate one another.Clear and direct communication is when you don't avoid saying what needs to be said. It can seem too blunt to some people, but some experts believe it is the healthiest form of communication. Try telling each other exactly how you feel, with no sugarcoating.Clear and indirect communication clearly communicates the basic message, but may not direct that message at the appropriate person. An example of clear and indirect communication would be saying that a certain behavior bothers you, but without directly addressing the intended target. In this case you or your husband may need to be more direct.Masked and direct communication directs communication to the appropriate person, but without being clear on what is actually being communicated. An example of masked and direct communication would be telling someone that certain behaviors can be upsetting, without directly saying that the intended target has engaged in that behavior. Again, practicing directness can help. Masked and indirect communication obscures both the message and the intended target of criticism. This is considered a highly unhealthy method of communication. If this sounds like you or your husband, you should take pains to be more honest with each other. Try writing down what you want to say as a way to clarify your feelings before expressing yourselves to each other., You may have identified some unhealthy or indirect tendencies in the way you or your husband communicate. Assertive communication is a great model for clear communication, because it is based on mutual respect: you will stand up for your needs, but you will also listen to others and compromise.To communicate clearly and assertively try the following:


Use ""I"" statements.Instead of beginning a sentence with ""you,"" which can sound accusatory and often makes the other person defensive, use ""I."" So, instead of ""You're wrong,"" you say: ""I disagree."" Other ""I"" statements include: ""I feel,"" ""I need,"" ""I would like.""
Talk about the behavior, not about your husband.Instead of saying, ""You look like a slob,"" ask: ""Did you know that shirt has a mustard stain on the front?"" This avoids judgement and instead focuses on the facts.
Pay attention to tone and volume. How you speak is as important as what you say. Don't scream and shout or speak in a whisper. Speak with a firm voice at a normal, conversational volume.Respond, but don't react. If you find that you are becoming angry and defensive, or your husband is, take a break from the discussion. Agree on a time to return to the issue once you've calmed down, and make sure you follow through and finish the discussion. Remember: being assertive is not the same as being aggressive.
Practice in low-risk situations.If you are afraid to assert yourself or nervous about larger conflicts, try starting small (like speaking up if he says the vacuum is in the garage but you know it is in the closet). If it is not easy to do this with your husband, find someone (like a friend or family member) with whom you feel comfortable enough to disagree.

, Know that ""agreeing to disagree"" is a possibility and is still an acceptable outcome.


Make clear requests. Instead of inviting your husband to say ""no"" in response to questions like ""Would you mind...?"", make your needs clear by asking ""Will you please...?"" The later is respectful, and he can still say no if he chooses, but you are no longer asking permission to have needs., Each partner in a relationship brings valuable contributions and makes meaningful changes to the other person's life. Sometimes, after being with someone for a long time, a spouse may feel emotionally neglected or taken for granted. To prevent this from happening, be sure to communicate your appreciation to your spouse.Tell your husband reassuring things, like ""I appreciate the nice things you do for me,"" or ""I'm so glad and thankful that you are in my life."", When you've lived with someone for a long time, it's easy to feel taken for granted from time to time. One way to prevent this from happening is to make time to spend alone together. It can be a weekend getaway, or even just a couple hours after dinner set aside for distraction-free conversation. However you reserve spouse time, make sure it happens on a regular basis and make sure you both enjoy your time together.Try having a weekly date night. You can set aside one night each week to go out for dinner and see a movie. Or bring the date night home, if you prefer, and cook a meal together., A long-term relationship can easily lead to couples falling into ruts and routines. You can remind your husband you care by surprising him from time to time. It doesn't have to be a jaw-dropping surprise. Simple, little surprises – like leaving a note in his lunch, or getting him a small gift without any special occasion – can help keep the excitement of romance alive.You can also surprise each other by trying new things together. Studies show that doing new things with a partner releases oxytocin, the so-called ""cuddle hormone"".Try taking a class together or even just going to a new restaurant together., Intimacy helps build lasting bonds in a relationship, perhaps more than any other factor. Intimacy isn't just limited to sex, although many experts consider a healthy sex life to be an important factor for a healthy, successful marriage.Holding hands, kissing, cuddling, and walking arm-in-arm are all ways you can enjoy intimacy on a daily basis with your husband.Find time to foster intimacy by snuggling together while watching TV or movies and holding hands while running errands. Once you make the effort to be more intimate, you'll most likely begin to see more and more ways to be intimate with one another.

, It may sound obvious, but it's important that you and your husband do little, day-to-day things together whenever possible. Even simple changes like eating meals together and going to bed together at the same time can go a long way toward feeling like you and your husband spend time together., One common complaint among people struggling with marriage problems is that the couple no longer does things they did while they were dating. The time when you and your husband were dating may feel far gone, but you can keep the spark alive by recreating fun date nights you had before you got married.Go out dancing together, if you and your husband enjoy dancing. It's fun, energetic, and may help remind you of why you fell in love in the first place.Have a romantic dinner together. You can go out to your favorite restaurant, or stay in and have an intimate meal at home.

, Even if you can't actually take a vacation at this point in time, simply looking at vacation options and planning a potential trip together can be a great bonding exercise.Once you've planned your dream vacation, start working towards making it a reality.

, A great way to have fun with your husband and rekindle the romance is to get out of your normal daily or weekly habits and do something new together.If you aren't a typically outdoorsy couple, try going for a hike together, or a simple picnic outdoors.
If you normally stay in on the weekends, try doing something different together. You can go on a double date with other couple-friends, or host a party and invite people you haven't seen in a long time.
No matter what you choose, it's important that you do new things together from time to time. That doesn't mean you have to scrap what's comfortable. Just change things up every once in a while.

Master your own emotions, don't blame the other.",How to Be Happily Married," The most common mistake made in the quest for a happy marriage is to expect that someone should be ""making"" you happy. The old saying ""to have friends requires one to be a friend"" applies.;
, The only way you can be happy is by focusing on your own efforts to make your marriage partner happy. In essence, a marriage is no different from any friendship with shared goals and responsibilities and the added bonus of readily available sex.

, As a general guideline, one should think how you would treat a friend you are very fond of and apply the same principles. No friendship would survive if you do not invest in spending time together and doing things together.

, Similarly, one cannot expect to find happiness in a marriage relationship without spending quality time together, making eye contact (a fact know to increase bonding) and doing novel things together.

, Our behavior is not dependent on our emotions - psychologists know that our emotions are more often the result of our thoughts and actions rather than the end all and be all so in a nutshell and at the risk of oversimplifying it: Act happy, think happy, feel happy.

Find ways to be grateful.,
Engage in flow experiences.,
Stop fighting the same fights.,
Develop your own interests.,
Try volunteering.,
Develop your social life.",How to Be Happy in an Unhappy Marriage1," It's not always easy to be grateful, especially in the midst of a bad relationship. Nonetheless, gratefulness can help you cope with the bad relationship, and it can lead to you being happier.Take time each day to figure out what you are thankful for. Try writing a few things you are grateful for each day in a journal. You can also use posts on social media for this purpose. Usually, even if the situation is bad, you can find something to be grateful about.
For instance, you may not like how you are being treated in the relationship you are in, but you may be grateful to have financial stability in your life at the moment. Alternatively, maybe you're grateful that the other person in the relationship remains a good parent to your kids.;
, Flow moments are when you lose yourself to an experience by being completely absorbed in whatever it is you're doing. If you're an artist, a writer, or even a runner, you may already understand this type of experience. It's that moment when the world falls away, and you are just experiencing or enjoying what you're doing. Studies have shown that the more flow moments you have, the happier you are in general.Choose an activity that challenges you a little bit, but that is still familiar so that you can lose yourself in it. For example, if you enjoy painting landscapes, then you might try painting a new subject such as a portrait or a basket of fruit.

, That is, if you always find yourself arguing about the same things, it may be time to put that topic aside. You need to decide that you won't discuss it because you can't agree or try to find a compromise that works for both of you.For example, if you tend to fight over politics, then you might want to make politics an off-limits topic. Or, if you often fight about what movie you are going to watch on Friday nights, then you might want to take turns choosing the movie.

, If your marriage is not what you want it to be, it may be time to find some fulfillment outside of your marriage and not in the form of an affair. Having your own hobbies and interests will help you stay independent and keep you happy and engaged with the world. In fact, developing your own interests is a good idea even if you have a great marriage.Consider exploring interests at the library, joining local hobby clubs and cooking classes, or taking a class at a nearby community college.

, Having a sense of purpose and some good social connections with other people is also a good way to feel happy.Because volunteering can give you a sense of purpose in life and it also allows you to interact with other like-minded people, it might help you to feel happier.


Try to find an organization that you would like to contribute to, such as an animal shelter or a food bank, and apply to become a volunteer. You might even ask your spouse if he or she would like to volunteer with you and it might be a good bonding activity for the two of you.

, Many studies point to relationships being key to happiness.If your main relationship is unhappy, then you may not see how you can change your situation. But your spouse doesn't have to be your main source of socializing. You can have fulfilling relationships with friends, as well as other members of your family.


Try to go out to dinner with friends one night per week or get together with a sibling or cousin for a day of shopping.
If you don't have a lot of friends, then try to meet more people who share your interests. For example, you could join a bowling league, take an art class, or find a knitting circle.

Take advantage of alone time.",How to Be Happy Without Having a Child1," If you are looking to advance in your job or to learn new working skills, you may be happier without the hindrance of child rearing responsibilities distracting you from your career. You may have more time than some of your parent peers to devote to work, in which case you can take this as an opportunity to immerse yourself fully and enjoy career success.Chart a career path by working only the jobs that interest you, trusting your gut about which positions you accept, and developing a professional network.;
, Raising a child is an expensive endeavor. If you do not have children you may have additional disposable income, and if you love traveling, you can take this as an opportunity to do more of that.


You could consider vacation destinations exclusively for the over-21 crowd if you want a truly child-free experience. You might also set a travel goal and plan a lifetime of travel alone or with your partner. In addition to expanding yourself culturally, you will meet a host of interesting people, and if you love interacting with others, this may just be the perfect way to attain happiness without having a child., Savings goals are very different for people with no children than they are for people with children.With the cost of raising children being so high, you may have more money than your counterparts with children which you could direct towards the purposes of learning how to invest. Without the stress of paying for your kids' college or leaving an inheritance, you may even be able to retire earlier than individuals with children.

Take time to be together.,
Remember what you valued.,
Talk about strengths and difficulties.,
Work out solutions.,
Think about counseling.",How to Be Happy in an Unhappy Marriage2," Making time for each other is a way to say you are committed to each other. Say you will spend a certain time each week with each other, and stick to it. It will also give you a chance to get to know one another again., When you first got together, you were probably partially attracted by the differences the other person exhibited. For instance, maybe you were exhilarated by the fact that he or she was impulsive and loved to be spontaneous. Now, you may find yourself hating the quality. The key is to try to remember why you loved that quality in the first place and move toward enjoying it again.For instance, it may drive you crazy when your spouse wants to drop everything and drive to the mountains. On the other hand, it keeps your life from getting too boring. Try to strike a balance, and enjoy what you can.

, It is important to acknowledge what is going well in your relationship as well as what has become a struggle. You might even want to make a list of strengths and difficulties together. Make sure that you include things on the list that you avoid talking about because of fears that you will just end up fighting about them.Try to pick a time to talk about your strengths and difficulties when you are both feeling calm and focused. Avoid talking at the end of a long day or at other stressful times.Use ""I"" statements rather than ""You"" statements. In other words, try to talk about what you're feeling and what you think is wrong without blaming the other person. For instance, saying ""I get upset when we don't spend enough time together"" is better than ""You're never around."" The second statement puts your spouse on guard, while the first helps open discussion.Spend time talking and listening. That is, you can't just lay out what you think is wrong. You also need to spend time actively listening to what your spouse has to say. Show you're engaged by offering short summaries of what he or she has said and by asking questions that are relevant to the conversation., Once you've figured out together what issues you have in the marriage, it's time to try to come up with some solutions. You may even be able to draw on some of your strengths to help you develop solutions to problems in your relationships.


To compromise, you must talk about your wants and needs, helping you both to decide what's most important to each of you.In other words, to make a compromise, you must be willing to let the other person win when it comes to their needs, giving ground when it comes in conflict with your wants. The same must be true of the other person.

, Sometimes, you need the help of a professional to get past your problems. A marriage counselor may help you fix more problems than you expect, and in fact, about half of people who use marriage counselors say that the counselor helped them fix all of the major problems in their marriage.

Try legal separation.,
Know divorce may be a better option.,
Consider reasons to divorce.",How to Be Happy in an Unhappy Marriage3," A legal separation gives you the time away from your spouse that you may need to work out problems. It is different than a divorce because you remain married. The benefit of a separation is it gives you a legal way to work out custody and child support while you are living apart, as well as how your property should be divided up. Nonetheless, if you work out your problems, you can go back to a normal marriage., While getting a divorce is a life upheaval, staying in an unhealthy marriage can be detrimental to self-esteem and mental health. Some studies have shown it's better to get out of a caustic relationship and work to improve your own mental health than to stay.Understand an unhappy marriage can lead to depression. One study, which involved data from 5,000 adults, showed that the quality of your most important relationship is a good predictor of developing depression. Meaning, if one of your closest relationships, including your spousal one, is in bad repair, it puts you at risk for developing depression., You may find that you have a good reason for getting a divorce. If you are unhappy in your marriage, you will likely find that you are a happier person once you get out.You might consider a divorce if your spouse had an affair. While some couples overcome infidelity, others never recover from it. If you find that you can't forgive your spouse for what he or she did even after months or years, you may want to consider a divorce.You've grown in different ways. Sometimes, when you grow into full-fledged adults together, you take different directions. If you find you and your spouse can't agree on much of anything anymore because you are just too different, it may be best to divorce.Your partner is bad at finances and won't change. Of course, everyone makes bad money choices sometimes. However, if your partner is so bad that it is causing stress on your marriage or is bankrupting your family, you may need to get out of the marriage, especially if you've expressed concern but your spouse is unwilling to change.Think about the kids. Many unhappily married couples stay together for the kids. Divorce is hard on kids, but it's also true that being unhappily married can be hard on your kids, as well. Your kids know you're unhappy, and if you're constantly fighting, you're putting stress on them, anyway."

Make 3 more petals using the same technique.,
Arrange the petals together to form a flower shape.,
Wrap a thin wire around the center to hold the petals together.Thread the wire through the bottom, pointed part of each V. Start by threading the petals that are directly opposite each other first.

How many poinsettias your garland has is up to up to you. The finished flowers will measure 5½ inches (13.97 centimeters) across.You can also make some white poinsettias using this same method and white chenille bump stems.;
, When you are done, your chenille stem should be half its length and have only two bumps.Pinch the folded parts between your forefinger and thumb to create nice, sharp points.

Make the bed in the morning and prepare breakfast.,
Do house chores before she asks you to do them.,
Help her with an important item on her to do list.,
Plan an entire day together, just the two of you.,
Surprise her with a thoughtful gift.,
Cook her a nice dinner.",How to Be Nice to Your Wife1," Start your wife’s day off right by making the bed in the morning while she gets ready for the day so she does not have to do it. A small gesture like this can show her that you want to be helpful and make her day that much easier.You can also improve her morning by making breakfast for her. This could be a nice cup of coffee and some eggs or setting out coffee in a travel mug and yogurt for her to grab on her way out. She will likely appreciate having to worry about one less thing in the morning and be grateful for your nice gesture.;
, If your wife is constantly asking you to do chores around the house and then getting annoyed when they do not get done, change this pattern. Take initiative and do chores around the house before she asks you to do them.Take out the garbage, tidy up the kitchen or living room, do yard work, and do laundry. Show her that you want to make her daily routine less stressful and that you are willing to follow through on your responsibilities at home.

Plan as one, not two.,
Execute as One.,
Tolerate each other's differences, and know that your love for one another supersedes all differences.,
See and feel Love around.,
Signals.,
Remember the golden rule.",How to Be in a Married Relationship," Plan for what? Well as an individual we all have goals just when we are getting married we need to combine the goals and re-align them as the common goal for each other. Goal of family/home. I have found two types of couple, one where one of the spouse is self sacrificing and another he/she is too bothered about himself/herself (read as dominant, ego etc). In both the cases an imbalance is created. In this relationship, i think the key is to consider both together and plan. It’s easier said than done. Always plan and expect that it will not be the same when it will come for execution.;
, It becomes easy to execute anything as individuals rather than becoming one. If planning is done then execution can be tried as one. Execution as one does not mean execute the same thing, it means as per the interest, comfort level, individual strength and weakness, execute as per the personal common goal. Love and thank each other to be on track and always have defined metrics for each one to evaluate. Evaluation is the key for any execution as it keeps us in track to our goal.

, Do not argue, criticize, condemn, fight, or yell.

, As most of us are so skeptical about everything and anything, we tend to always see what we need to do, if we are on track, if anything is missing, etc. Good things like love, hope they hide in detail, in small things which are easily missed. Fight not, because we love. Most of us love destination so much that we miss to appreciate and enjoy the present moment. ""Love is all around. "" We miss to see as we are too focused to watch our self right in future.

, If one individual has lost his opinion in the relationship, understand it will do harm to the relationship in the long run. Remember, most of us are busy dying, understand, think and get busy living. If this relationship is not living and is dead most chance is that you will start busy dying. ""Get busy living, Get busy dying"" - Shawshank Redemption

, Do unto others as you would have others do unto you. You can sleep as individuals, but never wake up as individuals.

Work on the relationship continually.,
Be affectionate.,
Always make time for each other.,

Discuss your dreams often.",How to Be a Perfect Couple," In order for your partner to feel like she can depend on you, you have to be a reliable and trustworthy partner. It is extremely important that you show her you always keep your promises and can be a dependable partner for her. Being trustworthy and dependable are some of the best ways to show her you are invested in the relationship and take it seriously. Some tips to earn her trust:Always follow through on things. When you say you're going to do something, do it.
Keep all your promises to her, but also keep your promises to other people to show her you keep your word to all the people in your life.
Don’t lie to her or exaggerate the truth. She needs to be able to trust what you say and what you do.;
, Opening up about things you are normally private about is another way to strengthen your relationship. Sharing things you would otherwise keep secret, like your biggest fears, will help show that you trust her as well. It will also help establish open communication between the two of you, which is very important. This might mean discussing things your partner doesn’t want to hear; however, being honest and vulnerable will help build trust and emotional intimacy in your relationship, which will help your love last., Disagreements will happen in even the most loving relationships, and it is important to address these disagreements maturely.Avoid having a “winner” versus “loser” mentality, and instead try to meet somewhere in the middle on issues. Also be aware that people’s needs change over time so you will both compromise on things as your relationship progresses. Some helpful tips:


Always listen intently to what your partner is saying before replying.
When you’re listening to your partner, don’t just listen so you can reply; listen so you can understand.
Avoid being judgmental, and always try to see things from your partner’s perspective.

, It is important that when you say “I’m sorry” or “I forgive you” that you really mean it. Sincerity, especially in regards to apologies, is very important in a healthy relationship. There will be times when you drive each other crazy; patience will help you to endure tough situations, and forgiveness will help you move on from them. Patience and forgiveness are some of the strongest forms of support.Try to realize that the emotion your partner is feeling is just as real to them as your irritation is to you.
Communicate with your partner using “I” statements such as “I’m trying to be patient, but I feel frustrated because…”
Discuss frustrating situations with your partner, and try to determine what triggers your impatience. If you can, avoid these situations when you’re together. If you can’t avoid them, prepare yourself to practice patience during this time and try to remain calm.

, When you’re in love it’s natural to want to spend all your time together; however, spending time apart is also an important component of a happy relationship. Cultivate and pursue separate interests and activities so that you can each have some time to yourself. Try taking a painting class or joining a recreational sport league. Having separate interests will help you grow as an individual and give you experiences to share with your partner when you come back. Plus, missing your partner can help remind you how important they are to you., You know your partner is amazing, but as relationships progress this is sometimes clouded by work, responsibilities, and life. The most successful couples take time to cheer for one another and celebrate each other’s accomplishments. Talk about your hopes and dreams often, and help your partner achieve their goals by encouraging them in their pursuits. Some tips to help you encourage your partner:Help them prepare for a job interview by printing off their resume and tucking a “good luck” note in their portfolio.
When they accomplish a goal, even something small, acknowledge it with a celebratory dinner, card, or an extra big hug when they get home.
Research some classes they can take or seminars they can attend that will help them get closer to their goals.

, It is important to remember that even if you think your partner or your relationship is perfect, it’s not. No one is perfect, and everyone makes mistakes. Respecting your partner means valuing them as irreplaceable and communicating through the toughest of times.


Never raise your voice to one another or insult each other with unkind words.
Don’t ever try to manipulate your partner or use their secrets against them.
Don’t ever betray their trust.
Always remember what you value in your partner, and never take them for granted.

, A long-term relationship has ups and downs, and a healthy relationship requires a lot of work. As your love transitions from new and exciting to established and more intimate, it’s important to make your partner feel special, appreciated, and loved. You need to actively work on your relationship and address problems as they come up instead of ignoring them or hoping they’ll go away. Communication is key!Be in the moment with your partner, and actively listen to them when they are talking.
Make it your goal to be as open and honest with your partner as possible, and promptly discuss any issues you have with them.
Avoid communicating when you feel like your emotions are high. It is best to have discussions when you are calm and emotionally neutral.
Tell your partner you appreciate them often; let them know you don’t take them for granted.

, It is important to always show your partner how much you care in both your actions and your words. Affection is reassuring and comforting, and it also helps to maintain a physical relationship with one another. However, affection doesn’t have to be just physical touching like hugs or kisses, it can be any kind of gesture that lets your partner know and feel that they are loved. For example:


Do something for your partner that you know they will appreciate. This could be folding the laundry because you know they hate doing it, or making them a cake just because it’s their favorite.
Give them some physical affection outside of your normal routine. If you always kiss them before you leave for the day, try changing it up by dipping them before you kiss them. Or if you like to cuddle on the couch and watch TV, sit so that you can rub their feet.
Do something unexpected. While you’re walking down the street holding hands, try spinning them around once and then keep walking without breaking stride. It’s an unexpected move without being too eccentric, and it won’t go unappreciated.

, Life gets busy and sometimes your responsibilities can be overwhelming. Try to take some time to relax and really enjoy each other’s company. Sometimes as relationships progress, being comfortable with each other and your routine can overshadow quality time. Revive date night and do something special at least once a month; it will be something you can both plan and look forward to, and it will help keep the spark alive. You can also try reading the same book and discussing it with each other or watching a TV show that you can cuddle up and enjoy together every week at the same time., Lasting love doesn’t always have to be serious all the time. Make sure you have fun together, both in the beginning of your relationship and moving forward. Laughter can be comforting, it can relieve stress, and it can strengthen your intimacy. Teasing each other with the security that love allows is powerful, and it can help make your love last. Continue to try new things together and get out of your comfort zone together. Save up to go on an adventurous trip somewhere neither of you have been, or plan a staycation and explore the nature trails in a nearby town., Being in a healthy relationship means taking on the world hand in hand with your partner; it means helping each other be better people and working towards your goals. In order to best support one another and fuel each other’s passions, talk to each other regularly about your hopes. These discussions will strengthen your intimacy and bring you closer together, and it will also help your mutual goals become a reality.Talk about your childhood and share if you have any hopes for what your future family will be like.
Tell them about your dream job, like how you’ve always wanted to run a restaurant.
Share how you’ve always wanted to go to Europe on vacation, and make plans to save up for a trip together.

Ask her about her day.,
Be a good conversationalist.,
Tell her that you appreciate her.,
Compliment her, just because.",How to Be Nice to Your Wife2," Take a moment at the end of the day to ask your wife how she’s doing and how her day went. This could be during dinner or as you are both getting ready for bed. Ask her directly, “How did your day go?” or “Tell me about your day.” Then, listen patiently as she speaks to show her you are listening.You should also display open body language so your wife feels encouraged to talk to you about her day. Keep your arms relaxed and at your sides, with your body positioned towards her. Make eye contact with her as she speak so she knows you are paying attention to what she is saying.

, This means paying attention to what your wife is saying and responding with an interested, engaged answer. Rather than brush off conversation with your wife or changing the subject when your wife comments on something, respond with an answer that keeps the conversation going. This will create a healthy dialogue between you and your wife and show her that you are interested in her concerns, even if they are not things you would usually discuss or talk about on your own.For example, maybe your wife enjoys gossiping about the latest drama with her work friends. She may say, “You will not believe what Donald did to Mark at the meeting today.” Rather than respond with, “Who cares? Can you pass the chips?”, you should make an effort to be engaged in what your wife is talking about and show her you care about her interests. You may say, “What did Donald do? He is always doing something inappropriate in meetings.” This will keep the conversation going and allow you to connect with your wife.

, Sometimes, all it takes are three simple words to brighten your wife’s day: “I appreciate you.” Say this to her after she has had a long day, but comes home and prepares dinner anyway, or when she goes out of her way to help you out. Remind her that you appreciate her hard work and dedication to your family, even when she has had a hard or challenging day. Though you can always show her how much you appreciate her by doing kind gestures, saying the words directly to her can also make a big impact., Take the time to compliment your wife on a daily basis, even if it’s just a small comment, to let her know that you value her and appreciate her. You can use “I appreciate you” as a compliment or say, “You look great” as she heads out the door.Try to be genuine with your compliments, as you do not want to come off as fake or insincere. Make eye contact with her and smile as you give her a compliment, focusing on a specific thing she is doing or how she appears. Giving your wife one genuine compliment a day can show her that you continue to be amazed and in awe of her.

Channel your temper into relaxing and calming activities.,
Listen and respond respectfully to your wife during a disagreement.,
Take a time out if your temper gets out of hand.,
See a therapist.",How to Be Nice to Your Wife3," If you tend to get upset or fight often with your wife, you may want to learn how to channel your temper into other outlets. This could mean doing a relaxing or calming activity when you feel your temper starting to get out of control. Maybe you enjoy retreating into your garage to work on your car or spending time doing woodworking. Find an activity that you can use to de-stress and focus on rather than yell or get upset at your wife.You may also want to consider taking up a relaxing habit, like deep breathing or meditation. This way, when you feel your temper starting to rise, you can use a relaxation technique to calm down. Doing this can prevent an argument with your wife and allow you to get some perspective so you can approach the issue nicely and calmly.

, Many married couples have disagreements, sometimes on a day to day basis. But it is important that when you do argue with your wife, you focus on listening respectfully and thoughtfully to her, even if you do not agree. This will foster healthy, positive discussions, rather than out of control, shouting matches.Maintain eye contact with your wife during a disagreement and do not interrupt when she is speaking. Try to let her finish speaking before you speak and show her you are listening by acknowledging what she has said.
Avoid belittling or talking down to your wife during a disagreement, as this will only lead to more conflict. Instead, focus on how you can reach a compromise and how you can support your wife, even if you do not agree with her. Use “I” statements when you speak so you are taking accountability for your thoughts and feelings. For example, “I feel that you are late often and this makes me upset,” or “I think you may have a spending issue.”

, Whenever you feel you are reaching a breaking point during a disagreement, you should walk away and take a time out. Go to another room and take a breather by doing a calming activity or tell your wife that you need a moment to collect your thoughts and go for a walk. Taking a time out will allow you to think about the disagreement and process your emotions so you do not say things to your wife that are unkind.


During your time out, you should also brainstorm possible solutions for the argument and ways that you can reach a compromise with your wife. This way, when you talk to your wife again, you can present several possible solutions to her and move towards a resolution to the argument.

, If you struggle to be nice to your wife on a constant basis and feel as though your disagreements with her are putting the relationship at risk, you may want to consider getting professional counseling. You may see a therapist for anger management on your own or ask your wife if she would be willing to see a couples therapist together. Getting professional help can get better at being kind and appreciative to your wife and at expressing your emotions to her in an honest and productive way."

Take a picture of the test and upload it to your computer. Set it as the background image.
Tell your husband that you have not been feeling well all day. When he is somewhat distracted, tell him you are going to take your temperature. Come back and tell him you need help reading the thermometer and place the positive pregnancy test in his hand.
Ask your husband to sign a birthday card for a friend. Hand him the positive pregnancy test instead of a pen.;
, Give your husband a special gift to mark the occasion of telling him your news. A personalized present may heighten the surprise and anticipation as you tell him—especially if he’s not expecting it—and may also give you a special memento of the day.Make a custom t-shirt with cute, short message. You can make the t-shirt for anyone: for your husband, a tee with the word “dad” would work. You could also get a shirt with “bun in the oven” or a shirt for one of your other children, if you have them, that says “big brother” or “big sister.”You could purchase keepsakes such as a silver cup or silver teething ring. You can write a special message in a card that says “in a few months, we can engrave this with the newest member of our family’s name.”
Consider something that your husband loves and incorporate that into a gift. For example, if your husband loves hiking, buy a small pair of hiking boots and backpack and say “for your new hiking partner.”
Purchase a small ceramic piggy bank and write “Baby’s College Fund” on it.

Tell him with a dessert. Bake or buy a cake with the message such as “congrats, you’re going to be a dad!”

, Purchase a beautiful card or some nice paper and compose a letter or note from your baby to your husband. It doesn’t need to be long or elaborate, just fun, warm, and to the point.


You don’t necessarily need to buy a baby card. A plain card can help heighten the surprise.
Send the card in the mail so that your husband doesn’t have an idea what’s in the card. You may want to consider having someone else write it so he doesn’t recognize your handwriting.
Write something like “Dear Christopher, I can’t wait to meet you in eight months and I know mom is looking forward to enjoying new adventures with both of us.” Sign the card “your baby.”

, If you have a pet or other children, let them break the happy news to your husband. This may catch him off guard and make him even more surprised or may also make another funny memory.If you have a dog or cat, you could place a small placard around their neck to announce the news.You could also find some type of toy that your dog or cat can present to your husband that will clue him in to the new arrival.Have one of your other children tell your husband. It can be a very simple message such as “mom says she’s having another baby” or another phrase that plays on your child’s personality., You can buy some type of signage to tell your husband the news. You can go big and bold via a billboard, or get something small like a “baby on board sign” for your car.


Make sure the sign is commensurate with your husband’s personality. For example, if you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while and your husband is outgoing, you could put a billboard up on his daily commute so that he’ll see it when he least suspects it.
If your husband is shy or you don’t want to broadcast your news to the world just yet, you can get a discreet “baby on board” sign for your car. Either place it in the car or nonchalantly around your house so he finds it.

Make that sure that he reads his fortune and gets the surprise! You may even be able to purchase fortune cookies specifically with the surprise that your husband is going to be a dad. Many companies offer this kind of product.

, Borrow baby paraphernalia from a friend or pick some up at a local store. Scatter the items all over the house while your husband is at work. When he comes home, let him figure out what’s going on or allow him to ask you before sharing the great news.


You could get toys and stage a “playroom” scene in your living room. Try bottles or baby food jars in your kitchen for a similar effect.

, Buy a few inexpensive items that hint at your pregnancy and place these around your house. Hide yourself and leave a note for him to point you to your hiding place so that you can deliver your good news.


Scatter the items around the house for your husband to find with clues at each stage. Hopefully, he’ll figure out your message before he finds you!

Convey your excitement to see your spouse.,

Remind them why you wanted to marry them. Include something specific, such as, “I knew I wanted to marry you when________.”
Articulate your appreciation. Include something along the lines of, “I deeply appreciate you and everything you do for us.”

, When you're looking forward to seeing your spouse again after a day at work or a trip apart, be sure to show and articulate that excitement. Though you may want to avoid approaching them with the exuberance of the family pet, be sure to greet your spouse as soon as you're reunited with both verbal and physical affection.Keep it simple if you want, but be sure to greet your spouse after time apart.

Be honest.,
Communicate.,
Do your part.,
Seek emotional maturity and take responsibility for your actions.,
Don't brush your wife off.,
Don't show her even the mildest forms of contempt.",How to Be a Great Husband1," In a mature relationship, honesty is the best policy. It may be difficult, but the truth will allow relationships to breathe. No matter what happens, no one can ever challenge the fact that you are truthful, which might mean that the other person also gives you the same respect. If something doesn't suit them let them know, otherwise they will not trust your opinion. But make it sound like a compliment.


Suggest an alternative and attach praise to the alternative. For example, if they ask you if you like something they are trying on (trying on, not already wearing at a party!) let them know that it might work but you think the blue one is your favourite so far because it shows off their great (insert a feature you appreciate, preferably not one that they are self-conscious about).
It's not going to be easy to be honest and kind at the same time, so focus on learning how to give a feedback sandwich and you'll both be better off.;
, Do not talk her ear off; however, make sure that if you have any problems that will affect your mood, she is made aware of the reasons for your problems and mood, so that you do not appear to merely be a fickle and cranky creature. Zone out everything around you when you're talking to her. If you ask her a question, ask because you really want to know. For example, ask her what type of movies she enjoys, or about one of her favourites.


If you know it, talk about it a little bit in an honest way, what you thought of it, and make a guess at why she might have liked it. Even if you are wrong, your mate will usually love the fact that you are interested enough to try. Remember, the opposite of talking is not waiting, it's listening.
Make sure you're actually listening, not just waiting for your turn to talk. Put off a vibe that tells her that she can tell you anything. Make her feel safe.

, Don't make her ask you to pull your own weight around the house. This makes her feel like a nag, and it creates an adult/child relationship. Which is never good. She is your partner not your mother. Show her she can count on you to get things handled.


Clean up after yourself (figuratively and literally). Loving husbands know that anyone can father a baby, but only mature men who understand and accept responsibility can be a good fathers.
Do it yourself or be a good helping hand. Great husbands refuse to make anyone do anything they themselves are unwilling to do. Helping your wife doing tasks or chores will gain you great respect from your wife if your consistent and willing.

, Responsible people honor their commitments, accept their duties and are accountable for damages they incur, debts they owe and claims they make. It's part of growing up, a man steps up to the plate, while a boy complains or criticizes.


Make some sacrifices. Mature people make some sacrifices for the people they love and care about even if they would rather have it easy.

, People often find it exasperating when they get the feeling their partner treats them as an inferior in a relationship. Women are no exception. A lot of people have been taught that the only way to get attention when their partner is trying to ignore them is to act more emotional and be louder until the partner finally surrenders and pays attention to her even if in annoyance.


If people feel they're being given the cold treatment by people who are supposed to be important to them, they get worried. Especially when it happens without you giving an explanation for why this disturbance has occurred. People aren't mind readers. Your mate is not likely to be able to guess that you're cranky just because they wouldn't let you do something that they felt was very trivial, whereas you found it important.
If you know that your mood might lead you to overreact, simply say ""I'm feeling really irritated right now. Can we talk about this later after I cool off a bit?"" (Don't forget to follow through and actually give her your time later.)

, Contempt is poison in a relationship. You don't have to act like you like what she said or did, but do not take on an attitude of superiority, even subtly in passing, such as momentary smirking, sighs of disgust or eye-rolling. Such gestures, though seemingly insignificant, deeply show a lack of support, respect and trust, especially over a period of time.


The way you naturally act towards her should subtly validate her as a person, even when you do not understand or agree with her. Giving eye contact when she has something important to tell you shows respect; not giving eye contact shows disrespect and that you don't care about her or what she has to say. This will destroy any attempt to communicate well.
If you show contempt in front of your child(ren) they will then feel that is an appropriate way to treat their mother. A son may feel he can treat his mother with contempt if he witnessed you treat your wife that way.

Being aware of this along with inherent changes can help your husband prepare himself mentally.For example, most women don’t want to have sex in the initial months after giving birth—and some don’t even want to have sex during pregnancy.

Include codes for more meaningful messages too, such as “I’ve got your back” and, of course, “Just reminding you how much I love you.”

, Shoot to catch them during a tedious task, to supplement a normal part of their day with a romance-induced smile. For instance, if your spouse eats eggs every day, draw silly faces on every egg in the carton with a non-toxic marker.Silliness is the key here - it can be incredibly gratifying to make your partner smile, or even laugh, for no reason whatsoever.

, Face it: flowers aren’t the most original romantic gesture. You don’t want to be sending flowers for every birthday, anniversary, and hallmark holiday. Only send flowers occasionally, on days they’ll never see it coming., Mornings tend to be a whirlwind of preparation, responsibility, and hustle. Start your day together less seriously, with a playful pinch on your spouse’s booty, or a dramatic, drawn out kiss.Say good morning. Even better: “Good morning beautiful.”
Give goodbye kisses like you mean it. A quick kiss can certainly convey affection, but a dozen seconds of locked-in lipping sends a far more romantic message to your spouse."
"
Beat your spouse to the chores.,
Get up and make the coffee.,
Remember to hold hands.,
Articulate your support on tough days.",How to Be a Romantic Husband3," In a partnership, you share the responsibilities for doing the household chores. Doing the dishes and cleaning the bathroom aren’t that fun, but they need to get done. Before your spouse gets home, take care of everything – both the chores you usually do and those they do too.Declutter the bedroom. If you don’t have a bunch of time but want to increase the comfort of your shared space, spend a few minutes tidying up the bedroom.
Make it sexy. It’s not 1955 - forget the old “have dinner ready when they get home.” Sure, you can have dinner ready, but strip down to your skivvies and get a head start on the dishes so they come home to an especially exciting scene in the kitchen. Dinner can wait.

, This requires absolutely no explanation; if your spouse drinks coffee, this act of daily necessity will go straight to their heart in more ways than one.Go the extra step and do something for your spouse that will help them get ready for the day. Waking up to a loving gesture from a partner sends a powerful message about how much you care about them.

, There’s really nothing like it - both in terms of romance and support. Whether on a walk around the block or just sitting in front of the video entertainment system, grab your spouse’s hand, give it a heartfelt squeeze, and hold it for a while.Though hand-holding can simply be a subtle romantic gesture, it also tangibly tells your spouse that you're there for them. Alternatively, quietly hug your spouse when you're know they're struggling.

, If your spouse has been stressed lately, or you know they’re up against a particularly challenging task, offer your support with a text or email.Keep it short and sweet, so as not to distract them. Just let them know they have your support.
Thank them too, for their support when you’re going through a rough patch. Say something like, “Hey, thanks for being there for me right now. It’s been rough – but being with you makes it all better.”

Prioritize your partner.,
Be her greatest supporter.,
Take care of your relationship.,
Be romantic.,
Keep your sex life invigorated.,
Give gifts as a surprise.,
Give what she needs.",How to Be a Great Husband2," She is the partner you have chosen: treat her as such. Talk with your wife and set clear expectations about what decisions you can make without each other, and what decisions must absolutely be discussed. Ask her opinion when in doubt with ""Let me talk this over with my other half.""

, Be someone she knows that she can always count on. Be there for her when she has had a long day. Listen to her with attentive eyes and ears. Back her up and ask if she needs you to protect her, both physically and emotionally. If you have done something to hurt her, even if you didn't mean to, tell her you are sorry and show her affection. This must be sincere! There's nothing worse than an ""I'm sorry"" that is put on or phony.

, Your wife may not need ""taking care of"" - but that doesn't mean you can't still care for her, and for your relationship and family. Your wife may feel overwhelmed with kids and work. Help out; cook her favorite food or make her favorite drink. Help with the kids and help around the house (like doing dishes). Wives aren't superwomen as much as you'd like them to be.

, What ""being romantic"" means varies widely from person to person, but at its core, romance involves doing something to express affection in a meaningful yet unexpected way. A true act of romance requires creativity and sincerity, often inspired by love (either its presence or its possibility). Reintroduce the excitement that characterized the beginning of the relationship. Do something different, something that your wife wouldn't expect. The more out of the ordinary, the better.


Treat your wife like they're single, like you're trying to earn her affection and trust. The opposite of being romanced is being taken for granted. No one wants to feel like they've already been ""caught"" and it's over and done with.
There are millions of ways to say ""I love you"" and ""I'm lucky to have you."" Think of the world as your medium. You can write it, say it, sculpt it, look it, hide it, shout it, paint it, kiss it, fold it, grow it, touch it, and express it in unlimited ways.

, Kiss her goodbye in the morning like you don't want her to leave. It gives her something to think about all day. Be romantic. Suggest new ideas. Ask what she likes. Be willing to put her pleasure ahead of yours. Talk about it. Intimacy (emotional and physical closeness) is important to women.

, Anyone can buy a gift for a birthday, Christmas or an anniversary. Listen to her when you are out window shopping, and if there is something she likes, and it's within your price range, remember it and surprise her with it when she least expects it, for no reason at all. Or pick something up on your way home from work, and tell her you were thinking of her when you saw it. It doesn't have to be big or expensive - a book you know she will like, or a CD of her favourite band are nice gestures.

, Ask her for what she needs to feel loved by you. If she needs you to give her compliments, learn to master the art of compliments. If she needs to you to come home on time, be on time. If you know that you are going to be late coming home, call her and let her know. If she needs you to help children with homework, spend time with the family instead of going out with your friend, or spend a quality time with her, give it to her. Being married is being of service. You give your wife because you love her. True giving is to give what the other person needs.

Let your family take care of you sometimes.",How to Be a Good Housewife," Try to make healthy meals, to keep your whole family feeling their best, as well as keeping yourself healthy and strong (so you can deal with all the challenges in your day!). If you don't know how to cook, try to learn!


Plan ahead, with the aim to have a delicious meal on the table when anyone who needs a meal gets home. It is often said that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, and it is absolutely true in many cases. Microwave meals are not always suitable cuisine, so find a recipe book you like and start experimenting.
Having a great meal ready is a good way to let anyone know that you have been thinking about him and are concerned about their welfare. A good meal can be an expression of love and a warm welcome for the returning household.;
, Do your best to make your home a clean and pleasant place to live in. Having a clean house can reduce everybody's stress and make things run much smoother. Prevent the constant search for the misplaced keys and the annoying dirty-dish odor by staying on top of the household chores.

, Laundry is stressful and time consuming, plus leaving it around can make your home stinky! If you want to reduce your household's stress, help out by keeping the whole family's clothing clean. With some careful planning, you can easily fit it into your day. You can even get the kids to help you fold!

, You are like a general and your family are your troops. You have to keep everything running smoothly! Create schedules for cleaning and how you'll get through your days, in order to help everything run better. Scheduling time is a great way to make sure more gets done in your day, since you'll find yourself wasting much less time!

, Get a head start on your day to make everything go more smoothly. Oversleeping will only make you more tired anyway. Getting up earlier will make sure you get everyone's lunches made and everyone dressed and ready to go without all the stress and scrambling to find that missing backpack. 

, Everyone in your family should come home to a healthy, empowering, uplifting environment. Do your best to make sure that everyone's spiritual and emotional needs are being met, including your own, to make your home the best home it can be.

, Discuss realistic expectations, and how to meet them as best as you can. Do not presume that you have the same expectations because you may find out the hard way (through arguments) that you don't. Sit down and talk it over.


The definition of a good housewife depends on which house you live in. It is also very culture-dependent.
What are the things your partner is hoping you will keep up with in the home? What are their responsibilities in the home? If you are primarily responsible for keeping the house clean, your partner may take responsibility for cleaning up after him or herself: putting dirty laundry in the hamper, putting dishes in the dishwasher, etc.
If you are also caring for young children or special needs children or adults during the day, you may be surprised by how difficult it is to also keep up with household tasks. Your partner may need to help significantly with the cooking and cleaning, if possible.

, It is all too easy to stop paying attention to your appearance when you have are a busy housewife but maintaining attraction is a key element of a long-term relationship. While it was important to keep a good appearance during dating/courtship, it is even more important in a married relationship, or any committed relationship. Make sure you're bathing regularly and wearing clean clothes. This is really about showing your partner that you still respect yourself....and you should respect yourself enough to take care of yourself!


If your partner often tells you they like it when you wear a certain garment or outfit, by all means, take the hint.

, It is important for your partner to still have control over their personal situations, like choosing their hobbies, their meals, their clothes, etc. When you are home a lot, it can be easy to want to take control of everything your partner does in the home, but this may not be their preference. It's all right if you want to give your input in a polite way, and of course fine if they asked you. Otherwise, let them have space, just as you want yours. You are two separate human beings, always remember that.

, A good partner listens to what her spouse has to say without interrupting. Show empathy and learn how to have great conversations. The key idea is that to be a good conversationalist, you should strive to listen more and talk less, by engaging the other person to talk more about his interests. That is the mark of humility, respect, selflessness, and generosity.


This will also set a good example and they should also listen to you more!

, Nagging never works, and will only serve to irritate your spouse. Not speaking your mind is just as bad. Husbands are not tyrannic creatures: if you find a balance in arguments, and take turns to speak, things will surely improve. Just remember to respect each other, and things will go much better.


Some arguing is normal. Don't worry if this happens. You are different people and you will disagree sometimes! Just handle the arguments in a healthy way and everything will be okay.

, Don't criticize him in an nonconstructive, cruel, or nagging way. Whatever your image of the 'ideal' man may be, everyone is unique in his own ways, so try to respect that. Before you try to improve others, try to improve yourself first. If you find things disagreeable about him, let him know in a mature, sensible and loving way: chances are that he will agree on some things and/or explain others, plus it will build trust between both of you and save unnecessary conflicts.

, A healthy sexual relationship is extremely important for relationships to succeed long term. This does not necessarily mean having a lot of sex, but instead means that both partners should be satisfied with the amount and quality. Talk out your expectations and become a better lover if you can. It never hurts, and will only help to learn more about the sexual side of marriage.

, People need space and alone time every now and again. While you have time to yourself during the day (while the kids are at school or asleep), your husband doesn't have that and may need some alone time to unwind when he come home from a hard day at work. Be available to spend time with him and comfort him, but if he wants to spend time alone or with his friends and not you, take a step back and let him have his way.


Help him unwind more by welcoming him home with a big smile and allowing him to relax. Have his favorite meal and drink ready, and let him relax after a tough day of work.

, Set up fun, educational activities for your kids or for the whole family. You can do some research and then do a guided tour of a museum, or you can go on a hike and teach everyone about the natural features you encounter.

, Show everyone you know all of the hard work you do by hosting block parties or holiday parties every now and again. Make some great food, decorate your home, and set up fun activities. This will let everyone bond and have a great time!

, If you really want to go above and beyond, take your home decorating skills up a notch and try to get that magazine look in your own home. This will give you and your husband something to be proud of, as well as creating a great environment for your kids.

, Help your husband arrange activities for himself, like a fantasy football group or a bowling night. This will help him unwind. A happy husband makes for a much less stressed wife. Let him choose his own activities, of course, but make sure he knows that you think it's healthy for him to get out of the house sometimes. Not everything is about work!

, It is easy to get caught up in your work and barely leave the house all day. This is a good recipe for the blues. Find some weekly activities (local libraries are a good place to look) that will get you out of the house at least once a day. If the afternoon rolls around and you realize you have not been out, go for a stroll, hang out at a bookstore or coffee shop for a half hour, or call a buddy and meet for tea.

, It seems pretty basic, right? But housewives can often get so busy that they forget to make time for their friends and maintain those social relationships. But if you create an environment where your husband is your only friend, you'll find yourself talking his ear off! Spend time with your own friends (by having lunch dates or weekly meetings) to keep everyone happy.

, You need to do things that make you happy too. Have something that is just yours and that gives you the opportunity to do something productive or creative that doesn't involve your home. This will give you an important emotional outlet. Try taking up productive hobbies, like sewing or cooking.

, Just because you may not need a degree for your job doesn't mean that you can't get better educated! Learning is fun and will make you feel more productive and self-confident. You don't even have to go to an actual school. You can read a lot of books (find them at your local library!) or you can take online classes for free through websites like Coursera or MIT Opencourseware.

, There are lots of jobs that you can work from home if you have some extra time. This will give you a way to contribute to the household and will also give you something to be proud of! You can open a home daycare or petsit, or even do things like data entry or run a travel agency. There are lots of options!

, You work hard and your family should occasionally help by bearing some of the load. They will probably want to do this naturally, but you can also have a set-aside one day a month where they do all of the things you do. This will have the added effect of making them appreciate the things you do more.

Be secure in yourself through keeping Christ's Spirit in your marriage.,
Choose joy in your married life: J.O.Y.,
Learn to pray fervently and effectively.,
You can have a long, happy Relationship by being cheerful, positive and confident with the husband, if he is ""thoughtful"".,

Help him to feel comfortable in showing simple verbal and courteous affection without it always leading to sex: begin this helpful guidance in public with public praise for courtesy and kindness by showing that you are thrilled by that attention; smile, slightly giggle and say something like ""flattery will get you everywhere,"" and try ""playing tag"" sometimes, or playing ""keep away;"" having fun--and being alluring and a little bit coy when there is no chance of going too far, ie: in front of his in-laws, at the store, and such.,

Accept him and especially his little mannerisms and habits.,
Be modest in public: as such a woman is a lady.,
Always be quick to forgive, quick to repent and quick to believe:

Quick to forgive.,
See the best in your husband and in life.",How to Be a Good Christian Wife in Traditional Marriage," Plan to have family worship, sing spiritual songs and have quiet time with Christ together, worshiping God and developing your walk in Christ. Be sure to study the Bible and to praise God for your opportunities and for giving you your very life. Have a personal relationship with Jesus. Anything that goes wrong pray to Him and lean not on your own understanding. Proverbs 3:5;
, is based upon loving ""Jesus"", ""Others"" and then lastly, ""Yourself""-""but not least,"" as the Bible says you are ""to love others 'as you love yourself'."" So love yourself as much as you love others and then you have the winning concept straight from Christ! This, for example, also means do not try to directly control your husband or other people (try gentle persuasion). J.O.Y. also means that you should not judge wrongly or harshly, but you will forgive yourself and others.

, The Bible says: ""Stay in a habit of attending church regularly"" with your husband or alone (or with girlfriends), if necessary. ""Pray for each other."" Pray together and ""pray without ceasing"" and ""honor Christ in all you do and say""... Our physical lives are in Christ and spiritually ""His life on this earth is in us and we are in Him."" He is ""at the right hand of the Father in Heaven where He is always interceding for us."" (Romans 8:34)

, Criticizing and putting yourself down to your husband or in front of him in public is a way of insulting his taste in women. Realize that if he is with you, it's because he chose you and wants to be with you. He finds you sexy enough, even if you don't feel like you are; so be there for him. Remember that attitude and willingness are important parts of feeling and being sexy. Poor self-esteem leaves a hole in your life that is terrible for your marriage. Make sure you continue to actually have occasional fun and help each other have an interesting life together, not just trying to control each other or only teasing about fun. Tease nicely, and mean it. Have a sense of humor.

, Will you still have girlfriends you see at least once a week, your special church group that you go to, full days and busy evenings? If you were not whole, your husband would always have to be trying to fill a hole in your life. Well, it's one that he won't ever fill, and you might both feel inadequate and unhappy, if you can't keep yourself up with friends and family as well as busy cheerfully serving Christ.

, Except in case your husband reads minds, don't expect your husband to just know what you want. If you want or need something, ask and discuss it together. Don't just drop hints and figure that he'll get it and ""come around"" without communicating calmly, clearly and directly. If something is wrong for you, say so. Christian friendships and relationships work best when each partner calmly expresses their current emotion -- without harping on what the other did. Frequently, a ""I feel confused"", or ""I feel sad"" is all it takes for him to step back and ask, ""Why?"" Then simply say, ""When you slammed the door, I felt ignored (or insulted)."" Let ""I feel..."" be your key word. Avoid saying ""you""--as in ""you made me sad."" Say ""'That' made me feel sad."" Take responsibility for your own needs and feelings.

, He needs to keep trying to do well, and you need to keep trying also, but neither of you will ever be perfect. Unsatisfied expectations frustrate everyone. However, if you both continue to work on your marriage, you will always be involved in each others lives, even when one of you comes up a little short. If your expectations are truly too high, very idealistic or unrealistic, you should set standards that are obtainable. For example, it is unfair to expect to be lavished with possessions. Have the love of your life at home; staying home, try having home cooking at several meals per week versus going out to eat junk food instead.

, Also, should you want more together time, be prepared to have that desire fulfilled with some effort, washing clothes and cleaning house together and relaxing together.

, Nagging and nitpicking can destroy a relationship. As long as the dishes get clean and are unbroken, for instance: don't nag about how you want the dishwasher loaded--the ""the right way"". Let him do such things his own way. Don't sweat the small stuff. Focus on what is more important and don't be a complainer. Maybe explain the theory as you show him how you believe it needs to be done one time and then leave it alone.""Wives, place yourselves under your husbands' authority as you have placed yourselves under the Lord's authority.""(Ephesians 5:22) but only so far as he is not doing crimes, is not cruel or actually abusive (not the blame game...) to you, the children or other persons.

, (Ephesians 5:25) If your husband is not showing love, do not demand attention or affection. Just ask cheerfully for some help and pick a time to give a playful or sexy hug and kiss: he may respond well, if he's not angry--or unless it is not the right place and time.

, This affection and fun will carry over to when you have the chance and the time in private.

, Be willing to try some innocent, new things (or even suggest/approach it affectionately without asking) and discuss them - don't just turn down fun and harmless play when he suggests something you don't feel is appealing immediately. This may make him feel rejected or that you are not having fun. At least be willing to discuss it nicely, and perhaps try it, but never do anything you are uncomfortable with after discussing it with him. Also, don't be afraid to discuss anything you might be interested in. Physical intimacy is as important to a marriage as is ""emotional intimacy"". Nurture them both.""Do not deprive each other of sexual relations, unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer. Afterward, you should come together again so that Satan won't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control."" (1 Corinthians 7:5)

, Accept him as he is, so that you have such deep respect and gratitude for him that you would never want him to change for you. He has so much to offer you, if you give him the space to be himself. He is a growing individual, just like you are. Help him grow in the direction that he chooses, and give him the chance to help you similarly.

, ""And that women may be dressed in simple clothing, with a quiet and serious air; not with vanity about her hair and gold or jewels or expensive clothing;"" (1 Timothy 2:9) Encourage your husband to expect you to be modest in public and erotic in private with him. There is much temptation that results from women feeling as if they need to turn other men on and to show their sensual side in public. One thing may lead to another. Avoid immodesty.

, Your spouse is not perfect and he will at times upset you, or even hurt your feelings. When this happens you have a choice to make; you either harbor offense and let your heart become hardened, or you can remember how patient and forgiving God is with you and forgive your husband just as you have been forgiven by The Lord.






Quick to repent. Just as your husband is not perfect neither are you. The Bible says that ""God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble"" (James 4:6) It is so important in your relationship with your husband and with God that you be willing to humble yourself and ask for forgiveness when you are wrong, or have acted in an unloving way.






Quick to believe. 1 Corinthians 13:7 says, ""it (love) always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.""







, Don't simply focus on the bad about your husband, but see him the way God sees him; focus on the attributes that you love about him and always believe and compliment him, such as: ""Honey, God is working in your heart, and so you are becoming more like Christ everyday."" The trick is to believe this even when it doesn't look like it! That is real faith in action, believing God can bring it to reality even when you don't see it.

This is an android app which is incredibly stealth.",How to Tell if Your Wife Is Cheating," If your wife begins to distance herself from your side of the family or from friends of yours whom she once got along with, it could be a sign of guilt.If your wife gets along with your family and friends, she will understand that more people will be hurt by the affair than just you. This will make her feel guiltier, so she might avoid the situation as often as possible.
Cheating wives can also worry that your friends and family will be able to tell that something is happening even if you do not pick up on the clues.
In some instances, your family could even be part of the problem. If your wife does not get along with your family and you often take their side over hers, she might feel as though she has no allies amongst those who care about you.;
, If she suddenly starts spending considerably more time running with social circles that don't include you, this could be another bad sign. Even if she claims to be hanging out with her female friends, this might not actually be the case.


Understand that an occasional girls-night-out can be both normal and healthy, so you do not need to worry if these nights are fairly infrequent.
These can be a bigger problem if your wife puts these nights above her relationship with you, if her story changes about who she goes with and where she goes, or if you are unable to get in touch with your wife while she's out.
Even if your wife is genuinely meeting with other female friends, there is some chance that she is using them as emotional support and confiding to them about personal issues she may not talk to you about. This might not be a sign that she's cheating, but it is a sign that there are problems in your marriage.
If she tells you she is going somewhere and you suspect she is heading out to meet another man, offer to go with her. If she ""changes her mind"" and decides not to go, it could be a sign that she was indeed trying to get out alone to go spend time with someone else.
If your wife disappears for hours at a time and simply claims to have been shopping, show an interest in what stores she visited, or what things she looked at, especially if she returns home empty handed. Many women love to discuss shopping trips, so if you get an elusive response, it may be an indicator that she was spending time elsewhere.

, Women generally feel a stronger need to talk about new and exciting things happening in their lives, even if they need to keep the news a secret. If she starts talking about a new friend, that new friend might be more to her than she intends to let on.


Keep in mind that your wife might give you a fake name to throw you off. If she talks a lot about her new friend ""Samantha,"" she might actually be describing her new friend ""Samuel,"" and providing you with a woman's name just to avoid raising your suspicions.

, If your wife frequently drank or smoke, then you might not notice much of any change. If she never had any interest in alcohol and cigarettes before, however, and suddenly begins smelling of either one, she might have a partner in crime who taught her those new habits.


Even if your wife does indulge in the occasional drink, pay attention to when you smell alcohol on her. If you smell it after she came back from what should have been a late night at the office, or smell it on her at odd times like the middle of the afternoon, there could be a problem.

, Your wife might claim to be spending more time at work, but if she was never much of a workaholic before, this change could indicate that she's spending those extra hours outside of the office after all.


Any excessive amount of time she spends away could be bad news. For example, if a trip to the bank, grocery store, or hair salon takes twice as long as it used to, she might be doing something other than what she claims to be doing.
Consider trips she makes out of town without you that are not business-related. If she frequently goes to visit relatives alone, she may be visiting more than just relatives especially if she stays in a hotel at night rather than at the relatives home. If she tells you she stayed in a hotel, casually ask her which one, and then watch for the charges to appear on your credit card statement; if there are no charges, another man may be providing a place for her to sleep at night.

, Take a discreet peek at your wife's receipts and credit card statements. A dramatic increase in the amount of money she spends could suggest that she's been spending her money on someone new.


To the same end, consider checking her car mileage. If you notice that she is driving more miles than she should if she were going to the places she claims to be going to, then she might be driving out to see someone she should not be seeing.

, You might get suspicious if your wife suddenly distances herself from you, but if she suddenly becomes inexplicably more affectionate toward you, that could be just as bad a sign.


A cheating wife can pay more attention to you as a way to ease her guilty conscience. If she devotes more attention to you when the two of you are together, she can momentarily make herself feel better about what she does when you aren't around.

, This can be a bit tricky, since many women naturally spend a lot of time on the phone. If your wife suddenly spends more time talking or texting, though, or if she hangs up as soon as you enter the room, these habits could suggest that she's talking to someone new in her life whom she does not want you to know about.


Try asking your wife about the phone calls she receives, especially if she leaves the room to take them or quickly hangs up when you walk in. Gauge whether or not her response seems truthful or if she is trying to make an excuse for who was on the other end of the line.
You should also pay attention to other changes in her calling habits, including the frequency of calls, time of day, and tone of voice she uses., Many husbands may already think that their wives nag them, but if your wife has becoming even more critical of your behavior than usual, she might be looking for ways to justify the affair to herself.


If your wife suddenly acts as though nothing you do is right in her eyes, there are considerable problems in your relationship, even if your wife is not cheating on you.
On the other hand, it could also be a bad sign if your wife ""nags"" at you less. If you have given your wife good reason to stop nagging by improving the traits she often criticized you for or by being more attentive, less nagging can be great. If you have not changed your behavior, though, and she becomes less critical of you, it could be a sign that she has become indifferent toward you, which could mean that she's getting emotional fulfillment from another source.

, You might expect your wife to show less interest in you sexually if she starts cheating on you. While this can be the case in some instances, just as often, wives will seem more interested in sex than before.


Wanting more sex can be your wife's way of alleviating the guilt she has for cheating on you.
If your wife wants more sex, it could also be a sign that she is having an emotional affair and using you to satisfy her sexual desire for a man she cannot have in bed.
On the other hand, if you had a healthy enough sex life before and the flames suddenly die out between you, it could indicate that she is fulfilling her sexual desires with someone else.

, On instinct, humans avoid eye contact with others when they feel guilty or when they have a secret to hide. Try to make eye contact with your wife throughout the day. If she is cheating, there is a good chance that she will turn away more often than not.


This is especially important when you ask her about where she has been, who she's been with, and what she has been doing. Since she will need to come right out and lie to you if she does not want to admit to cheating, she will find it much harder to look you in the eye than she normally would.

, Nowadays, the computer is used as a means of communication just as often as the phone is. If your wife spends more of her evenings on the computer and becomes defensive when you ask about it, she might be sending emails or communicating via social media with someone she hopes you won't find out about.


Take a glance at your wife's Internet history when she is not around to see. If her history has been erased, consider that to be red flag and a sign that there was something there she did not want you to see.
Remember that cell phones are the most commonly-used computer. Ask to see her phone. If she is defensive, it could be a sign that she is hiding something there. If you do have access to the phone, consider applications that might indicate cheating, such as Ashley Madison, Tinder or other dating apps. Social apps like Skype, Snapchat, Kik or WhatsApp may be ways that she is hiding her communication with another man, especially if the history in these apps is always deleted.
Review the cell phone bill. Most carriers provide detailed calling records. Look for unfamiliar numbers that are dialed or used for texting frequently. Consider using reverse phone lookup services such as spydialer.com to get a name and location for the phone number.

, As a general rule, if your wife suddenly begins sharing fewer details about her day and her thoughts, she might be hiding something or getting the emotional support she needs from another source.


Women are rarely secretive unless they have a good reason to be. They are generally more inclined to open up about their thoughts and feelings than men are, and while husbands may hold back in an effort to avoid what they perceive as ""nagging,"" wives rarely demonstrate the same behavior.

, The longer a couple stays married, the more both spouses tend to let themselves go. If your wife suddenly dyes her hair and spruces herself up, she might be trying to make herself look good for someone new.


Women usually try to look their absolute bests at the start of a new relationship, so if your wife is suddenly making considerably more effort in terms of her appearance, it stands to reason that there might be a new relationship in her life.
Note, however, that there is some chance that your wife could be doing this for your benefit. If she senses a lack of heat or chemistry between the two of you and wants to remedy the problem, she might try to make herself seem more appealing to you.

, Take a good look at what she brings home in her shopping bags. If she buys new clothes in excess, she might be trying to show them off to someone—especially if those clothes are revealing or if she buys more lingerie.


A big sign can be if your wife is buying sexy lingerie but not wearing them in your bedroom, or if she is buying attractive clothes but never wearing them in front of you.

, If your wife takes a sudden interest in shaping up even though she never showed much desire to do so before, she might be trying to make her body look more appealing to a new guy in her life.


Understand, of course, that this is not necessarily a dead giveaway. She might genuinely be trying to get herself in shape for valid reasons, especially if her doctor has recently informed her about possible health risks, if a favorite dress no longer fits, or if the new year just started and working out is on her list of resolutions.

, If you rarely see her shower at home anymore and she frequently claims to have showered at the gym, there is some chance that she might be showering at another guy's place and using the gym shower as a cover.


A cheating wife will often shower before she greets you at home to cover the scent of the other man.

, Most spouses get accustomed to the way their counterparts smell. If your wife smells “off” or like a brand of men's cologne you do not use, she might be in close contact with another man.

Take her to your house and watch a movie.,
At the end tell her very gently.,

, Try to have as much tact as possible since this is an extremely delicate subject. You know your friend very well, so try to avoid anything that may discomfort her even more: like trying to lighten the atmosphere with a joke, or being too negative, etc, it all depends on how you know your friend will react.

, Tell her she is too good for him, try to make her see how wonderful of a person she is and that nobody like that deserves her tears. And most of all, make her see it wasn't her fault. Nobody should be blamed but the cheater. Don't let her take the blame and remind her that if there was a problem he could have very well talked it out instead of doing what he did.

, It is very hard to forgive being cheated on, but with a little gentle help everyone can do it in time. Don't push her to forget immediately and talk her out of revenge (and of course don't give her any ideas).

, She has her reasons, and even if you don't approve you're her friend after all, not her mother. Respect her decisions and be there for her.

, If you know what her favorite food is then go ahead and cook it for her. Things we like trigger endorphins which make us feel better, and her feeling better will help her cope better.

, Sometimes having his things around helps her cope with the process of accepting, sometimes it helps her see things she didn't see before. Give her time to get rid of everything, and help her through the process. Being gentle and patient is a must.

Question what your man is telling you.,
Make his phone your best friend.,
Check to see if he has social media or snap chat.,
Check if he takes his phone with him to the bathroom and safe guards it all day.

,
Does he go to sleep and let his phone die so that he won't have to worry about you going through it while he sleeps?,
Check and see if the numbers in his phone are really the people that he has them saved under!,
Consider, does he always stay on late at work on certain days and is he always picking up shifts supposedly?,
Find out if he goes to the bars every week.,
Put an old cell phone in his car or tape recorder under their seat in their car and they will never know that you are listening to their conversation.,
Don't drive yourself crazy and go commando on them.,
At the end of the day, you decide what you want to do but remember a man will disrespect you only if you allow him to!,
Remember, to catch a player, you have to be a player"".

",How to Spy on Your Man," Some men are liars and will lie to your face, consistently they think that they can always get away with it! To find out the truth, you can spy and then you can decide whether to make or break your relationship. Once you accept the fact that you are being lied to and that your man is sneaky and devious, you can move on.;
, Believe it or not but some men have everything on their phones! Check to see if there are any apps downloaded on his phone that look funny or fishy. You would be surprised that an app that looks like a game can really be an app for hidden text messages and stuff! So keep that in mind and an have an eye on what is downloaded on his phone!

, You know that there may be nasty girls who will send pics of themselves naked to him privately and you wouldn't know. Like Instagram now has the direct message thing where they can send private pics back and forth. You should check out who has been sending him messages.

,, If he does that all the time, you can make the assumption that he IS hiding something. If he he leaves it around only once in a blue moon, it could be because he has deleted everything and he isn't worried.

, Keep mental notes of the phone numbers because for all you know, he has his friend James, for example, in his phone and its really Jennifer!

, You need to check on that because they can pretend to be picking up a shift so that you would not be suspicious if they are gone all day! Get your butt in the car and you need to stake out! You even get a chance to see who he is going out for lunch with.

, You can almost guarantee that they are getting numbers, not saying all the time (depending on much of a POS that he is) but they may be flirting and getting numbers! They make excuses and blame it on the liquor. Don't accept lies from your man.

, You never know who they are talking to on their way home from work or anywhere!

, Just make sure that you pay attention to the small details that they think you aren't paying attention to! You don't want to live on a lie and so don't waste your time anymore and move on with life. That way you don't have to worry about any of this.

, When you forgive them are back with them and catch them again, they will make it seem like its your fault by saying ""Well, you stay with me so why shouldn't I cheat?""

Be sure.,
Get firm evidence.,
Consider what you know about the relationship.,
Weigh the pros and cons.,
Put yourself in your friend’s shoes.,
Avoid telling other mutual friends.",How to Tell a Friend That His or Her Partner Is Cheating1," Before you jump the gun and start dialing your friend to tattle, make sure what you saw was actually cheating. You’ll stir the pot for no good reason if it turns out your friend’s partner is simply having lunch with a coworker or a distant relative. Carefully evaluate what you saw just in case you are reading into something completely innocent.Was there hand-holding, hugging, or kissing involved? What about the interaction makes you think your friend’s partner is cheating?;
, If you are absolutely sure the interaction falls under the category of infidelity, get proof. You may not have to use this. But, it’s better to have proof, just in case you decide to share the info and just in case your friend doesn’t believe you.


You might take a picture or record a video of your friend’s partner with their illicit lover.
Be discreet, if you decide to do this.

, You must be willing to acknowledge the idea that your friend and their partner have an open relationship. Such relationships, in which both partners agree to date other people, are becoming increasingly more common. You could be assuming their partner is cheating, when they actually have permission to see other people.Some people in open relationships have an understanding between one another but may not share the dynamics of their relationship with family or friends. Your friend may be perfectly okay with their partner dating someone else--they just may not have told you about it.
Sticking your nose in their relationship business could put both you and your friend in an awkward position.

, Consider the ramifications of sharing what you know. You might automatically feel like telling is the “right” thing to do, but it may not be what’s best for your friend. Spend some time pondering the ups and downs of telling them.Make a pros and cons list that outlines the positives and negatives associated with breaking the news to your friend. A pro might be “She’ll know her partner’s unfaithful.” Cons might include “She’ll be angry at me for delivering the news” or “She is already fragile from being cheated on in the past. The news will ruin her.”

, Another way to make this decision is by using empathy. Ask yourself what your friend would do if they were in this position. Consider what you know about your friend, their personality, and their beliefs.Are they a champion of being honest? Do they have trouble believing anything negative about their partner?
Use what you know to consider how your friend might respond to the news and whether telling is the best decision.

, Your first impulse may be to call up another pal and tell them what you know. You may not do this to spread gossip necessarily, but to get their advice. Don’t. It may feel good to share the burden with another friend, but it’s disloyal. Avoid discussing your friend’s personal business with anyone else who knows them or their partner.Talking to another mutual friend could start the rumor mill. It may also create drama if your friend decides not to act on the information.

Look for excessive blinking.,
Make eye contact.,
See if your spouse is scratching excessively.,
Watch your spouse for fidgeting.,
Glance at your spouse's swallowing behavior.,
Watch for combinations of these signs.One of these behaviors alone does not mean your spouse is lying.Just because she takes a sip of water when you ask her a hard question, you cannot assume she's being dishonest — she may truly be thirsty.",How to Tell if Your Spouse Is Lying1," This may occur when you start talking to him about an uncomfortable topic. If you are talking to your spouse about something he is lying about, he may start to panic. Occasionally the lying spouse may actually slow down his blink rate going into the lie and speed it up afterwards.Blinking frequently can be a reflex in this case.
For example, you might ask your spouse, “Did you send the plane ticket to my mother for the holidays?” Perhaps he is lying about having a good relationship with your mother and didn’t send the ticket. So an increase in blinking during the conversation may occur.;
, If your spouse avoids or overly tries to make eye contact then she may be lying about your current topic of discussion. A liar may avoid eye contact, but she may also try to overcompensate for lying by establishing eye contact for too long. Use the eye contact behavior as a gauge in conjunction with the other behaviors.You may ask your spouse, “Did you lose my high school trophy?” She could lie and say no while avoiding your gaze, but also stare you down while denying it.

, A sudden increase in scratching by your spouse during a conversation can indicate lying. This is sometimes an indication of heightened nervousness. The scratching may occur anywhere on the body.For example, you may ask your spouse “Are you going out drinking again?” He may scratch his head and deny this.

, This is a common indicator of lying. Your spouse may fidget in place, shift her feet, touch her face, or rub objects around her. She may also become suddenly very still.For example you may ask her, “Did you go to the casino with your paycheck again?” And she may shift in their seat while denying it.
Another example may be you asking your spouse, “Do you want to meet me for dinner tonight?” And she agrees, but doesn't mean it—meanwhile she is fondling some jewelry on her person while answering you.
If your spouse is concentrating on her lie, this takes more energy and focus than telling the truth, which may cause movement to cease or be suppressed., If your spouse is swallowing in gulps or drinking a lot he may be lying. Changes in saliva production can be a biological response to lying. The saliva change can be an over-production which will result in excessive swallowing or gulping. The change can be an under-production, which would result in more drinking.An example might be you asking your spouse “So, another late night at work with the new boss?” He may swallow hard when denying it or take a sudden drink of water.

, Instead, watch for clusters of these signs. If she is fidgeting and avoiding eye contact, and you pick up some verbal cues as well, that is a better indication of dishonesty than only one of the behaviors."
"
Wait for the right time.,
Do your research.,
Write down your thoughts.",How to Talk to Your Spouse About Wanting to Move1," Timing is important in life, especially when you want to talk to your spouse about something they may not want to do. Try to find a time when neither of you are stressed out, when you’re both relaxed and calm, and in good moods. Waiting until the weekend when you are both decompressed from work is an ideal time.


The best time to approach the subject is when it is just the two of you. Attempting to convince your spouse to do something in a group setting or when others are around may seem like you are trying to put them on the spot and make them be agreeable so they won't embarrass themselves in front of others. Your spouse will likely become defensive and may even feel betrayed. Instead, begin the conversation when you’re having a nice dinner or when you are relaxing on the couch.You might say something like, ""Can we get dinner tonight? There's something I'd like to discuss with you.""
If your spouse is a football fanatic and there's a big game on that night, then it might be a good idea to talk the next day. Choose a time when neither of you will be distracted and can focus.;
, Determine why moving to the area would be a good idea for your spouse. Try to find selling points that would work in your spouse’s favor. Having this information handy when you bring up the subject could help you to convince them of the move.Perhaps your spouse doesn’t like the weather where you currently live, and your ideal location has temperatures you believe they would like. Or maybe the jobs are better in that area.

, You can go into a conversation feeling prepared, but if you receive opposition from your spouse, you might forget all of your mental prep work. To prevent this, write down your reasons for wanting to move. Your notes can serve as a check list of subjects you want to cover during the conversation.


It may be helpful to write down your spouse’s responses to each of your topics. Doing so allows you to come back to the list and think about possible solutions for your spouse’s apprehensions, should you have another conversation about moving."

Look for over-the-top gestures of generosity or kindness.,
Decide if you feel guilty when others do nice things for you.,
Identify any inequalities in your relationship.,
Consider whether your spouse is purposely making you feel obligated.,
Ask your spouse to talk with you.,

Compromise.",How to Stop Feeling Indebted to Your Spouse," Some people frequently shower their loved ones with favors and expensive gifts. These “over-givers” are often driven by a sense of inadequacy or a need for attention, and they may not realize they’re making others feel indebted. It’s natural to feel awkward or uncomfortable when you’re on the receiving end of this kind of generosity, especially if you can’t reciprocate.For instance, if your spouse surprises you with lavish gifts for no reason or insists on doing all the housework even though you both have jobs, they might be an over-giver.;
, If you’re used to taking care of everything yourself, or if you have low self-esteem, you might struggle to accept generosity or thoughtfulness from others. This mindset can make you feel like you have to “pay back” any favors or gifts you receive from your spouse.If you have a hard time letting your spouse help you out with chores, even when you’re tired or sick, you might be stuck in this mentality.
Try and ask yourself why you feel this way. Is there an experience in your past, such as a parent making you feel guilty when they did something for you, that may be the cause?
Remember that all relationships have give and take — you can't be the only one giving all the time. You must be able to receive from your partner as well.

, Does your spouse make significantly more money than you, or vice versa? Does one of you take on all of the household or childcare duties? A disparity between income, chores, or childcare responsibilities can make your relationship feel unbalanced, leading to feelings of indebtedness for one of you.You and your spouse don’t have to make the same amount of money and split chores or childcare down the middle to have a fair relationship, but it’s important to divide your responsibilities in a way that satisfies you both.
It is important that inequalities or differences are not used as leverage or retaliation. If your spouse makes more money and therefore pays more of the rent, they should not use this to make you feel guilty or inadequate.
Think about if your ideas about how things should be divided is rooted in what you learned from your family of origin. Was there an expectation that one family member would be the breadwinner, making it hard for you to share this responsibility with your spouse? It's important to explore how your family has impacted your idea of what a marriage ""should"" be.

, Guilt and obligation are two of a manipulator’s favorite tools. Your spouse might be trying to manipulate you if they often remind you of what they’ve done for you or if they use past favors to pressure you into doing things you’d rather not do.For instance, if your spouse says things like, “I work so hard for you, and you repay me by going to see your family and leaving me alone,” it could be an indication that you and your partner have some issues with manipulation that need to be addressed.

, Try to talk when you’re both in a good mood and don’t have any other time commitments. Choose a comfortable, private location.Bring up the subject by saying, ""Honey, I've been feeling like things are a bit unequal around here lately, and I want us to sit down and talk. Do you have a moment?""
If you have children, have the conversation when they’re in bed, at school, or with a babysitter.

, Let your spouse know that you’ve been feeling indebted to them. Give them specific examples of their behaviors that make you feel this way.Use “I” statements like “I feel…” and “I need….” Avoid using “you” statements, such as “You always…”, which may come across as confrontational.
For instance, you could say something like, “It’s really generous of you to give me so many presents, but it’s starting to make me feel guilty. I don’t have the money to buy you presents all the time, and I don’t want our relationship to be based on material things.”

, Tell your spouse what you need to feel comfortable in your relationship. Encourage them to share their needs and expectations as well. If you discover that you value different things, you may have to come up with some compromises to keep you both satisfied.For example, one person might say, ""It has always been important for me to have a big role in raising my children. Therefore, I would like to set an expectation that I start working part-time in order to be more involved with the children. Is this agreeable to you?""
Consider creating a list of relationship guidelines that both of you can reference.

, If you think your relationship is unbalanced, bring your concerns up with your spouse. Ask them what makes a relationship fair in their eyes. Work together to brainstorm ideas for making your relationship more equitable.Your brainstorming sessions can eventually lead to developing your relationship guidelines. Doing this together can enhance your relationship.
If you have trouble identifying what a fair relationship looks like for each of you, or if you don't know how to create the balance you need, it could help to see a marriage and family therapist. These types of mental health therapists have special training to work with families and married couples. Attending therapy can help bring greater equality and reciprocity into your marriage.

, Ideally, you and your spouse should split up your responsibilities so that both of you feel satisfied with your contributions. Talk with your spouse about how you want to handle bills, budgeting, cooking, and other tasks.For example, if your spouse works full-time and you work part-time, you might decide to take on the majority of the cooking.

, If you feel uncomfortable with some aspect of the relationship, or if you want to try dividing your responsibilities differently, let your spouse know. Encourage them to do the same if they’re not happy with an aspect of your partnership.You might say, ""I need a bit of time to myself each week after work and family responsibilities. Can we look at our schedules and carve out an hour or two of me-time for both of us each week?""

, Try transforming your feelings of indebtedness into feelings of thankfulness towards your spouse. When they do something nice for you, allow yourself to just appreciate their kindness, instead of feeling like you have to return the favor.Learning to accept kindness is especially important if you’ve had a hard time allowing people to do things for you in the past.

, Compromise is an integral part of every marriage, especially if you and your spouse have different ideas about what makes a relationship fair. Identify the situations that tend to cause conflict or make you feel indebted, and work together to find alternate ways to handle them.One of the best methods to compromise is weighing the importance of the issue between spouses. For instance, if one spouse enjoys cooking while the other doesn't have an issue with cleaning, you can divvy up chores so that each person is doing the task they prefer. Then, you simply divide the tasks neither of you care for. It is best to take turns with these.

Know when to leave.,
Leave when planned.",How to Stop a Verbally Abusive Husband," You can't change his behavior, but you can prevent your own feelings from plunging you into depression. If this happens often, you probably go right from hearing the abuse to feeling bad. Think about the step in between — your belief about what happened and why. Chances are, the reasons for what happened are not specifically about you, but about the frustration and rage of your husband. Make it about him rather than about your perceived failings. Try thinking to yourself:He was mean to me about how long I took in the bathroom — I shouldn’t feel bad about taking the time to shower and put on makeup. He can easily use the other bathroom.
He refused to eat the food I had cooked again. He said it looked gross. But this isn’t about my cooking — it’s about him wanting to make me feel bad about myself. I’m not going to do that.
He told me I looked fat in my new outfit. I know that I don’t. He just wants me to feel insecure.;
, To get yourself ready to engage with your husband, figure out how you are feeling and how you can explain those emotions to your husband. Are they healthy — sadness, disappointment? Or are they unhealthy — beating yourself up for not being good enough, anxiety, self-hatred? Work on moving your reactions toward the healthy category and decide how you want to express those feelings to your husband. Think about the following kinds of questions:How do I feel about him making fun of me and my friends and how we like dumb movies? I shouldn’t care. It’s sad he can’t be happy for me that I have good friends.
I am disappointed he won’t come with me on a hike even though he made me feel bad about going without him. I don’t want to spend another Sunday cooking and cleaning for him — he would just be mean to me about it anyway. I need to get some time away from his negativity.
I am good enough for my husband. He says that I’m not, but it’s really about his own insecurity and problems at work.

, Because he is the one creating the problem, he is the one who needs to change. It's probably going to take a lot more than making him think about his words, but you can put the idea in his head. Sometimes just by making it a big deal rather than being silent or moving past verbal abuse, you can start to make your husband realize what he’s doing. Keep calling attention to his words. Sometimes they might just be belittling, rather than screaming and name calling — it’s all meant to put you down, and you shouldn’t have to deal with it. Some ideas for doing this are:“When you make fun of the way I look, it makes me feel bad. Could you try to not do it anymore?”
“When you get mad at me about the laundry not getting done on time, it makes me feel upset and anxious. Maybe you could help me instead of getting angry about it?”
“Telling me that I am stupid all the time makes me feel like I am. I know that I’m not stupid, so please don’t call me that.”

, Sometimes just by responding rather than ignoring him you can help change the interaction. Keep in mind, however, that this often does not solve the problem. Verbal abuse often follows a script, and you can disrupt it by engaging:”Stop talking to me that way.”
”I want you to write down what you said to me so that I can keep it and read it back to you later.”
”I’m walking away from this conversation. When you are less angry we can talk.” (Don’t do this if it will escalate the situation.)

, Verbal abuse isn’t rational. You are not going to be able to get to the root of it on your own, and he will probably not want to discuss the reasons for it anyway. Realize that it is irrational and don’t even try to reason out why it is occurring.Don't attempt couples counseling — it's not a good idea for an abusive relationship., When your husband becomes verbally abusive, tell him that you will not deal with it anymore. Explain that you have chosen to set limits on what you will hear from him, and choose not to hear abusive words. If he continues, you might want to leave the room, unless you believe that will lead to escalation. Turning your back and doing something else would be another choice to show you are setting limits. You also need to let him know that you are considering leaving for good if he doesn't decide to change., Let your husband know that you don't have to stay in a relationship that is damaging. Also keep in mind that verbal abuse can lead to physical abuse, and you shouldn't put up with abuse of any kind. Be ready to leave if you think this is a possibility. Formulate a plan for yourself if it becomes necessary to leave at a moment's notice. You might want to include:Money you have set aside, separate from your husband’s.
A bag with identification (like passports), Social Security card, clothing, medications, banking information, legal documents (car title, marriage license, birth certificates) that you can leave with a coworker or person that your husband will not know.
If you’re taking children, have their birth certificates, Social Security cards, immunization records, clothing, medications, and identification cards (if they have them).

, It might include family, friends, or coworkers. You need people to talk to about your situation. Even though it can feel like you bring the verbal abuse on yourself, you need other people to help you check those reactions and understand that it’s not your fault and that the abuse is irrational.

, Verbal abuse is not something anyone should go through alone. Finding a good therapist to hear your story and formulate other ways to deal with your situation can be extremely helpful., Verbally abusive relationships can be codependent, with both partners having little outside contact. It’s difficult to leave a relationship if you have no friends or family close. Make a plan for yourself if you don’t have a strong support network. Maybe staying in a hotel for a while would be an appropriate response — whatever it is, you need to feel like you don’t have to physically stay with your husband if the verbal abuse becomes too much., As satisfying as you think it might be to call your husband the names he might call you, don’t do it. It won’t help your relationship to descend to his level., If he is willing to seek help and therapy, then there’s hope. If he is unwilling to work on changing his abusive attitude, it’s best to work on leaving the relationship, if only for a brief time until you can agree on some kind of therapy program., As satisfying as it might be to make a hard and fast deadline — if you call me names again, I’m leaving forever — think about what’s realistic. Will you stay when he is working on changing his behavior? At what point will you give up and leave? Share your plan with your support network so they can help you if it becomes necessary to follow through with your exit plan., It’s usually impossible to fix an abusive relationship. Don’t keep threatening to leave then stay — go when he steps out of bounds you have discussed. Reach out to family and friends with information about how to contact you and that you are leaving.


Change your cell phone number and give it out only to trusted friends and family, asking them not to give it out.
Delete any search history with research about your leaving on shared computers. If you are worried about retaliation and anger, leave a fake trail. Do internet searches for towns hours from where you plan to be. Write down phone numbers of motels in that town (where you won’t be).
Go to a safe place that you have set up beforehand — shelter, the house of someone your husband doesn’t know, a hotel.
Communicate with your husband through a note you leave at home and let him know you have left and the steps you will be taking (restraining order, divorce, etc.) Let him know a family member or friend he can contact to reach you, but warn him that he will not be able to talk to you directly.

Choose a time when you and your friend are alone.Instead of breaking the news in a public place such as a restaurant that may feel like a fishbowl to your friend, go somewhere private like a park bench or a quiet courtyard.

, You might ease into the topic by asking your friend how the relationship is going. Starting here may also give you an opening to bring up the infidelity.


For example, you might say, “How are things with you and Brittany?” Use your friend’s response to determine how you approach the subject.
If they believe things are good, you might say, “Hmm…Well, maybe I misread the situation…”
If they admit things have been rocky, you might say, “I’m sorry to hear that, but that’s why I wanted to talk to you…”

, Be forthright and considerate when you divulge that your friend’s partner is cheating. Use a soft, caring tone. You may also take your friend’s hand or rub their shoulder as you share the news.


It may be appropriate to say something like, “This is really hard for me to do, but I felt a duty to share this with you. I saw Hank with another woman the other day. They were having lunch in the city.”

, Don’t automatically assume your friend wants to see proof. They may need to process the news before being forced to see pictures or watch a video. Let them know that you have it, if they’d like to see it.You might say, “I couldn’t believe what I was seeing so I took a picture. I have it, if you’d like to see.”

, Your friend may be overcome by a lot of emotions once you share the news about the cheating. They may associate these feelings with you and try to get distance. It may be smart to go ahead and call out what you think they might do and ask them not to.For example, you might say, “We’ve been friends for years, so this was really hard for me to do. I don’t want to see you hurt, but it wouldn’t feel right to keep this from you. I know you might want to push me away or “shoot the messenger.” Please, don’t. Whatever you decide to do with this information, it’s up to you. But, please let me be here for you.”

Assume your friend may distance themselves.,
Vent to an unbiased friend.,
Perform self-care.",How to Tell a Friend That His or Her Partner Is Cheating3," Even if you plead with them not to push you away, your friend may still do so. They may want space from you, as the bearer of bad news. Plus, if they choose not to leave their partner, they may prefer not to be reminded of the cheating by seeing or talking to you.Signs of avoidance might be that they stop answering your phone calls or constantly be ""busy"" when you try to make plans.
Expect that they might react this way and know that there isn’t anything you can do about it.

, It may help to talk the situation over with someone you trust after you’ve told your friend. You might decide to do this if you are hurt by their reaction towards you or if you simply need advice about how to move forward. Be sure to choose someone unrelated to the situation who doesn’t’ know your friend or their partner., Be gentle with yourself and keep in mind that you did what you thought was best for your friend. Don’t beat yourself up if they seem to resent you for telling. Take some time to nurture your physical and mental health and well-being.This can be a very stressful situation, so be sure to get plenty of rest, eat nutritious meals, and get regular exercise.
You might also perform calming activities like visiting a spa, meditating, taking a warm bath, reading a book, or going for a hike outdoors.

Catch the inconsistencies.,
Ask an unexpected question.,
Ask for details.,
Listen for unease.,
Talk to a witness.",How to Tell if Your Spouse Is Lying2," This is the most basic verbal method for telling if your spouse is lying. Try to use logic. If a person hears an unexpected loud noise, then he will look towards it. So if he says they ran away without looking at all—he is probably lying. This can be difficult if you don’t have all of the information regarding the situation your spouse may be describing.For example if you ask your spouse “Did you come straight home from dropping the kids off at school?” He might say he did. Later you notice the car’s odometer is reading double the mileage it should for the day without it having been used again. That would be an inconsistency.
A more verbal inconsistency might be you asking your spouse “Did you buy tickets to the concert today?” The spouse may say yes, but you knew couldn't have because the news said it was already sold out.

, Another name for this is “tripping them up.” This is more useful if you suspect your spouse has told several lies. You want to catch her by asking her something that is now impossible or embarrassing because of her dishonesty.One example of this might be for a spouse that has repeatedly hidden bad financial investments from you and lied about it. You could try asking her, “Let’s go to the bank and ask the agent to provide us all the tax forms.”
Another example could be for a spouse that is habitually lying about hanging out with friends late at night so you tell her “I’ve gotten us two tickets to the theatre tonight.”

, Notice if you get too much detail or rambling from your spouse. If your spouse is in an uncomfortable situation, or one he feels guilty about, he may have over-thought how he will get out of it. A lying spouse may ramble on and on about what he was doing, where he was, and who he was with if he put a lot of care into the lie to cover his tracks.An example might be you asking your spouse why he is three hours late to your dinner date and he answers something such as, “I was driving in rush-hour traffic, there was an elderly lady crossing the street, an ambulance had to get by, construction blocked the road, and it was down to one lane on the bridge…”

, This can manifest as hesitation in the voice. This may be a sign of anxiety from your spouse for lying. If there are a lot of pauses in the speech patterns of your spouse then this can be an indicator of lying.An example of this could be you asking your spouse about where she has been all day and she lies with an answer such as, “Oh, I…um… have been…. Um… with my friend Jane.”
Lots of pauses in speech or stumbling may suggest lying because it takes more mental energy to maintain and tell a lie than simply tell the truth.This is especially true if the person is asked a more complex question — she will need time to formulate an answer that is consistent with her story., One way to catch your spouse in a lie is to find someone else to contradict his version of events. You need to be careful with this method as the witness is also capable of lying or being inaccurate. It may be helpful to talk to multiple witnesses to get more consistency in an answer. If you ask only one co-worker then she may say your spouse was there—but could be covering for him. However, if two or more co-workers all say your spouse was there, then this is most likely true.


For example you may ask your spouse if he was at work during business hours like he claimed to be. Then you can ask witnesses, in this case co-workers, if your spouse was telling the truth.
But if two or more witnesses claim your spouse was lying then you know with more certainty this is the case.

Discuss the advantages of the situation.,
Talk about the cons.,
Problem solve.",How to Talk to Your Spouse About Wanting to Move2," After you have thought long and hard about your reasons for wanting to move, it's time to have the discussion with your spouse. You have good reasons for wanting to move. Being open with your spouse about them could sway their thinking. When laying out your reasons, take care not to act like your way is the only way; doing this could cause them to shut down and not leave any room in their mind for negotiation.


Be sure to mention every advantage you can think of. These can include better schools, shorter commute to work, being closer to family or friends, or a safer neighborhood. If you want to move to a smaller home, bring up how your mortgage or rent is likely cheaper each month, how you’ll pay less for utilities, and how you may not have to do as much yardwork.If you and your spouse have long-term goals, talk about how moving can help you achieve them. For instance, paying a lower mortgage can help you save for early retirement, or moving closer to your extended family means your parents can help watch your kids, saving you money on daycare and babysitters.

, If you want your spouse to be open-minded about what you want, you also have to be open-minded as well, and this includes recognizing any possible downsides to moving. Without arguing or interrupting, let your spouse voice their concerns. Perhaps your spouse wants to stay for sentimental reasons, or doesn’t want to have to go through the stress of selling and buying a home. These are all valid reasons for wanting to stay, and showing that you understand that moving has its drawbacks could help your spouse realize you are willing to listen and validate their hesitation and not strong-arm them into doing what you want.No one wants to feel like they aren’t being heard or that their opinion doesn’t matter. Assuring your spouse that you get them and why they are hesitant to move shows you are supportive. This usually leaves the opportunity to discuss the matter further, instead of your spouse shutting it down immediately.

, Once you have heard your spouse's concerns, see if you can address them together and problem solve. If you have done your research, it may be easier to do this For instance, your spouse may be worried about crime in the new neighborhood. Having the statistics on how safe the area really is can help resolve the issue. It may also be helpful to take a break and discuss the move with outsiders, such as friends and family, who may provide a unique perspective.

If your spouse is nervous about moving away from their parents, for instance, you might say, “I understand that you’re reluctant to move because you don’t want to be further away from your parents. I think we can work out an arrangement so that you can still be there for them even if we don’t live as close as we did before,” then work on a plan together that includes moving and doing what your spouse also wants to do.This shows your partner that you hear them and are taking their concerns seriously.

"

Involve your spouse in the planning.,
Take a trial run.,
Work out a compromise.",How to Talk to Your Spouse About Wanting to Move3," Perhaps your spouse doesn’t want to move because they don’t want to be steamrolled in the decision-making process. You can combat this by including them in all of the planning. Not only can involvement help them feel like they have a say in the situation, but it may also make them more excited about moving.


Allow your spouse to look at homes with you, scout out neighborhoods, and choose design options. They may find that moving presents them with better choices when they are able to see what the home and area are like., If you want to move to a new city, state, or even country, plan a vacation there. Being immersed in the area may help your spouse to change their mind when they see what the new environment has to offer. Choose activities that will highlight the location and find things to do that your spouse likes. Planning your trip out ahead of time to include what your spouse will enjoy could make all of the difference in the world.


If you are able to, rent an apartment in the new location for a few months. This allows your spouse to really get an idea of what it would be like to move there. You may find that they like the new area because of this, or you may even discover that after living there, you would rather not move at all., If you still can’t come to an agreement, at least try to come to a compromise. Suggest renting your house out for a year, and moving to your ideal spot until the lease is up. If your spouse still isn’t happy, make an offer to move back into your home. However, if your spouse is willing to try out a move for you, you must be good on your word and move back if they don’t love the new location.


To make the agreement even more official, put together a contract of sorts. Include that you agree to live in the new home for a year and you will move back to the original home if you aren’t both happy with the new place. Having a document such as this may make your spouse feel more confident that you will, in fact, move if they don’t want to stay after a year."
"
Remember that whilst your marriage may not have traveled down the path that you wanted, or expected, that you are not to blame yourself, and a marriage is rarely ever of one sided blame.,
Remember that you are not alone.,
Remember who you are.,
Last but not least, do not forget that you are worthy of love and WILL find love again.,
DO not use your failed marriage as a guideline of comparison to other things in your life, no matter how tempting it may be, this is not and will not be the beginning of a string of failed attempts and sabotaged opportunities.",How to Stop Being Emotionally Needy After a Long Marriage,"


Take some time out to think about all of the factors that led to the destruction of your marriage, not discounting the things you or your partner did wrong, as to not indulge in self guilt/blame, but also not harbor feelings of harsh anger or resentment toward your partner, in an attempt to fault them for it all.
A lot of the time, the feeling of 'neediness' is born from feeling that we are not good enough. When you remind yourself that you are not solely to be blamed,and your contribution alone could not have been the sole premise of your divorce ,you will begin to understand that you ARE good enough, and are worthy.;
, Yes it is true that you are now beginning life away from somebody whom you have spent a lot of time, and built a future with, but they were not the only person who loved you.


One of the main things in marriages, are the merging of two people, and or sometimes isolation of other family members and friends. This could be classed as one of the primary reasons, divorce can be such a lonely and daunting time, as the realization sets in that without your ex, you are standing by yourself This however, is untrue.
This is the perfect time to reconnect with old friends, find yourself retrieving numbers of past acquaintances that you always wanted to meet up with, but couldn't quite find the time since you were always planning weekly trips with your husband.
Reunite with single friends you may have neglected in attempts to accommodate your newly married life, you may feel as if those people have long forgotten you, but it is never too late to retrieve that little black book!
Also, don't forget that family are there for a reason! Use them as MUCH as you can! We sometimes forget that no matter how old we get or how far we move from home, our family will always be there to love, comfort and adore us, use this to your full advantage! Surround yourself with family members, retreat back to your old town if you have to, take solace in the people who will always cherish you, plan family days out, treat the ones you love. You may be feeling needy because you are NEEDING lost comfort, NEEDING lost love, NEEDING reassurance, all of these things you can find within the people who love you the most.

, Whilst in a marriage most of your identity seems to merge into a dual 'hermaphrodite' persona. You and your partner dissolve into one big character, and develop traits of each other's habits, some we may like, and others not so much.


Now, is the time to remember who you were before the marriage and what you loved about yourself! Much of the neediness you will be feeling delves around you feeling desperate to find yourself outside of a relationship you were in for so long.
Instead of projecting your confusion into desiring company or contributions that distract you from rediscovering yourself, take the time to write, begin a journal, write down questions you're confused about, and go back to it a few days later, and try to answer it.
You will find that a lot of the things you are requesting answers for, can be found within yourself, if you just take the time to listen to you. Trust you again.

, Just because this marriage did not work out, does not mean that everything you commit a substantial amount of time and effort to will not work.

, See this as a fresh start, a new conquest, and do not rush into seeking solace in the environment of anything that seems draining and daunting.

Make an effort to figure out what went wrong.,
Figure out if what went wrong is something fixable.,
Open communication with your spouse.,
Seek out a marriage counselor (optional).,
Test the waters for change.",How to Save a Marriage1," You can't move forward if you don't know what's keeping you back. Most relationships — and people — suffer from a few flaws, and perhaps those flaws are getting in the way of a healthy relationship. Your job is to take a long, hard look at what you think went wrong. Here are just a few:



Growing incompatibility. Work, family, stress, finance and everything else our modern world throws at you can cause people to reveal their true colors. Are the real-world husband and wife very different from the fairy-tale version?

Infidelity. Is the guilt of an affair weighing on you or your spouse? Did confession cause everything to suddenly blow up?

Lack of communication. What you say doesn't get processed by your spouse, and what your spouse says doesn't get processed by you. Maybe neither of you says anything at all.

Death of a loved one. You or your spouse's world changed irrevocably after someone close to you died, and you can't go back to the life you had before.

Money. Someone is a spendthrift and the other is a penny-pincher, and the twain never meet. Or maybe growing financial insecurity is making home life bitingly negative.

Sex. If sex is a physical symbol of your love for one another, the wilting of that symbol can be both emotionally and physically saddening.;
, It's a perfectly natural response to try to save your sinking ship, but what if the ship is so tattered that it isn't worth saving? No one can make this decision for you, but know that certain flaws in people or relationships might not be worth trying to save.


Know that people rarely change. People often say they'll change, but they rarely do. After they're comfortable, they usually revert back to the people they were before. It's not impossible for someone to change wholesale, but it's unlikely.

, Get information from them about how they think the relationship can be improved. When bringing up this difficult conversation with your spouse, remember a few things:


Don't be accusatory. Accusing them of something will only burn bridges. Instead of ""I thought you were going to take care of that, which is why I'm angry it didn't happen,"" you can say ""We all know that no one's perfect. I just thought you were going to take care of that, so I was surprised when it didn't happen.""

Count to three before you answer. A lot of the time, our impulse is to fight back instead of hear what the person is actually saying. Count to three before you answer, thinking about what your spouse has said. Calm and composure on your end will produce similar results on their end.

, A marriage counselor, while expensive, offers highly nuanced insight into the clockwork of your marriage. A counselor might be able to identify what went wrong from an informed, but emotionally distant, place. Because the counselor has no skin in the game, so to speak, s/he is less likely to lie, to cut corners, or forget inconvenient facts. A marriage counselor might very well save your marriage.

, Is your spouse absolutely unwilling to bend? If so, it might be hard to create the change you want to see in your relationship. If you're unsure, test the waters to see if your spouse seems willing to make the necessary changes to save the relationship. Again, it's hard to help somebody who doesn't want to be helped. You can test the waters by:


Asking your spouse if they're willing to see a marriage counselor
Asking your spouse if they love you as much, if not more, than they did on your wedding day.
Asking your spouse if they're willing to sacrifice — along with you — in order to make the relationship work.

Find a good time to talk.,
Sit down and face each other.,
Discuss the conflict.,
Avoid pointing fingers.,
Listen actively.,
Compromise.",How to Resolve Conflict in Marriage1," Talk with your spouse when both of you are well-rested and able to focus. Don’t try to solve problems when one or both of you are distracted, tired, or hungry.For instance, if your spouse has just come home from work, give them some time to unwind before you bring up something that’s bothering you.;
, Stay calm by sitting down to talk, instead of pacing around the room. Make eye contact with your spouse.Making eye contact shows your spouse that you’re listening to them and care what they have to say. It also helps you feel more connected to each other.

, Tell your spouse what’s bothering you. Speak calmly and avoid rambling. If you’re arguing about an issue that seems minor on the surface, try to figure out what the underlying problem is.For instance, you could say, “I wish you would clean up the kitchen after you’re finished cooking. When you leave it messy, I feel like you don’t appreciate how hard I work to keep the place clean.”

, Don’t throw accusations at your spouse. This will make them feel defensive, and your argument could turn into a full-blown fight. Instead, tell them how you feel and what you think.It’s also a good idea to steer clear of the words “always” and “never.”
For example, instead of saying, “You never tell me when you’re going to be working late,” say, “I feel unimportant to you when you work overtime and don’t text me.”

, Keep an open mind as you listen to your spouse. Pay attention to their body language as well as their words. Make sure you understand what they’re saying by mirroring their statements.For example, if your spouse says, “I just need time alone sometimes,” you could mirror that statement by saying, “So you feel like you can unwind and relax best by yourself, is that right?”

, Work with your spouse to find a solution you’re both happy with. If you can’t find a compromise that works for both of you, try taking turns with your preferred solutions.For instance, if your spouse prefers to use the dishwasher and you would rather wash dishes by hand, try using each method on alternate weeks.

Understand how to create passion.,
Think about things that you feel passionately about.,
Understand why these things make you feel passionate.,
Make happy moments and happy memories.,
Understand what your answers mean.,
Use happiness to create passion.",How to Re Ignite Passion in a Marriage," Passion is a phenomenon that is created. It is not a spontaneous thing that just happens. In order to understand how to create passion, you must do two things. First, you need to understand why you feel passion. Then you need to understand how passion is created.;
, Do you have a job that you love? Is there a hobby you can't live without? Maybe you have a talent you live for.


Regardless of what it is, there are many different things in life that can make you feel passionately. It could be a wonderful career, or your brand new sports car, a young puppy, playing video games, painting pottery, dancing, pretending you're a superstar when it's karaoke night at the bar, etc. The list is endless. Take a moment and try to identify the things you have in your life that make you feel passion.

, Now that you have identified what it is that makes you feel this way, think about why it is that these things make you feel passionate. Why are you passionate about your job/hobby/talent/pet?


One thing you will notice about anything that makes you feel passionate is that this is something that makes you feel happy. Feeling passionate is a good feeling. Passions are often developed from feelings of love and happiness. It is the love and happiness we feel for these things that grows into a passion over time. Therefore, with time, it is possible for passion to become stronger.
Never give up hope when the passion in your marriage is dwindling. Remain hopeful that you will feel passionately with your partner again, starting with learning how to make each other happy.

, Learn how to make your partner happy and teach your partner how to make you happy. Any true passion thrives off of happiness. You need to take the time to understand your partner's wants and needs. Sometimes we can even be unaware of what our wants and needs are, so doing this can take a great deal of effort.


If you are having trouble figuring out what your own wants and needs are, then start by being honest with yourself. You can ask yourself and/or your partner the following questions to help you learn what your wants and needs are:

What do I want from my partner?
What do I need from my partner to make me happy?
What is making me feel sad and/or angry in my relationship?
What do I need to change in my life to create my own happiness?



, The first two questions will help you identify what you need and desire from a romantic relationship to feel fulfilled by it. The last two questions will help you learn how you can work towards making your relationship more satisfying to you.


After you answer the third question, take your answers and write down the opposite for each one. For example, if your partner's distance and lack of affection makes you feel sad, then for the opposite, you should write that closeness and affection from your partner makes you feel happy. Completing this exercise will help you identify exactly what will make you feel happier in your relationship with your partner. It will also help you identify what you want and need from them.

, Now that you understand more about how passion is created, try to use the things that make you happy and your partner happy to create it. Sometimes this means willing to compromise or make sacrifices. Always remember that you and your partner are two different people, who each feel passionately about different things.


Understanding how your partner is different from you and willing to accept this is a huge step. So for starters, don't be afraid to go out of your way to make your partner happy. Do something special just for him or her. It doesn't have to be something big.

You can start with the little things. If she loves chicken alfredo, take her to her favorite Italian restaurant. If he loves epic movies, go with him to the theater to see Lord of the Rings. Maybe she would appreciate it more if you helped her clean up around the house. Get out the dish soap and help her clean up after she makes dinner. Maybe he just wants to have his space and some free time to himself. Give it to him, and do something that makes you happy when you're not with him.
Here's the trick, though: Don't just do it, actually enjoy doing it. Remember, this is something you're doing for your partner because it makes them feel good! If you act resentful or annoyed about doing something to try to make your partner happy, your partner is not going to be very happy about it. When you do something out of frustration and anger, even it is to make someone else feel good, then the person on the receiving end just feels like they are the recipient of your incurred wrath.
Passion is not created out of wrath. It is created from happiness. If your partner needs you to do something you resent doing to be happy, like the dirty dishes in hell's kitchen, then just remember, you are doing this because you love, admire, appreciate, and respect your partner. Even if you can't feel happy about doing it, at least do it with a feeling of mutual respect.

Create a safe space for this communication.,
Don't use threats as a bargaining chip.,
Learn how to argue effectively, with humility.,
Say what you do and do what you say (and expect the same from your spouse).,
Learn how to celebrate the successes and commiserate the failures.,
Leave time for some time apart.,
Admit to your spouse that neither one of you is responsible for this lull in your marriage.",How to Save a Marriage2," A lot of the time, a marriage begins to fall apart because both parties forget to communicate, feel unsafe or embarrassed communicating, or think they're communicating when they're actually not. In order to encourage the right sort of communication, think about:


Setting aside a time of the day for you and your spouse to come together and just talk. No sex, no children, no TV, no work. Just talk. If you want to talk about your issues, talk about that. If you want to talk about your day, talk about that. Setting aside time to talk will grease the wheels and encourage deeper communication.
Let your spouse vent. Sometimes, your spouse just wants to get something off their chest: they don't want an analysis, they don't want direction, they just want a pair of ears and a shoulder to lean on.

, Often, threats are bandied about a failing marriage like horseshoes on the 4th of July. Threats don't mean you're a bad person, they just mean that you've learned a bad habit, one you should unlearn. The problem with threats is that they encourage people to do the right things for the wrong reasons: your spouse shouldn't want to save the marriage because you're threatening to leave them — your spouse should want to save the marriage because they absolutely, deeply love you.

, Arguments in marriage are bound to happen. The couples that survive and build on their love are able to overcome personal hangups, put themselves in their partner's shoes, and learn from their mistakes. If you want to save your marriage, both you and your spouse are going to have to learn how to argue the right way.


Don't dig up the past. It's really tempting to bring up what happened 14 years ago as a piece of evidence about why your spouse is undeserving or wrong. This misses the point: the point isn't to ""win"" the argument, it's to get your spouse to hear your point and possibly change their behavior. If you constantly dredge up old dirt on your spouse, they'll feel attacked instead of involved in a discussion. That's when the argument starts to go astray.
Don't use ad-hominem attacks. An ad-hominem attack is when you attack a person (their physical, emotional, psychological traits) instead of their ideas. Sometimes, a trait needs to be criticized and dealt with. But too often, it feels like a serious low-blow and causes more mudslinging than than coming together.

, A relationship is all about trust. Trust is gained when expectations are met, and when actions are followed through on. If you say you're going to do something, do it. A failure to follow through on your words causes your spouse to believe that your words aren't what you say they are. This leads to a breakdown in trust.

, Every life is filled with ups and downs, just as every person is filled with strengths and weaknesses. In a failing marriage, we too often use our partner's failures as a chance to secretly gloat and pass over our partner's success like we take them for granted. What more does a husband or wife want than to have their loved one be with them in times of despair and share happiness with them in times of joy?


If the idea of celebrating your spouse's successes and ruing your spouse's failures sounds horribly weird, take a step back and think about what you want to get out of your marriage. Most happily married couples admit feeling joy for their spouse when they're happy and feeling sadness for them when they're not.

, Falling back into love all over again is great, but sometimes that personal independence that we all yearn for gets lost along the way. Often, what we need is an hour or two of alone-time to engage ourselves in something that we absolutely love, whether it's gardening, fixing cars, or reading books. If one person in the marriage feels smothered, they're going to take that displease out on their spouse, and it's unlikely to lead to happiness. During your time of reconciliation, set aside time to do things you both love, to recharge, and most important, to reflect.

, It's tempting to blame everything wrong that's happened on your spouse without admitting that you were somehow also complicit. There's also space for admitting that you both shoulder blame and responsibility. The process of saying that to your spouse can mean a lot, helping you to reform your bond.


For example, it's unfair to say that your spouse never made dinner with the family a priority if you didn't try to work with them to fix that. You can say something like: ""You didn't make dinner as much of a priority as I would have liked, but I was guilty of holding that against you and not trying to work with your busy schedule to accommodate you when you were free.""

Rededicate your commitment by making it tangible.,
Switch up the environment.,
Try to go on a date.",How to Save a Marriage3," A marriage is also about commitment, a commitment that puts other people ahead of oneself. If you feel like rededicating your commitment to your marriage, consider making it physical or tangible to that your spouse can see that commitment. Gift your spouse a:


Ring
Picture
Flower or plant (something growing)
Meal
Work of art (made by you)

, Couples whose marriages are in danger often take trips, both faraway and close, because the monotony of life back home has them taking each other for granted. When the obligations of work, kids, and family go away, couples rediscover why they fell in love in the first place.



Note: a vacation can be a pretty poor litmus test of whether the relationship is going to succeed. A vacation is all play and no work. Going back to the familiar routine of work, family upkeep, and chores can cause the fairy tale ending to end very quickly.

, A loving marriage is one in which both partners still enjoy the thought of being with one another all alone. Some couples try to engineer a date night every week, others every couple of weeks. At the very least, try to plan a date night with just you and your spouse once a month. This should help reignite your passion for one another, as well as eliminating some of the more tedious responsibilities of everyday life.

Keep your cool.,
Focus on the issue at hand.,
Avoid hitting below the belt.,
Don't jump to conclusions.",How to Resolve Conflict in Marriage2," Don’t raise your voice, call your spouse names, or get sarcastic. Acting nasty will put a stop to any productive discussion you might have had. If you feel your temper rising, call a time-out and regain your composure before continuing the conversation.If you’re getting too angry to talk rationally, go somewhere by yourself and take a few deep breaths, or blow off steam by taking a walk around the block.

, Argue about one thing at a time. Don’t drag unrelated issues or old grudges into the conversation. Leave the past where it belongs – behind you. If you’ve already forgiven your spouse for something, don’t dredge it up again as ammunition for your current argument.For instance, if you’re arguing about how often to mow the lawn, don’t bring up an old disagreement about where your kids should go to school.

, Stay civil and polite. Some things, like name-calling or picking at your spouse’s insecurities, should remain off-limits during an argument. If you’re angry enough that you want to say something to hurt your spouse, step away and cool down by yourself.For example, if your husband makes a rash decision, resist the urge to call him ""stupid"" or ""an idiot."" Even if you feel it's true in the moment, it will only make communication and conflict resolution even harder.

, Give your spouse the benefit of the doubt. Don’t put words in their mouth or look for reasons to assume the worst. Make sure you understand what they’re saying before you answer them.For example, your spouse tells you they need some space and you assume they are trying to leave the marriage. Ask for clarification. ""Space"" could simple mean more time and room to think things over.
If something is bothering you, address it. Don’t spend time by yourself stewing over what may have been an innocent action or remark.

Avoid picking at your spouse for little things.,
Appreciate your spouse.,
Let your spouse make mistakes.,
Spend quality time together.,
Stay away from people who try to control your marriage.,
Avoid trying to win every argument.",How to Resolve Conflict in Marriage3," Learn to distinguish between real problems and minor issues you can ignore. If your spouse has a few habits that are annoying but harmless, reconsider whether you really need to argue about them.For example, if your husband likes to move some pillows to a different chair when he comes home from work, don’t nag him over it. Putting the pillows back is easier than fighting.

, Focus on your spouse’s good traits, both big and small, and don’t be shy about giving them a sincere compliment every now and then. When your spouse does something thoughtful for you, thank them.For example, you could say something like, “Thanks so much for making dinner when I get home late. That makes my evenings a lot more relaxing.”

, No one is perfect, and your spouse will make mistakes just like anyone else. You wouldn’t like it if someone held your past mistakes against you, so don’t hold your spouse’s slip-ups against them, either., Don’t let months or years of marriage make you lose sight of the reasons you married your spouse. Make a habit of going on dates, trying new things, and having fun together. Choose activities you both like, such as taking a stroll to enjoy the weather or working on a hobby you share., Don’t listen to friends or family members who offer you bad advice or try to influence you for the worse. If someone tries to meddle in your marriage, tell them politely but firmly that your relationships are your own business., Choose happiness over being right. We all want to win arguments, but needing to defeat the other person all the time will destroy your relationship. If you’re arguing about something trivial, or if you think you really might be wrong, let your spouse win the argument."

Join a genealogical society.,
Take a class.,
Buy a research guide.,
Subscribe to a genealogy website.,
Attend a genealogy conference.,
Connect with genealogists online.",How to Learn About Genealogy," There are genealogical societies for cities, counties, provinces/states and countries. Societies also exist for a wide variety of ethnicities, religious groups and special interest groups (like Internet genealogy). Nearly all of these groups, associations and societies offer newsletters to members with tips on how to effectively conduct genealogical research.;
, Many historical and genealogical societies offer seminars on a variety of genealogy topics. Libraries also sometimes offer courses, especially those that have collections that include resources used by family historians. An increasing number of genealogy classes are offered online. The National Genealogical Society offers a well-respected home study course, and a few colleges and universities now offer certificate programs in genealogical studies.

, Thousands of books are available on both general and specific topics related to genealogical research. Most researchers start their own genealogy libraries by buying a few general guides to family history research, along with books devoted to the specific location or ethnicity of the families they hope to trace. Most public libraries have at least a few books devoted to genealogy.

, Modern genealogical research generally requires that researchers use subscription genealogy sites that offer access to basic records like censuses and city directories. Libraries can direct you to the major sites, and some have free subscriptions available for library patrons. Check the ""help"" section of the genealogy sites you use; many offer free tutorials on basic genealogical research techniques, and nearly all offer help on how to effectively use their own collections.

, The National Genealogical Society puts on the largest genealogy conference in the United States every year in the spring, and the Who Do You Think You Are conference is a large event in the United Kingdom. Large conferences usually offer lectures on research techniques, case studies and location-specific strategies. State and local genealogical societies also frequently host conferences with similar types of classes, and private organizations and genealogy companies are beginning to hold family history expos as well. Contact the local historical society or local library in your area to find out what conferences are planned there.


Talk directly with instructors and other researchers at conferences. This can be a valuable opportunity to learn how other genealogists have successfully tackled some of the same research problems you face. Most large conferences offer at least one vendor-sponsored luncheon, which offers attendees a chance to sit and talk with other conference-goers.

, Connecting with other researchers who are already working in areas where you want to look more can help you get advice and learn more about a particular location's record groups and unique challenges.


Utilize blogs for genealogy research. Since finding long-lost relatives is frequently an important part of a genealogist's research strategy, many family historians have blogs to help distant relatives find them and their research on the Internet. These blogs also allow researchers to connect with each other to compare notes, discuss research strategies, and learn about new techniques for tracing their family history. You can find blogs relevant to your research by searching the Internet for the surnames and/or locations that relate to the families you're tracing.
Access social media sites to find other family historians. Many social media users have keywords like ""genealogy"" included in their profiles to make them easier to find.

Interview your relatives.,
Preserve and record old documents.,
Search published genealogies.",How to Find Your Ancestors Online1," Before starting your ancestry search, speak with relatives to gather as much information as you can about your family history. Get as much specific information as you can (i.e dates, locations); conducting a genealogy search with names alone will be very difficult. Ask relatives for any relevant primary documents they might have (or copies of them) to aid in your research.;
, Be sure to give proper care to any old documents you have or receive from relatives. Keep them clean, store them in a cool, dry place, and handle them with gloves if possible. Consider contacting a conservator if the documents are in bad shape (e.g. moldy or torn documents) and need to be repaired. To preserve family records, digitize your documents, being careful not to damage them while copying and scanning.Digitizing documents generally means scanning and saving them as PDF files on your computer or storage drive. Purchase a scanning software if your computer doesn’t already have one installed (e.g. Adobe Acrobat). For the best results, use a scanner that scans in color and accommodates large documents., Before starting your own genealogy search, check to see if anyone (i.e. a distant relative) has published a genealogy and family history of your family. There are many websites where you can search published family histories (e.g. the Library of Congress catalogue). Be sure to use any publications you might find as a reference point for starting your research, and not as an irrefutable source of information; being published does not guarantee accuracy, so be sure to double check sources, look for reviews from credible genealogy journals and newsletters, and search for documents related to the information provided."

Search the internet using a search engine.,
Be persistent and search often.",How to Find Lost or Missing Relatives Online1," Before you start searching, spend some time thinking about the person you're trying to locate. Consider any details you can recall about their personality, such as hobbies, favorite idioms, maybe even try to remember middle initials or where they were born. If you know their date of birth, this will also come in handy on your search. You need to try to remember any specific aspects of their personality, likes, dislikes or quirks about the person.;
, As soon as you have gathered your information on the missing person, begin your search. Don’t put off your search for a lost or missing person. The sooner you start, the better your chances of finding the person will be., If you were searching for a while and then stopped, don’t start over or start from scratch. Even if you hit a dead end, pick up where you left off in your search and continue from there. , Use a popular search engine to begin your search, such as Google, Bing, or Yahoo. Type in details about the missing person such as their name, age, state (if known or suspected), and occupation. The University of Buffalo has a librarian curated list of the best search engines for web searches as well as for people searches. , Just because you don’t turn up any results the first time you try to locate your lost or missing person does not mean you should give up. If you don’t find anything on your first try, try again in a few days and keep trying.

Give people from a given region a last name denoting their place of origin.,
Give a child a surname indicating who that child's father is.,
Give a person a last name denoting his or her occupation.,
Give someone a last name based on a personal characteristic.",How to Find The Origin Of Your Last Name1," Place-name-based last names, as a group, are the most popular source of last names for people in the United States, comprising about 43 percent of the population. These are of several types:


Country of origin. This class includes surnames taken from countries, such as LaFrance and Spain, and from residents of those countries, such as English, French, and German.
Region or province of origin. This class includes surnames such Fleming, meaning from the Flanders region of Belgium, and Westphal, meaning from the German province of Westphalia.
Geographic features. This class includes both names taken from general geographic features, such as Camp, Hill, Parks, or Woods, and names of specific geographic features, such as Shannon after the River Shannon in Ireland.
Estates. ""Estates"" here is used to mean residential property of any size, ranging from a small cottage to a manor surrounded by acres of land. These estates normally passed from father to son, as did the surnames. These surnames include last names such as Cheshire, Cunningham, Kent, and Preston.
Place-name-based surnames often begin with a prefix denoting ""from"" (""de"" in French, ""von"" in German, ""van"" in Dutch), ""of"" (corrupted to ""O'""), or ""at"" (""At"" or ""Atte,"" later corrupted to ""a""), as well as the prefixes ""By"" (Bykirk means ""by a church"") and ""Under"" (Underwood). They may also have a suffix indicating a geographic feature, such as ""-ley,"" ""-legh,"" or ""-leigh,"" meaning near a pasture, or ""-ea,"" ""-ey,"" or ""-ney,"" meaning near water.;
, Called patronymic surnames, these last names, as a group, are second to place-name-based last names in popularity, making up about 32 percent of last names in the United States. Patronyms are usually found as either prefixes or suffixes in last names.


Common patronymic prefixes are ""O'"" in Irish last names and ""Mac-"" and ""Mc-"" in both Scottish and Irish surnames, meaning ""son of."" Other such prefixes are ""Bar-"" and ""Ben-"" in Hebrew, ""Ibn-"" in Arabic, and ""Fitz-"" in Irish surnames.
The most recognized patronymic suffixes are ""-son,"" found in English, Scottish, and Swedish last names; and its variation ""-sen,"" found in Norwegian and Danish names. Other patronymic suffixes are ""-az,"" found in Portuguese last names; ""-ez,"" found in Spanish last names; ""-ovich,"" found in Russian last names; and ""-wicz,"" found in Polish last names. The endings ""-s"" and ""-es"" in names of Welsh origin, such as Roberts and Hughes, also indicate descent from men with those first names.
While most patronymic prefixes and suffixes mean ""son of,"" there have been patronyms for daughters as well. At one time, prefixes such as ""Ni-"" and ""Nic-"" were used in Gaelic to mean ""daughter of,"" and Icelandic women are still given last names ending in the suffix ""-dottir.""
Originally, children each generation were given last names indicating their immediate parentage; thus Simon Johnson might be the son of John Frederickson, who was the son of Frederick Stephenson. However, most countries today carry the original patronym to successive generations, with some exceptions.

, This form of surname is the third most common in the United States, comprising almost 16 percent of its residents' last names. Some last names obviously indicate the occupation, such as Baker, Miller, or Speakman, while others are less obvious: Barker derives from the Old English word for tanning (as leather), Cooper was a barrel-maker, and Wainwright made wagons.

, Just as people are given nicknames today based on an aspect of their appearance or personality, such as calling a redhead ""Carrot-Top"" or someone with a sunny disposition ""Sunshine,"" last names have been assigned based on some characteristic. This type of last name is least common in the United States, making up less than 10 percent of the population.


Some last names have neutral connotations, such as ""Reid,"" ""Roth,"" or ""Russ"" referring to a person who had red hair.






Some last names are mildly negative, such as ""Peel"" or ""Peele"" referring to someone who was bald.
Some last names may have been backhanded insults, such as giving the surname ""Power"" to someone who was poor, as opposed to being a forceful person.
Some last names were outright insults, such as giving the surname ""Barrett"" to a person known to be a liar.
Some such last names were given to suggest the characteristics of an animal, either real or imagined. Richard the Lionheart was so named for his courage, while someone with the last name Adler (German for ""eagle"") may have had the keen sight (or insight) of an eagle or perhaps a nose like an eagle's.

Try to stay calm.,
Ask your spouse why they need a separate account.,
Practice active listening.,
Keep an open mind.,
Make your feelings clear.,
Follow up with your spouse.",How to React when Your Spouse Wants to Open a Separate Bank Account1," If your spouse’s request comes as a shock, you may experience a wide array of emotions. You may feel hurt or betrayed that your spouse wants their own bank account. You may also feel angry or become suspicious of their motives. However, in the moment, the best thing that you can do is to try to stay calm. This will help you have a productive conversation with your partner about your finances.


Once you feel emotions well up, try slowly counting down from ten while taking deep breaths. This will help calm your body’s anxious response.;
, After your spouse makes their request, ask them why they need the account. Talk with your partner about what the purpose is of the separate account. More importantly, discuss what it means for your relationship.You might ask things like “Why do you need a separate account?” or “What is the separate account for?”
You may find that a separate account simply helps your spouse manage their money better. However, it may also be a sign of larger problems in your relationship.

, Be a good listener and pay attention to what your partner tells you. Listen to what they say and try not to be distracted by your own thoughts and emotions. Although this may be difficult when your emotions are high, active listening will ensure that you and your spouse communicate clearly and avoid any misunderstandings.Make eye contact. Use facial expressions and head nods to indicate that you are listening.
You can also try paraphrasing. For example, ""I hear you saying that you want a little financial independence. Is that right?""

, Although a separate bank account may trigger feelings of suspicion and distrust, there may be valid reasons for your partner’s actions. For example, if your partner is accustomed to managing their finances in a certain way, a separate account may provide them with some autonomy. Try to keep these negative thoughts at bay and keep an open mind while you discuss what a separate account means to your relationship.Try writing about why you are offended or hurt by this to gain a better understanding of your feelings. For example, you may be harboring negative feelings of inferiority if your spouse makes more money than you do.

, It is important that you clearly communicate your emotions to your partner. Let your spouse know how their actions have affected you. If the new account is a surprise, express to them any hurt feelings that you may have, as well as any fears concerning the health of your relationship.


You might say things like “This new account really worries me” or “I’m hurt that you’d open this account without talking to me.”

, After you have your initial conversation, make a point to talk about it more in the future. Do not simply have the initial discussion and then never broach the subject again. Ask your partner to talk with you about the account after you have had some time to think about it. This will allow your emotions to settle a little, which can give you some perspective.


For example, pick a time a few days after your initial discussion to revisit the subject. If you are still upset about the separate account, you might want to meet at home to avoid creating a scene in public.
You might say something like “Can we talk about this more tomorrow?” or “I think that we need to talk about this more in the future.”

Simplify the spelling.,
Complicate the spelling.,
Conform the spelling to the language of where the name-bearer now lives.,
Translate the last name into its equivalent.,
Change the last name to something else.",How to Find The Origin Of Your Last Name2," Many names have changed their spellings over the years, usually becoming simpler. There are several ways to simplify how a name is spelled:


Eliminate silent letters. This can be as simple as changing the spelling of ""Hoffmann"" to ""Hoffman"" or ""Hofman"" or as complicated as changing ""Caesche"" to ""Cash.""
Spell a name the way it's now pronounced. Over time, the pronunciation of the name ""Cockbourne"" changed to ""KO-burn,"" so the spelling of the name became ""Coburn."" Sometimes, the spelling changes first and the pronunciation follows, as may have happened when shortening ""Davies"" to ""Davis.""
Respell using the letters closest to those in the original language. The German language puts umlauts (diaereses, two dots) over the letters ""a,"" ""o,"" and ""u"" to indicate a different vowel sound than for those letters without the umlaut. It also uses a letter similar to a ""B"" with an open bottom called an ""ess-tsett"" in place of a double-s. Because English doesn't use these letters, German names with umlauts are often written with an ""e"" after the altered letter, such as ""Moench."" (As the pronunciation changes, the spelling may also change as well, simplifying the name to ""Munch."") German names using the ess-tsett are written in English with ""ss.""

, In contrast to simplifying the spelling of a surname, some last names are made fancier with additional letters, such as changing ""Johnson"" to ""Johnstone"" or adding a second ""t"" to ""Barret"" to make it ""Barrett.""

, Certain words are similar, but not identical, among different languages. Occupation-based last names based on these words may change to match the word in the new language when the possessor of that name moves to a new country, such as the German ""Mueller"" becoming the American ""Miller.""

, Some languages use entirely different words to mean the same thing. Last names based on occupations that have very different words in two languages may be translated directly into the new language, such as the Irish ""Brehon"" becoming the English ""Judge"" or the German ""Schneider"" becoming the English ""Taylor.""

, Just as people can legally change their names today, people in the past have changed their names for one reason or another. A family with the last name of ""Hallstrom"" today may at one time have used the surname ""Rasmussen.""

Talk about your financial goals.,
Discuss your finances regularly.,
Manage your finances together.,
Have joint and separate accounts.,
Maintain transparency.",How to React when Your Spouse Wants to Open a Separate Bank Account2," In order to avoid any financial surprises, you should have frank and honest conversations with your partner about your values and financial goals. Talk about what you want to save for, how you envision your finances being managed, and how each of you will contribute to the household income. Although you do not need to agree on everything, you should try to come to a consensus on how to manage your money.You should ask your partner things like “What things do we want to save for?” and “How much should we save for retirement?”

, Besides conversations about your financial goals, you should talk about your finances on a regular basis. Sit down and talk with your partner about your bills, savings, and other assets that you are managing. It is important that you and your spouse are honest about what resources you have and how you are actively managing your finances. If you have children, then doing this can also set a good example for them.


For example, once a month, make a time to meet with your partner and just talk about your finances.

, As a couple, you and your partner should put together a household budget. Then you should sit down together and balance your budget every month. This will ensure that you are both invested in and aware of what is going on with your finances.For example, after you have been paid but before you pay your major bills, you and your spouse should set a time to manage your resources each month.
There are helpful free digital tools available for managing finances, such as Budget Pulse., One easy way to maintain financial transparency is by opening joint and separate banking accounts. Put your money for bills and other shared expenses in a joint account, which you both manage. Then decide on how much money will go into separate accounts for individual spending. This will help you manage your household expenses while maintaining some autonomy.Although the accounts may be separate, you should consider putting both of your names on the accounts in case one of you becomes incapacitated.

, Make sure that you and your partner are able to see each other’s accounts. Although you may find that separate and shared accounts are more practical for your relationship, you and your partner should still be able to look at how each of you are managing your money. A little transparency will help you build trust and keep you on the same page financially.


However, it is important that you manage this transparency responsibly. Try not to become too critical of your partner’s personal spending habits or attempt to control how they spend their money. As long as they are not affecting your shared income, you should still respect their autonomy.
If your partner is too critical or controlling about how you manage your individual finances, let them know that you are capable of making your own decisions. Say something like “I can take care of myself” or “I’d appreciate it if you’d trust me.”

"

Divide expenses fairly.,
Deposit funds evenly.,
Save remaining balances.",How to React when Your Spouse Wants to Open a Separate Bank Account3," If you and your partner decide to have separate accounts, it is important that you find an equitable means of dividing household expenses. When you put together your household budget, talk with your partner about how much they can contribute to your shared expenses. It is important that you come to a consensus on how much each of you will contribute to your joints expenses each month.For example, if your shared expenses are $2,000, make sure that you and your partner each contribute $1,000 from your personal accounts.
If one of your makes more money than the other, the person who makes more may need to pay a larger portion of the shared expenses. Talk about this to avoid any resentments or hard feelings.

, Whenever you or your partner receives any extra income that you did not budget for, say from a work bonus or as a gift, you should find a way to split the money equitably. Talk with your partner about what accounts the money should be deposited in. Just as you need to divide all expenses evenly, you should also find equitable ways of divvying up extra income.For example, if your partner gets a bonus, you may decide to keep half of the money in your partner’s account and put the rest in your joint savings account.

, In addition to your budgeted joint savings, you and your partner might also consider saving money from your individual accounts. At the end of the month, you and your partner may decide to put the remaining balances from your individual accounts into a shared savings account. This will ensure that withdrawing from the savings account is a mutual decision.For example, if you have a remaining balance of $100 in your personal account at the end of the month, deposit it in your shared savings account.

Consider the implications of finding this person.,
Ask other family members to help.,
Check public records.,
Record your findings.,
Follow up on your leads.,
Consider hiring a private investigator.",How to Find Family Members1," Think about why you want to find a certain family member. Was there family turmoil that may be uprooted if other family members know that you are looking for that person? Can you enlist help from other members of your family? Gauge other family members' possible reactions before springing the idea on them so as to not cause hurt feelings.


Adoption situations can make for complicated searches. If you are looking for birth parents, or for children that were given up for adoption, make sure that you won't be stirring up a taboo subject or creating unrest in your family.;
, Interview any available family members who can give you more information or possible leads. You may have to speak to multiple people to get all of the information that you need. The more people you can ask about your family member's history and the possible direction that he or she pursued, the more you will likely find out.


If your family is supportive of your quest, start dividing up tasks so that you can cover more ground in a shorter amount of time. Have one person search social media, one person visit the local public record archives, and one person contact your family member's old acquaintances to ask for information.

, Visit the person's hometown—or the town where you suspect that the family member resides—and check available public records. These records could include marriage, birth, and death certificates, or even newspaper articles and announcements. Visit the local public library, or ask around at the local courthouse for publicly-accessible archives.

, Keep organized records of everything that you learn. Write down facts and rumors, phone numbers and addresses, and contacts who might be able to give you more information. Piece together everything that you know. Consider what information, if any, might be missing.


Consider marking a map with each place that your family member has gone, and why. If you can visualize their journey, it might be easier for you to guess at their next step.

, If you uncover any contact information, consider calling, emailing, or sending a letter to confirm the location of your family member. If all you can find is an address, consider visiting that address to find out if the lost person is living there. Be persistent and be thorough. You never know when a lead will work out.


If you call, do not make assumptions. Say, ""Hi, is Theresa there?"" and explain why you are trying to find her. If the person on the other end of the line doesn't seem to know anything, do not push.

, If your research leads you to a dead end, try turning the case over to a professional who finds people for a living. Provide the investigator with all of the background information that you have already compiled and let them do the leg work for you. Search for ""private investigator "" or ""private investigator lost family member"". There are many websites that can help you find family, lost loves, and old friends. Be cautious: the Internet abounds with scam sites.

Find out more about your genealogy.,
Decide how far back to go.,
Choose paper and a drawing utensil.,
Decide what form your tree will take.,
Draw the tree in light pencil.,
Write your name.,
Add your parents and siblings.,
Write in your aunts and uncles, cousins and grandparents.,
Include more generations.,
Enhance it with more detail.",How to Draw a Family Tree," Some people are intimately familiar with their family history, and others don't know as much about their grandparents, great grandparents, cousins, and so on. Before you make a family tree, get all the information you need by conducting research in the following ways:


Ask family members for information. If you're making a family tree for a school project, your mother and father may be able to tell you everything you need to know about your family. For extensive family history projects, consider looking at a genealogy database. Sites like Familysearch.org have information about long lost relatives you may not have known you had.
Be thorough. A family tree isn't as useful when someone is accidentally left out. You might want to check with multiple sources to make sure your information is accurate.;
, It's interesting to trace your family history as far back as you can, but when you're drawing a family tree, it's not practical to record information that extends more than a few generations back. You're limited by the size of the paper you use, since you need to be able to fit all of the names on one page.


Many people choose to go as far back as their great great grandparents and their siblings, or their great grandparents and their siblings. These are people you, your parents or your grandparents have met, so they are tied to you more closely than more distant relatives.
If you have a large family with a lot of great aunts and uncles, cousins, and so on, you may have to end with a more recent generation to fit everyone on one page. If you have a smaller family you might be able to extend the tree to a more distant generation.

, Since you're taking the time to research and draw your family tree, pick out nice drawing materials so that the information is presented well.


Art supply stores sell individual sheets of large paper. Choose one that is sturdy and attractive, such as watercolor paper.
A more convenient option might be a piece of posterboard. This type of paper is also sold by the individual sheet, and it comes in a variety of colors. You can find it at drugstores.
Plan to draw the family tree in pencil and trace over it with a nice ink pen or marker.

, Some family trees are drawn in the shape of actual trees that have a branch for each ""branch"" of the family. Others are more like family diagrams; the end effect is tree-like, but the family names aren't actually superimposed on a tree drawing. Use the style that was assigned to you in class or simply choose the one you prefer.

, Envision what it will look like and plan how much space you need to write each name and to draw the necessary connections. Working in pencil allows you to start over on a branch if you run out of room.

, Since this is your family tree, it all begins with you. Write your name in a spot on the page that is surrounded by plenty of space for all of the other names.


The place where you write your name is the beginning of the tree. If you write it at the bottom of the page, the branches will protrude upward. You could write it at the top of the page and have the rest flow downward, or write it on one side of the page and have the tree bloom out in the other direction.
If you decide to go with an actual tree shape, go ahead and draw the outline of the tree in light pencil and position your name where you want it.

, Space your parents' names directly above or below your name, depending on what direction you want the tree to flow. Write your siblings' names level with yours, so they extend from your parents' names.


If you and your siblings have spouses or children, write them as well. Spouses' names are written directly next to their partners, and the children's names are written below their parents' names. You can draw lines connecting parents to their children if you'd like.
Tailor the tree to fit your family. If you have one parent, or more than two parents, fill them in as well. You can get creative with the drawing to include your step parents, step siblings, and anyone else who is part of your family. The most important aspect of a family tree is making sure everyone is included.
To keep your tree well-organized, use a regular pattern for the order in which you list the siblings. For example, start with the oldest sibling on the left and then put all subsequent siblings to the right, or vice versa. Either way, keep it consistent throughout the tree.

, This is where the tree begins to split off into branches. On your father's side of the tree, write in his siblings' names, their spouses, and their children (your first cousins). Write your father's parents' names on the next level, with a line extending from them to each of their children. Do the same on your mother's side of the tree, including all the members of your extended family on that side.

, Continue adding the names of your great aunts and uncles and their spouses and children, your great grandparents, and so on until you've filled in as much of the family tree as you want.

, Retrace the tree in black or colored ink to make the names and outline stand out. You can add decorations and other details to make the tree more interesting. Here are some examples:


Use different shapes for males and females. For example, you can use ovals for females and rectangles for males, or whatever other pattern you wish. This way, someone looking at your family tree can tell at a glance the gender of the different individuals.
Use dashed lines for divorced couples. This way, you can still express the biological relationships between parents and their children, even when they are not married.
Add dates of birth and (where applicable) death. This can add a lot of information to your tree and make it interesting to your friends and other family members.
Add more biographical information for each individual, such as place of birth, maiden names, middle names, and so on.

Legacy.com also allows keyword searches, which could be particularly helpful if you were unsure what name was used in someone's obituary.Legacy.com only includes obituaries as far back as February of 2001.Websites such as WorldVitalRecords.comand vitalrec.comhave more international death records and notices, as well as links to other sources of international vital records online. Although you can see basic information about your search results, you must subscribe to the service to gain access to the records themselves.;
, If a funeral home was used, you can find an online database of official funeral home death notices at obitsforlife.com.


Obitsforlife.com allows you to search by name or location for death notices, or you can conduct a keyword search. In addition to funeral homes in North America, the website includes global death notices from countries such as Brazil, India, the Philippines, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
Death notices on obitsforlife.com can only be uploaded by licensed funeral homes, so authenticity is assured. At the same time, the site's database only includes listings from funeral homes that are members of the site, so results may be somewhat limited in that respect.

, Several websites such as genealogybank.com and ancestry.com allow you to search the SSDI free of charge. The SSDI contains records of people with U.S. Social Security numbers whose deaths were reported to the Social Security Administration.Genealogybank.com has the SSDI from 1899 through 2011,while ancestry.com allows you to search from 1935 through 2014.You can search using as much or as little information about the person as you have, including first and last name, date of birth, date of death, last known residence, or Social Security number., State death indexes often go back further than online obituaries or the SSDI, and many are available online for free.


You can find links to death indexes for each state on sites such as http://www.germanroots.com/deathrecords.html and http://www.deathindexes.com.
Although generally you can find death notices through the early 1900s for free, you may have to pay a fee or join a subscription site to gain access to older death notices, such as those from the 1700s., The National Archives has information about vital records, including death records, and links to websites with free databases of death notices and records.Since these records are maintained by state or local authorities, they are not federal records and not held by the National Archives. However, the National Archives website provides plenty of online research tools and other assistance for genealogists, historians and researchers.
The Archives does have casualty listings from the U.S. military as well as deaths of U.S. citizens in foreign countries."

Use people-search web services.,
Search for family members through social media.,
Follow up with a call or message.",How to Find Family Members2," There are a number of web services through which you can find names, addresses, ages, and records: marriage, employment, and legal histories. Some sites are free, and some charge a small service fee. Compare low-cost and no-cost search options, and find something that suits your purposes. You can also run a reverse phone number search if you have a phone number that's connected to your family member.


Try a White Page search through Metacrawler's http://metacrawler.intelius.com/ page. This can be a useful tool if you think you know the town or a few possible towns where your family member might be living.
Use commercial websites such as http://www.publicpeoplefinder.com/Family-Member-Finder.shtml, http://www.ussearch.com/others/consumer/services/findFamilyMembers.html, or http://www.ancestry.com/. You usually need to pay a service charge to use these websites, but they also tend to give you more information than free sites.
Check out free people-search websites like FamilySearch.org, which is a service provided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Check out the free resources at http://www.myheritage.com/family-tree-builder?gclid=CMGsrLq-_qcCFYS8KgodpGINqQ.


, You can search for people on Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, Instagram, and most other networks, although you may need to search through long lists of people with common names. You may be able to refine your search if you know the person's email address, their community, or their schools.


If you are looking for a specific person, search for his or her full name. Try searching for nicknames and variations in addition to full legal names. For example, if you are trying to find Bob Shovels, try searching for ""Robert"" and ""Bobby"" in addition to ""Bob"". Search for any variations that you know a person has used.
If you suspect that someone you know might be Facebook friends with the person you are trying to find, try looking through their friend list. It is possible to de-index your profile from the Facebook search tool, so just because you cannot find your family member through a basic search does not always mean that he or she doesn't have a profile.

, If you are reasonably sure that you have found your lost family member, try to find a reliable means of contacting her. Look for a street address, an email address, a phone number, or a social media profile. Reach out to the person with a message explaining who you are, or call the number that you find and ask for someone by her name.


If you cannot find your family member online, it could be a sign that he or she has gone off the grid. He or she may be ""illegal"" in some way, or wanted by the police, or simply not wanting to be found
Bear in mind that if you aren't ""friends"" with someone on Facebook, private messages will go to a separate, little-seen inbox. The person may eventually see your message, but he or she will not necessarily notice it immediately.

Start with living relatives and work your way into the past.,
Use genealogy websites.,
Consider hiring a professional genealogist.",How to Find Family Members3," Ask questions and get as much detail as possible: full names, maiden names, date of birth, date of death, date of marriage, date of divorce, names of children, and places they may have lived. Family bibles often have familial information recorded in them, and old personal notes or letters may be helpful as well.


If all you have is a photo of your family member, ask other family members if they recognize him or her. Look through old family photo albums and try to figure out who is who. If you aren't sure when a photo was taken, check the back of the photo for the date.

, You can use the Internet to put together all of the information that you gather. Websites like Ancestry.com and FindAGrave.com are a good starting point, and some offer free trials. These sites have access to US census records, birth, marriage, death certificates, and other family trees that may intersect your own. If you have a name to search for, you can find out where family members are buried, and you can find information about any memorials that have been held.


Bear in mind that you may find many people with similar names. Immigrants from similar backgrounds often tend to congregate in a given neighborhood or region, so you may find find individuals with extremely similar names.
Names may have been misspelled or arbitrarily changed in older records, so you may find many different iterations of certain names and dates. Follow up with local municipalities to verify any information that you find.
Ancestral search sites usually allow you to search international repositories and documents. If your ancestral family hails from another country, you can piece together the journey that you ancestors took from their homeland.

, If you do not make as much progress as you like, or you find you need a language translator, you can find professional genealogists on ancestral search websites.


Remember, information such as your mother's maiden name is often used to as a security question for your financial information. Be careful sharing personal information.
Research professional genealogists thoroughly. Read reviews and references before deciding who to trust with your information.

Visit the public library.,
Request a death certificate from the state vital records department.,
Search cemetery and burial records.,
Visit your state archives.,
Visit a National Archives facility.",How to Find Death Notices for Free2," Public libraries typically have local newspapers archived, sometimes going back to the first year the newspaper was printed.


For example, if you go to the New York Public Library, you can look at microform copies of The New York Times going back to 1857.If you're looking for a death notice from someone who died relatively recently, you may be able to find that online for free. However, if the person died hundreds of years ago, that information may not be digitized or available for free.

, If you need an official death certificate, you probably will have to order it from the vital records department in the person's last state of residence.


Typically you will be charged a fee for a standard copy and a little extra if you need a certified copy., Even if a gravestone is weathered or illegible, you typically can search cemetery or burial records to find details about a person's death.


Some cemetery districts have websites where you can look up a grave online. For example, the Orange County Cemetery District provides a searchable database for graves in Anaheim Cemetery, El Toro Memorial Park, and Santa Ana Cemetery.In many cases, however, you will have to make a visit to the cemetery itself to review the records.

, State records often go back further than Social Security or other national records and may provide more detail about the death. The state archives typically are housed in the state capital, but if you can't travel to that city you may be able to request documents through a local university research library or historical society., While plenty of information is available online, a visit to an Archives facility may be necessary to find the death notice you need.


You can search the Archives website at http://www.archives.gov/locations/ to find the location nearest you and the services provided there.
Beyond just federal records, ancestry.com also is available for free at an Archives facility, so you may be able to find the records you need there without paying a subscription fee to use the online service."

Identify the will.,
Work with the executor of the estate.,
Examine the will.,
Meet with an attorney who is familiar with estate law.,
Prepare to perform a “due diligence” search.",How to Find Heirs1," For the vast majority of cases, identifying heirs is not very interesting or involved. Read the will, identify the spouse and/or children, and distribute the property. However, when a will cannot be found, or if the heirs are not clear, then the matter becomes more interesting (and usually more difficult). Wills are not filed with any court or state agency. Sometimes the person will leave a will with the attorney who helped draft it. But it is entirely possible that a person could have written a will, without telling anyone, and tucked it between the pages of his or her favorite book in the book case. The first step, in such a case, is simply to find if a will exists and identify it as such.


If, after a diligent effort, no will can be located, then any interested party can apply to the probate court for an order that no will exists. Usually this will be a family member. If that happens, then the estate will be distributed according to state law, as though no will ever existed.
State probate law generally describes certain percentages of the estate that are to go to the spouse and children. If no spouse or children are alive at the time, then the law will extend to parents or siblings. The example of an estate going to a long-lost great nephew twice removed rarely happens, except in the movies.;
, In most states, distribution of the property is managed by someone called an executor. The executor is usually a friend or relative of the deceased, or could be an attorney who gets appointed. If you are looking for heirs to the estate, you will need to meet with the executor to get information about the will., If you are in a position to read the will, examine it carefully. If the will identifies heirs by name, then your search will be easier. However, if the will uses vague language, such as, “I leave the remainder of my estate to any identifiable heirs,” of if there is no will, then your search will be more complicated. You will first need to determine whether any such heirs exist, and then try to find them., Estate or probate law is what directs the distribution of assets from a decedent’s estate. You will probably need to meet with an attorney who practices this type of law to understand the requirements of your state.Estate laws differ from one state to another. The law that controls is usually the law of the state where the decedent was last living when he or she passed away.

, The law will inform you about the need to search for missing heirs. If the will is vaguely written or if an heir cannot be located or identified, state law generally requires the estate to perform a “due diligence” search. This is at least a minimally reasonable effort to try to find missing heirs.A due diligence search usually requires advertising in a local newspaper for a number of weeks about the effort to locate heirs to the estate, as well as making direct contact with known family members.

"
"
Gather as much information as you know.,
Contact other relatives of the deceased person.,
Contact friends of the deceased person.,
Keep a notebook or search journal.,
Search social media and other online sources.,
Post information online.",How to Find Heirs2," In some cases, you may wish to go beyond a due diligence search and continue trying to find a missing heir. Perhaps the inheritance is very valuable, or perhaps you may stand to earn a commission if the person is found. Whatever the reason, every case is going to have a different level of difficulty, depending on how much information you know at the start. The more bits of information that you can collect at the beginning, the easier the rest of your search is going to be. Some examples of helpful, or necessary, information include the following items:Vital records (birth certificate, death certificate, marriage license)
Obituaries of family members
Real estate and cemetery records
Credit records
Employment records
Education records
Family correspondence

, The place to begin your search is with known family members of the decedent. Ask for any leads they may have for the missing heir. Try to jog their memory with direct questions:”When was the last time you saw John Doe (the missing person)?”
”Where was John Doe living when you last heard from him?”
”Do you know what kind of work John Doe was doing?”
”Do you know if John Doe ... got married? ... was attending college? ... had any children?”

, After you exhaust the known relatives, try meeting with friends and colleagues of the decedent. Their memory of a missing heir is likely to be even less than that of family members, but it is always worth asking., As you meet with people, you should keep a written record of your efforts. Keep notes, either by handwriting in a notebook or keeping a spreadsheet on a computer, of everyone you meet, the date and time of your conversation, and the list of questions and answers. You will be able to use this record as proof of your search efforts when you report back to the executor of the estate or if you need to prove to a court that you have conducted a thorough search., With the widespread access to social media, locating individuals has become easier in recent years. Use such tools as Google, Facebook, or Twitter to search for the missing heir. There are several things to keep in mind when searching for someone online:Use a very wide range of spellings and name combinations.
Try including a middle initial, or leaving it out.
Use a variety of spellings for the last name, if it is commonly misspelled.
Try searching under nicknames, if you know that he or she used one.

, It is sometimes easier to put out notices that you are looking for a person, and then let that person come to you. If you are trying to find a missing heir to an inheritance, post information about the inheritance and include a way for anyone with information to reply to you.Create a Facebook page, identifying the name of the person you are looking for or the name of the deceased
Send out information on Twitter or some other social media.
Post a ""Looking for..."" ad on Craigslist.

Select a reputable heir finder or investigator.,
Provide as much information as possible.,
Check with your state to see if such firms must be licensed.,
Discuss the financial arrangement with the search agent.",How to Find Heirs3," Simply searching the Internet for “missing heir” will turn up a wide array of genealogists, private investigators and “heir hunters.” Review several websites to try to find a company that appears responsible, that describes openly their search process, and that appears to be fully responsive. Select one or more to meet with initially and then select a company that you believe will conduct the kind of search you need., The investigator’s job will be simplified and improved if you can provide useful information. If you have conducted any searching already by yourself, you may turn over your notes to help the investigator get started.

, In some states, heir finders or private investigators need to be licensed. In some they do not. Check with your state’s department of revenue or secretary of state to try to find out.If you have found an investigator that you would like to retain, ask if the company is licensed or has any other kind of state oversight.

, Before you retain anyone to perform this kind of work for you, you should have a written contract. The contract should state clearly the work that you want performed and the fee that you are going to pay. You need to specify whether the payment will be based on an hourly rate or as a percentage of the amount of the inheritance. Different companies will have different billing policies, and you may have different preferences based on the type of inheritance.Be clear whether you will pay an hourly rate or a percentage of the value of the inheritance.In some states, there are limitations on how much of a percentage an heir finder can charge."

Abstain from sex during your most fertile time each month until you have successfully begun using birth control.",How to Use Birth Control when Nursing1," Most of the non-hormonal birth control methods have been around for a long time, such as the diaphragm and the condom. You can also use a cervical cap or a vaginal sponge. These types of birth control methods will not affect the breastfeeding process or the health of your baby. They are safe to use and you can begin using them right away.


If you decide to use a diaphragm, you may need to go to your physician and get measured for it. Even if you used one before becoming pregnant, the size or shape of your vagina may have changed after giving birth. It is best to get checked for sizing before attempting to use a diaphragm so that any changes in size can be modified immediately.;
,


The abstinence method of birth control has been used by women for centuries. This means you will need to abstain from having sex during the times when you are most fertile each month.
You may want to consult your physician if this is the only type of birth control you wish to use, as it can be difficult to distinguish when your most fertile time is during the time when you are breastfeeding.
Many women will not have a period while they are nursing. This is due to the hormonal changes that take place to allow for milk production. It is important to remember that ovulation will occur prior to the return of a period, so the absence of a period does not indicate the absence of ovulation.

"
"
Consider using contraceptives that only contain progestin, as these are the preferred method for women who are breastfeeding.,
Begin using progestin-only birth control around six to eight weeks after having your baby.,
Beware of birth control that relies on the use of estrogen.,
Use the morning after pill only as an absolute last resort.",How to Use Birth Control when Nursing2,"


There are several types of birth controls that only contain progestin - mini pills, hormonal injections, IUDs and a birth control implant. You should consult your doctor to decide which of these methods are best for your body before deciding which one to use.
The birth control injection and the IUDs or implants provide more long-term birth control, with the IUD and implant lasting up to 5 years. It may be a good idea to give the mini pills a try before committing to a long-term method.

, Most women do not experience any problems with their milk supply if they begin using the contraceptives around this time. Some believe that this type of birth control can actually cause the volume of milk to increase in comparison to the non-hormonal methods. However, it is still important to use caution when beginning any type of contraception while nursing and to pay attention to the amount of milk that you are producing once you begin using the contraception.

, Contraceptives containing estrogen have been shown to reduce your breast milk’s quality and quantity. These types of combination contraceptives should only be used six months after you have given birth if you are nursing and also once your baby has begun to eat solid foods. Types of combination contraceptives are the vaginal ring, the pill, the patch and the injection.


It is important to understand that most contraceptives containing estrogen are not recommended to new mothers who are breastfeeding. If you feel that this is definitely the best type of birth control for you, you may want to consider not breastfeed or to discuss your options further with your doctor.

, This pill should be a last resort whether you are breastfeeding or not. However, if you do find yourself in this emergency type of situation and are breastfeeding, make sure to ask for the progestin only morning after pill, as there is also a type that contains both estrogen and progestin.

Back to the basics.,
There is reason behind each face.,
Distance yourself from her negative behaviours .,
Discover how unpleasant dialogue/fights with her starts and when.,
Stop getting mad for petty things.,
Take care of yourself now for six months be only the observer not caught up in the drama.,
Try to talk to and interview each of your siblings.,
Reflect on whether it is healthy to keep a relationship with her.,
Believe that being a child of an unhappy individual is very hard and give yourself the room to be happy and create a life.,
Help your siblings when you are freed from her grasp.,
Avoid feeling guilty.",How to Deal With a Terrible Mother as an Adult," It is very simple, once you get a grip out of it, you will find a solution to it and it applies to each and every issue that you could ever encounter in your lifetime. The secret is to being able to remember the good in the bad. In this case we have an abusive mother, think of the very first memory that you have had with her. For example; some might see themselves being fed by her. How do we see that person, that individual, that we call 'mother'? In most cases we vision a; caring, loving, calming, perfect mother.;
, Why is she so unhappy? What were her parents/family life like? What are her frustrations or failed dreams for herself? How can you avoid falling into a pattern to not become like her? What are her expectations for herself and you? Your siblings? What are your expectations from her and your own behaviour? This is where you get in, this is how you will solve the problem.

, Imagine you are from another planet and you are observing her dialogue and patterns of destructive behaviour. What are her triggers? How do you respond to her outbursts or her drama? Write this all down, make a list, start taking notes. Start with your behaviour towards her. Write down pieces of any emotional conversations and look at it. Are you feeding her behaviour in any way or adding fuel to the fire. If you are then stop immediately.

, Note the hot spots. Is it each time you talk or just around certain people? What are the triggers? Self knowledge is power. Your brothers and sisters may need help but you need to help yourself first to help them.

, Understand that for your mother to strike out at you or favour one sibling over another has to do with her short comings as a person. She might be aware or oblivious to how she is being so damaging. Emotional behaviour is the hardest to change but you can become less involved and more objective. It will make you stronger.

, She will notice a change in you and may increase her attacks. Stay calm, observe and keep writing.

, Tell them you are trying to build a happier family life and need their help. Hopefully, they will see your point of view and help you. Do not get discouraged if you get a ""no"", just continue and move on.
, Some people are so toxic and damaging to be around that they will try to destroy you even if it is your own mother. If this is the case then leave the relationship and don't talk to or visit her for an allotted amount of time. Write her a letter and tell her you need some space but will contact her when the time is right. The time might never be right but it's not impossible.

, Start one step at a time becoming more independent. In the long run, what your mother thinks of you is NOT who you are. Her distorted opinion of you or your siblings don't count much if you can understand how hurtful and destructive it is. Then your job can be to not to make her happy at all. That does not make you a bad or selfish person but rather a realist.

, Find solutions that might work for you in dealing with her and discuss it with them. Tell them that you want them to have positive self images of themselves and to be strong. Show a role model,a healthy mental behaviour towards them and her. Console them if they are in pain.

, It is the number one reason people stay in destructive relationships. You are responsible for yourself not her.

Search for your birth parents.",How to Find Birth Parents After Adoption," There are generally two types of information you can search for: non-identifying information and identifying information. Although you will want identifying information to find your birth parents, non-identifying information is often easier to get.


Non-identifying information is information often collected by the adoption agency which will not lead you to the identity of your birth parents. This information can satisfy a curiosity about what your birth parents look like, or it can provide a medical history of your birth parents. This information typically includes:the date and place of your birth
the age and general physical description of your birth parents
race, ethnicity, religion, and medical history of both parents
the birth parent’s educational levels and occupations at the time of adoption
existence of other children born to each parent
the reasons for putting the child up for adoption


Identifying information is usually harder to get. This information will give you the name of your birth mother and possibly your birth father. A copy of your original birth certificate would contain this information. You will want identifying information if you hope to find your birth parents.;
, You need to know the state in which you were adopted because your ability to access adoption records will depend on the state where the adoption occurred. Ask your adoptive parents where the adoption took place. If they only remember the name of the agency, then search online and try to find out where the agency has operated.

, You should find the state statute that controls who may access adoption records and under what circumstances. The easiest way to look is to type “adoption” and “your state” into a search engine. Scroll through the results and look for the applicable state statute.


The Child Welfare Information Gateway has also created a summary of all state laws, which is available at their website. Because states frequently update their laws, you should still perform a web search to make sure you have the most up-to-date statute.
Each state’s summary should tell you how to get non-identifying information as well as how to get identifying information.

, Some states have open adoption records. If you meet the age requirements (usually 18 or 21 and older), then you can simply request a copy of your original birth certificate.In some states, however, the birth parent must consent to the release of the information.States with open adoption records include:Alabama
Alaska
Delaware
Hawaii
Kansas
Minnesota
Montana
Oregon
Pennsylvania
Tennessee
Vermont
Washington
Wisconsin

, Many states run registries where biological families and adopted children can find each other. The most common registries are “mutual consent” registries and confidential intermediary programs. With a mutual consent registry, the child or family members may file affidavits indicating whether they consent or refuse to allow information to be released to the other party, should that party be searching for them.For example, your birth mother may have filed an affidavit with her state’s mutual consent registry, stating that she agrees that her information should be released if you are looking for it. If you apply to the registry, then her contact information will be released to you. On the other hand, she may have filed an affidavit declaring that she does not want to be contacted. In that situation, no information would be released.
If your birth mother has filed no affidavit, neither consenting nor refusing to have information released, then some states will check with her to see if she is willing to consent to the release of her information.
With a confidential intermediary program, an intermediary is granted access to adoption records so that he or she can search for birth family members and ask for their consent for contact.If the birth family consents, then the contact information is released to the party seeking it.

, Registries restrict access to certain people, typically those who are in a blood relationship. Sometimes an exception is made for the adoptive parents, who may seek out some information about the birth parents. Read your state’s statute to see who is granted access. In Maryland, for example, the following people may request identifying information through the registry:birth parents
siblings
the adoptee who is 21 or older, provided they do not have a sibling under the age of 21

, If your state has a registry, it is probably maintained by a state department, such as the Department of Human Services or Department of Child Services. To find it, search “your state” and “mutual consent registry” in your favorite web browser.

, To register, you will probably need to fill out some paperwork. New York provides an “Adoptee Registration Form,” which is available on their Department of Health website.


Complete all required forms and return them. You may or may not have to pay a filing fee. There is no fee in New York.In Arkansas, the fee is $20.00., Several states require that you undergo counseling before information will be released to you. The counseling will touch on a variety of issues related to the search for your birth parents and possible reunification.The following states require counseling: Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas., An attorney can help you throughout the entire process of finding birth parents. An experienced lawyer can inform you of what your state law is, whether you can access the information, and can provide advice on how to use state registries. An attorney is also invaluable if you need to petition the court for the release of your birth certificate or other adoption records.


To find an experienced family law attorney, you should contact your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program.

, Some states will release information only by a court order. To request that a court release the records, you must file a petition in court. In the petition, you must state why there is a compelling reason to disclose information about the adoption and why this reason outweighs maintaining confidentiality.Some states may have printed “fill in the blank forms” for you to use. In Texas, for example, you can use an “Application for Access to Termination and Adoption Records,” which is available from the Texas Law Help website.
After you fill out the form, you must sign it in front of a notary public.Notaries can be found at the courthouse as well as most large banks. Be sure to bring personal identification: a valid driver’s license or passport.
Keep a copy of any application or petition for your records., You must file the petition in the county where the adoption took place.In some states, you may have to pay a filing fee. If you cannot afford the fee, then ask the court clerk for a fee waiver.

, In some states, you may be called in to see a judge immediately after filing your petition.In other states, the agency may be afforded an opportunity to respond to your petition.


If your hearing is not held immediately after filing your petition, then contact the clerk and ask about the date. On the day of the hearing, be sure to arrive early. Do not bring any food or drinks into the courthouse and have your cell phone turned off.
You should also dress appropriately. Avoid wearing shorts, if possible. Instead, wear slacks and a dress shirt. If you have to come directly from work, be sure to mention that fact to the judge., At the hearing, you or your attorney should argue why you want or need the identifying information. For example, the non-identifying medical information available from the adoption agency may be insufficient. You may need to contact your birth parents to ask if they would undergo medical tests or to ask for updates on their medical history. Whatever your reason, you must demonstrate your need by clear and convincing evidence.Always address the Judge as “Your Honor.” If the judge has questions for you, then answer them honestly and respectfully., If you are granted access to either your birth certificate or other adoption records, then you should have the judge’s order certified. You can get the certified order from the clerk’s office.You may need the certified order to give to a third-party intermediary if the judge refuses to release the records to you directly.Be sure to keep a copy of the certified order for future use.

, The adoption records (including birth certificate) should have the name of your biological mother, at the least. The information may also contain the name of your biological father. Since so much time has passed since the adoption, you may not be able to locate your birth parents at the address they gave when you were born. Accordingly, you may have to search for them.


Once you have names, you can search online to find your birth parents’ addresses. Visit wikiHow’s How to Find Someone for tips on how to use search engines like Pipl.com and Wink.com to find your birth parents.

If you’ve dealt with a miscarriage, premature labor, postpartum depression, or other health problems during a previous pregnancy, a medical professional can advise you on how to have the safest possible pregnancy this time around.You might say something like ""Hey, Dr. Weber, I am really nervous about this second pregnancy--mostly because I already have a two year old at home. Do you have any suggestions for better managing it?"";
, Pregnancy is an exhausting ordeal for your body under the best of circumstances. Growing a baby takes a great deal of energy, and pregnancy changes your hormone levels and metabolism, leaving you feeling tired more often.Taking care of a toddler’s needs on top of your own can add to your stress levels and fatigue, so take advantage of any opportunity you can to put your feet up for a few minutes or catch a catnap.

, Your diet is more important than ever when you are pregnant, so make sure to eat plenty of healthy, well-balanced foods to provide nutrition for your growing baby. Eating right will also help you stave off blood sugar crashes and mood swings, giving you more energy and patience for dealing with a temperamental toddler.Eat plenty of lean protein, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains during pregnancy for optimum health and energy. Avoid sugar and processed foods.
Your body needs extra calcium, iron, and folic acid during pregnancy to adequately nourish your growing baby. Ask your doctor about taking prenatal vitamins or supplements to ensure you get enough of these nutrients.
Avoid consuming alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol can harm your baby by causing birth defects, premature birth, or brain damage, among other problems., Between the demands of pregnancy and childcare, it might feel like you don’t have any time for yourself. It’s especially important that you find ways to recharge during this tiring time, though, so make it a priority to spend some time relaxing and taking care of your own needs.


Try getting a massage, attending prenatal yoga classes, or reading a good book after your toddler goes to bed., Your time and energy is limited right now, and enlisting the help of others can make it easier to get through the day. Ask your partner to take over some of the household chores such as cooking, and see if your relatives will babysit your toddler while you get some rest or make preparations for the arrival of your new baby.


If you only have limited support from your friends and family, consider hiring a mother’s helper for a few hours a week.Once your baby arrives, a postpartum doula can provide some much-needed assistance as you adjust to a new routine. A postpartum doula is a professional who provides emotional support, household help, and infant care advice for new moms during the first few weeks after giving birth., Sometimes you just won’t be able to give your toddler your full attention. You might need a break from watching your child so you can paint the new baby’s room, sort through baby clothes, or get some exercise. In situations like these, don’t feel bad about asking for help. Hire a babysitter or ask a family member to watch your toddler for a few hours., Pregnancy can be a difficult time in a woman’s life, especially with an older child to take care of. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed, anxious, or depressed.


Turn to your loved ones for support and reassurance when you need it. Social support is powerful – research has found that women with a strong network of friends and family are at decreased risk for developing postpartum depression.Leaning on others can be as simple as asking your sister ""Is it okay if we visit you guys for a week so that Little Charlie will have another kid to play with? Plus, it would be nice to get a change of atmosphere...""

, If you have morning sickness, it can be difficult to get your own day started, let alone a toddler’s, too. Make mornings as easy as you can by spending a few minutes getting ready the night before.Set out clothes for yourself and your child, prepare meals and snacks that can be easily reheated, and plan activities to keep your toddler entertained.
For example, you might prepare oatmeal for the week ahead and separate it into individual containers that only require warming or adding toppings. You could chop fruit and veggies for snacks.
Preparing for activities might be eased by creating a wall calendar where you toddler can look at pictures to know which activities have been pre-planned for the day.

, You might normally reserve TV for a weekend treat, but when you’re pregnant and tired, television and movies can be a lifesaver for keeping your toddler entertained while you rest. Keep your child’s favorite movies or educational DVDs close at hand for times when you need a break., Your pregnancy can be a confusing and stressful time for your toddler, too. He or she may not understand why you don’t feel well or what life will be like with a new baby in the house. Many toddlers will act out their feelings through misbehavior or tantrums. To help your child feel more secure, encourage them to help plan for their sibling’s arrival and emphasize their new role as big brother or sister.Make it a priority to spend a few minutes with your older child every day, even after the baby is born. This will help reassure them that you still love them and they aren’t being “replaced” by the new baby.
Help your toddler know what to expect by reading picture books or watching videos about having a new baby in the house.
Involve your toddler in preparations by letting him or her pick out some clothes or toys for the new baby.

, When you’re pregnant, it’s a good idea to limit the amount of strenuous physical activity you do, both for your unborn baby’s safety and to avoid pulling muscles or ligaments. When you play with your toddler, choose activities that allow you to sit down.Playing board games, reading, or watching movies together are a few good options for activities that won’t tire you out.

, When you’re pregnant and have a toddler, you’ve got more to do than usual, but less energy with which to do it. This might mean that keeping your house immaculate isn’t a realistic goal anymore.


Focus on getting the basics done, like washing dishes and doing laundry, and forget about deep cleaning or keeping up with a demanding list of daily chores – you’ve got more important things to worry about."

Studies show that if you leave them crying they will learn to become more dependent of themselves and they probably won't be asking you every week for toys.;
, For example, if they are newborns, buy them diapers, cribs, baby bottles, etc. You can buy toys for them so they can entertain themselves. Just don't go overboard.

, In order to be prepared for school, you have to teach them things. A simple way would be reading a story book before they go to sleep, sing them a song, count their toes while showering, saying aloud the phone numbers of companies advertising their product on T. V. or reading the billboards on the highway.

, If you don't want a rebellious child, you have to spend time with them, not to insult them, but to compliment them.


Bad mother: *Child Chewing Food* You have to stop eating, you're getting way too fat.
Good mother: *Child Chewing Food* Here eat this. It will make you stronger.

, Instead of spending time in your phone, and being a bad example to your child, go outside with them. Encourage them to be outdoors. This will make them more active and healthier. You could play hide and seek with them or you could pretend that you are monster chasing them around. You could play with a ball or dirt. Whatever it is you choose make sure that they are in a safe area where they will hit something soft if they fall.

, If they are preschoolers, they will most likely think they are the only important people, which is fine. They will grow and they will realize there's other people that have worse problems than they do. They're at an age where they are starting to realize there's a difference between pretend and realistic. Give them their time. If you'd like you can still play pretend with them and have some fun with them.

, Some kids will tell you to go and play with them. If you say no, they'll think you don't like them or something like that. If they invite to play with them, go. Don't be a scaredy cat. Once you get there, ask them what the game is called. Then play along. If there are rules, follow them, it won't be fair for them if they have to follow your rules, but you don't follow their rules.

, If you chose their clothes for them, they will feel like they have no freedom even if it's in their home. You may not like the design that is on the shirt or the color they chose, but its their choice. No offense, but they might know a bit more about fashion than you do, and they might want to go all fashionable to school or something.


Keep in mind that you shouldn't go to stores like JCPenny or Dillard's very often because that's where they'll find the most fashionable things, and if you don't have the money, you can't buy those things.

, This is most likely to happen if you are Mexican, no offense. All you have to do is be patient. If they did something that you don't like have them explain everything and why they did it. Don't interrupt them in the middle of the explanation.

, Congratulations! But are you afraid that your oldest child will be jealous of the small one? Here's how to prevent it. Sure babies need special care, but if you spend time with both of them, you will rarely have any problems. If you are at the store buying things for the newborn, buy thing a for the older one too. For example, if you are buying clothes for the baby, buy some clothes for the five year old too. If the five year old wants you to go play outside with them, go. Take the baby with you and sit and watch the five year old play for a while, then go over to them and say, Let's play hide and seek, or something like that.

Do what you've always dreamed of doing.",How to Live After the Death of a Spouse," Although not everyone experiences each of these stages and not everyone experiences stages in the same order, you may experience some combination of denial, anger, resentment, yearning, suffering, sadness, and eventually, acceptance.In addition to possibly not experiencing these in order you may experience these stages repeatedly over the course of your grief journey.Let yourself feel grief and allow yourself to work through these stages. Do not try to mask your emotions.;
, If your spouse died suddenly and there were no final requests, explore ideas to honor the memory of your late partner. This may give you a peace of mind, and will ensure that you will not have any mental obstacles in your new life. You can make this a recurring practice, or you may wish to honor your spouse once and then do your best to move on. To honor your spouse you might:Light a candle in their honor.
Take flowers to their grave and talk to them. Let them know what's on your mind.
Do an activity that you loved to do together, while remembering everything that was great about your spouse.

, Your pain will not just disappear, and it will not heal itself. Be patient with yourself as you work through the process of grief. Grief is a journey that lasts as long as it takes to reconcile all issues pertaining to death, your loved one, yourself, and the good and bad parts of your relationship. , Grief and depression can look very similar, but they are quite different.It is important to know the distinction so that if your grief turns to depression, you can seek help from a therapist.


When grieving, you may experience the following: Sadness, despair, mourning, fatigue or low energy, tears, loss of appetite, poor sleep, poor concentration, happy and sad memories, and/or mild feelings of guilt.If depressed, you may experience symptoms of grief, but also the following: feelings of worthlessness or emptiness, helplessness, extreme guilt, suicidal thoughts, loss of interest in pleasurable activities, extreme fatigue, and/or severe weight loss.
Pay attention to how good memories of your spouse make you feel. Do warm memories of your spouse give you some comfort or joy? Or do you feel emptiness and loss that even good memories cannot relieve? If you experience the latter, it may be a sign that you are depressed., What matters is how you feel you are grieving. The loss of your spouse is between you and your spouse. There is no right or wrong answer for the right amount of time to move on. If someone is telling you that you aren't grieving properly, thank her for her concern and tell her that everyone grieves differently.
You may run into someone who thinks that you are either healing ""too fast"" or who thinks you are healing ""too slow"" and have become stuck in your grief. If this happens, be sure to keep in mind that while this person's intentions are probably good and that he wants to see you healed, it is up for you to decide when you are ready to move on.

, There is a time when you need to cry and go through the suffering to get to the other side. There will come a time when you are ready to actively participate in grief work to bring healing to have a new life. Although you had no choice in the loss of your spouse, you can choose how you respond to the situation and how you aim to move on with your life.


That said, in the loss of your spouse, you have faced a drastic change. It is best not to make any other drastic changes right away while you are still navigating your loss., You loved this person enough to be with him until the end. You will remember him. Take comfort in knowing that memories of him will always be in your mind to recall whenever you want to. Let yourself become busy with life; it may do you good in your journey toward emotional healing. Don't think that if you become busy you will forget or that you are disrespecting your spouse. Life requires your attention and hard work. It is normal to be busy with life and it is not a sign that you are forgetting him.

, Studies show that having a pet is associated with increased well-being, decreased loneliness, and with being less preoccupied with one's thoughts than among non-pet owners.If you don't have the energy to give a great amount of attention to a pet, consider a cat. They make great companions. They are clean and do not have to be walked. They give you love and affection. They give you someone to care for and care about. They will greet you when you come home, and lie on your lap while you watch TV. If you are not a cat person, get a dog, or whatever pet makes you happiest or provides you with a sense of well-being or worth. Understand that the pet will not replace your love, nor is she meant to, but animals can make you smile and listen to you when you feel like talking to fill a lonely day.

, Volunteer your time to a cause or something that you feel strongly about. Helping others can have a wonderful effect on ourselves. In fact, studies show that helping out others make us happier.Take it slow; start out just once a week for an hour and see how it goes for you, then build up from there as you are ready.

, When things like your spouse's birthday, or some holidays come to pass, you may experience especially strong feelings of sadness. Also be aware that certain locations, smells, or sounds that are associated with your spouse can trigger feelings of sadness. Although this is normal, there are some steps you can take to mitigate the emotional pain you experience.For example, if you and your spouse went shopping together at a particular store, you might consider changing where you get your groceries to avoid being overcome by sadness.
Or, you might be flooded by emotional pain when you drive by your spouse's favorite dessert place. You could plan for this by taking a different route to get to where you are going. If you can't take a different route, you might build some time into your day to let yourself experience the painful feelings that might arise in response to this cue. For example, you might leave a few minutes earlier than normal so you can air your grief in the comfort of your vehicle.
You may not know what your triggers are until you experience them. Once you figure out something that brings about grief, take note so that you can create a plan for navigating subsequent encounters with this trigger.

, Grief can take a toll on the body. To counteract its effects and ward off depression, be sure to get regular exercise, eat healthy foods, drink plenty of water, take your prescription medications, and get plenty of sleep each night so that you feel rested and alert the next day.You should aim to get 30 minutes of aerobic exercise every day.Try to eat a balanced diet of lean meats, nuts, whole grains, fruits and veggies. Avoid eating too much fat or sugar.Although the amount of water you should drink a day varies depending on many factors, aim to drink around eight glasses of water a day, but don't beat yourself up if you're a bit short of that mark as it isn't a magical number. Aim to get around seven to eight hours a sleep each night, adjust as needed so that you feel rested in the morning., Although it may be tempting, if you drink or do other drugs in an attempt to get over your loss, you may just find yourself more anxious and depressed than before. This is because, at least in the case of alcohol (but certainly for at many other drugs, too), the effects of drinking can lead to symptoms of depression and anxiety.Be especially wary of abusing alcohol if you are a man, as there is evidence that men are more likely to drink to cope with loss than are women., One way to help get over a loss is to become closer to other people. One way of increasing your social closeness is by becoming an active participant in your community. Studies in fact show that helping others out can reduce stress and increase feelings of social closeness. To join in, look for flyers around your neighborhood, ask your neighbors, or search the internet for upcoming events you might take part in.

, Look for someone who specializes in grief counseling if you can. In some cases, experienced counselors or therapists can help you overcome your grief and process the emotions you are dealing with. To find a psychologist near you, try this website.

, You may find it comforting to talk to others who have also experience loss.These individuals might be able to provide you with a perspective only gleaned from personal experience with loss.


You can search for support groups by going online, asking your grief counselor or therapist, or by looking in your local newspaper.

, After enough time has passed and you have moved on, allow yourself a major change to provide yourself with some excitement about life again. Now is the time to do it! Be anything you want to be. Become an artist, a pilot, or a scuba diver. Take a ride in a hot air balloon.


Most of all, strive to be happy and fulfilled. Your dreams can become a reality and help fill the void in your life. You will meet new people and realize that life can be satisfying and exciting even if you are alone.

Seek therapy.,
Be aware of therapy ethics.,
Keep a journal.,
Practice self-care.,
Avoid numbing behaviors.,
Find trustworthy people.,
Find a support group.",How to Deal with a Destructive Parent As an Adult1," Seek a qualified therapist to help you unpack your feelings from childhood that carry into your adult life and relationships. Your therapist will help you work through emotions, deal with unhealthy thought patterns, and help you strategize in dealing with your parent.


While not everyone needs to see a therapist to manage problems with their parents, it can be helpful, particularly if you feel as though you are struggling. Signs you may benefit from therapy include: feelings of helplessness and sadness, your problems not improving, excessive worrying or constantly being on edge, or struggling with addiction issues (like alcohol or drug use).;
, Therapists are bound by a strong code of ethics by their association or state governing board. This is for your own protection, so that you feel safe in self-disclosing your feelings to your therapist for the most beneficial treatment. In dealing with the trauma from a parent, however, some regulations may be important to remember:


Your therapist cannot diagnose your parent in absentia. They may give you strategies for dealing with someone who has an alcohol problem, for example, but they cannot say, “Yes, your mother is an alcoholic,” without independently evaluating her.Your therapist is bound by confidentiality, but they are mandated reporters. If you have a minor sibling in the home who is experiencing abuse, or another parent who is abused or neglected, they are required by law to report these incidents., You may find it helpful to write down some of your emotions and examine your childhood memories privately. Journaling helps you clarify your emotions and get to know yourself better.Journaling allows you to keep a record of your thoughts. Looking back on your old writing helps you see thought patterns and remember incidents (and your reactions to them) you may have forgotten. This can lead to greater self-awareness and personal growth.
If you are in therapy, you can bring your journal to your therapist and read some of your self-reflections.

, Self-care refers to behaviors and techniques a person can use to reduce stress and increase a feeling of well-being. Self-care practices help you bring more balance to your life. They also help you recognize your limits: you begin to feel a need for self-care in your body, or in a fatigued mental state. Self-care techniques vary for different people.Think about what activities you enjoy that feel restorative to you. You may feel better after dinner with a close friend, extra sleep, attending a religious service, or exercising. Try to incorporate these activities into your everyday life.
You can often tell if you are in need of self-care by the signals in your body. You may feel irritable, anxious, exhausted, or forgetful.Practicing self-care can help you feel more “normal” again after a draining encounter with your parent.

, Numbing behaviors are usually addictive in nature and keep you from dealing with your emotions. These behaviors, like alcohol and drug use, binge-eating, or zoning out in front of the TV are not tools for self-care. If you struggle with addictive behaviors, consider attending a recovery meeting like Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, or Overeaters Anonymous.

, In instances where you are estranged from your parents and/or extended family, you will want to find people in your life who can help you feel emotionally supported. Be a supportive person for these people, too.


Find an older adult who can help you in a mentor capacity. Is there someone older in your life who can provide you the perspective that age brings?
Think about people who’ve “got your back.” These people might be your close friends, your roommate, extended family, members of your religious institution, or coworkers. Build your own support network. Keep in mind that different people will serve different roles for you: the friend who you can always count on for a fun time, the coworker who mentors you professionally, and so on., Look for a support group for people who cope with difficult parents. Support groups help you connect with others who have similar experiences, helping you to feel less isolated. Together, you can talk about your problems, communicate your successes, and find strategies for managing your situation.Search online for support groups. For example, try searching for “support groups for adult children of narcissists” if you believe your parent may have Narcissistic Personality Disorder. There may be in-person support groups you can attend, or you may find support in online forums.
If you are a child of an alcoholic, you may find support at Al-Anon. Teenagers of alcoholic parents may find help at Alateen."

Be relaxed and stay positive.,
Cherish the memories.,
Avoid procrastination on other things.,
Accept any help that is offered.,
Get a routine and stick with it.,
Sleep when they do.,
Interact as much as possible.,
Recognize their signals and wants.,
Get your baby to interact with outside sources.,
Keep up with all medical appointments.",How to Succeed As a New Stay at Home Mom," Your life will change dramatically. Things will not go the way you wish and you need to have a positive outlook on situations. The mood that you are in or have will reflect on the baby; so if you're feeling depressed or frustrated, the baby will act on the behavior. If you come to a point where you cannot handle a baby in your arms, either lay them down and walk away or hand them to someone else. Never under any circumstance, shake a baby.;
, Between birth and by the time your baby will hit the 1 year mark, there are so many ""new"" things, events, and moments that will occur during this time period. Create a baby journal, scrapbook, or binder of anything you want. Take lots of pictures and share them online with friends and family. Discover your baby's abilities as time goes and appreciate them.

, Taking care of a baby may consume most of your time and day, resulting in procrastination of putting other assignments or duties to the side. Place the baby in a car seat and set it on the floor of where you are, for example the kitchen if you're making dinner or washing the dishes. This way, the baby knows where you are, feels secured, and can still interact - while you can accomplish needs. Do laundry or other ""heavy duty"" things while they're taking a nap.

, Whether if it's getting a job/chore done, needing quality time to yourself, or getting a little nap of your own, don't turn down good offers if someone asks. Remember that you aren't ""Superwoman"" and you cannot always complete everything by yourself. Take this time to clear your head and take the load off your shoulders.

, Having a routine organizes your life and makes the day more comfortable for both you and your baby. The longer time period you stick with the routine, the baby will recognize the schedule more. Know that during the night hours, there should be no play-time whatsoever: it should be a straight feeding or sleeping. Have a time goal of when the bath should be given and the first attempt of putting them to sleep. If you want to take them outside for the day, set a strict daily time to return home so the routine can continue.

, Being a stay-at-home mother to newborns or babies is an exhausting job. Change and match your sleeping patterns to theirs. Realize that you may need to sacrifice doing things that you may want to do while they're sleeping, but know that you and your health comes first on that list. As the months go by, your baby will sleep for a longer period of time during the night. Use your own judgment of how you use the time, but know that a 6 month old will still wake up in the middle of the night.

, There are so many ways and possibilities of interacting with a baby. Talk to them while playing, sing to them while changing diapers, imitate their sounds and cooing noises, interact with other family members or pets, or play games. Use ""tummy time"" as much as possible. Start teaching them how to roll over to their sides and how to hold their head up by themselves.

, Newborns will be a little more difficult in trying to find out what is wrong or how to fix a situation. But as time goes, babies will show signs and signals to what they want. They will also want to be in the most comfortable position, so you may find yourself walking around while feeding them instead of sitting down or being held in a specific way.

, Take them to a newly parent class or meeting, a park, or a place that you frequently go to, for example a coffee shop. Interaction with your baby makes them more comfortable around non-family members and will adapt to smile at strangers. Invest in a stroller or a baby sling and go for a walk on a regular basis. Have them see the world through their new eyes.

, Your baby's health is seriously important and so is going to every doctor's check up. Keep a log or reminder calendar of when your baby gets their required immunization shots. Call in advance for any medication refills instead of requesting them at the last minute. Ask the pediatrician any questions that you may have about anything. Knowing something is better than doubting and guessing.

Decide your level of involvement.,
Communicate your boundaries to your parent.,
Learn to say no.,
Implement self-care strategies when seeing your parent.,
Keep your distance.",How to Deal with a Destructive Parent As an Adult2," Set boundaries with your parent and determine how much you want to be involved in and connected to their life. Different people and different situations demand different boundaries, so the only person who can tell you what’s best for you is yourself (perhaps with the input of your partner, close friend, or therapist).You may decide that you are only comfortable seeing your parent occasionally, perhaps only at family events where their presence is diffused.
You may only feel comfortable communicating via phone or email with your parent, and not be comfortable seeing them in person.
If you have children, you may wish to limit your parent’s contact with them. You may decide to agree to letting your parent see them only while you are present, and say no to offers of babysitting and overnights, for example.

, Let your parent know what they can expect from you and what, in turn, you expect from them. Indicate what the consequences will be if they do not adhere to your expectations.You could say, “I have decided to come home for Christmas. If you are verbally abusive to me during our visit, I will call you out on it, and then I will leave.”
Do not be afraid to let your parent to know your limits. Going into a situation with clear expectations can help avoid hurt feelings and confusion. You could say, “I know that we have had our problems in the past. When I visit next week, I want to be clear with you about what I will tolerate.”, Refuse to get more involved with your parent than you are comfortable. If you are uncomfortable setting limits, remember how you may become angry and resentful otherwise.Find ways to say no. Figure out how you are comfortable saying no, but make sure it is firm and leaves no room for misunderstanding. You could say, “I’m sorry, Mom, but that’s not going to work,” or “No, unfortunately I can’t make that event.”
If you are not comfortable saying no directly, you could offer something in exchange that you are willing to do. For example, “Mom, I can’t help you move on Saturday, but I can come over the following week and help you unpack for a few hours,” or “No, taking the kids out for pizza won’t work, but you are welcome to come over for dinner next week.”

, Prior to an encounter, decide how you can keep yourself emotionally “safe” from your parent’s harm. These will be different for every person and depend on the situation. If you are in therapy, you may wish to discuss strategies with your therapist.If your parent lives nearby and you are visiting them for the day, you may wish to set a time limit for your visit. You could tell your parent, “We need to leave by two o’clock.”
If you are visiting your parent from out of town, you could insist on getting a hotel while you are visiting, in order to get some physical distance and recovery time from the toxic environment.
You may decide to leave right away if your parent is being verbally abusive or is engaging in substance abuse, giving them no second chances.

, If they have “disowned” you or you are estranged from them for some reason, respect their boundaries and give them the space they want. It may be extremely painful, even though you have consistently been treated poorly by your parent throughout your life. If this is the case, consider finding a therapist to help you work through conflicting emotions.Put it in perspective. Even though it is painful to be estranged from your family, think of how the space will allow you to get some freedom and grow into your own, stronger person.
Give it time. Your parent may wish to communicate with you at some point down the road. Stay hopeful, but let the ball remain in their court. Let your parent initiate contact if they initiated the disconnect.

Consider talking to your parent.,
Forgive your parent.,
Realize their poor parenting wasn’t your fault.,
Apologize for your mistakes if necessary.,
Hope for the best, but keep your expectations low.",How to Deal with a Destructive Parent As an Adult3," If you feel emotionally healthy enough, and if you think you parent will be receptive, you could consider talking to them about your feelings and experiences. This could help you come to a better understanding of your relationship with your parent and hear your parent’s perspective. An honest, open conversation with your parent could offer new insight on your past.If you choose to have a conversation with a parent who was abusive, or who struggles with mental illness or addiction issues, it may be wise to have this conversation in the presence of a therapist. A therapist can also help you prior to the conversation with your parent about what you can expect, as well as coach you on what you want to say.
It may feel freeing to express yourself to your parent, but understand that they might feel under attack and defensive.
You and your parent could decide what you want to do next. For example, “Dad, we’ve gone a few years hardly speaking to each other. What should our relationship look like going forward?”

, Sometimes we become weighed down by our grudges and resentments: “If only he had done this,” or “I still can’t believe she treated me like that.” Forgiveness is coming to a place of acceptance about the past and vowing to let go of the anger you have been clinging to.Forgiveness doesn’t mean that you condone the behavior. Rather, you are refusing to let it anger you any longer, and you are coming to a place of peace and acceptance about the past.
Just because you forgive someone doesn’t mean that you will have them in your life and everything will be wonderful. Often, people may choose not to have any contact with those they forgive. Forgiveness is often more for yourself than for the other person. Besides psychological and emotional benefits, there are lots of health benefits to forgiveness, including lower blood pressure and a stronger immune system.You may wish to develop a ritual to acknowledge your forgiveness. You may decide to throw something into the sea, or write a note with all your anger and bitterness and set it on fire or rip it to shreds., There will be a huge surge of hurt in your heart when you realize that your parent let you down. You were born into parents that were too self involved or concentrated on the wrong things to the point of destruction. This is not your fault, but how you deal with it is your responsibility.


Do not allow yourself to be made to feel guilty or ashamed for your childhood behavior. If your parent says, “You were such a mouthy child, it’s no wonder I lost my temper,” you could say, “You had no excuse to verbally berate a child the way you did.”

, Be the bigger person and admit fault if you contributed to the family dysfunction in some way. This may be difficult if you are still waiting on an apology from your parent for their behavior, but do it anyway. Be a role model for the behavior you would like to see in your parent.


You could say, “I’m sorry I caused so much trouble in the family when I was drinking as a teenager. I know that it was hard on you.”
Do not, however, be coerced into making an apology for being a “bad” child. You could say, “I think our family has a lot of problems, and I think I tried to deal with them any way I could.”

, Your parent may change someday down the road. If you are in contact with your parent, you can encourage them to seek counseling or join a substance abuse support group to get help. Perhaps little nudges in the right direction will make a difference. But keep your expectations reasonable. If your parent has never been anything but emotionally distant from you, for example, there is likely little possibility of that changing.


Accept that you can't control your parent’s actions. The only behavior you can change is your own. Changing your own behavior, by speaking up or setting limits, may in turn impact their behavior. For example, if your alcoholic parent is drinking around you, you could say, “I told you we wouldn’t be spending time with you if you are drinking,” and end your visit."

Remember that independent people pay their own way.,
Respect the home.,
Respect your parent's privacy.,
Adopt a balanced approach.,
Agree on a signal system between you and your parents to offer whenever you feel the need for extra privacy, or space.,
Use the opportunity.,
Provide adequate care for your children if you are bringing them home with you.,
Think things through, then make your own decisions.,
Spend time alone.,
Set a firm date to move out of your parent's home and stick to it.,
Treat your parents.,
Maintain an attitude of appreciation.,
Remember that being independent means taking care of your own basic needs, paying your own way, and contributing to society.",How to Be Independent when Living in Parent's House," While living in your parent's home you may feel inclined, or even encouraged, to neglect your financial responsibilities; resist the temptation. Create a plan and a budget, discuss what payment your parents will need from you (zero is not acceptable) and begin contributing to the household immediately and consistently.;
, While living in your parent's home, ensure that you, and anyone you invite into the home, abide by the rules of the house. If you or a friend cause damage, fix it immediately at your own expense and apologize.

, Much ado is made over an adult child losing their sense of privacy when they move back in with their parents. Your focus should be on making the smallest dent possible in your parent's privacy. Follow their lead, if in doubt. For example: If their bedroom door is kept closed, keep yours closed as well. By your presence, no matter how welcome, your parents will be losing precious, quiet moments they once had to themselves, or to share with one another. Make a concerted effort to preserve their quiet, undisturbed moments.

, Do for your parents what they no longer wish to, or can, do for themselves. For example: Become the housekeeper in the home. (That's housekeeper, not martyr.) Taking care of the household for your parents (with the exception of making the big decisions) will give you a sense of responsibility and usefulness, and keep you in practice for when you're out on your own again.

, A simple, pre-determined, wave of the hand from you or one of them can prevent unnecessary questions when one of you unexpectedly encounters the need for a moment of breathing room.

, While in your parent's home, take advantage of the opportunity to impress them with all that you've learned while out on your own. Take on projects to improve their home in ways you, or they, have only dreamed of. Put all your skills to good use and make them glad they reopened their home to you.

, Your parents have already made the traditional sacrifices of privacy, dream chasing, and time while raising you, make sure you are providing for your children's needs. Provide limits and boundaries for your children to follow while in your parent's home and protect your parent's status as grandparents; free to enjoy special time with their grandchildren, but not charged with partial responsibility for them.

, It is vital that you maintain and continue building your strength in decision making while living with your parents. Do not carry all of your burdens to the kitchen table seeking advice; be selective. For example: If you've left your spouse and brought the kids home to live with you, any decisions you might have to make regarding the school the children will attend should be decided upon by you and your spouse.

, Take walks around the neighborhood, go to a park, or visit the library every day. Spending time alone will prevent you from clouding your thoughts about your future with the thoughts and/or hopes of your parents. They've allowed you to stay in their home for a time; you must, therefore, take advantage of that time by using it to create a more stable independent future for yourself.

, Pick a date to leave the house, even if selected arbitrarily. Let your parent's know when you intend to leave. Don't disappoint yourself or them by missing the date.

, Do something special for your parents at every opportunity and thank them for going out of their way to accommodate your needs. Make them dinner, buy a bottle of wine for them to share, or get them a gift certificate to go out to dinner or to a movie together.

, Regardless of the circumstances that caused you to need to move in with your parents, maintain a respectful and appreciative attitude while in their home. Defer to them in any conflict that arise like you would if a stranger invited you into their home.

, Make sure that you are doing each of these things every day to prevent you from developing dependent habits that can distract from your efforts to get back out on your own quickly.

Face the situation.,
Practice empathy.,
Talk about your emotions.,
Allow your parent to accept death.",How to Care for a Dying Parent1," Though it may be difficult, you should not pretend that everything is okay. You should not lie to your loved one or yourself. Though it may be uncomfortable and hard to deal with, not facing the fact that your parent is dying can cause additional stress and pain.If you don’t know what to say, listen to what your parent says about death and dying. If they bring the subject up, respond to them. Don’t change the subject.;
, Taking care of dying parents can be frustrating and difficult. You may be able to see how much pain your parent is in and how upset they are because of their condition. Through your frustration, just remember how difficult it is for your parent to be dying and have a decreased quality of life.Your parent may snap at you, stop talking, become dejected, or act in other negative ways. Don’t take it to heart or lose your temper with them.

, You and your parent should communicate about the way you feel. Don’t think that you should only be strong and act happy for the sake of your parent. If you are honest about the way you feel, then your parent will feel like they can be honest, too.Expressing your feelings, even if they are feelings of sadness or pain, is healthy. This is a difficult time, so you and your parent should talk about it and share your feelings.

, Grief comes in five stages, but people do not go through the stages in the same way. People also deal with death and accept it in different ways. Allow your parent to accept their death in their unique way.For example, some people may start planning for their deaths but also buy vacation packages for a time after they will be gone. Trying to get your parent to snap out of the denial stage is futile. Just let them go through it and support them.

Always remember that disagreements are a normal part of daily life.,
Do not marginalize the older parent by excluding them completely from important decision making activities.,
Realize that the memory tends to fail with age.,
Understand that elderly parents will suffer a general decline in health.,
Remember that you too will reach old age at some point in time.,
Give them the respect and dignity they deserve.,
Make them a part of your daily life.,
Make them proud of themselves and you.",How to Adapt to Aging and Elderly Parents," If everyone agreed on everything, life will become mundane and monotonous. Respect the decisions and values of the older generation. They simply have a different view on life that may not be in keeping with up to date technology and modern times. They have raised you, so give them some credit for the way you turned out. Try to meet them halfway by blending your own ideals with those of theirs. You may come up with a spectacular solution that you never thought of before.;
, Very often we tend to give very little credit to the vast experience and the wisdom of our elderly parents.Marginalization makes the parent feel hopeless and unwanted which in turn leaves them with no choice but to become rebellious and look to others for comfort, usefulness and belonging.

, As our parents age, the memory capacity tends to weaken. Very often they will forget to remember completing little chores or taking a proper message for you by telephone. Please be patient as you would, when dealing with a child. The natural course of time is having an effect on their memories and this is seldom due to carelessness or sloppiness. Avoid becoming agitated or passing hurtful and sarcastic comments.

, Be supportive when they complain about minor aches and pains. Avoid adopting the attitude of neglect or simply ignoring every little complaint you are faced with. Drive them to the local clinic, hospital or even a private doctor if the need arises. You may save them from further harm to their health and their general well being. This also proves to them that you care and parents take great comfort in knowing that their child or children care for them.

, The cycle of life continues as does everything else. You will not want to be treated badly by your own kids , so refrain from doing the same to your parents.

, One can understand that aging parents can be difficult , sometimes even completely unreasonable. Listen with attention and find the humor in this to help you relax and calm or smooth the situation over. Always remember that you are what you are because of them due to the proper care and nourishment they afforded you with. The buck does not stop here. It is the duty of every child to act with responsibility to aging and elderly parents.

, In the middle of being busy with your own life and family, try including your parents into this daily routine. Other issues such as medication times need to be scheduled into your other activities to cater for the needs of ailing parents. Where possible use hired help if necessary. Incorporate the help and input from other siblings or family members.

, A comfort dwells when parents know that their children are there for them when or if the need arises. The smiles and happiness reciprocates leaving you feeling fulfilled and content.

Remember that your help or support will be needed long term.,
There will be false starts, and setbacks.,

Be practical.,
Be free with physical shows of support.,
Do some research on the grieving process.,
Expect the grief to increase not decrease.,
Don't try to mend things and don't try to counsel or advise.,
Never compare a child's death with a non-child death of your own you've experienced.,
Don't be afraid to talk about the child.,
Don't just disappear.,
Give them space.",How to Help a Bereaved Parent," It is going to take time.;
, Be prepared for the emotional ups and downs with them. Your love and compassion is just what they need.

, It doesn't matter what you need to cancel to be there. Making the effort to attend means a lot to the parents and shows them how much you care about their lost child, and that you are counted among those who intend to remember and aid the family in their time of loss.

, Grieving parents need space to grieve. You can help this by providing meals, offering to keep the garden tidy, cleaning the house, or running errands for them. Do the everyday mundane things that suddenly seem pointless to them. Stay in close contact; simply calling and visiting can be a huge source of practical support.

, Give lots of hugs. Give the parent your shoulder to cry on literally.


Hold the parent and let them cry. Many many tears are normal and healthy.

, Go online and read about what parents feel when they lose a child. Jump into forums and talk to other people about their feelings and the things that helped them through during the initial stages of their grief. Sites such as Compassionate Friends can be a good place to start.

, This is grief for life, even if one day it is be the perennial missing-part-of-the-heart type grief; it's not something to ""get over"". Accept that there is no time frame on grief. For now, it will continue to grow in magnitude and you are much needed as the grief overwhelms your friend. Be a shoulder to cry on, someone who will listen, someone who will not judge, and someone who will keep being there, no matter what. Accept that a bereaved parent will never ever get over the loss of their child, but know in time, lots of time, they will get through it.


Don't ever tell the parent to ""Get over it"", or ""Get on with your life, your child would want you to.""
Never say ""You can always have more children"" if the parent is mourning the death of a baby or very young child. This is one of the most insensitive things to say to a grieving parent. And grandchildren are no substitute for lost adult children either; just don't go down this avenue of platitudes.
One really good phrase is simply: ""Tell me how you feel."" This lets the parent open up and talk in any direction wished. And to cry or scream if they want to as well.

, Unless you're professionally trained to handle grief, leave this part to the professionals. Your role is as someone who cares, listens, and respects the grieving parent. If you're inclined to offer religious or personally based advice, be one hundred percent sure it's welcome.


Allow the parent to talk about their child.
Allow the parent to cry, scream, sob, and be angry. Simply allow them to feel all of their feelings. It's their right.
If you don't know what to say, say nothing, just listen. Saying nothing is better than saying something like, ""He is in a better place"", ""He is with God now"", etc. If you feel better saying something, simply explain that you don't know what to say if that's what you're feeling. It's better to be honest than to bumble along and potentially make things worse.
Don't force or overly encourage the parent to socialize, or return to work.
Never put them down or discourage them from seeking support online with other bereaved parents.

, The loss of a child carries very different connotations from the loss of a parent, sibling, or friend. Parents will often tell you that they wish it could have been them instead of the child and this is a feeling that haunts them for many years after. The pain after loss of a child does differ from any other loss of a person you know and love; accept this and acknowledge it where needed.


Share your pain over the loss of their child, but remember your pain is nowhere near their pain unless you have lost a child yourself. There is no greater pain than the death of one's child. Never tell a bereaved parent you know how they feel or you understand because you probably do not.
Do not compare the loss of your job, marriage, pet, or grandparent to the loss of their child.

, Every parent wants to know their child is not forgotten. And listen to the parents when they want to talk about their child. Whether the child was young or an adult, there will be many memories that the parents will want to talk about, as a way of bringing the child back into temporary existence.


If you talk about their child and they cry, it's okay. Allow them their tears, and know that you didn't hurt them.

, This can be the ultimate letdown for a grieving parent, to lose someone who was once a friend, a rock. The concern you feel at not knowing what to say or do is nothing compared to the pain, sadness, and loneliness the grieving parent experiences. It's better to put your foot into it and apologize than to just fade away and cease to be a resource your friend can count on.


Remember the parent on Mother's Day and Father's Day, they are still a parent.
Remember the child's birthday. Send a card saying that you remember their child.
Remember the child's date of death. Send a thinking of you card, call them, share good memories about their child, and listen.

, As well as letting them know you're there for them, also accept that the bereaved parent may want to seclude themselves. Be wise to signals of distress about having you around and gently withdraw, still letting them know that you're there for them whenever they need you, just a call or text away.

Draw up a power of attorney.",How to Care for a Dying Parent2," End-of-life care is a personal decision, but often when treating the illness is no longer an option, hospice care might be the best solution. Hospice care involves care meant to relieve any suffering or pain caused by an illness, along with support, and is available to those who are expected to pass within six months.To qualify for hospice care, a doctor must certify that your parent is terminally ill and has six months or less to live.Many receive hospice care when they have stopped treatment for the illness and wish simply to be comfortable and as pain-free as possible.
Hospice care may be a good choice if your parent would like to spend less time at the hospital and more time at home. If inpatient treatment becomes necessary, this can be arranged by the hospice.
This type of care can also be helpful if your parent needs help with everyday tasks, such as eating, dressing, bathing, and walking.

, An advance directive is a legal document. The document provides instructions to doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel about your parent’s wishes if they become unresponsive or unable to make medical decisions for themselves. Each state has different laws for advance directives, so ask your doctor or research the guidelines for your area.Talk to your parent about their wishes. Do not make decisions for them. Even if you don’t agree, if after discussion your parent still wants that care, respect their decision.
Decide what end-of-life care your parent would like. For example, ask they if they would like to be kept on life support. You should also decide what medical procedures your parent will agree to and won’t agree to if they are unable to decide for themselves.
Discuss options with your parent’s doctor if you are not sure what should be included.

, Your parent should also come up with a power of attorney. This is another document that provides your parent’s instructions in case they are unable to provide it. The power of attorney specifically gives a designated person the responsibility to make decisions for your parent if they cannot make them for themselves.The person named in the power of attorney should be someone your parent trusts completely. The person should be able to make decisions based on your parent’s wishes, not their own ideas.
Your parent should have a conversation with the person they name as their power of attorney. The person needs to learn your parent’s wishes so they can make sure all decisions are ones your parent would make.

Be there for your parent.,
Focus on meaningful conversations.,
Touch your parent.,
Ask your parent how they want to spend their time.",How to Care for a Dying Parent3," Even if you cannot take care of your parent all the time, you can still be there for them during important times. You can visit them, go with them to appointments, or spend time with them. Even though it may hurt you to see them in their condition, don’t ignore them or refuse to go see them.For example, if they go into the hospital, make sure that you go visit them there. Go to doctor’s appointments or treatments with them. Go visit them in a non-medical capacity.
Being with them lets them know you care and can give them comfort during difficult times.

, When your parent is nearing the end of their life, they may want to talk about certain important things. This may include memories or stories they would like to share with you before they are gone. They may want to talk about regret and forgiveness, or even explore reasons they should be thankful. Don’t try to deter them from these conversations. Instead, encourage them and listen to your parent.Pay attention to what your parent says. Often, people try to tell loved ones messages or get them to understand something they may not understand how to say. Listen closely to what your parent says and try to get the message they want to convey.

, Dying people often feel depressed, anxious, and isolated. This may stem from people avoiding them because they don’t want to face the fact that they are dying. Maintaining a physical closeness is important in the last months of a person’s life. To help with this, touch the person and stay close to them.This may include hugs or holding hands. You may put a comforting hand on their arm. Sometimes, a gentle massage can help them not only relax, but also feel connected.

, People want to spend their final days in different ways. Some people like to have large groups around them and see all their family and friends. Others may like only one or two people with them at a time. Ask them what would make them comfortable or happy.You can also ask them if they would like to listen to music or watch television. This can often be comforting. However, some people don’t like noise and find it distracting and hard on their senses.

Discuss the prognosis with the doctor.,
Talk to the doctor about treating and managing symptoms.,
Turn your parent often.,
Offer to help feed them.,
Control the temperature.",How to Care for a Dying Parent4," When you find out that your parent is dying, talk to the doctor. Find out what treatment will be done and what management techniques should be used. You need to find out how much care they will need and what arrangements you can make for it.If you are not going to be the primary caregiver, get your parent’s permission to discuss medical needs with them.

, Often, people who are dying undergo pain management to help with their pain. Other problems, like respiratory or digestive problems and fatigue, are also something doctors treat terminal patients for or help them learn how to manage. Discuss your parent’s treatment and management plan with their doctor, and be sure to let the doctor know if something isn't working.Often, morphine and other painkillers are prescribed to help ease pain and provide comfort. Morphine also helps with shortness of breath. Medications can also be prescribed for nausea or vomiting.
Dry skin can occur in terminal patients. Alcohol-free lotions and lip balms can help skin and lips, while ice chips or damp cloths can help with dry mouth.

, Bed sores are a common problem when people are bedridden and dying. To help prevent bed sores, your parent should be turned every few hours. Turn them from their side to their back, and then to the other side. Bed sores often occur on heels, hips, lower back, and the base of the skull.Foam placed under heels or elbows may help prevent bed sores.
Keeping your parent clean and their skin moisturized can also help.

, If your parent is too weak or doesn’t have the energy to eat, you can help them. Offer to feed them, making sure to do it slowly. Give them enough time to chew and swallow. Offer them food in small portions and avoid feeding them too much at once.Offer them their favorite foods if they are able to eat them.
Don’t force them to eat. Some people stop eating when they are close to dying for many reasons. You may encourage them to eat, but never force them.

, People who are dying may be sensitive to temperatures. They may be hot or cold regardless of the outside temperature. Often, they may not tell you, so watch for signs. If they are cold, make sure they have blankets and warm clothes, and turn up the heat. If they are cool, remove excess blankets, turn on a fan, and give them a cool cloth.


If they are cold, they may shiver, pull the covers around them, or have a rigid body posture. If they are hot, they may be flush or sweating, and they may kick any blankets away.

Join a support group.,
Find ways to relax.,
Ask for help.",How to Care for a Dying Parent5," If you are the caregiver or just are dealing with your parent dying, consider joining a support group. You can join one that deals specifically with terminal illness and grief. If you take care of your parent, you can join a caregiver support group. This can give you some much needed emotional support during this trying time. You may also receive tips or ideas to help care for your parent.Talk to the doctor or local hospital about any support groups in your area. You can also look online, or join an online support group.

, You may feel like taking care of yourself is the last thing you should be worried about while your parent is dying. However, running yourself ragged will not help anyone. Make sure you take breaks, find ways to relax, and not let yourself get too run down.Talk to your family and friends. This can be very therapeutic, especially since this is a difficult situation.

, You cannot do everything alone. There is nothing wrong with asking others for help. This might be to do errands for you, stay with your parent so you can take a break, make dinner, or just to listen when you need it.You can ask siblings, your significant other, children, or other family members to help. If you or your parent have close family friends, see if they can help out.
If you or your parent are involved in a religious organization, you may want to ask a religious leader for help. Often, these people can be great sources of help and support.
You can also hire a home care worker to assist you. You can specify what exactly you need help with (providing meals, cleaning the house, medical care, and so on) and hire a home care agency to send assistance, or privately hire someone of your choosing.

Ask your parents what their concerns are.,
Talk to your parents alone.,
Talk about the situation as a group.,
Reassure your parents.",How to Cope when Your Parents Dislike Your Fiance1," If you don’t already know why your parents dislike your fiancé, you should ask them. Once you know exactly what their concerns are, you can take steps to address them and hopefully improve the relationship.


You might say, for example, “Mom, Dad, I know that you don’t care for my fiancé very much. But I’m not sure why. Could we talk about it?”
Or, you might directly say to them, “Could you tell me why you don't like my fiancé?”;
, It may be easier for you to begin the process of overcoming your parents’ dislike for your fiancé without your future spouse’s presence. You’re likely to have a greater comfort level this way, and your parents may be more willing to speak freely.You don’t have to hide this from your fiancé, though; say something like “I’m going to talk to my parents about why they seem to dislike you. I think it will be best if we bring you into the discussion a little later.”
Listen carefully and calmly to what your parents have to say. Find out if the problem is finances, prospects, attitude, background, beliefs, or some other factors.

, After you’ve spoken to your parents alone, or, right from the start if you prefer, sit down with them and your fiancé and talk about the situation. Having open and honest communication about what is going on and how your parents feel may bring a peaceful and happy resolution to the situation.Try to talk at a neutral place like a restaurant or a park. You all may be less likely to get upset in a public place like this.
You might tell your parents and your fiancé, “We’re all going to sit down and talk about this situation so that we can work it out.” Be calm but firm in your insistence that your marriage plans will not be derailed and that an accommodation must be reached.

, Sometimes parents have concerns about their future in-laws because of worries they have for their child’s happiness. Talk to your parents about your decision and let them know that they have nothing to worry about.This can help alleviate some of their worries and help them like your fiancé a bit better.


For example, you could say, “You guys raised me well and I hope you can trust that I’ve thought this decision through. I know that I’m making the right choice and that I’m planning for a successful future with my fiancé.”
Or, you might say, “I know that you want the best for me. If you give my fiancé a chance, I’m sure that your feelings will change.”

"
"
Remain neutral.,
Be honest with everyone.,
Try to compromise.",How to Cope when Your Parents Dislike Your Fiance2," Avoid taking sides in any confrontations between your parents and your fiancé. This not only will make one side feel betrayed, but may make the situation even worse. The best thing you can do to diffuse the situation is to remain neutral and let both sides know that you care about them and respect their feelings.You might say something like, “I know that there are difficult feelings on both sides. Let’s just all calm down and take a step back.”
Don’t let yourself get dragged into an “It’s them or me” ultimatum; keep saying “I love each of you deeply and I know we can work this out, or at least learn to tolerate one another.”

, You may be tempted to give your fiancé the impression that your parents really like them. You might not want to let your parents even know that you’re engaged. The best thing to do when your parents dislike your fiancé is to be honest with everyone about what’s going on.For example, you might have to tell your fiancé, “I know you really like my parents, but they don’t care for you very much. I hope that will change some as they get to know you.”
Or, you might need to tell your parents, “I know you don't like my fiancé, but we are in love and are planning to get married. I don't want this to come between us.”
The truth will come out eventually, so it’s best to stay ahead of things and address problems before they fester.

, Your parents and your fiancé may never see completely eye-to-eye. However, they can reach a compromise that all of you can cope with. Sit down with your parents and your fiancé and try to work out a plan for how you all can interact and be a family together without any negativity.For example, you might tell your parents, “I know you may never fully embrace Jamie. But we’re going to all be a family soon no matter what, so we need to sit down and work out a way to manage our problems together.”
In some cases, letting your parents get to know your fiancé better might help; in others, it may be best to limit contact to necessary, defined situations.

"
"
State your position clearly.,
Adjust your wedding plans as needed.,
Create a plan for managing family interactions.",How to Cope when Your Parents Dislike Your Fiance3," If you’ve tried communicating and compromising and there’s simply no way that your parents will ever be able to embrace your fiancé, you need to stand firm. Be clear that their disapproval will not change how you feel about your partner or your plans for a life together.Say something like, “Mom, Dad, this is my decision to make and your disapproval will not change it. I’m sorry you can’t accept the person I love, but I love you too and always will.”

, When you dreamed of your wedding day, it probably didn’t include your parents sitting there stone-faced in disapproval — or worse, not there at all. Don’t ignore reality and expect everyone to embrace happily on the big day. Instead, make adjustments to your wedding plans to limit unnecessary interactions or even to account for your parents’ absence.If, for instance, you’re having a civil ceremony because your fiancé doesn’t share your religious background, and this upsets your traditionalist parents, don’t try to force them to come. Tell them something like, “Remember, the ceremony is at 2 o’clock at the courthouse. I’ll make sure there are seats for both of you if you decide to come. And I really hope you do.”

, Once you’re married, you’ll have to continue to navigate the difficult relationship between your spouse and your parents. As before, honesty, open communication, and practical adjustments are key. Clear the air when necessary, seek out compromises, and be reasonable about limiting interactions when needed.


For instance, go to family gatherings alone sometimes, or be clear beforehand that the two of you can only stay a set amount of time. You should also plan an exit strategy ahead of time in case things go sour quickly.

"
"
Talk to each other.,
Empathize with your fiancé.,
Consider couples’ counseling.",How to Cope when Your Parents Dislike Your Fiance4," Don’t try to ignore or deny the problems caused by your parents’ dislike for your fiancé. If anything, use it as added motivation to strengthen the relationship you have with your partner. Communicate openly and often about your feelings and concerns, listen attentively, and seek support and solutions from each other.For instance: “You’ve probably noticed I’ve been feeling down about my parents’ refusal to accept you. Can we talk a bit about it and see if we can come up with any ideas?”

, Your parents’ negative attitude will weigh on you, but it will also impact your partner. They will likely feel some amount of guilt for causing this rupture between you and your parents. Be clear with your fiancé that you don’t blame them and that you support and love them just the way they are.


Watch signs that your partner is stressed, sad, or feels guilty about the issue, and also be mindful of the signals you are putting out. Are you acting like your fiancé’s partly to blame even if you keep saying “It’s not your fault”? Talk and listen openly and honestly., Family disapproval can destroy romantic relationships by sowing seeds of doubt or distrust. If you truly want your forthcoming marriage to succeed, don’t be afraid to seek out professional help in working through the problems caused by your parents’ dislike for your fiancé. Being determined to make a relationship work is a sign of strength, not weakness.


Talking with a therapist can help reduce the stress created by the unpleasant reality of your parents’ disapproval. You can also engage in stress-reduction strategies with your fiancé by doing things together like exercising, meditating, trying yoga or deep breathing, or taking up relaxing hobbies.
The therapist will use their judgment on whether to include your parents in a session or two. Sometimes an outsider can connect with parents better in this kind of situation.

Allow yourself to experience your feelings.,
Express your feelings to others.,
Find creative outlets.,
Prepare for reminders.,
Reminisce.",How to Cope With the Loss of a Loved One1," Losing someone you love is an emotionally devastating experience. In the aftermath of loss, you may find yourself grappling with a variety of feelings. It's very important that you allow yourself to feel what you are feeling, even if it's bad. Suppressing your feelings is not a good idea in the aftermath of loss.


Avoiding feelings of sadness can prolong the grieving process. Also, suppressing grief can lead to things like anger, anxiety, and substance abuse. Even if pausing to consider your feelings is painful, it's important you allow yourself to feel. Do not shy away from feelings of devastation and heartbreak. Allow yourself to cry when necessary.Certain types of death or loss may be particularly difficult to process. Losing a child may provoke feelings of anger and injustice, for example. A suicide can lead to anger at the person who has died. With these kinds of losses, people often feel bad about their emotions or think how they're feeling is inappropriate or insensitive. Keep in mind no feelings are inherently good or bad. How you choose to act on your feelings can have negative consequences, but having a range of powerful emotions is normal. You should not judge yourself for feeling what you're feeling.Not all emotions in the immediate aftermath of loss are negative. It's not uncommon to feel gratitude for having been close to someone, even if they're gone. You may also find yourself smiling over fond memories. Many people find, when coping with loss, that they veer between laughter and tears. Understand all these emotions are healthy and necessary when it comes to processing loss.;
, Talking to others is very important following the loss of a loved one. Your friends and family members may not be able to provide you with direct advice, but simply having someone to listen can be cathartic. Sometimes stating your feelings out loud can help you work through them. After a loss, seek out understanding friends and family members. Express your feelings to them and seek comfort and support., Even if you're not typically a creative person, using a creative medium to express your feelings can give your grief a tangible form. Make a scrapbook or photo album commemorating your lost loved one. Write a poem, essay, or short story about your relationship with that person. Draw or paint out your feelings in abstract images and colors. This can help you get your feelings outside your own head in a concrete manner, helping you better process your emotions., After losing a loved one, reminders are constant. Reminders can be obvious, like holidays and birthdays. They can also be somewhat less tangible. Certain sights and smells, for example, can trigger memories. It's not always possible to know when you'll encounter a reminder. However, when you know a reminder is coming try to prepare.


The anniversary of someone's death can be very painful. The first birthday without that person, as well the holiday season, can also be difficult to endure. During these times, it can be helpful to simply brace yourself for an emotional reaction. Acknowledge the fact you may very well be sad on these dates and remind yourself it's important to allow yourself to experience these feelings.However, you should also make sure you care for yourself. Make sure you have someone to call or go see if you know a certain date or event will trigger feelings of grief. You want to make sure you have adequate support. You can also have something to distract. While you should acknowledge your grief, if you become overwhelmed by it it's okay to have something comforting in mind to do. You could plan to go see a movie or call an old friend., Many people find their memories comforting in the aftermath of loss. Reminiscing may be painful at first. However, with time you may come to treasure memories of your lost loved one. At the memorial and funeral service, allow yourself to share memories with others in attendance. Memory can be cathartic when it comes to coping with grief.


You can also find tangible ways to honor someone's memory. For example, you may want to donate to a charity they cared about or get involved in an organization that was important to them."
"
Pick a good setting.,
Stay calm.,
Be straightforward and honest.,
Listen and ask questions.,
Ask for advice.,
Write a letter.",How to Deal with Parents As a Young Adult1," Choose a time when your parents can sit down and talk with you without being distracted. Try to talk with your parents alone at first. If you live away from home, call and ask what time would work the best for them. Leave your significant other out of the initial conversation or your parents may feel ambushed and act defensively.


You might also gauge your parents' mood and make sure it is okay prior to talking. You could say, “Did today go okay? I have something important I’d like to talk with you about tonight.”
It’s best to avoid a public place for a conversation of this type.;
, As you tell your parents your concerns, maintain a level voice and try to keep your emotions in check, even when talking about actions that make you angry. Keep your mind focused on word choice and expressing yourself in the most accurate way possible. If you feel overwhelmed, take a break and stand or do a quick stretch.If you find yourself getting angry as your parents speak, focus on your breathing. Picture yourself breathing all of the anger out and taking positive energy in.

, You are only as good as your word, so don’t lie or elaborate. Simply recount the events from your list and include your emotional reactions. If it is easier, you may ask your parents to remain silent until you finish with an initial ‘list’ of concerns.


It’s not healthy to hold thoughts and feelings inside. They can fester and make you a bitter, angry person. Try to have constructive conversations about problematic feelings as they arise so that you don't create large-scale fights or blowouts.To avoid a defensive reaction, you might open with a positive statement, such as, ""I love you"" or ""You know I appreciate what you do for me."" Then, transition by emphasizing your feelings, ""Lately, I feel..."" When describing your feelings try to connect back to your parents by stating, ""You know that one time..."" or ""Remember when I said...""

, When your parents get a chance to talk, respect them and listen carefully. This is your opportunity to try to understand where they are coming from. There is a possibility that the same event was viewed in two different ways. Listen to them now so that you can avoid miscommunication and misinterpretation in the future.


Give them indications that you are listening. Nod your head or say “okay” as they are talking. If you disagree, reserve your response to “Hmmm” at the moment and wait until it’s your turn to talk.
Wait until they are finished and ask some questions. It may be helpful to write down any questions on a notepad as they are talking. Avoid asking “yes/no” questions and instead choose open-ended ones.It may also be helpful to thank them for listening to your concerns and providing their feedback, even if there are areas where you disagree.

, Keep parts of the conversation positive by telling your parents about your goals for the future. Discuss your financial, romantic, or work-related plans and ask for their advice. This lets them know that you value their opinion, and will request it, but you still need boundaries.


This does not mean that you need to disclose every detail of your financial situation, such as salary or debts. Nearly half of young adults don’t talk about finances with their parents.You could ask them for credit card advice. You might say, “Is it ever worth it to get a credit card with an annual fee? Why?”

, If you don’t feel comfortable talking with your parents in person, write them a detailed letter expressing your feelings, or make a list of issues you would like to address. Be honest, calm, and direct in your language. You can even ask them questions that you hope will be answered. Tell them if you would like a response in letter form, or in person.


Putting your feelings down on paper may be good for your mental health as well. It might help you work through your negative emotions."

Be patient.",How to Cope With Grief," One myth people may have about facing grief is that if you ignore your feelings or sweep them under the rug, that they will simply go away. Sure, you can go on with your life, go to work, and act like nothing happened, but in the long run, this is only going to delay your pain and make you drag out all of the sad, bitter, angry, or hurt feelings that are welling up somewhere inside you. So, the first thing you should do is admit that you're in terrible pain. Admit it to yourself, to your friends, and to your support network, and then take it from there.;
, Many times it is seen that the reason for grief is illogical, and irrational. For example some people grieve because of a habit of doing so as after when they are get over grief they feel better and triumphant. They even sometimes get addicted to this triumphant feeling after getting over their grief.

So question yourself.....

Is this grief rational or logical? People sometimes grieve for something over which they have no control of, petty things, fake reasons, etc for example if a friend fails a test. Logically you have no control or influence over their friend's failure but still they will grief instead of supporting their friend in a productive way. Another example could be rejection in an interpersonal relationship, which is most of the time is complete nonsense. Remember, failure is a part of success.
Is this reaction productive?. Ask yourself, the grief you are feeling, is it in anyway going to help me to get over the source for the grief? would it have a positive effect on my life? if yes, by all means grieve, but if no, aren't you being irrational and hard on yourself? You are feeling miserable which is not going to get you anywhere.
Can I do something about the grief? People sit there and grieve in a hope to get rescued and in the end it makes them even more sad and grievous. Instead of feeling miserable ask yourself; what can I do to fix it? if there is something which you can do about it, try to do it. However if there is nothing you can do to fix this, it would be irrational and you would be doing a huge disservice to yourself by feeling sad over which you have no control of.

, Another thing people going through a great loss tell themselves is that they should put up a strong front. You may think that nobody wants to see you crying, looking sad, being barely able to take care of yourself, and just walking around like a sleepwalker, but it's okay to do that if that's really how you're feeling. If you have to stay strong for other friends or family members, then it can get tricky, but you can still admit that you're feeling weak if you're really devastated.


Of course you don't want to completely fall apart, and you may not have to. But don't try to act ""tough"" or like you've got it all under control when you know that's not the case.

, There's no limit to how many tears a person can cry before they cease to be ""productive."" If you feel like crying, just get it all out of your system and cry again whenever you feel like it. Obviously, it's more convenient if you can cry mostly when you're not alone, and not fall victim to tears in public, but if you do, it's not the end of the world, and people will understand. Don't think that your tears are slowing you down or keeping you from moving forward., Contrary to popular belief, not everybody experiences pain the same way -- and not through tears. You can feel a deep sadness without shedding a tear, even if the people around you might think it's ""weird"" that you're not expressing your feelings more openly. Everyone grieves differently, and don't force yourself to cry if that's not what you want to do., Maybe you've heard that ""grief only lasts a year"" -- that doesn't sound so bad, right? Unfortunately, everyone has his or her own timeline when it comes to dealing with grief, and you shouldn't feel bad if you feel like months and months have gone by and you feel like you haven't made any ""progress."" It's not about progress -- it's about learning to face your feelings and seeing where they take you. People may have certain expectations for how you should be feeling at a certain point, but your own feelings should have nothing to do with what people want from you.The fact of the matter is, you'll never be able to fully ""get over"" your grief. You will be reminded of your loved one, even many years later, and that's perfectly normal. ""Getting over"" really means finding the best way to cope with your feelings so that you can move forward, which is different from ""moving on."", If you're grieving, then it's likely you've heard about how every person has to go through the five stages of grief -- denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. However, not everyone goes through all of these five stages before he or she finds peace, and not everyone goes through them in the same order, either. For example, you may feel depression first, followed by anger. If you are going through these stages, it can help to know that other people feel the same way, but don't think that you can't deal with your grief because you haven't ""reached"" all of the stages., That's what they're there for, isn't it? Your friends and family aren't just there for the fun times or the holidays. They are there to be a shoulder to cry on, and to lend you a kind ear and helping hand when you need one. Open up to a close friend or family member about your pain, and make a habit of hanging out with your loved ones in relaxed/low-pressure settings. Obviously going to loud parties with your loved ones is only going to stress you out and make you feel worse, but watching a movie or sharing a meal with a close friend can make you feel better.If you need a lot of alone time, that's okay. Don't force yourself to be social if you don't want to be. But if you feel like you don't want to be around other people at all, then you can run into trouble.






If hanging out with close friends really does have a soothing effect, then make a plan to spend even more time with them and to make your social calendar a bit busier than normal.







, If you do adhere to a specific religion, then this can be the time to get even more invested in your faith and your religious community. Talk to your pastor, rabbi, imam, or other religious leaders to find comfort and attend services and events held by your religious group. You can meet new people who offer comfort or just spend more time focusing on your faith and your religious beliefs, which will lead you to comfort as well., Support groups are filled with people who are suffering from similar losses and who can share their pain and understand yours. You may feel that you don't have many friends or family members to turn to because they don't know what you're really going through because they have never suffered a similar loss, no matter how well-meaning they may be. Support groups can give you access to people who are suffering in a similar way (though of course, no one can feel the exact same pain as any other person) and can help you build a new routine and get the help you need.


Support groups aren't for everybody. If you join one and just don't feel like it's making an impact, it's okay to leave, too.







, Sometimes, it can be a big help to share your feelings with a professional who doesn't know you on a personal level. This can help you sort out your feelings and to get more advice from a trusted source. You may also just want to talk and can feel less restricted if you're sharing your feelings with a person who doesn't know you outside of his or her office. Don't think that getting professional help means you have problems or that you're weak; it's a sign of strength to admit that you need further help.Don't worry about making people feel a little more awkward or uncomfortable around you; that's only a small risk, and it's much better to put it all out in the open instead of struggling to smile through a difficult work day when you can barely force yourself to open your email.







, This may sound ridiculous. How can a tiny little kitty make you feel better about the death of one of your closest friends? Obviously, a new pet can't replace the person that you lost, but having a pet -- if you feel stable enough to take care of it, of course -- can make you feel better for sure. You'll find comfort in being able to cuddle with a creature who loves you unconditionally and will feel strength from being able to care for another being. Pets are shown to relieve stress, and that may be another thing you need.

, It may sound silly to make sure you get 7-8 hours of sleep a day, but this is one of the most important things you can do to take care of yourself during this difficult time. Chances are, you're staying up all night worrying, or you may be spending over 14 hours a day in bed because you can't make yourself get up to face the day. Try to find a balance, getting enough sleep but not too much, even if it's a struggle to get up.


If you're having trouble sleeping, take it easy on the caffeine.






If you really can't sleep, you can get some medication if that's what your doctor thinks you need, but don't depend on it too much.







, People who are coping with grief tend to stop looking after their health. Maybe you can barely eat one meal a day because you're too sad, or maybe all you can do is order pizza twice a day because you can't bring yourself to go food shopping or to cook a normal meal. Force yourself to eat three balanced meals a day as often as you can and to make sure you're eating foods that make you feel good and energetic, not even more sluggish and tired.If you really can't bring yourself to cook, lean on a friend who can make some comforting meals for you.






Try to exercise at least once a week -- ideally, every other day, if you can. Even taking a walk for 30 minutes a day will make you feel stronger and can improve your mood.






This means staying away from alcohol until you're feeling more stable.







, Everyone reacts to grief differently, and it's great if you're already seeing a counsellor, but you need to check in with yourself to make sure you're not feeling overwhelmingly depressed, anxious, or angry. Talk to your doctor or mental health care professional if you feel unable to do almost anything, can barely leave the house, or feel anxiety or anger about your every move. Looking after your mind is just as important as looking after your body, especially during this difficult time.

, The sun has been shown to make people feel happier. Go sit in a park instead of sulking in your room. Walk that 20 minutes to the grocery store instead of driving. Sit on your back porch when you're reading instead of staying in bed. These small changes can make a big difference.

, Sitting there and constantly thinking about the grief would only bring more grief. Instead doing some productive activities would help to cope with it.

Meditate. One of the purpose of meditation is to help find the inner strength, which you are not conscious about. This inner strength can be extremely useful to feel and become strong from the inside. Meditating just about 10 minutes can be very beneficial.






Play some good music. Music has an amazing power to change mood instantaneously. So playing some good music and even trying to dance to it is a good activity to shake off your grief. Remember there is a high chance that playing sad music is not going to help you as it may make you even more sad, so happy and inspiring music is recommended.






Have fun.Remember the most important thing is to have fun.






Feel genuinely grateful for the things you have. If your friends and family is supporting you, music, good food, garden etc basically you can feel grateful for anything which has a positive effect in your life. So look up at the amazing and infinite universe, spread your arms and say 'Thank you' for what you have and try to feel the gratitude. It is a very powerful activity and exercise to get over grief.







, Writing in a journal at least once every day or two can help you take stock of your emotions, feel more in control, and feel like you're reflecting on how you're going about your everyday life. You may feel that life has been passing you by since the loss and that you've barely had time to think, and writing in a journal can help you slow down and get in more touch with your emotions.

, Grief doesn't move on an even trajectory, and yes, you will feel worse during some moments that can bring back all of the heartache. These moments tend to be the holidays, family events, or interactions with any people who remind you of your loss more than others. If you know that you're going to face an event or group of people that will make you think even more about your loved one, make sure that you have extra support and an escape plan if one is necessary.


If you're used to spending Thanksgiving with your loved one, make sure you make alternate plans for where to go months in advance so you're not home alone during this time.







, Wait until you feel calmer and more rational before making any big decisions. The loss you're feeling may make you think that's it's high time to ask for a divorce, quit your job, move across the country, or to do something very dramatic, but you should take some time to reflect before you decide whether or not this is really the best plan for you. Even if you've been thinking about these changes for a long time, it's better to make these decisions with a cool head than to do something you will regret later.Once you've made a decision in your head, give yourself at least two months to act on it. When the time rolls around, ask yourself if it was really as good of an idea as it seemed.







, Though you can't rearrange your life completely to deal with your loss, the more changes you can make, the better. Find a new coffee shop other than the one where you and your loved one went on Sunday morning. Find a new work schedule that works for you. Pick up a new hobby or interest, and throw yourself into it a few times a week. Try a new form of exercise, like yoga or running. Though you don't have to change everything in your life, especially if it was all working pretty well before, you should find some new things that give you pleasure that don't make you think of your loved one.

, This doesn't mean that you should sit back and wait for the day when your grief magically goes away. Unfortunately, that day won't come. But slowly, you will realize that you are able to live with your grief and to move forward. The person you lost will always be special to you and will be on your mind, but there will come a day when you are no longer overwhelmed by your loss. Keep telling yourself that it does get better, however corny it sounds, and work on taking care of yourself in the meantime.

Take care of your physical needs.,
Avoid numbing the pain.,
Sleep.,
Maintain a schedule.",How to Cope With the Loss of a Loved One2," In the wake of grief, people often neglect their physical needs. Even if it's difficult, make an effort to care for yourself. Not engaging in basic self care can affect your mood for the worse.


Eat right. Many people suffer from a loss of appetite after losing a loved one or have an erratic, somewhat unhealthy eating schedule. However, strive for a healthy and well-balanced diet after losing someone. Eating quality foods, like fruits and vegetables, can help regulate your mood.Try to engage in very basic self care rituals. When you're grieving, these can sometimes be forgotten. Remember to brush your teeth twice a day, shower regularly, and try to get some exercise. Some self care rituals will inevitably slip during the grieving process. However, try to keep up as best you can given the situation. Simply caring for yourself can help with your emotional wellbeing.

, Alcohol and drug use can be tempting after grief. It can help numb the pain. However, you are at higher risk to develop a substance abuse problem when you're grieving. It can also be bad for your emotional health to avoid addressing your grief. Try to avoid drinking and drug use in the months after losing a loved one., Much like your diet, maintaining a solid sleep schedule is important in regulating your emotions. When you're going through a traumatic experience, it's important you make sleep a priority. Strive for 7 to 8 hours of high quality sleep each night.It may be very difficult to sleep after losing someone. If you have prolonged difficulty sleeping, talk to your doctor about temporarily trying a medication to help regulate your sleep cycle.

, It may be very difficult to maintain a regular schedule after losing a loved one. However, having some semblance of normalcy during your grief can provide comfort. A simple routine can help ground you and help you deal with negative emotions.


Things like eating, sleeping, and exercise are important to incorporate in a routine. Make sure you make time for those basic needs.You should also try to see people at least once a week. Many people isolate themselves after a loss. However, you need support from those who care about you to move forward."

Let people know what isn't helping.,
Join a support group.,
Recognize when you need psychological care.,
Find a therapist.",How to Cope With the Loss of a Loved One3," You will get a lot of sympathy, advice, and feedback when you're grieving. Unfortunately, not all of it is helpful. People are rarely trying to be hurtful or insensitive when they say the wrong thing. They may simply be unsure of how to help. It's appropriate to respectfully let people know when they're not being helpful. You can also tell them how they can better help you cope with your grief.


People sometimes inadvertently say things that come off as hurtful or insensitive to the bereaved. For example, a friend may say something like, ""Be grateful for the time you had."" If your loved one died somewhat young, this may bother you. You can try gently saying to your friend, ""I really appreciate that you're trying to help, but my cousin died very young. Being reminded of the time I had, which wasn't very much, just makes me feel angry. Could you please not bring that up anymore?""You can also let people know what is helpful. Most people genuinely want to help. Even if they're saying the wrong thing, it's because they care. Letting them know what does and does not help will allow them to better assist you. For example, you could say to that friend, ""The next time you want to help, maybe just ask me how I'm feeling and let me express it without offering any advice. Sometimes, I just need to vent."", Some people find support groups very helpful when dealing with a personal loss. Talking to others who've been through the same experiences can provide you with insight on how to cope. You can see if there are any support groups at hospitals or counseling centers in your area. If you can't find anything close by, consider an online support group.

, It's normal to feel sad after losing a loved one. However, sometimes grief can spiral into depression. You should seek psychological care if you experience any of the following:


Your emotions are so intense you are unable to cope with day-to-day life
Your have difficulty sleeping
Your personal relationships are suffering
Your professional life is suffering
You're having sexual problems or becoming accident-prone, If you're experiencing symptoms of prolonged grief, make an appointment with a therapist. You can find a therapist by talking to your insurance provider or asking for a referral from your regular physician. If you're a student, you may be entitled to free counseling from your college or university.

Enact a calming down period.,
Be present.,
Demonstrate your maturity and independence.,
Bring in a third party.,
Express your appreciation.",How to Deal with Parents As a Young Adult2," If emotions get out of control during your talk, take a step away and agree to meet again in a day or two. Give yourself time to “sleep on it” and come back to the conversation refreshed both physically and mentally.


It is possible that your parents may avoid having another conversation about these issues. If that is the case, give them some time but continue to enforce your boundaries. If they do something hurtful, tell them, “That is not okay.”

, If you live with your parents, avoid retreating to your room permanently. If you live elsewhere, continue to make your regular visits over to your parents. Don’t respond to a negative reaction by completely disappearing. Show that you are invested in the relationship and want it to work, despite the challenges.


If tension is high, you might give your parents a heads-up before coming over. You could say, “I think I may drop by for a bit tonight, will that work for you?”

, Your parents may be smothering you because they are afraid that you can’t survive on your own. Use your actions to show them that you are a capable, independent young adult. Tell them about your recent accomplishments at work or at school. Discuss challenges that you’ve faced and how you’ve conquered them.


Tell them about a task that was difficult but that you completed after some struggling. This shows your parents that you are thinking of the “long game.” You can thrive even in tough situations.Have these discussions regularly and let them see what you're doing with your life. They may be reassured that you continue to do well without their help.

, If necessary, find a relative who is about your parents’ age who can talk to them about how you feel. This should be someone who you know very well and who you can trust. A family friend will also work, as long as they meet the trust test. Sometimes having an outside party come in can also calm everyone down.


You can also suggest meeting with a family therapist. If they are concerned about the cost, think about ways that you can offer to help pay or tell them that insurance may cover part of the cost.Make the argument that your relationship is worth the investment.

, With all of the negative emotions floating around, it is important to remember what your parents have done for you. Let them know that you are where you are now in part because of their help and guidance. This will make them feel more secure as your relationship heads into new territory.A simple “Thank you” can go a long way toward mending a relationship. If you start this process, odds are your parents will follow your lead.
To find good moments, look to the past. Go back well into your childhood and remember when your parents were the best at parenting. For example, did they take you to the zoo? Get you the best gifts?

Discover your internal boundaries.,
Communicate those boundaries.,
Set consequences for crossed boundaries.,
Enact consequences.,
Be prepared for a negative reaction.",How to Deal with Parents As a Young Adult3," Take out a pen and paper and write about significant times that you’ve felt negative emotions toward your parents. What boundaries did they cross in those situations? Once identified, you know that these are the boundaries that need to be protected in order for you to effectively deal with your parents.For example, you might ask yourself: Are my parents controlling? In what ways? Are they embarrassing? In what ways? Are they too anxious? When? Are they generally perfect but I would like them to treat me as an adult?
It is important for you to consider how you would like to be treated. This varies by individuals. Some people see no problem with certain behaviors that might really frustrate other people. Make a note of what bothers you, but also why it bothers you.

, Find a quiet time to sit down with your parents and discuss your concerns and your need for defined boundaries. Tell them that you would like to strengthen your relationship by understanding what actions (and words) are okay and not okay for both them and you.


Don’t be too radical with the boundaries that you suggest early on. Take a more moderate position and see how your parents react.
A moderate boundary is one which requires only a minimal change in behavior by your parents. A more radical boundary is one which changes the nature of your relationship with your parents and may prompt a severe response on their part., Before you talk with your parents, think about what you plan to do if your boundaries are ignored. Your reaction needs to fit the degree of the negative action. Only establish consequences that you are willing to enact. Consequences should provide an immediate and consistent end to conversation or activity prompting their disrespect.


For example, if your parents comment negatively about your friends or push for too much information, you say, “I know that you are concerned, but I need you to be nice to my friends. Now, I will have to take that time and spend it out with them instead of here.”

, It is important to establish that each action creates a reaction. If your parents decide to ignore your boundaries, you will want to warn them first. Then, if they continue to push your limits, you will need to let them know that you will take action to protect yourself.


Don't be surprised if your parents enact consequences when you violate their boundaries as well.

, Your parents are probably trying their best to look out for you. This means that they may respond angrily and negatively to your attempts to set boundaries, or that they may try harder to impose them before giving up. Just remind them that is part of you becoming a successful, independent adult.Avoid getting into a series of arguments with your parents. If emotions are high, remove yourself from the situation and address the issues later.

Use your grief to enact change.",How to Cope With a Person Passing Away," While there may be some common ways that people often react to death, no two people will react or learn to cope with the death in the exact same manner or time frame.You may notice some people around you either seem to be much more affected by the death or not bothered by it. Be careful not to assume they do not care. A family member may find comfort in staying busy and focusing on other things—this is just the way he or she deals with the death.
Grieving is not about who is the most upset. It’s a very personal thing. You may also find that everyone around you has some sort of suggestion about moving on or how it gets easier. This advice may or may not be helpful to you. Just keep in mind that they mean well and are also trying to cope with the death and also be there for you.;
, You may see both physical and emotional reactions to the death that depend on several factors. Knowing these helps you to understand that grieving can look very different. Your feelings are adequate and real no matter how you might express them.

Physical reactions to the death may manifest as dizziness, physically throwing up or feeling like you are going to, numbness, disorientation, headache or body pains, or not being able to sleep or the opposite where you feel all you can do is sleep.
Emotional reactions may include sadness, confusion, denial about what happened, anger, and guilt.
Certain factors may influence how you grieve a particular death. These include, but are not limited to, the relationship you had with the person who passed, the age of the person, the person’s health at the time he or she died, and whether the death was something you were anticipating.

, While most people will go through each stage of grief, there is no time frame or correct way to do so. You also may find you don’t go through all the stages and that is fine, too. The stages of grief might look like:Denial- “This can’t be true. I just talked to her.”
Anger- Needing to know who is to blame or how it happened
Bargaining- “Take me instead.”
Depression- “I can’t go on alone.”
Acceptance- “I know she is not in pain anymore.”
Many people assume that it is wrong to feel angry about things or feel out of place if those around you are feeling differently about the death. Try to not punish yourself for the way you feel, just be aware that the emotions may come and go.

, There is no hard and fast time frame to get back to “normal,” so don’t try to push yourself into things you are not ready for. While some routines may help you cope like returning to work to keep yourself busy, you may find other routines never fully recover. There is no right or wrong way to deal with the change.One thing to keep in mind when taking the time you need: even though your world may seem upside down, the world around you still goes on. Reach out to get help if you need someone to make sure you are staying in contact with work if you are not able to attend or keeping up with the daily bills to avoid forgetting to pay something important like rent.

, Don’t be afraid to talk about the person and share all types of memories. Part of being a support also means not having to talk about the person all of the time. Everyone will be dealing with it in their own way so it’s also fine to leave things unsaid and just spend time making sure everyone is OK.Include children and younger family members in these groups when it is possible. Kids need to see they do not need to hold in their feelings. Crying is OK to do in front of others and this includes the kids.

, Spirituality for some means turning to religion but it doesn’t have to if that is not a regular part of your life. You may find whatever you believe occurs after death is a way to find peace in the death of a loved one. Take whatever time you need to talk about this with others who share your beliefs.

You may also choose to pray, meditate, or take walks in nature to ease your grief.

, In the months after the death, you will find those around you talk less about it, but a group setting can help you feel like you can still talk about it on a regular basis with people who have been there. To find a group, you can reach out to a variety of sources including groups specific to the type of death (like cancer survivors group, or families of crime victims) or those that are religious based if you feel that is a good fit. Many hospitals also offer support groups as well.
You will probably find the group setting either really helpful or not. You can test the waters to see which type of outside supports work best for you. If it's unhelpful, you may find that one-on-one counseling with a grief specialist works.

, While emotional reactions are expected after a death, there are also physical symptoms to grief. Loss of appetite, nausea and stomach pain, intestinal upset, and sleep disturbances/loss of energy often present themselves when someone is experiencing grief.By taking care of your body, you can also help to heal your mind.


Do your best to get enough sleep and eat right. Exercise is a good way to help increase your ability to sleep and eat. In addition, it causes your body to produce endorphins, which will help lift your mood.Avoid using drugs or alcohol to ""numb the pain.""If, no matter how hard you try, you have trouble keeping a regular appetite and sleep habits, you may need to talk to a professional. Sometimes, people who are grieving experience symptoms of depression, which must be addressed in order to fully heal.

, It may seem overwhelming to think about going, but it is often healing to participate in the rituals tied to paying your respect and will help you connect with others who are also dealing with the death. Many people become almost obsessed with the “perfect” funeral, and feel like they can only pay their respects by putting on a lavish ceremony. Honor the person in the best way you can and know that small things that go wrong really won’t be remembered.
If the service is uncomfortable due to differing religious beliefs, try to at least participate in parts of the services whether it is a graveside service outside of the church or a private viewing. Many memorials offer flexible options to participate either in a bigger service or attend a private viewing of the body without the religious service.

, Look at pictures. Share and tell funny stories. It’s OK to laugh even after someone has passed away. Take the funny memories forward along with all the other memories. You will find many family members will enjoy just laughing and sharing the history., Give yourself the opportunity during this alone time to cry as much as you need to, talk to your loved one if you want to and just do whatever feels right in the moment. Unlike the funeral setting, no one is watching so this is your time to say goodbye or reminisce with your loved one.Visit as often as you feel you want to. Some people feel comfort in regular trips just to chat with the loved one while others may not feel connected to the gravesite. There is no right or wrong way to handle visits.

, If the passing was not expected, you may feel like there were things left unsaid—so say them.Don’t get hung up on what to do with the letter after you write it. You will find a solution that seems to fit. Focus on putting your thoughts on paper and getting closure. Afterwards, you may choose to share it with another loved one or even read it aloud at the grave site.

, Sometimes, you may find closure by making a difference after the death. Take action in some way to help other people who may be in your shoes someday.


For example, if your loved one died of cancer, you might start a foundation to spread awareness. If he or she passed after an accident, you can use your energy to prevent future accidents of the same kind.
Take this act of change one step further and honor the name of your loved one by starting a scholarship in memory or name the foundation after the one who passed. Incorporate the life story of your loved one in the story of the foundation. This is a terrific way to maintain his or her legacy with a positive contribution to society.

This is a common myth associated with grief.Do not be afraid to cry or scream or whatever you think helps you react to the loss. Before you can move on from losing a loved one you must first mourn their loss.


Children and teens typically follow suit with the reaction of the adults in their lives. If the adults openly grieve and show sorrow, the children may feel more comfortable doing this, too. However, if the adults try to swallow their feelings or stay strong, the youth may think grieving is inappropriate or a sign of weakness.;
, Even if you have encountered a loss before, you may react differently after your cousin’s death depending on your relationship with this person and the unique circumstances surrounding the death.

You may even be filled with anticipation and hope, waiting for your cousin to appear and clear up this misunderstanding.
Anger. You may feel upset and resentful after your cousin’s death. You may have angry and bitter feelings toward yourself, medical professionals, God, and or even towards your cousin for leaving you.
Guilt. You may feel guilty that you couldn’t prevent what happened or that you survived.
Sadness. This is one of the most common reactions to death. Sadness may include feeling like there is a hole in your life, loneliness, or hopelessness. You may cry for hours on end.

, After a death in the family, everyone must heal and grieve at their own pace. Some people may start to feel better in a few weeks while, for others, the grieving process may take months or more. Be patient with yourself and anticipate that you will feel better again in your own time., During this mourning period surround yourself with family and close friends who will be able to support you during this process. Often it helps to talk about your emotions rather than bottling them up, as this can make healing and growing after a loss more difficult.Journaling may also help you to release the pent-up emotion or confusing feelings you are experiencing after your cousin’s death. You might write about the good times and happy memories the two of you shared., This can be done through the observance of rituals such as funerals/cremations.

You might even start a tradition of celebrating this person’s birthday each year or releasing balloons on this day to keep his/her memory alive., Your cousin would not want you to mourn forever. You must live life yourself. Although this may seem a long way off to you at the moment, there will come a day when you will not think of your lost one as often or with as much pain. Then, you can live for your cousin, and live to the fullest.Suggestions for living your life to the fullest might be to take advantage of the time you have on earth to set new goals. Create a ""bucket list"" of things you'd like to do before your own death, and start ticking items off., Everyone reacts to death differently. If the death of your cousin provokes you to withdraw from friends or family, stop participating in school or performing at work, feel extremely depressed, or use drugs or alcohol to cope, you should see a mental health professional.A counselor or therapist can help you find positive ways of channeling your grief and coping with loss.

Very young children, such a preschoolers, may have a hard time understanding death, instead viewing it as a temporary separation. High schoolers, on the other hand, can understand the finality of death and it's causes.


Some younger children may generalize death to understand it. For example, after witnessing Sept. 11, some younger children might associate death with walking into tall buildings.
Let your child guide the conversations about death, as they will ask the questions important to them and help your decide what tone and language to use.

, Especially for young children, death is often a foreign concept. The idea that our loved ones will not be around forever needs to be learned, and parents can provide love and support while kids learn to cope with death. While this conversation is difficult, you should be yourself and be there for your child.


Answer questions with simple and direct questions, not with euphemisms like ""lost"" or ""passed on.""
Be truthful -- minimizing negative emotions will only confuse your child later on and hurt their trust in you., Don't whisper, make up stories, or wait to tell them ""at the right time.""

Acknowledge the death.,
Show your genuine concern.,
Offer specific support.,
Share memories.",How to Comfort a Grieving Person1,"

When you see the grieving person, let them know that you are aware of the death.Or, even send them a message or give them a call. Trying to avoid saying anything direct can make things more awkward. Acknowledging the death opens the door for the person to turn to you for comfort.

You might acknowledge the death of a neighbor’s family member by saying, “I was sorry to learn your sister passed away.”
If it’s a violent death, consider how well you know the grieving person to determine what to say. Some people aren’t comfortable talking about homicide or suicide.
For example, if a co-worker’s family member was murdered, you might simply say, “I read in the paper that your uncle died.”
In cases of suicide, use the terms ‘died of suicide’, ‘died because of suicide’, or ‘died from suicide’ rather than ‘committed suicide’.
For instance, if that is how your friend’s brother died, you could say, “I heard that your brother died of suicide.”;
, Comfort them by letting them know that you care about them and their loss. Be honest and heartfelt in what you say. Being empathetic will show them that you are here to support them during this time.Use a gentle, compassionate tone of voice and, when possible, refer to the deceased person by name.For example, if your church member’s husband died you might say something like, “I know Manuel was important to you. I know I can’t take away your pain, but I’m very sorry for your loss.”
Try to avoid phrases like ""God needed another angel"" or ""The grief will fade in time.” They can make you sound insensitive to the grieving person’s pain.
Try phrases like ""This is really shocking and I honestly don’t know what to say,"" ""I'm so sorry to hear that,"" and ""That must be really rough.""

,

Asking ""What can I do to help?"" might not be helpful, because when a person is grieving they are often too overwhelmed to even think of an answer.Comfort them by offering to do things that you know or think might be helpful right now.Think about practical things they could use help with like cooking, cleaning, babysitting, or taking care of a pet.
For example, you might tell your neighbor, ""I'll bring some lasagna on Friday. You can't handle spice, right?”
Offer your support, but don’t push yourself on them. Offer support twice. If they still refuse, let them know the offer still stands if they change their mind.
For instance, if a grieving friend said they don’t want the class notes, you might say, “Are you sure? I don’t mind bringing them.” If they still say no, say, “Ok, but let me know if you change your mind.”
If you want to help, but don’t know what to do then ask someone close to them for suggestions for how you can support the grieving person.

, Talking about a loved one who has died can be a helpful way to remember the person and develop an understanding of your feelings.If you know the deceased person, it can comfort the grieving person for you to share memories that you have. Knowing that you are thinking of the dead person and that you remember them will help the grieving person cope.For example, if your best friend’s brother died, you could say, “He was a great tennis player. Could I tell you about one of my favorite memories of him on the court?”
Keep your recollections positive and brief. You want to comfort the grieving person, not overwhelm, bore, or upset them.
For instance, you might tell your friend one or two funny stories about his brother and then move the conversation on.
Be understanding if they aren’t ready to share memories yet.

State your expectations up front.,
Ask ahead of time for your duties.,
Go with the flow.,
Use humor to reduce stress.,
Appreciate the host.,
Maintain your distance.",How to Deal with a Demanding Host at Family Events1," Let your host know what you can and cannot do for the upcoming event. If there is anything you are looking forward to, make sure that they know. Being as clear as possible early on may encourage the host to let you enjoy yourself during the event.


For example, if you are worried that you will be asked to watch the children, you might say, “I am really looking forward to seeing everyone. I haven’t seen my uncles in forever, and I’m hoping that I can sit next to them at dinner.”
If you know that the host will be expecting something from you that you cannot provide, let them know as early as possible, especially if it is a task that they have asked you to do before. You might say, “I've had back problems recently. I know you usually want me to help set up the tables at the picnic, but I’m not sure I’ll be able to help this year.”
If you are uncertain or do not want to commit, tell your host, “Let me get back to you on that.”;
, If you are going to an event where you will be expected to contribute something, make sure you know ahead of time what it will be. Contact the host. Ask them if there is anything you can do or bring to help reduce stress.For example, you might call the host a week or two beforehand and say, “I’m looking forward to the party. Is there anything I can bring to help out?”
Be very clear about what type of help you are willing to lend. For example, you can say, “I’m not sure I’ll have time to cook anything. Do you want me to bring plates or drinks instead?”
Tell your host exactly when you plan to arrive so that you can contribute something useful. You can say, ""I won't be able to come until 8:00, so I do not think I will be able to help with the prep this year."" If your availability changes, tell the host as soon as possible.

, It is sometimes best to keep the peace at family gatherings to prevent larger conflict. When it comes to a demanding, controlling, or overbearing host, you should pick your battles. Try to compromise on some issues and let others slide.For example, if your host expects you to help out with cleaning up, you might decide to do it so that you do not have an argument. But if your host is nagging you about certain lifestyle choices of yours, you might decide to confront them about it.
When deciding if you should talk to the host, ask yourself what you are planning to get out of it. Do you expect the host to relent? Is there a risk this might cause a larger family conflict? Or is there a way that you can ask the host to respect your personal boundaries?
While it may be frustrating to deal with a demanding host, if the only thing at stake is your pride, it may be better just to be quiet. Take a break by going outside or by volunteering for an errand.

, Sometimes, tensions can run high at family events. Your host might be stressed out because of their responsibilities or because of other things going on in their life. Humor can relax the situation. If you feel as though you are on the verge of conflict, try cracking a joke to lighten the mood.Self-deprecating humor is the best way to crack a joke without offending anyone. This is humor where you poke fun at yourself.For example, if the host is bothering you about being single, you can say, “Oh, I’ve been dating myself for a while, and I have to say, I think I’m the one.”

, Throwing a family event, especially during the holidays, can be stressful on the host. Use small gestures to thank the host. This might boost their mood and improve their behavior towards you.

Compliment the host on how well they did setting up the party. For example, you can say, ""These decorations are amazing! You did a fantastic job.""
You may want to bring a small gift for the host. This could be a candle, a bottle of wine, a flower centerpiece, or even a friendly card.
After the event, write the host a thank you note. This may encourage them to continue treating you nicely at events.

, If your family member’s demands are interfering with your mental health or are causing undue stress, you may want to consider keeping space between you and them during the event.


If it is a large event, such as a holiday party or reunion, you might be able to seat yourself next to different family members. You might decide to not volunteer for any duties. While you should not ignore the host, avoid touchy topics and situations.If it is a small event, such as a family dinner, you may not be able to avoid them entirely. Let your host know at the beginning when you have to leave. This can help you set a firm boundary for how long you will see the problematic host. For example, you might say, ""We would love to stay, but we are paying a baby sitter tonight, so we have to be back by ten.""
If you're allowed to bring a guest, it can help put space between you and the host. The host may be on their best behavior in front of the guest, and you may be able to escape the host's demands since you are entertaining someone else.

Avoid getting drawn into their conflict.,
Maintain boundaries.,
Tell your parents to get help.",How to Cope with Divorced Parents1," It’s important that you’re able to feel comfortable about each of your parents after their divorce. One of the most important aspects of maintaining positive relationships with each of your parents is refusing to side with one of them over the other. If either of your parents try to get you to agree with them about how they see their divorce, remind them that it is their relationship, and their discussion. If one of your parents begins to act as though they are jealous or upset about you spending time with your other parent, tell them to stop.
Be specific, by saying something like, “I intend to maintain a positive relationship with both of you, and you need to allow me to do so.”;
, Hopefully, your parents will not attempt to pit you against one another. However, you may realize that one or both of your parents begin to rely on you heavily for emotional support. This can be a challenging thing to experience, as well as a challenging thing to recognize. If you find yourself consoling a parent somewhat often, think about who else they may be able to speak with.If they have siblings or close friends that they could talk to, reach out to those people and ask them to contact your parent. Though it may feel odd to seek help for a parent, it is likely in both your own and their best interest.
Never allow either of your parents to act as though their happiness is your responsibility. If they make this implication, respond by saying something like, “I want you to be happy and I will support you as much as I am able, but I also need to take care of myself.”

, Your parents are people too. It can be disconcerting to become aware of the fact that they sometimes struggle with intense emotions and need support when they’ve always been the ones taking care of you. This realization can even be traumatizing, though it will also likely contribute to your own growth.If your parents are struggling with persistent bitterness, anger, or depression, ask them to see a counselor or therapist.
Tell them that a counselor will know how to help them maintain emotional stability while going through a divorce.
Further, conclude the thought by saying something like, “a therapist can also give you pointers to help ease the stress you’re feeling.”
Make sure that you do not start to take on the role of a counselor for your parents, such as by listening to them complain, being a shoulder to cry on, or offering advice. If you find that you are taking on this role, then ask your parents to seek the help of a counselor as soon as possible. This is not a healthy relationship to develop with your parent(s) and it can have negative emotional effects on you. If your parent continues to rely on you for emotional support, then talk to another trustworthy adult about the situation, such as an aunt, grandparent, or teacher.

Listen to them.,
Let them cry.,
Expect mood swings.",How to Comfort a Grieving Person2," Sometimes it comforts a grieving person to talk about how they are feeling or share memories they have of the deceased. They don’t necessarily want you to do or say anything, they just want and need someone to present and listen to them.Show you are paying attention by facing the person and making eye contact with them while they are talking.
Remove distractions so that you can listen without interruption. Turn off the music, put aside your work, and put your electronic devices on silent.
Instead of thinking about how you should respond, just focus on hearing what they are saying.
Allow and encourage them to talk.Ask open-ended questions to let them know you are listening and encourage them to talk.
For example, you might ask your workout partner, “What is your fondest memory of your aunt?”

,

It may be a bit uncomfortable for you, but letting a grieving person express their feelings is good for them. So, allow the person to shed a few tears, scream, or shout if needed. You may not even need to say anything. Just being there reassures them.

You may want to say things like, “It’s okay to let it out” or “I’m here for you.”
If it is in a public place, let curious people know that he is just grieving and that everything is okay.
If necessary, try to move the grieving person somewhere that they can grieve without onlookers.
Make sure they are in a safe place. If possible, remove anything that might hurt them (or that they might use to hurt themselves) in the event they become extremely upset.
If they become agitated to the point that you fear for their safety, call for help.

,

The grieving process is different for each person. But some feelings like anger, guilt, sadness, despair, hope and acceptance are normal and common to grief.You can help comfort a grieving person better if you don’t take their mood swings personally.

If they say something mean or hurtful, just remember that it is the grief talking, not the person. You can address the comment at a later time, if you need to address it at all.
For example, if your girlfriend snaps at you for no reason, you might wait a few minutes and then say, “I know you didn’t mean what you said, but it hurt my feelings.”
If you need to, take a short break from the person. Take a few deep breaths and remind yourself that they don’t mean to act that way.

Give them time to grieve.,
Get them active.,
Form a support team.,
Encourage them to seek professional help.",How to Comfort a Grieving Person3,"

Each person is different, so grieving processes are different. Some may grieve for a relatively short amount of time; some may grieve for what seems like a long time. Comfort a grieving person by allowing them to take the time they need to come to terms with their loss.Check up on them periodically. Don’t just see how they are doing immediately after the loss, check on them in the weeks and months following.
Be aware of trigger days like birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays that may be particularly hard for a grieving person.
Try to make yourself available to support them on and around these days.
For example, you might want to keep the anniversary of the death of your partner’s father free from other events.

, You can comfort a grieving person and help them heal by getting them involved in an activity. Whether it’s getting them back in the routine of doing things they did before, or introducing them to something new, being involved in activities can help distract them, fill their time, and lift their mood.

Invite them for a walk, bike ride, yoga session, or game of table tennis. Physical activity is good for the body and for the mind.
Suggest that you two volunteer somewhere or participate in a community event for a good cause.
Giving back to the community can help the grieving person feel connected to the world again.
Attend a grief support group with them. It may help them to be around other people experiencing the same feelings and challenges they are.

, The grieving person may need support and comfort for a while and you shouldn’t and probably can’t help them with everything they may need. Identify a few friends and family that are willing and able to help the grieving person over time.Try to organize a couple of people that can take turns checking on the grieving person.
Perhaps each week one of you calls the person to check in and lets the rest of the group know how things are going.
Check with other members of the group if you notice something that concerns you. Ask them to do the same.
For instance, if you notice your roommate hasn’t eaten in a few days, you could let her parents or siblings know so that you all can help her with her grief.

, Sometimes grief may cause more pain than a person can cope with on their own, or even with the support of friends and family. If someone you know is struggling to cope with their grief, then it is important to encourage them to seek professional help, such as by seeing a therapist.Try offering to take the person to see their family doctor and get a referral or offer to help them find a therapist they can speak to.
You might try saying something like, ""It seems like you have been struggling and I would like to help if I can. Would you be willing to let me make an appointment for you to see your doctor?""

Use “I” statements.,
Lead conversations.,
State why you can’t do something.,
Deflect unsolicited advice.,
Avoid defensive criticism.",How to Deal with a Demanding Host at Family Events2," When speaking to the host or other family members, it is important to avoid using accusatory language or blaming others. While you might be stressed, upset, or annoyed by the host’s demands, you can prevent further conflict by using statements that begin with “I” instead of “you.”For example, instead of saying, “You keep asking me too to do way too much. Why can’t you ask someone else?” you can say, “I have my hands full at the moment. Perhaps I can see if someone else can help you?”
You can use “I” statements to declare your feelings and your thoughts. For example, “I feel as though I’m taken for granted when I’m expected to do all of this work without asking.”
You might also use “I” statements to actively listen to others. Active listening involves rephrasing what the other person said to demonstrate that you understand their feelings. For example, you might say, “I understand that you’re stressed out. I know that this dinner is a huge responsibility for you.”

, If you're worried that the host is going to monopolize conversations or bring up uncomfortable topics, try leading the discussion yourself. Come prepared with a few topics to discuss. This can help you stay in control of the conversation.

You may want to have a few topics to engage each family member to reduce your interaction with the host. For example, you can ask your cousin how college is going or talk to your mother about how her garden is doing.

, Instead of outright refusing your host’s demands, you can gently explain why you cannot do something. Whenever you state something, you can follow it up with a phrase that begins with “because.” This can help encourage your host to back off.You might say, “I can’t stay long because I have an appointment that afternoon.”
If the host or another family member is bothering you about certain choices in your life, this tactic can also help. For example, you might say, “I’m not looking to have children right now because I need to focus on my career before I can start a family.”
That said, if you would rather not explain your choices or reasons, you do not have to. You can simply say, ""I'd rather not talk about it.""

, Some family members may try to comment or pressure you into decisions you don’t want to make. You should end the conversation quickly and politely with a calm thank you. End the conversation there. Do not engage with their advice.


If someone tries to give you advice about your love life, career, or family, you can simply say, “Thank you. I’ll keep your suggestions in mind.”If someone is asking uncomfortable questions about your personal life, you can try saying, “I have nothing to complain about” or “There’s nothing much to say.” If they try to press you for an answer, respond with “I’ll let you know if anything changes.”

, It may seem easy to react to a controlling or demanding family member with a snappy response. You may even want to confront them outright about their behavior. This could start a large argument. Instead, try to step back. Come up with a diplomatic answer that does not blame or accuse them. Focus instead on a peaceful response.Instead of saying, “I brought the best gift I could. I think that you should appreciate what I bought you,” you can say, “I’m sorry you’re disappointed. I thought you would have liked it.”
If it is difficult to speak or interact with the host without becoming emotional, angry, or upset, you may just need to excuse yourself.

Take the host aside.,
Remain calm.,
Find common ground.,
Come up with different options.,
Avoid feeling guilty.,
Apologize and forgive.",How to Deal with a Demanding Host at Family Events3," If there is a serious issue that you must resolve with the host, it is better to do it privately than in front of the rest of the family. Wait until the host has a free minute. If they are busy trying to run the event, they may be frustrated and annoyed that you are bothering them, increasing your chances of a fight.


If you feel that something is about to blow up, tell the host that you want to step aside. You might say, “Look. Let’s not discuss this here. If you want to talk, let’s step outside.”
If you can, wait until after the event has wrapped up. Before the host leaves, you might ask them, “Hey, can we discuss what happened tonight?”
In many cases, a family event is not the best place to deal with such a conflict. Although you may be upset or frustrated, it may be easier and more productive to wait a day or two before bringing it up to the host. This will allow you to prepare what you want to say without becoming emotional.

, Keeping your composure is important to resolving conflict. By becoming upset, your host might be defensive, angry, or guilty. A calm, even voice and a gentle tone can help your host feel at ease as you bring up the issue.If your host says something to upset you, you can try counting to ten before responding.
Deep breathing can help restore a sense of calm. Relax the muscles in your body as you do this.
Pull another family member aside, and talk it out with them if you feel as though you need to vent.

, If you and the host are beginning to argue, instead of asserting your different perspective, try to find something in common with what they are saying. By focusing on your commonalities, you reduce the risk of argument, and you help keep them calm.For example, if there are arguments about the menu, you might say, “I think we can all agree that we should have plenty of different options.”
You can also redirect the conversation towards a less contentious topic. You might say, ""Isn't it great that everyone could come today?""
If you are disagreeing on how to do something, try to find a compromise. You might say, “I know that you want to take a hike after the reunion, but I think that will be hard on some of the older family members. How about I stay back with them while you go on the hike with everyone else?”

, Your host has probably spent a great deal of time planning the event, and they may want to make sure that things go as smoothly as possible. To help out, provide suggestions to solve problems as they come up. Do not simply state the problem or try to argue for one perspective.For example, you might say, “Well, since there doesn’t seem to be many options for the vegetarians in the family, how about I cook some vegetable dishes for them on the side? Or we could pick up something up from a restaurant.”

, Some people might use guilt against their family members as a way of coercing them to do things. Remember that while it is nice to help out your family, you can refuse their requests. Do not be afraid to assert your boundaries. You can let the person know that you understand why this is important to them, but you should also reinforce that you are unable or unwilling to do something.You might say, “I understand how important this is to you, and I would be love to be able to spend more time with you, but I just cannot get there until the day before the wedding.”If you're uncertain whether or not you should refuse the host's demands, ask yourself how you will feel in a few days. Do you think that helping will cause you to resent the host, or will you not care in the long run?

, If you lost your cool, you should apologize to the family member as soon as possible. Alternatively, if they have gotten angry at you, you should try to forgive them. In this way, you can mend your relationship, and there is a chance you both can still enjoy the event.Try to address the issue in a polite, non-confrontational way. State why you felt so upset so that the host can avoid it in the future. You might say, “I am so sorry for snapping at you. I think I was just stressed out by all the work that needed to be done. I think I might need a break to cool down.”
Do not tell someone you forgive them until they apologize to you. If they do apologize, you can say, “It’s no problem. I forgive you. I understand family events can be stressful.” If they do not apologize, try to swallow your anger and move on. Telling them that you forgive them without an apology first can be seen as presumptuous.
It is ok to take some time to forgive the host. You do not need to forgive them immediately. Focus on getting through the event. Afterwards, you can work on reconciliation.

Talk about your own future.,
Talk to your siblings.,
Live your own life.,
Plan ahead for special events.,
Talk to someone you can speak freely with.,
Try to focus on the positive.",How to Cope with Divorced Parents2," After recovering from the shock of your parents’ divorce, you’ll likely start to confront the fact that your own life will be different moving forward. This is especially true if you’re still living with one of your parents. You should ask your parents any questions you have about your future, in both the short and long term.Plan a time to sit down with both of your parents together, as soon as is possible. If their relationship is volatile or they are unwilling to speak with you together, make plans to speak with them separately.
While talking about what has happened may be helpful, ask questions about what will happen moving forward. Feel free to be direct by simply asking, “What’s going to happen next?”
Don’t worry about “adding” to what they’re going through. While you’ll likely feel this way, it’s better for everyone to communicate your concerns. You may learn that your parents have already been thinking about your future as well.

, Your siblings will likely prove to be an extremely important source of support, no matter what your relationship with them was like before the divorce. The experiences you’ve shared give you better insight into one another’s lives than most. Talk about how each of your parents are doing, how each of you are doing, and what you can do to help each other, as well as your parents.If anyone is having a particularly hard time dealing with the divorce, you and your other family members can plan to talk to them together about seeing a therapist.
Reach out to extended family members as well. In particular, your parents’ siblings may be better able to help and support them than you and your siblings.

, Don’t put your own life on hold simply because your parents have hit a rough patch in their lives. Keep any long-term plans you’ve made, especially if you’re pursuing a significant goal. For instance, if you’re planning to move out and go to college next year, you still should. Similarly, if you intend to get married yourself in the foreseeable future, don’t start to question your own goals and intentions on account of your parents’ divorce.If you are having fears about the future, then try talking with a trustworthy adult, such as a parent, teacher, or religious leader. For example, you might start by saying something like, “The divorce is making me question some of the things that I had envisioned for my future. I am starting to feel fearful about ____.”
Continue participating in normal everyday activities as well. For instance, keep going to your weekly volleyball meetup, and try to maintain an active social life.
Keep yourself occupied with personal interests and relationships to keep your stress levels low and stay focused on your own goals.

, Holidays and celebrations may become a source of stress as you try to navigate how to include your parents, or decide when to visit them when they both may want your company.While they may be willing to be around one another to share in your accomplishments and other key events together, they may also wish to compromise, and work with you to plan to be a part of separate occasions.


Ask your parents to speak with one another about attending events that you want them both to be a part of, such as your graduation, a big sports game, or a birthday party.
Hopefully, they will be able to put their differences aside. You may even want to frame it in these terms, by asking if they’d be willing to focus on the positive for a day, in the interest of enjoying a special occasion altogether. Try saying something like, “I know you two have a hard time being around each other, but I was hoping we could just have a day to focus on this milestone in my life.”

, Whether a sibling or a friend, you need to be able to tell someone how you’re honestly feeling about your parents’ divorce from time to time. Another way of looking at it is allowing others to support you. Stress, depression, and sadness will all make it harder to go about your daily life, let alone maintain a happy, healthy frame of mind.You can also find a support group of people roughly your age who also have divorced parents.
If you continue to struggle with mental health issues, see a therapist! A school counselor or your doctor’s office can help you find one.

, It may sound impossible, but there is likely some good that will come from your parents’ divorce. Most importantly, there was a reason they got divorced, and one – if not both – will be better off in the long run because of their separation. Meanwhile, think about what you like about each of your parents as individuals. If you continue to spend time with each of them, you’ll likely come to know them better than you did when they were together."
"
Don’t be too hard on yourself.,
Do not parent your parents.,
Refuse to pick sides.,
Remove hurtful people from your life.,
Don’t compare your relationship to your parents’.,
Talk to a therapist.,
Keep in touch with both of your parents.",How to Cope with Divorced Parents3," You may feel like you should have “gotten over” your parents divorce long ago, or that their divorce shouldn’t bother you if it happens when you’re already an adult. It’s actually quite normal, however, for people to have strong residual feelings about a parent’s divorce, not matter your age or how long ago it occurred.Anger about your parents’ divorce may even increase as you become more aware of how it affected you and your family.
You may have more questions as you become more aware as well. Ask your parents these questions to prevent them from leading to resentment.

, More to the point, you must insist that they do not put you in any negative situations. A risk of being adult with divorced parents is the tendency to end up playing mediator. This might happen either because you feel like you should or because one of your parents puts you in situations where you have to act as a mediator. Either way, this is unhealthy, and you need to avoid doing so. Tell a parent that pushing too much information or responsibility onto you that they need to talk to a friend, counselor, or lawyer instead.Remind yourself that you are not responsible for helping your parents through a divorce.
You may even need to articulate this by saying something like, “I am sympathetic about what you’re going through and I want you be happy. However, it’s unhealthy for me to be in the position you’re putting me in. There are other people it would be more appropriate to have this conversation with.”

, Even in scenarios where one of your parents made some really poor decisions, it is unhealthy to side with one of your parents over the other. In fact, it is likely that you do agree more with one of your parents than the other, particularly if infidelity, financial mismanagement, or alcohol abuse contributed to the separation. In these scenarios, it’s better for everyone to try to stay on positive terms with each of your parents.If one of your parents starts speaking poorly about the other – even if what they’re saying is accurate – ask them to stop.
Try “I love you both, and it hurts to hear this” or “I love you and I’m also hurt that this happened to all of us, but I need to have a positive relationship with both of my parents.”

, If one of your parents had been abusive to you or your other parent, do not worry about ""taking sides."" In this context, you and any other family members that had been victims of abuse should do everything you can to support one another.Further, do not seek to maintain a relationship with a parent that had been abusive.


If you want, tell an abusive parent that it may possible to rebuild your relationship in the future, once they've significantly changed their behavior.
Reach out to a mental health professional or law enforcement officer whenever you believe someone is being abused, including yourself. While it may be hard to accuse someone you love of abuse, remind yourself that allowing abuse to continue will hurt people you love even more.

, You may not like some of the things you realize about your parents, and may even have to confront some realizations that upset you. Do not let these feelings, nor the actions of your parents, dictate what you believe about romantic partnerships in general. Every relationship is different, and it’s important to remind yourself of this when you find yourself comparing aspects of your parent’s relationship to your own.Watch out for thoughts that regard tumultuousness in your own relationship as evidence that all relationships are “doomed” from the start. Many children of divorced parents are inclined to have these thoughts, and they can have negative repercussions on otherwise healthy relationships.
If negative sentiments such as these arise, then there are things you can do to change your negative thoughts, such as by identifying the thoughts and actively rewriting them as positive thoughts.

, Do not hesitate to meet with a mental health professional if you’re struggling with any intense emotions. Persistent sadness, melancholy, loneliness, an inability to concentrate, or simply a recurring uneasiness can all be addressed by speaking with someone. Best of all, therapist can recommend a counseling program where you can speak with others that have had similar experiences.See a therapist soon if you’re experiencing waves of rage. These may be directed at nothing in particular, or accompany thoughts about one of your parents.
Keep in mind that a therapist is not biased, and may be able to see a situation more clearly from the outside. They also will always consider your personal health and safety to be their main priority.

, The distance between you and your parents has likely grown as you’ve grown up. It may be even greater if your parents have split up. However, it is still important to try to maintain contact with both of your parents if you are able to do so. Occasionally, make a call or send an email to let each of your parents know you care about them.If your relationship with one of your parents is more strained, they will still be happy to hear updates about your life. Shoot them an email letting them know of any big news in your life, and let them know about the next thing you’re looking forward to.
It may be rough between you and your parents for a while. Remind yourself, however, that putting in the effort to rekindle relationships that have been damaged by divorce may empower you to develop stronger and more meaningful relationships that you have had before.

Maybe you're worried about seeing an irritating aunt, or listening to your mother make negative comments about your cooking. By having greater awareness of possible triggers, you'll be better able to handle them.Consider writing down the most common stressors you encounter when at family gatherings. Then identify possible ways to handle these.
The greater awareness you have of what's going to bother you, the greater power you have to control how you'll react.
Avoid filling your head with negative thoughts and expectations! Identify potential stressors and plan how you will deal with them, then go to the family gathering with an open mind and give everyone the chance to behave well.;
, Depending on what's a sources of stress and drama at your family gatherings, plan and possibly rehearse a response to certain family members. For things that seem out of your control, have a back-up plan so that you're not feeling disappointed again.For example, if you're getting over a break-up or a recent set-back at work, you may dread talking about your relationship or work. Instead of getting upset when people ask you these possible questions, consider having a stock answer that makes it easy to move on and then change the subject. Find ways to make the conversation about general interests rather than heated personal topics.
Consider a stock answer such as, ""Sometimes we can't control how things go, but we just need to keep trying to move forward. Did you catch the championship game last night? It was really intense."" If the person pushes the issue, remember it is perfectly acceptable to say, ""You know, I'd really rather not talk about that. Thanks.”
Have a back-up plan for you or your kids if the family gathering seems to be boring, or the scheduled time for dinner is running later than expected. For example, kids can get bored more easily and get hungry more often. Have some games or toys for them at the event to keep them occupied when they're bored, or a stash of extra snacks if they're hungry.

, Having a friend or partner present could help to lessen drama, depending on the person you're bringing. If your current partner or spouse is generally low-key, talk with them about your concerns about family drama. Ask them to help you stay calm in difficult situations. Or, you could bring a neighbor or friend that may serve as a healthy distraction to the gathering.A friend, co-worker, or neighbor could serve to draw attention away from you, and help others to act better in front of new company. This friend can act as a ""wingman"" of sorts, allowing you to possibly exit early or avoid certain confrontations. For example, your friend could intervene and start talking about the latest blockbuster movie if a difficult uncle tries to bring up politics.
Consider talking with your partner about intervening in certain situations with your parents or siblings. For example, discuss with your partner about concerns that you and your sister may bicker over religious views. By giving advanced warning to your partner, they may be able to subtly remind you to stay calm and move on from the argument.

, Maybe there's an old grudge between you and your brother that you're concerned will become a source of drama. At a family gathering, people come to have an enjoyable time, so they don't want to caught in the middle of old childhood feuds. Try letting go of the grudge during the family gathering. Even if things are still unresolved, family gatherings aren't the time to bring them up. Try scheduling one-on-one time with the person you need to speak with. If the grudge is very fresh, consider sitting this family gathering out. Be sure to catch the next one, however, so that it doesn't lead to a rift within the family.
If you feel like you can't forgive the person, try focusing your attention to other people who make you feel supported at the event.

, Think about how you want to handle yourself, by staying calm and focused. Close your eyes and listen to your breath for a moment. Take your mind away from the stress in the present and redirect your thoughts to feeling at peace.


Consider doing breathing exercises, such as slowly inhaling your breath, holding it, and then slowly releasing your breath.
Tune out the people or conversations that are a source of stress in that heated moment. Focus on how you want to feel in control of yourself. This way you can avoid starting, or getting in the middle of, family drama.
Before the gathering, practice visualization exercises that take you to a happy, peaceful place, then you can more readily pull these images from your memory in the moment.

, Avoid immediately reacting as angry, hurt, or upset. If it seems the other side just wants to pick a fight, recognize that fighting back and arguing with them will likely lead nowhere.Listen to your body if you find yourself getting worked up. Physical signs of stress may occur even before you get upset.
Be polite if possible, and show them that you're not interested in stirring up arguments or drama.
Consider saying things like, ""I know that you're feeling upset. I don't want to argue or fight about this. I want this time with our family to be fun and enjoyable. Can we call a truce for now?""

, Have some breathing room during family gatherings that are likely to be stressful. It's better to excuse yourself and take a walk rather than to sit and be increasingly miserable.If your family is casually sitting around and having a picnic for example, consider taking a walk around the neighborhood or the event area. This way you can clear your head. A little exercise can help to reduce stress hormones.
If the gathering is more formal such as a sit-down Christmas dinner, consider excusing yourself from the table and going into another room that's private such as the bathroom or walking into a different area of the house.
You can also excuse yourself and call a friend who can help calm you down and remind you of your goals.

, Sometimes you might have high expectations of a family gathering, especially if you're the one hosting or helping to set up the event. Try minimizing all-or-nothing thinking in which you feel like you've failed if the dinner plans are a bit off or some guests' travel plans change.Realize that life is full of little pitfalls, and things don't always go as planned.
Be a source of calm and peace when things change rather than getting upset. By understanding that we're all human, you'll be less apt to judge yourself and others. Try saying things like, ""Oh well! What matters is we're all here and enjoying family time.""

, Instead of trying to correct or criticize others, try to focus on their good intentions and kindness. For example, your mother or aunt may want to help you in the kitchen. They may come off as trying to control the situation, but think instead of their offer to help as a sense of generosity.If someone offers some criticism about the event, try include them rather than getting upset with their judgments. For example, if your cousin likes to have a fire going during Christmas dinner, ask for their help or a trusted adult's help with setting it up. Do not step in and try to accommodate everybody. This can result in resentment and feeling like a failure. Instead, encourage them to get their own needs met. Say, ""That sounds wonderful. You're welcome to start a fire if you'd like.""
Offer words of appreciation when you see that someone is trying to be helpful even if it comes off a little awkward. Say things like, ""I really appreciate your ideas"" or ""Thanks, I'll consider that next time.""

, Redirect any stressful or negative interactions towards games, movies, and lighthearted fun. Group activities are a good way to bond with your family, and develop stronger connections other than bickering. Consider these types of activities to help keep interactions positive:Play board games that get everyone engaged and focused. Consider games that appropriate for different ages levels so that they interest both kids and adults.
Consider playing team games like Charades. This can help to foster teamwork, rather than bickering with each other.
Have people work together to make sweet treats and desserts. Getting together in the kitchen to make things can be another opportunity to bond.
Play a lighthearted comedy movie for the family. Make it feel like the whole gang is going to the movie theater. This can help to keep the drama low when people are quietly watching the movie instead of arguing.

, While your family may drive you crazy from time to time, it's important to focus on being thankful for what you have, and the opportunity to share precious time with them. Take a moment and think of someone who lost a loved one and send them positive thoughts or prayer. This can help increase your gratefulness for what you have. By focusing on gratitude, this will help both your emotional and physical health. Stress will be less when you feel appreciative of the moments that you share.Instead of focusing your negative energy on the people who make your life stressful, identify three or more family members that you'll encounter who are supportive and caring. Remind yourself of their generosity when you're feeling low.
Focus your time on giving back. Help at a family gathering when you can. Offer time or resources to make the event special. Try working together to make it easier for everyone.

, Do not force family gatherings to last for extended periods of time! If they go well, wrap them up and do not give them time to deteriorate by forcing them to extend past their natural lengths of time. Remember to take time and love yourself. Have activities ready to help you handle stress, and make you feel whole again. Consider these self-care activities:Get a massage or take a hot bath.
Practice meditation or yoga.
Have a warm drink with a friend.
Exercise, go to the gym, or take a walk.
Find a peaceful, private space such as the outdoors or a bookstore.
Listen to soothing music and get plenty of rest.

For starters, if you're on speaking terms with an ex-spouse, ex-fiancé or an ex from a long relationship, at the very least inform them of the engagement. If you're not on speaking terms, write a note to let them know. If children are involved, your ex needs to know about your marriage and agreed arrangements as to the children's involvement should be arranged.

Reasons that you might wish to go beyond merely informing your ex and actually inviting them to the wedding include:


You're still really good friends with your ex and there is no animosity between you. There are lots of reasons for why people part amicably and still remain firm friends; that's totally your call and your business. However, if you intend to remain in touch with your ex post-wedding, then the sooner this is clarified for your fiancé, the better.
You want your ex-spouse to be present because you had children together and it will help everyone to meld properly. Again, this is only provided you get along with your ex.
You may have no choice. Your ex may be the husband or wife of a brother, sister or other family member. In which case, there isn't going to be much more to discuss, as it's assumed everyone is going to behave nicely!
Wanting to rub your ex's nose in it is not a valid reason for inviting him or her to your wedding. Your fiancé won't appreciate this motive and neither will your ex; if guests also work out that this is the motive, you'll be publicly shamed.;
, After exploring why you think you want your ex to come to the wedding, also think about any reason why you should not invite your ex. Is the venue for your reception a place that holds romantic connotations for the two of you? Are you going to use music, poetry, songs or other elements that have a romantic meaning or memorable attachment from the time the two of you were together? Or does your ex become confrontational when he or she drinks or gets over-emotional at a social event? Any potential for emotional explosiveness should be thoroughly explored and dismissed before deciding that it's a good idea to invite your ex to the wedding.The last thing you want is a movie scene style sequence of your ex jumping up and objecting to the marriage out of spite or inability to get over you!


If your ex isn't over you and is liable to cry at your wedding ceremony, ditch the whole idea. There is nothing more uncomfortable for everyone present than a public display of weeping for lost love. What a downer!

, The most important step is to make sure your fiancé is completely comfortable with you inviting your ex to the wedding. The best way to approach your betrothed with the invitation is to choose a quiet area in your home or at a restaurant to review the guest list.


Review the list of friends you’d like to invite and ask your fiancé his or her feelings about inviting your ex. Approach the query with an open-ended question and let him or her have the floor to express his or her full opinion. By now, it should be absolutely clear to your fiancé that you are still in regular contact with your ex and have a good friendship.
Make sure that your fiancé knows that you have no strong feelings about having your ex at the wedding. Take a casual approach to whether or not he or she is invited so your fiancé doesn’t have to worry about hurting your feelings. If you want your ex there because of the children, then say so, as this can actually make it easier on your fiancé who will see that this is about broader family implications, not just about old feelings.
Tell your fiancé to be completely honest with his or her feelings and to express his or her gut reaction. Let your fiancé know that it's fine to say no but that you hope for that your fiancé will agree. Be conscious that the thought that goes through the minds of many a person asked to cope with an ex at a wedding is: ""Is he/she going to look at that person and remember all the good times they had together?""
Be prepared to drop the notion of inviting your ex if it seems likely to create deep anxiety for your spouse-to-be and is likely to ruin his or her wedding experience.
Involve your fiancé in laying down ground rules if the ex comes to the wedding. Let your fiancé know that your priority is the wedding and the marriage. Allow your fiancé to establish the ground rules based on his or her comfort level and stick to them. For example, during the reception, you can only have small talk with your ex and no dances or lengthy discussions. Or perhaps your ex is only allowed to attend the wedding but not the reception. Work out together what sits most comfortably for both of you.

, In some cases, the ex may be a family friend, which will negate any issues with the invitation on your parents’ part. However, if you originally didn’t part ways on a high note or if your parents or other relatives have a beef with your ex, you may want to broach the subject with the relevant relative. Avoid springing the announcement on the family during a public occasion such as dinner if a family member is uncomfortable with your ex. Instead, as with your fiancé, discuss the matter in a quiet, private room where you can open the discussion to honest feelings and opinions.

, As with your family, consider if your ex’s presence will set off another guest. The last thing you want is a boxing match or a showdown at your elegant affair. Mentally review your entire guest list to ensure there are no conflicts, no other complicated relationship skeletons in the closet that could spring forth during the heady emotionalism of a wedding. If you discover a potential for conflict, determine if you can discuss the invitation with the relevant guest or even consider not inviting that particular guest, if feasible. Naturally, this will involve weighing up who is the most apt to invite to your wedding out of the guest with a potential for conflict or your ex.

, Obviously, if you want to invite your ex, it's presumed that you're still on friendly terms. All the same, he or she may be uncomfortable with the whole concept of being invited to your wedding and their feelings should be respected. When asking them if they'd mind coming, explain your reasons for having them come along. In addition, explain how the ceremony will play out and what type of reception you plan to throw (if you're planning on inviting your ex to the reception as well). Be sure to let your ex know who else is invited and reassure your ex that he or she is absolutely allowed to bring a date.

, Avoid seating or locating your ex near any other ex-flames or anyone who might be unhappy being near him or her. In the church or hall, your ex should be seated or located away from the front rows, where immediate family sits or stands. At the reception, your ex should not be seated at any of the primary tables unless this is important for keeping an eye on very young children. Even then, it would be better to ask other family members to do that instead if the children need to be at the primary tables. At all times, be considerate as to who will be forced to mingle with whom as a result of seating arrangements.

Create a powerful ritual.,
Create a sense of place.,
Say a blessing or give a toast or say grace.,
Hold hands around the table as you express your gratitude.,
Think of the things that children can express.",How to Get the Most Out of Family Dinners," For example, on Sunday dinners, using your grandmother's china is a lovely symbolic gesture that says Sunday dinner in this family is important enough to get out the good china.;
, Using grandma's china, for example, creates a real link to the past and you can start telling stories about grandma and other family members from the past. Kids who know more about their family history feel more connected to their family and report back later that their families are higher functioning. By ritualizing dinner a little bit, you create a sense of place and a real sense of belonging.

, Grace doesn't have to be tied to any religious doctrine; the potential grace has is that it is a habit that kids get into that evokes all kinds of positive emotions. Grace is an expression of gratitude or appreciation for the food, or for what you have. The important aspect is expressing positive emotions in the present; it makes us all feel tremendous joy and contentment. It is also an act of faith and optimism, which are positive emotions about the future.

, That is a way of showing that you love one another.

, Encourage them to find good things about their day, such as: ""I had a great play date today""; ""This is delicious food""; ""Daddy gets to be home with us tonight""; ""We all feel good""; ""My cold is gone""; etc. Support their interpretation of the things that are worth being grateful for and make this a regular occurrence at the dinner table.

Look for a cruise line that offers family-friendly accommodations and activities geared towards children.,
Ask about whether babysitting is available.,
Look for destinations and ports of call that will interest the entire family.,
Ask about dining options.",How to Enjoy a Caribbean Cruise With Children1,"


Research cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and Carnival. These lines have ships that include waterslides, rock climbing walls, miniature golf and arcades.
Reserve a cabin that is large enough to accommodate your family. Cabins are notoriously small on most cruise ships, so you may need to ask for an upgrade. You can also reserve adjoining cabins.;
, Some cruise lines offer babysitting services on board. This can be helpful if you want to enjoy some nightlife or do things without the kids during the day.

,


Choose Caribbean destinations that offer private beaches, hiking, snorkeling, and other activities that you and your children will enjoy.

, If you want to eat with your kids, choose the early dining time, which is usually around 6:00 p.m.


Look into other options if you would prefer a leisurely dinner without the kids. Royal Caribbean has a program that allows you to sit down to dinner with your kids but finish up alone. Staff members collect your kids for a special program after they have eaten.

Decide what you will do with the children and without them.,
Prepare your kids for when you will be apart.,
Take advantage of adults-only opportunities such as spa treatments, nightclubs and workout rooms.

,
Enjoy activities that can only be enjoyed in the Caribbean.,
Take lots of pictures, and let your kids be the photographers.",How to Enjoy a Caribbean Cruise With Children2,"


Have a talk with your spouse, partner or travel companions about which activities you want to do with the kids. These activities might include swimming in the pool, taking part in excursions at your ports of call and attending evening shows.
Allow yourself some non-child time too. Decide when you will take advantage of babysitting services and kids programs so that you can have some adult time.

, Small children might be a little nervous, so talk to them about what they will be doing and get them excited.

,, Whether you want to feed stingrays or swim with dolphins, give your kids an experience they will never forget.

, Putting your children in charge of the camera will give them a project, and help you preserve some of the best memories of your trip.

Review the houseboat's inventory list from the rental company, so you know exactly what you don't need to bring.,
Make a list of household items you'll need to bring.,
Plan the menu for three meals a day plus snacks and beverages.,
Pack personal items.,
Bring everything you need for water recreation and fun in the sun during the houseboat vacation.,
Prepare for bad weather and indoor activities during the evening.,
Take a fishing rod and tackle if you plan to fish.,

Be diplomatic and be sensitive.,
If it seems that your relative is bored, suggest that they go and do things that interest them.,
If you can't work out why your relative has this need to clean the holiday home from top to bottom, you might try explaining how their busy cleaning makes you feel.,
Go out.",How to Cope When a Relative Starts Cleaning Your Holiday Home," The first thing you need to work out is why your relative feels compelled to start cleaning; it may have nothing to do with passing a criticism on your own standards of cleanliness or feeling as if everyone's being too lazy. If could be out of boredom, habit, or feeling that this is the best way to repay you for having invited them along.;
, Offer to take them somewhere for activities or let them take the car. Maybe there are things that they can do around the holiday home that are more interesting than cleaning, like gardening, or helping to fix anything needing repairs.

, Consider something like:


I appreciate your efforts doing the housework. It's just that when I'm on vacation, I like to be able to relax and having someone working hard around me causes me to feel guilty and stressed, and makes me feel as if I should also be doing housework instead of relaxing. I came here to relax and while it's very kind of you to want to clean up, I'd love it if you could just enjoy the opportunity to relax on vacation too. I am happy to do the housework when we leave but not till then.""

, If you cannot stop your relative from doing the housework, spend as much time as possible outside and away from the holiday home. With any luck, that'll put a stop to the vacation housework obsession!

Be grateful for the in-law relationships where you click instantly and get along.,
Be sure to want to develop a friendship with your in-laws.,
Understand that you all have mutual interests.,
Don't fall for the trap of seeing your spouse's less amiable habits as being the result of the way your in-laws raised him or her.,
Try to meet on neutral territory more often.,
Keep in mind that closeness to in-laws improves marriage.,
Be reciprocal and non-competitive.,
Don't take an unwillingness to befriend you personally.",How to Befriend Your In Laws," Some people simply don't get the whole in-law thing, as they find their own in-laws lovable, caring, and adequately off their turf. For those of you lucky enough to find this, you might not need to find the pathways of friendship. For everyone else, continue with the remaining steps!;
, Without this desire, you won't get very far because your anger, irritation, or condescension will continue to shine through instead.

, And that those mutual interests sometimes conflict. Children, running a household, maintaining a garden, choosing schools or places to reside, feeding the family, etc., are all potential minefields rather than points of mutual understanding. In being aware of this, you can be alert to the potential triggers that make friendship harder:


It is all too easy to view suggestions in these areas as criticism, interference, or bossiness.
The ""advice"" is usually offered in the most personal place of all - each other's homes. It's a little hard to distance oneself when one's own territory is at stake!

, That is just a cop-out and it fails to respect that your spouse is an individual person capable of making his or her own choices about how to be. It might help to put yourself in your in-law's shoes and think about how much you'd like it if your future daughter-in-law or son-in-law suggested that your own child's negative habits were all down to you! Not a nice feeling, is it?! Besides, going on like this traps people into behavior patterns rather than providing expectations that we are all individuals with the potential to grow, change, and overcome early life habits: Don't give your spouse that out if they're not living up to being a fully engaged spouse.

, If seeing your in-laws in your own home, or in theirs, is just too trying, arrange to meet them elsewhere on more occasions than in your own homes. Some examples of places to meet include restaurants, parks, malls, the library, cafes, places of entertainment, etc. Even a friend's house might be a good solution depending on the circumstances.

, When your spouse is happy that he or she can see his or her parents without feeling that you are unhappy, a huge burden is removed from your relationship and the original closeness can be maintained with the in-laws without detracting from your marriage. In addition, the extra support and love obtained when in-laws are a friendly part of your life is priceless, especially with respect to harmony.

, Instead of trying to outdo your in-laws for your spouse's affections, here are some basic things to consider:


Stop trying to make the best cake, or trying to find the best wine, just because this is also the province of your in-laws.
Ask for their knowledge and be genuinely grateful to receive it. For example, ask them for the recipe of the meal you just enjoyed, ask them how they mowed the lawn so efficiently, ask them how they planned that trip around the world on such a tight budget. Instead of resenting their good points, make the most of them and benefit from both their knowledge and the fact that in asking a favor from them, they in turn realize that they must reciprocate by trusting what you're good at.
Don't wait for your spouse to lay the groundwork. Find individual connections with your in-laws on common ground. It doesn't have to be everything or even a lot - just something that you can share stories, tips, ideas, or even commiserations about.
Ask for their help. Instead of assuming they're not interested or willing, ask. They'll soon let your know if organizing little Johnny's fourth birthday party is beyond their capacity.

, Much of negative or difficult in-law behavior is tied up in the unresolved patterns of their past, in the reality that some parents are still coming to terms with their children growing up, and may never come to terms with this. At the end of the day, what matters is that you maintain your willingness to be friendly, and do so without allowing yourself to be drawn into the emotional blackmailing or confusion that some in-law relationships insist on being.

Start with the type of vacation you want.,
Research dog-friendly destinations.,
Choose a hotel that allows pets.,
Choose a spot your dog can easily travel to.,
Make flight arrangements.",How to Choose a Dog‐Friendly Vacation Destination1," Traveling with pets means you may not get to choose the specific destination you want. Instead, you should probably think about the type of getaway you want. Do you want a beach vacation, a city adventure, or a mountain getaway? With this idea in mind, you can start finding a good pet friendly destination.After choosing the type of place, you can start researching dog-friendly areas. For example, if you want a US east coast beach, you can look for pet friendly beaches in the eastern seaboard states.;
, Some destinations are better for dogs than others. Many blogs and dog-lover websites provide information for dog owners who want to take their pet with them. Before settling on a destination, research to see if it is a dog-friendly place.For example, many destinations in Colorado are dog-friendly. Charleston, South Carolina is another dog-friendly destination, with nearby access to beaches that allow dogs, large dog parks, and even dog beaches. Florida has many beaches that are dog friendly, and St. Augustine even has a dog-friendly cruise.

, There are many hotels in destination cities and in between that will allow pets. Before booking a hotel, you should check the hotel’s website or call them to find out their pet policy and how much extra it costs for a pet-friendly room.


You can also find pet-friendly cottages, bed and breakfasts, and RV parks.
You can search the internet for pet-friendly hotels. If you use a discount booking website, you can choose the option for a pet-friendly hotel.

, If your dog loves to ride in the car and does it often, longer road trips are okay. If your dog doesn’t like to ride in the car, choose a vacation spot close by.When you go on a road trip with your dog, make sure to pack plenty of water and food, treats, an extra leash, and poop bags.
Make frequent bathroom breaks. Think about the best places to stop with your pet. Rest stops have pet walking areas that can be great for letting you and your dog stretch your legs.

, If you are going to a destination that requires a flight, you have to make sure to make arrangements for your dog. Contact the airline prior to buying a ticket to discuss pet traveling policies. Also be aware you will have to buy a ticket for your dog.Make sure to get a direct flight when flying with your dog.
You will need a pet carrier when flying with your dog.

Make a list of pet-friendly restaurants.,
Find alternatives to restaurants.,
Choose dog-friendly activities.,
Research dog parks.,
Consider your dog’s age, health, and activity level.,
Find local dog sitters.",How to Choose a Dog‐Friendly Vacation Destination2," You don’t want to leave your dog in the hotel room all day. That defeats the point of bringing your dog. Some dog websites, such as BringFido, list dog friendly restaurants from around the world.You may also be able to call restaurants or check their websites to figure out if dogs are allowed.

, If you can’t find many dog-friendly restaurants in your destination, consider other options. You can find parks and outdoor areas where you can take your dog and eat a picnic lunch or dinner. Food trucks are a good option since they are outside and you can just walk up to the window.


Ordering takeout and eating it in your hotel or in a dog-friendly destination is another option.

, As you plan your vacation, decide what activities your family can do with your dog. Many outdoor activities, such as hiking or swimming, are in places that are dog friendly. State and national parks, and some national monuments, are also generally dog-friendly.


Think about what you want to do on your trip. Some things, like museums or aquariums, are not going to be dog-friendly.
Before buying tickets or deciding on an activity, call ahead or check the website. This way you will know if you can bring your dog with you.

, Most cities have dog parks. Dog parks can be a good place to visit when on vacation. You can let your dog get exercise and expend energy, and you can relax. Look online or contact a visitor's center or local chamber of commerce. Ask them about dog parks in the area.

, Some vacations may not be right for every dog. If you have a senior or overweight dog, or if your dog has health or mobility problems, you should think about that when choosing a destination. Your dog’s size may also influence what you can do.


If your dog has never hiked or kayaked, you may not want to choose an outdoor adventure. If you want to do that, you may want to limit your activities.
Small dogs with small legs may have more trouble walking long distances.
Dogs that are brachycephalic, like bulldogs or pugs, or long-haired dogs may not do well at the beach or in super hot climates.

, If there is a day you want to do something without your dog, you may find that you need a dog sitter or a doggy daycare service. Before you travel, research available dog sitters and daycares in the area.


Many dog travel websites list these resources. If you can't find any for your particular destination, search online for dog sitting businesses in the area.
You may want to contact the dog sitter or doggy daycare ahead of time to find out if they have openings or how early you need to book the service.

Read the local pet rules.,
Determine what is required to take your pet internationally.,
Take your dog to the vet.",How to Choose a Dog‐Friendly Vacation Destination3," If you are traveling within your home country, you probably know the basic dog rules for the country. However, different cities, countries, and states have different ordinances. Some places are strict about leash laws, while others are more lenient. There are some areas dogs are not allowed.As you plan your trip, read all local dog or pet ordinances so you will know what to expect and what rules you must obey while in the area.

, If you would like to travel to an international destination, you need to find out what the rules are for taking your dog to another country and then bringing it back into your home country. Depending on the country, there may be a few or many hoops to jump through.Contact the embassy or consulate to figure out what the regulations are for traveling with your pet and to get the necessary paperwork.You may also want to contact your vet to see if your dog needs anything to be compliant with your destination country’s regulations.
For example, you may need health certificates, shots, or other immunizations. Your dog may have to go through a quarantine period before entering the country or coming back home.

, Before you go on vacation, get your dog a physical exam. This ensures that you dog is healthy and fit to travel. You should also make sure your dog is up-to-date on all their shots and immunizations.


If your dog needs certain immunizations to travel to certain countries, you can get them during this visit.

Use Audio books.,
Carry a ‘Favourite things’ bag.,
Try wrapping some small travel games and giving them to your children to open during the journey, maybe as a reward for being good.

,
Let them have fun with a Compass.,
Take a full drink bottle for each child and a larger one for refills.,
Headrests.,
Consider taking a ball or Frisbee for a quick game on route.",How to Approach Car Travel With Children," A great alternative to books for children who suffer from motion sickness, audio books and even favourite music or nursery rhyme CD’s can help to keep your children amused while travelling. If you have a CD player, and your children are of an appropriate age to use one, then allow your child to listen through headphones to avoid distractions. This also makes younger children feel quite grown up and the novelty factor is a winner. You can get adapters to allow for two sets of earphones if required. Always ensure that the volume is kept low.;
, Allow your child to pack a little bag with some of their favourite things for the journey. Give them some freedom with this so that it feels exciting and encourage them to include items like; A book, a much loved cuddly toy, travel ‘Etch a Sketch', magnetic travel games, a pack of ‘top trumps', a word search book and highlighter pen

,, This can be a fun item for children who wish to be involved in the navigation! Slightly older ‘happy helpers’ could also have a printed out map of the route, allowing them to tick off towns as you progress on your journey.

, Stocking up at garages can be expensive! Water is advised as sugary drinks will probably lead to higher consumption and therefore more toilet stops (not to mention the excess energy they will provide). Let you children help to make a box of snacks for the journey including items like carrot batons, breadsticks, string cheese, dried fruit and cereal bars. Also take some wipes and a rubbish bag!

, For long journeys a headrest and maybe a lightweight blanket can ensure that your child is more comfortable and likely to take a nap rather than repeatedly ask “are we there yet?”

, You should allow for an opportunity to stretch your legs on long journeys and spending half an hr doing something active with your children during that time can be a really good idea!

Consider past resentments.,
Look for a solution, or leave it alone.,
Make sure you and your spouse are on the same page.,
Be direct.,
Enforce boundaries as necessary.,
Have a positive attitude.,
Encourage everyone to set differences aside.,
Create rituals to minimize conflict.,
Hold different family gatherings if they become too stressful.,
Respect your own needs and limitations.,
Listen to everyone's perspective.,
Create escape plans.,
Surround yourself with positive people.,
Develop a sense of humor.",How to Cope when Your Parents and In‐Laws Do Not Get Along," When attempting to set boundaries for conduct, try to consider everyone's feelings regarding the situation. Past resentments or pain often create conflict within a family unit, so think about any underlying reasons your in-laws and parents may not get along.If your in-laws and parents dislike each other in the present, there is probably something that happened in the past to create the tension. Try to think of what past interactions or moments may have caused the rift.
For example, maybe something happened at the wedding. If one set of parents made a bad impression on the other, this initial meeting may still be causing problems. Try to keep this in the back of your mind when you go in to set boundaries. Understand your parents and in-laws may both still harbor specific wounds and anger due to a failed first meeting.
However, it is important to keep in mind that disagreements between families are not always the result of past resentments. These disagreements may stem from basic cultural differences. When you suspect that a disagreement has occurred as a result of cultural differences, you might take it as an opportunity to educate your family members in both sides. Do this early and often, and make sure that your spouse is on the same page as you.;
, While you cannot force people to make up, you can think of potential solutions after considering everyone's point of view. You can try to smooth over differences, but you can also try to set clear boundaries for interaction to minimize conflict.However, keep in mind that there will not be a solution for every situation. If things don’t seem to be working out, then it is also okay to just leave the issue be and move on.


Often, conflict is due to a lack of understanding. Maybe your in-laws and parents come from different backgrounds. For example, your in-laws come from a culture where hugging is the norm. Your parents come from a culture where personal space is a priority. If your parents did not, say, return a warm hug at the wedding, this may have led to bitter feelings.
You can try explaining the differences to each set of parents. For example, ""I know you think Laura's parents were being rude at the wedding, but their family was just never touchy the way we are. They aren't comfortable with hugging and I don't think they meant to offend you.""
Remember, you can't force anyone to let go of a resentment. In the event your parents and in-laws can't eye to eye, look for an alternative solution. For example, instead of focusing on getting them to make up, find ways to minimize interactions in the future.

, When the two of you are dealing with tricky family situations, it's important that you have the same expectations. Talk it over first before confronting your parents and in-laws about boundaries. Reach a mutual agreement about the kind of behavior you expect.For example, if you're setting boundaries for a holiday event, what do you both want and expect? Do you want your in-laws and parents to be civil for the event? Do you want one person's parents to apologize? Would you prefer to do strictly separate events?
Have a clear game plan in mind and make sure you address any difficulties between you and your spouse in regards to dealing with the situation. If your spouse has a different idea of how to cope, try to meet them halfway. For example, if your spouse would prefer separate events, and you want everyone to be civil for a group event, talk this over until you find a mutual solution.

, When dealing with in-laws especially, direct communication is key. You do not want to, say, ask your spouse to talk to his parents on your behalf. This could come off as passive aggressive. You also do not want to hint at the issue. Remember, you're setting firm boundaries and not merely making suggestions. Make this clear going into the situation.You should both talk to your in-laws and parents separately about the issue. Make sure to let them know what you want to discuss without any ambiguity. For example, say something like, ""We want to talk to you about your issue with my parents and how we can all get along this Christmas.""

, It's not your job to make people who do not get along make up. In fact, it may be stressful to attempt this. Instead, focus on setting clear boundaries that allow you and your spouse to minimize stress in your own lives.Figure out specific values and expectations and then communicate them directly. For example, you may not want either set of in-laws bad talking one another to other family members, especially not at events.
Communicate these values to both set of in-laws directly. For example, ""Mom, Dad, we know you have your issue's with Jack's parents, but we would appreciate it if you kept that yourselves. Please don't complain about them to my sister anymore, especially not when everyone is at an event together.""

, Going into a family event, try to approach things from a positive place. Even if there has been bad blood between your parents and in-laws in the past, going in anticipating the worst may set the stage for disaster. If you come in tense, that can rub off on others. Try to hope for the best before a big event.Think about your intention to be happy ahead of time and state it on no uncertain terms. For example, think to yourself, ""I intend to enjoy this Christmas party, no matter what happens.""
This attitude can shine through, even during negative interactions. If your in-laws, say, make a negative comment on your parents, you'll be more likely to take it in stride if you've decided to be happy. This can prevent you from getting upset and accidentally escalating a situation.

, Disagreements between parents and in-laws can disrupt holidays and other events. Before an event happens, give everyone a head's up that you would appreciate it if differences were set aside for the day.Discuss potentially difficult situations with both sets of parents ahead of time, letting everyone know you understand their feelings and frustrations. For example, ""Mom, Dad, I know you think Jake's parents are stuck-up. We understand you get frustrated sometimes.""
From there, ask that they set aside this resentment, at least for the duration of an event. For example, ""But this is our son's first birthday party, so we want everyone to get along. If you could just let go of that resentment for the party, we would appreciate that.""

, If people tend to fight a lot at holidays, you may have to create new rituals to minimize squabbles. Oftentimes, if people only get together once or twice a year, old patterns of behavior and forgotten tensions resurface during that time. Try to figure out new rituals that can help minimize conflict and arguments.For example, you could keep everyone occupied with a task at a family event. If you're, say, playing board games the whole time, your in-laws and parents will have something to focus on other than one another.
You can also consider rituals that help minimize interaction between your parents and in-laws. For example, if you have a very big family, have two tables for Thanksgiving dinner and your in-laws and parents sit at different tables.

, Another option is to divide your time with each group into two separate gatherings. You and your spouse can decide on specific days and time frames to celebrate with each set of parents separately.


For example, you could have your in-laws over for dinner on Christmas Eve and then invite your parents to come over for dinner on Christmas Day.

, It is not your job to make sure everyone gets along. Your parents and in-laws need to be willing to be mature and smooth over differences. If you're not making any progress, acknowledge feelings you're experiencing like sadness, tension, and frustration.It's okay to give yourself a break to vent. Express your feelings to others instead of bottling them up. For example, sneak away to sent a text to a friend ranting about the family fighting if you're feeling overwhelmed.

, You want everyone in the situation to feel heard. If your parents and in-laws are not getting along, allow everyone to express their sentiments on the situation. This way, neither set of parents will feel you're taking sides in the situation.Allow your in-laws and parents to express any frustrations they have. When they talk, genuinely listen to what they're saying.
Try to put yourself into other people's shoes. Think about what unique experiences may drive someone's perception of the situation. Think about how you would feel if you were your parents or in-laws.
Remember, you don't have to solve the problem. Oftentimes, merely being heard makes people feel vindicated. This may encourage your in-laws and parents to be civil in the future.

, Some tensions simply do not go away. At family events and holidays, have escape routes in place. That way, if anyone is feeling overwhelmed, they have the option of slipping away for a moment. This can keep emotions in check if conflicts do not have a clear resolution.For example, you can have a code word or phrase your parents agree to use if they need a break from your in-laws. If your parents say something like, ""We're very tired,"" this means they need to exit the event early to prevent an argument.

, You should deal with your own emotions as well. After difficult interactions between your parent and in-laws, surround yourself with people the family that do get along. For example, if you and your siblings are all friendly with one another, spend some time with them after arguments between your parents and in-laws crop up., Laughter can help you put a situation in perspective and stay positive. Try to laugh off negative interactions and make jokes with your spouse about the situation. Humor can help minimize stress during stressful confrontations and arguments."

Do not spend the visit complaining.",How to Be a Good Guest (for Mothers in Law)," Don't expect your hosts to cart you around to wherever you want to go. Additionally, your hosts may be not having their vacations as you are and working throughout the day - the last thing they want to do when they get home is drive you places.;
, If they are working during your stay, they may need some time to themselves away from 'entertaining'. Conversely, ask them ahead of time if they have any routines that you should respect while you're in their home.

, If, when you arrive, your hosts have prepared a place for you to sleep and take a bath, do not offend them by refusing their graciousness and sleeping on the sofa or bathing out of the kitchen sink. If they have gone to the trouble to prepare for you, be a gracious guest and take advantage of their preparations. There may be a very good reason they have placed you there. Don't be a martyr.

, do not hum or sing when there is no music playing (especially if others in the room are trying to watch TV or read a book), burp loudly, or walk around in your pajamas all day. Be an observer and learn more about what your child's life is now like.

, Things like spraying yourself liberally with perfume or walking around in underwear may not be acceptable; be a quick learner and follow the rules.

, For example, a recliner is comfortable but there are others in the house that may want to use it on occasion.

, Get up and get your own sodas, cook a meal, take out the trash, do something to contribute to the family. However - before using the stove, oven, washer, dryer, or opening any cabinets to find cleaning products, ask your hosts for permission.

, This is a pessimistic view and not pleasant conversation. Try to not think of yourself the whole time, and try not to monopolize the conversations. Especially, do not get into long 'do you remembers' and goings-on of back home with your son/daughter while other people are present. It makes them feel left out of the conversation and they have nothing to contribute. Find some alone time with your child to reminisce.

, Money is easy to spend and it does not make up for being rude or not following proper etiquette. Your child is a person and deserves respect.

, You had your time raising your children, now it is your son's/daughter's turn to raise theirs.

, If you have a son-in-law, do not verbalize any flaws that you see in him. (This includes refraining from verbalizing your son-in-law's perceived flaws to your own daughter or other family members).

, Period. Your child and spouse already realize that they do not see you frequently. Do not complain about it, do not blame them, and do not bring on the guilt trips and accuse them of not caring. This will only push them farther away and you will see even less of them in the future.

Stop stereotyping.,
Do not be too proud and independent.,
Be the first to implement respect and kindness.,
Watch your Social Mobility-affected attitudes.,
Be Financially Stable.,
Talk to your spouse about balancing your family cohesiveness.,
Be clear to your spouse regarding financial support for in-laws.",How to Adjust with in Laws," The widely accepted stereotype of the ""typical mother-in-law"" can lead into unfavorable mental sets even before marriage. Unfavorable stereotypes about the elderly, that they are bossy and interfering, can add to in-law problems. Remember that you are now a part of their family. So instead of thinking it in a bad way, try to put yourself in their place. If the younger ones in your own family get into trouble or so, you might as well interfere with their lives because you care about them without knowing that you may be annoying them with your interference. This could be the same with your in-laws. Trying to understand the reason of their actions will help you take things easy.;
, Young married adults tend to resent advice and guidance from their parents, even if they must accept financial aid, and they especially resent such interference from in-laws which can possibly make a huge gap in your relationships. Being independent may be good, but everyone needs help sometimes. Learn to put down your pride occasionally and accept help from your parents and in-laws. In turn, they would be willing to accept help from you when it is them who are in need. A process of give and take which is an indication that you are in a healthy relationship with them.

, Though there might be some cases when in-laws will not like you for some reasons, showing disrespect as a revenge will never help you solve the problem. Instead, it will only make the matter worse. Never think that they are mean to you because you are ""just an in-law"". Your own parents might have as well misunderstood you sometimes or get mad at you with no apparent reasons while you were with them, and yet you were still bound to love and respect them. Your in-laws need the same respect and kindness from you.

, If you have risen above the status of your families or that of your in-laws, do not try to keep them in the background. People often find it hard to deal with a person who thinks too much of himself and makes others feel inferior. Most parents and relatives resent this and hostile relationships with you as well as marital friction are likely to develop.

, Particularly when the married couple are young and inexperienced, in-laws will try to exert some control over their lives, especially if they are responsible for their support. But for couples who have proven themselves on their responsibility and are better established financially, in-law interference with their lives is less likely to occur.

, Marital adjustments are complicated when your spouse devotes more time to relatives than you want to; when your spouse is influenced by family advice; or when a relative comes for an extended visit or lives with the family permanently. It is important that you and your spouse will find way to resolve these matters or you will have bad feelings towards your in-laws. This will affect your treatment towards them which they may find strange and can create misunderstandings.

, If you and your spouse have to contribute to or assume responsibility for the financial support of your in-laws, it may and often does lead to a frictional marital relationship. Make a clear agreement with your spouse about what things you both have to sacrifice to make the aid possible. This way, you do not just establish a good relationship with your spouse, but you are less likely blame your in-laws when your specific wants or needs are not met.

Talk more.",How to Survive a Vacation With Your In Laws," What annoys you most about the in-laws? You may want to say “everything about them” annoys you but honestly they can’t be all that bad––they produced the person you love, right? For your own sake, be prepared to give them a break and be open to the possibility that they might surprise you, even if it's surprise at the ease with which you can convince them to stay lounging while the rest of you go out hiking away from them. And rather than broadly dismissing them, try to only pinpoint which areas get on your nerves the most, so that you can find ways to tackle these annoyances head on.


Once you’ve identified what is most unnerving, figure out ways to avoid producing that kind of behavior. For example, if your father in-law likes to call every restaurant server by first name and joke a little too excessively with him or her, or your in-laws like to spend big while you're trying to stick to a budget, suggest to your spouse that he or she does all the restaurant ordering or that you eat at your vacation residence more often (if possible). Alternatively, get the in-laws cooking more often or paying their own way.
Try to suck it up. You aren’t going to change them and you may have to be in situations where they're being annoying or embarrassing. Instead of blowing your top, consider trying to be Zen with the situation. Practice meditation and visualization when they start getting on your nerves. And definitely practice letting go––their behavior reflects on them, not on you.
Get assertive. If the reason your in-laws bug you is because they give you advice on everything from child raising to weight loss, be prepared to call them on it. Let them know that you have heard what they think but that you have made choices to raise your children/eat the way you do/dress as you do and the like, because of your own background/reasons/learning/decisions, etc. In particular, don't let comments about spoiling or ruining your children fester––once said, they'll assume they can keep it up but if you point out how the comments impact you and how inappropriate they are, the in-laws are on notice to stop doing it. You can soften your annoyance by acknowledging advice you do agree with (in the hope the advice will stay at that level).;
, Unless you're sharing a mansion with wings for your in-laws and your family, avoid staying together too long. To paraphrase Mark Twain, ""fish and visitors go off after three days"" and even your immediate family can feel overwhelming when around each other constantly, let alone extended family. Stand your ground and limit the amount of time spent together on vacation.

, Where you're headed for holiday can be a good or a bad thing, depending on how you choose to see it. In all cases, you are not their babysitters and you are entitled to get out and enjoy yourself away from their presence. It can help to remind yourself that even your own parents or anyone from that generation would probably cramp your style after a while anyway, so shelve the guilt and start looking for constructive and fair solutions instead.



Cruise: Even though you may be feeling “trapped” at sea, don't despair as you may have more freedom than you think. In addition to having your own cabin, most cruise ships are extremely large, so you could easily “get lost” on board throughout the trip. Even better is suggesting that everyone select their preferred activities to head off to and agree to only meet up again for meals.

All-inclusive resort: While you may have your own room, you’ll need to ascertain how much square footage you have to roam. Resorts typically mean that you don’t want to venture out into the town alone, so identify some “hiding” spots throughout the area so you can grab some alone time. And find out what activities are on offer that will interest your in-laws––help them book into them. If you find out they dislike the gym, spend more time there; on the other hand, if they want to lie around all day, find some active options for yourself that takes you out of their presence. On your return, you can always lie down at the opposite end of the pool, swearing that your myopia prevented you from spotting them.

House rental: This is the ultimate in togetherness so if you're renting a house with the in-laws, stockpile the alcohol, board games, outdoor sporting gear, local attractions guide, bikes for quick escape, and buckle up. This trip will require a little more than creative planning on your part as you will most likely be together 24/7. Do some online research before leaving to find out what activities and sites your in-laws might like to do and see, so that you have plenty of excuses to drive them into the nearest town and leave them there for the day.

Overseas adventure: On the one hand, you should be extremely busy and involved in exploring new territory, cultures and experiences. On the other hand, you may want to strangle your mother-in-law for attempting to speak Mandarin, while infusing Pig Latin into her sentences and complaining that she doesn't eat foreign muck. Grit your teeth and learn to hide behind the guidebook but don't be too timid––occasionally calling out your in-law's rudeness or boredom with what is happening can actually spur them into getting with it sometimes, out of embarrassment or a desire to keep up with you.

, The best way to take back your vacation is to set aside time for just you and your immediate family. A day excursion or even a dinner at night may help you feel like you have regained (somewhat) control over your vacation.


Let your in-laws know ahead of time that you plan to do a few spouse or family only activities. Be matter of fact and deliver the news to make it sound like it is something good for everyone, including the in-laws.
Don’t be too specific about what you're doing. If your in-laws are crafty they may “surprise” you with a visit during dinner or a couples massage.

, Divided you conquer and getting the in-laws unglued might actually improve things for everyone (maybe even them included). Make it clear to your in-laws that this isn't about avoiding them but it's about making the most of the time everyone has together on this vacation. By acknowledging that different people and age groups have different interests to pursue, you can enlighten them to spending time apart as a way of increasing togetherness as a whole and helping them to see it's perfectly natural that there will be occasions when you split up into pairs, smaller groups or even as individuals, depending on the activities chosen. Sell this mixing-it-up as a benefit (which it is), and be sure to split the in-laws up too, so that grandpa spends time with his granddaughter, grandma spends time with her grandson, and so on, apart from each other. Basically, split them apart for a bit and you might discover different personalities under the restfulness of a vacation!


Be fair. Although you may want to ditch the in-laws every single day on your trip, balance the alone days with in-law days, so you don’t offend or upset anyone.

, You're going to have to go to that happy Zen place if you're to survive an in-law laden vacation. Consider implementing some de-stressing activities to enhance your mood and boost your serotonin levels.


Work out every day. While you may feel as if you should lay around like a fine piece of veal during your vacation, you should do just the opposite to get the endorphins pumping and boost the happy hormones. It's a good excuse for time to yourself and you'll astonish your in-laws with your dedication and fitness levels.
Sleep in. Now’s the time to catch up on those z’s, plus you’ll be better prepared to handle your in-law’s grating habits.
Eat well. Indulge in the indigenous bounty provided at your destination. Enjoy fruits and vegetables and try to avoid overindulging on desserts or alcohol. Good food will keep everyone in a good mood. If cooking is an in-house matter, draw up a roster that includes your in-laws taking turns.
Practice meditation. Even if you’ve never meditated in your life, sit in a dark, peaceful room for a few minutes every day. Close your eyes and think of a place where you feel happiest and most at peace. Practice deep breathing exercises to relax the mind and soul.

, Perhaps some of your anxiety and dislike or discomfort around your in-laws has grown over the years through lack of communication or as a result of misunderstandings. Vacation time is an opportunity for some honest heart-to-hearts, especially dark nights by the bonfire or under the stars, where people seem to feel less inhibited and more likely to speak personal truths. If you approach this as a potential for bonding, however tenuously, it might not be as utterly mind-numbing as you're worried it will be.


Once again, assert yourself. If you've been too good to your in-laws out of deference to your spouse, you may be harboring resentment over the comments and actions of your in-laws. Whenever they say or do something that bothers you, find a polite and assertive way to draw their attention to what they're doing. Even if they're doing it to purposefully annoy you, they may be surprised that you're willing to stand up for yourself and demand more respect. Nobody said this is meant to be easy but it is part of your own personal growth to both reach out and to assert your own dignity. At least you can say you tried.

Be forgiving.,
Make up.",How to Accept a Family Member's Spouse," There can be many reasons for this. Maybe the addition in the house was unexpected or against the will of the family, perhaps you dislike their attitude or behavior, it might be a gay couple, etc. Find out why you are having difficulties with that person.


If the spouse is causing physical or emotional damage to your loved one, this is a serious problem. Get help right away.;
, Realise that it is as difficult for the person to accept your family as it is for you to accept him/her. Give the person space to open up and try to make him/her feel at home. It takes time to adjust for anyone in a new home, give the person that time.Put yourself in his/her shoes and try to think of the situation from his/her point of view too.

, Your loved one has probably noticed your less-than-happy attitude about their spouse. Take them aside to a quiet place and have a heart-to-heart about your relationship with their spouse.


Phrase it as your problem and use ""I"" language. ""I need help because I am having trouble getting along with your spouse.""
Make it clear that you are not attacking their spouse or their taste in partners.

, Find out what you have in common with the person. You both might like the same TV show, music or you both share might share the same hobby. Ask him/her about his/her dreams, aspiration and goals. Share family jokes. You can also talk about his/her partner.  You might find a good friend in that person.

, Tell the person why you have difficulty in accepting him/her. Act compassionate, and apologize if needed.


""Kiante, I realize that I've been a little aloof and distant towards you. I guess I've been having a hard time accepting that my baby bro is gay. That's my problem, not yours, and I realize that you're the type of guy who will treat him right. I'm truly sorry, and I hope we can be friends.""

, After all, they are married to your loved one, not to you. Search for their individual strengths. Try to see how, even if they aren't a good match for you, they are right for your family member.

, You have to do a lot of sharing when a new person joins the family. You'll share dinner tables, company, and loved ones. But the good part is that you also get to share your responsibilities, love, thoughts and feelings. Look for ways to share positive experiences together.

, Everyone has faults. How would you feel if someone judged you as harshly as you were judging the spouse? Try to ease up a little and give them the benefit of doubt.

, Even if you fight with the person make it up as soon as you can. Do not let the bitterness of a fight affect your relationship.

Name your baby after a season or significant event.,
Wait until you meet your baby.",How to Choose a Baby Name1," This list might include names passed down from beloved family members, friends, or influential figures in your lives. There are no rules or limits to what your baby’s name can be.Don’t be afraid to consider significant names from many different sources. Beloved book or movie characters, songs, childhood pets, or even the street you grew up on can be turned into a special and meaningful baby name.;
, Perhaps, you two were introduced by your mutual friend, Dora, your first conversation was about Charles Dickens, or you shared your first kiss under the Eiffel Tower in Paris.


If you and your partner both have an equally long list of personal name ideas, a good way to compromise might be to decide on a name with mutual significance from your shared past.

, Family trees are a great source of inspiration as you’re searching for significant baby names. Some families have incorporated common middle names or used specific ethnic origins for generations.


Don’t feel pressure to conform to your families’ naming norms, but it’s always a good idea to ask about them so that you keep your options open.Asking your families about naming traditions or trends may also help you and your partner compromise on a meaningful name.
For example, you may find out that you both had a great-grandmother named Mary or that you each had an ancestor from Ireland.

, Let inspiration come to you during the special and tender time of pregnancy. The good news is that you have approximately 10 months to decide, so you have lots of time.


For example, you or your partner might feel the baby’s first flutters during a walk by the ocean, which might inspire an ocean-themed name, like Ariel or Kai.
Vivid dreams and memories are a common symptom of pregnancy, and many expectant moms claim that the names they choose for their babies came to them during dreams they had while pregnant.

, Perhaps your baby will be born right when summer roses are in full bloom or during the very first snowfall of the year, alluding to names like Summer, Eden, Rose, Rosalie, Snow, Elsa, Winter, or December.

, You and your partner might decide on the perfect name once you’ve met your baby and have a chance to get acquainted.She might surprise your family and be born with red hair, just like your great Aunt Josephine.
If you have a boy with serene features, perhaps he’ll remind your partner of a poem by your favorite poet, inspiring you to choose a name like Walt or Earnest.

Store laundry products out of reach and out of view.,
Keep products in the original packaging and in the intended place.,
Take special precautions with detergent packs / pods.,
Look around from a kid’s perspective.,
Make the laundry room a kid-free zone as much as possible.,
Latch the doors on front-load washers and dryers.,
Prevent falls and eliminate appliance tipping hazards.,
Hide or secure irons, ironing boards, and other laundry accessories.,
Ensure that utility connections are safe.",How to Child Proof Your Laundry Room," Detergents and other laundry products often come in brightly colored containers and have appealing scents. Small children can seem almost compelled to touch them and — if given the chance — taste them. To prevent this, make “out of sight, out of mind” your mantra as you decide how and where to store your laundry products.If at all possible, keep your laundry products in an overhead, locked cabinet. If this is not feasible, keep them on a high shelf that cannot be accessed by small children. If you must keep them in a lower position, make sure they are kept behind a locked cabinet door at all times.
When choosing where to locate your laundry products, imagine that you are storing dangerous chemicals … because you are.;
, You may think it is safer to pour your fabric softener into some nondescript container instead of the colorful package with the cuddly bear on it, but you’re more likely to cause confusion this way. Make sure you know exactly what is in each container, and return each item to its secure storage location as soon as you finish dispensing it.Never keep laundry products on the machines, on the floor, or in basket, even during wash cycles or between loads.
Identify laundry products in their original packaging as “bad” by applying a “Mr. Yuk” or similar child safety sticker. But never assume a sticker will stop a child from exploring.

, In only a few years on the market, laundry detergent pods or packs — pre-dosed amounts of concentrated detergent sealed within dissolvable “skins” — have become widely adopted because of their convenience. Unfortunately, the qualities that make them so convenient — their size, shape, and quick-dissolving nature — also make them particularly dangerous for small children. Several thousand poisoning incidents occur in the U.S. each year due to ingestion of detergent pods.Keep the pods / packs secure within their original packaging, and keep the package sealed and stored properly. Never allow a child to touch one of the pods, as even a small amount of moisture can dissolve the “skin” that seals the detergent inside. The detergent is highly concentrated, so wash your hands after touching a pod and before touching a child.
Some companies are now making more child proof containers for pods. Purchase these if you can find them.

, It may seem silly to get down on your hands and knees in your laundry room, but placing yourself at a small child’s eye level really does make it much easier to identify potential hazards. Doing so can also alert you that something you think is securely out of reach and/or out of sight is in fact not.Children under three years old, and especially under eighteen months, explore by “mouthing” things. To reduce choking hazards, make sure that items smaller than the child’s fist are always out of reach. Watch also for laundry items that children are drawn to grab, handle, and “mouth,” like spray bottles and powdered detergent scoops.

, The most truly “child-proof” laundry room is one in which a child never enters. If you can place your laundry room behind a locked door, do it. In any case, teach your child from the start that the laundry room is a “grown up space” and keep any toys or kid-friendly items out of it.


Do the laundry during naptime or when the kids are outside playing with grandma so they don’t have to join you in the laundry room.As soon as your kids are old enough to understand, teach them that detergent pods are not candy and liquid cleaners are not beverages.Let your little child be a “big helper” with sorting dirty clothes or putting clean ones away, not with the washing. Teaching that skill can wait until kids are much older.

, If a small child can reach a door handle, he or she will try to open that door — and front-loader appliance door handles are just the right height. Such doors often take effort to disengage and then fling open, possibly striking the child. Even worse, a curious child may climb into the machine and possibly seal him or herself inside.Visit the child safety display of your preferred retailer and choose latches specifically designed for this purpose. Add them to your refrigerator, oven, and other potentially dangerous locations while you’re at it.

, When open, a traditional dryer door makes an ideal drawbridge-like platform upon which a child will want to climb. Falling from atop a washer or dryer, especially onto a hard basement floor, can easily injure a child. Additionally, if the appliance is not securely on level flooring, there is the possibility that it may tip over onto the child.Make sure your appliances don’t wobble, rock, tilt, or tip. Washers and dryers have adjustable legs to compensate for uneven floors.
Do not allow children to play on or near washers and dryers. They are heavy-duty and potentially dangerous pieces of machinery.

, An iron on a shelf with a dangling cord is an accident waiting to happen. A pull-down ironing board can also easily cause injuries, and freestanding models can tip over or catch tiny fingers when opened or closed. Once again, look and think like a child and keep tempting but dangerous items out of view and/or out of reach.Don’t leave your iron and ironing board out, even if you have to stop partway through your ironing. Put them away and get them back out whenever you get the chance to finish ironing the clothes.
Be smart with accessories like collapsible drying racks as well. They present a significant pinch hazard.

, For general health and safety, check regularly to ensure that electrical, gas, water supply and drainage, and exhaust connections are properly attached and maintained. For childproofing purposes, keep as many cords, pipes, tubes, and connections out of sight or out of reach as possible.


A washing machine should be connected directly to a standard 110 volt outlet (in the U.S.), while a dryer should be plugged into a dedicated 220 volt line. Make sure all connections are secure and out of reach of children. If necessary, use childproofing outlet covers that prevent access to the plugged-in connection.Never allow standing water to remain in a laundry sink, wash basin, bucket, or anything else that could present a drowning hazard. Small children can drown in very small amounts of water. Clear slow or blocked laundry sink drains immediately.

Consult a baby book or an online name database.,
Choose from a pre-approved list.,
Tune into the media.,
Take a vote or conduct an online naming poll.,
Choose a nickname.",How to Choose a Baby Name2," Baby naming books are easy to find in the library, and there are a number of online naming lists and websites. If you have a specific category you want your baby name to come from, such as nature-inspired names, classic boy names, gender-neutral names, or Southern names for girls, be sure to enter that as online search terms.


When looking through lists of names, try not to get overwhelmed by the number of choices. Just read and search until one jumps out at you and seems to stick.

, Some countries, like Iceland, only allow babies to be given nationally approved names. To narrow down your search, consider choosing an ethnic name from a pre-approved list, like those for Iceland., Skimming baby or parenting magazines, watching entertainment news on TV, and even listening to popular songs on the radio that are specific to your personal preferences might offer inspiration on the latest and greatest names.


Beware of name fads that quickly fizzle out in terms of popularity. For example, timeless names, like “Charlotte” and “Poppy” are becoming wildly popular again, but so are very modern names, like “Meadow” and “Story.”
Although “Meadow” and “Story” are cute names now, make sure that you and your partner will still find them attractive when their popularity dies out and newer naming trends take their place., This strategy definitely isn’t for everyone, but some parents desire public input. At the baby shower, guests can submit names of their choosing for your review or you can host a poll on social media, where your friends vote on your top five favorite names.


You aren’t obligated to ultimately choose the name that gets the popular vote, but be sure not to make any promises ahead of time.
You don't want those who vote to participate with expectations and then have their feelings hurt if you make an alternative choice, so be sure to let your voters know the poll is just for fun.

, Sometimes nicknames can inspire full-length baby names. If you’ve always dreamed of calling your baby by a fun or informal name that isn’t necessarily appropriate as a full-length name, you can work backwards to find one!


For example, if “Sunny” or “AJ” are nicknames you adore, “Sonora” or “Amelia Josephine” could serve as formal, full-length names that the baby can switch to when she is older.

Even if your baby’s name doesn’t have personal or family-based significance, it’s still a good idea to check its formal definition.For example, “Portia” sounds like a beautiful and exotic name for a girl, but it’s Latin for “pig,” which is a meaning some people may find appalling and others may adore.

, Make sure the name you choose sounds good out loud. “Julian George,” for example, has a regal ring to it, while “Stella Isabella” sounds more like the name of cartoon character.

, Puns are never a good idea when selecting a name for your baby. School-age kids can be especially cruel, so steer clear of puns or plays on popular words and phrases.


Candy Kane and Gamble Moore may sound cute and funny in the moment, but remember that your child will have to live with laughs and jests for a lifetime!
Avoiding puns or irony for twins is also important. Twin names like “Jennifer and Angelina” or “Harry and Sally” are references to pop culture and won’t be lost on the majority of people, even if making a joke wasn’t your intention.

, It can get quite frustrating if your name is constantly mispronounced or you have to repeat your name or its spelling multiple times to a new acquaintance because it’s unusual, long, or difficult to say. For example, if you like a rare name like “Meegan” but choose to spell it “Meagan” or “Megan,” people will assume the common pronunciation over the exotic one, which means you and your child will constantly be correcting new acquaintances.
""Axle” is a cute, modern boy’s name, and though “Acksol,” and “Aksyl” are unique renditions of it, they are not intuitive., While some names are perfectly suited for cute babies and small children, they won’t always suit an adult. Make sure the name you choose can grow right along with your baby.For example, while “King” is an adorable name for a baby boy, his colleagues may not take him seriously when he’s an adult giving a presentation in a corporate office.

, Some of the best name combinations can bring forth the worst initial combinations, so be sure to write out the initials of your favorite name before making the decision permanent.


For example, the name “Ashley Suzanne Seavey” and “Parker Mitchell Smith” are not ideal initial combinations!, No matter what name you choose, it’s going to be impossible to please everyone, and negative feedback may leave you questioning a truly excellent choice. If you wait to announce your baby’s name until after birth, people are far less likely to criticize and far more likely to agree that you’ve made the perfect choice.

Choose a braking method.,
Consider whether to buy a bike with gears.,
Consider purchasing a bike second-hand.,
Carefully choose wheel size.,
Choose a bike that is size appropriate.,
Do not choose a bike your child will ""grow into"".,
Check the bike's brakes.,
Check the front wheel.,
Check the frame.,
Check the material of parts.,
Consider whether to use training wheels for young riders.",How to Buy a Kids' Bike," A helmet is standard equipment and should be purchased before buying a bike. Ensure the helmet fits the child's head size correctly and that the chin strap is snug, but not too tight., You may consider buying a bell or reflectors for your child's bike. Other safety gear to consider includes knee pads, elbow pads, and wrist guards.

, Cheaper bikes tend to be made out of cheaper materials, which also tend to be heavy. Because children's bikes have a smaller wheel diameter, they are harder to pedal, so you want to choose a lightweight bike. Choose a bike frame made from metal alloys and not steel., Children under the age of 5 tend to lack the coordination and skill to work hand brakes and should use pedal brakes.Pedal breaks are activated when the child pedals backward. If you choose a bike with hand brakes, make sure they can easily be grasped and that your child knows how to use them, as it can be dangerous if your child does not know how to stop her bike., Gears will help your child navigate hills and different terrain. Using gears are for more advanced riders, so make sure your child has mastered basic skills such as hand braking, turning, and safety before graduating to more advanced stages.

, Many bikes are available for purchase from a garage sale or through an online marketplace. Children will outgrow their bikes, so consider purchasing a quality second-hand bike as opposed to a new bike.

, Children's bike sizes are determined by wheel diameter, not seat height and frame size (as is the case with adult bicycles). Smaller children's bikes have a smaller wheel diameter whereas bikes for older children have a larger wheel diameter.Ages 4 to 5: Wheel diameter of 12 inches, child's inseam 14-17 inches.
Ages 6: Wheel diameter of 16 inches, child's inseam 18-21 inches.
Ages 7-8: Wheel diameter 20 inches; child's inseam 22-25 inches.
Ages 9+: Wheel diameter 24 inches, child's inseam 26+ inches., The rider should be able to dismount easily and should be able to straddle the bicycle easily on flat feet. When riding, your child's hands and arms should rest comfortably, not needing to outstretch to turn the handlebars. Knees should not hit the handlebars., Children will have a difficult time balancing and maneuvering a bike that is too big and heavy, or may get frustrated or injured dealing with skills that are above their level. Don't put your child in this vulnerable position as it could prove fatal on an open road.

, The brakes are the most important part to function on the bike. Make sure the brakes function properly. If the bike has hand brakes, make sure that the brake pads align on the back tire., Make sure the wheel spins freely, but doesn't move when pushing it side to side. A quality wheel will have a metal hub, spokes and rim., Make sure the metal cannot be bent by hand. Ensure that the frame is aligned by examining the bike head-on, so that the tires and frame all line up., Parts made with plastic will not endure as long as metal-based parts. Parts made of steel tend to be heavy, especially in the tire rims.If purchasing the bike second-hand, make sure it is in full working order before buying. Ask if any maintenance work has been applied to the bike, such as oiling the chain. Assess any wear on the brake pads.

, Training wheel use is debated, and many parents choose not to use training wheels because they can encourage children to reach much higher speeds than their skills can handle. This can result in the child being unable to stop or steer, causing larger accidents.However, other parents believe that training wheels can be helpful for very young children who need to build confidence or learn how to be cautious.


Make sure that your training wheels have adjustments so that you can move them higher off the ground as your child improves. You want your child to get a sense of balance while still having the support of the training wheels. Never push your child to remove the training wheels.

Respect your spouse’s relationship with their parents.,
Avoid making your spouse choose between you and their parents.,
Talk to your spouse about setting boundaries.,
Agree to explain and enforce your visiting rules together.",How to Ask Parents or In‐Laws to Call Before Visiting1," It is important to acknowledge and respect the relationship that your spouse has with their parents. Regardless of whether or not you enjoy the company of your In-laws, you need to understand and respect their significance for your spouse. You should communicate your respect to your spouse:“I really admire the relationship that you have with your father. You seem to share so many things. You’re lucky to have a parent like that in your life.”;
, Although the situation of your in-laws dropping by unannounced is extremely frustrating, you are unlikely to resolve it by giving your spouse a choice between you and their parents. Instead, you should work with your spouse to find a way to increase your privacy and the quality time that you have together.For example, avoid giving ultimatums like the following:


“It’s up to you. Go live with your parents or stop giving in to their every demand and become committed to our relationship.”
Instead, try saying: “We really need to find a way to resolve this situation. What are some things we could do to stop your parents from coming by unannounced?”

, Discuss the need to establish better boundaries with your parents or in laws. You may want to discuss the kinds of values that you grew up with and the kinds of values that you want to have as a couple or a family. In addition, you may want to chat about your respective expectations for time together, away from friends and family. If there are barriers to spending time together such as parents or in-laws who drop by unannounced, talk about how to overcome these barriers., You need to come to an actual agreement with your spouse, so that you are on the same page in consistently explaining and enforcing visiting rules. Decide how you will explain the rules and situations where you need to enforce the rules.


For example, decide how you will explain the reason to your parents or in laws. You could decide to both explain the reason for wanting notice of upcoming visits in terms of privacy or working on your marriage or other justifications. Whatever reason you choose, you should make sure you are consistent in your explanations.

"
"
Communicate your love and respect.,
Explain your need for privacy.,
Tell them to call before coming over.,
Tell them when a boundary has been disrespected.",How to Ask Parents or In‐Laws to Call Before Visiting2," Before telling your parents about your need for privacy, you should make sure they know how much you love and respect them. This will help them understand that your reason for asking them to call is not that you don’t want to see them but, rather, that you need privacy for your relationship or marriage to flourish.You could tell them:


“As I start my new family, I have really started to appreciate the amount of love and hard work that you put into raising us. It couldn’t have been easy. I just want you to know how much I respect the job you did as parents.”
“Although I’ve been busy with work and my new relationship, I just wanted to let you know how much love and respect I have for both of you. Thanks for being amazing parents.”

, Tell your parents that you are at a stage in your relationship where you need privacy for things to move forward. Tell them that there are a lot of things that can get in the way such as work obligations, social events and even family obligations. For instance, you could say:


“We’re having a hard time finding privacy in our lives. There are a lot of demands on both of us right now. And there are always so many social and family events on the calendar. I just wanted to let you know that we’re trying to cut down on social and family events so that we can have more time together. If we say no to an invitation, that’s the reason.”

, You should plainly tell them that you would appreciate a ring before they come over. If they ask for an explanation, you could tell them that it helps you and your spouse maintain some privacy. For instance, you could say:“It would be great if you could just give a ring before coming over. That way, we know when to expect you and can prepare for your visit.”
“My partner, Joyce, and I are trying to find more time together these days. We tell people to call before stopping by. If you wouldn’t mind doing the same, it would be much appreciated.”

, If your parents disrespect your privacy by dropping by unannounced, you should let them know. Try saying:“It is flattering that you want to see us and the baby all the time. However, I should let you know, we were actually trying to have a night for just the two of us when you dropped by unannounced the other day. If you can avoid that in the future, we would be so grateful.”

"
"
Ask your partner to speak to your In-laws about the situation.,
Communicate your needs to your In-laws.,
Be blunt if absolutely necessary.",How to Ask Parents or In‐Laws to Call Before Visiting3," Tell your partner that you would really appreciate it if they could tell your in-laws not to drop by unannounced. Also, you should remind them to communicate how much you appreciate their role in your lives. You could try asking:“Do you mind asking your folks if they could give a ring before stopping by?”
“Can you talk to your parents about their constant visits?”

, If your spouse is comfortable with the idea, you could also directly communicate your needs to your in-laws. Say that the two of you have made a decision to ask all family members to call before visiting. By framing it as a general rule, they may be less likely to get offended. Try saying:“We have made a decision, as a couple, to ask all friends and family members to call before visiting.”

, If your in-laws continue to drop by unannounced after you tell them about your need for privacy, you may need to use more straightforward language. When they drop by, tell them that you are actually busy and don’t have time for them at the moment. Eventually, they should get the message that they need to call before visiting. You might say:""Sorry you came all this way. I'm not sure if you remember, but we're actually busy right now. You really should have called before coming all this way.""
""Sorry, we're actually in the middle of something right now. If you give us a ring later in the week, we can make plans for a better day that works for both of us.""
""Thanks for coming but we're actually busy right now. I hear there's a great new restaurant on Main Street, why don't you check that out. Call us later in the week and we'll set up a time for dinner soon?""

Perhaps you enjoyed a relatively smooth childhood with them, but during their teenage years, you began to have trouble. Maybe you were not present in their life for a while but have recently desired to connect. Thinking critically about your past together will help you as you move forward.


Consider who cut who off or whether the estrangement has been mutual.
Take some time to write out the thoughts you have when you think about your relationship with your child.;
, Perhaps you have enjoyed a relatively smooth and meaningful relationship with your parents over the years, or maybe it has been rocky at best. Consider how your relationship with your own parents may mimic that with your child in negative ways.


For instance, if your parents were very critical of you growing up, consider whether you have transferred that behavior onto your own child. This could have contributed to the estrangement.

, Talk to a loved one or a friend about the estrangement, especially if they know your child as well. They will likely be able to give you some insights into your relationship that you may not have considered. Outsiders can often give a fresh or larger perspective that you may be blinded to seeing.You might considering saying something like “You know that me and my child have had a lot of differences over the years and it really wears on me when we don’t speak for a while. I was wondering if you had any advice or thoughts on how to improve our relationship? Or if you’ve noticed any behaviors in me that you think has caused these problems? Please be honest.”
Talk to friends who also have estranged or rocky relationships with their children.
If you and your child’s other parent are married or still in touch, talk to them about it as well. If your child is estranged from them too, you can support each other; if they are not estranged, they may be able to assist you in reconnecting. However, ex-partners can also sometimes contribute to the estrangement.

, Your child is likely dealing with the estrangement as well, even if they have not expressed that to you. No one enjoys being disconnected from their family. Acknowledge that your child is also hurting in their own way in dealing with this distance between the two of you.


Try putting yourself in their shoes. For instance, if you have been abusive to them in the past or overly critical, think about how that must have felt for them and perhaps you will understand their behavior more.
Remember that adult children will often respond out of their childhood experience with you, rather than to who you are now. They often will not even know who you are now.

, You may feel that you have done nothing to contribute to your falling out, but that is unlikely. Think about the situation and how you could have behaved differently.Perhaps you did something horrible to your child. Maybe you have been addicted to drugs for years or neglected, abused, or abandoned your child. In these instances, you need to work on yourself to deal with those issues within you. Seek therapy to help you work through it.
You can also seek community with others who have had similar issues. For instance, there are support groups for former addicts.

, Call or text your child if you have their number. You can also email them or even reach out through a message on social media if necessary. Try to start out with more casual forms of communication, and work towards a deeper conversation. If your child doesn’t respond, continue to reach out.


You could start by sending birthday and holiday cards to let them know that you remember these important times and you miss them.
If you are friends with them on social media, then you can comment on their pictures. For example, you could let them know how much you liked seeing pictures of them and/or their partner and/or children.
Write a letter. A call or text may not be enough to elicit a response from them. Take some time to write out a thoughtful letter to them apologizing for the things you have done, telling them how much you miss them and want a presence in their life, and promising them that you will do all that you can to be a better parent to them.
You may want to begin the conversation by saying something like “I know we haven’t spoken in a while, but I want to say that I am sorry and I love you. It is a strange feeling to be so disconnected from the person you love the most. I am hoping that we can talk now though and build a better relationship. I’m willing to do whatever it takes.”

, Though it can be difficult to consistently reach out to someone who may not want to talk, don’t give up on your child. Whether it has been months or even years since you last spoke, you will regret if you don’t do all that’s within your power to connect with them.


Reaching out consistently to your child will show that you are dependable. If you have not been dependable in the past, this will be particularly important.

, After thinking deeply on the issues that are present and once your child agrees to see you again, offer a sincere and genuine apology. Apologize for the exact ways that you have hurt them and avoid making excuses for your actions. Assure them that you have thought about how you have caused the estrangement and you feel guilt, but that you want to repair your relationship.


You can begin the conversation by saying “I know that I hurt you when I said those mean things to you and I want you to know that I regret them and I’m sorry. I miss you very much and I hope we can move forward but I know it will take time.”
Choose a quiet, neutral space to apologize. They may not feel comfortable coming to your home, but perhaps you can choose a park or a coffee shop.

, Take some time to listen to your child. They likely have some pent up emotions that they are dealing with in regards to your relationship. Listen not to respond, but to understand, to hear, and to know. They may offer a perspective on the relationship that you had not considered even in your time of reflection. Take some time to hearken to your child’s hurt.


Resist the desire to defend yourself.Recognize that your child’s viewpoint is valid., After you have spoken your peace and your child has as well, begin to address the issues that created your estrangement. If you feel that these have been addressed within the context of your apology, this step may be unnecessary, but if the estrangement was mutual, then further clarification may be needed. Use this time to create a plan moving forward with how to avoid future issues.


For instance, if you got into a fight because your child was disrespectful to you and then you were rude back, you may need to discuss how to avoid fights escalating in the future. Begin the conversation by saying “how can we establish mutual respect moving forward?”

, Work with your child on developing your communication skills with them. Some tactics you can begin employing immediately are to not raise your voice when having a disagreement, to avoid name calling or insults, and to use “i” statements rather than placing the blame on them.


One other way to communicate effectively when having a serious conversation is to use a talking stick. You can select any object to use as your talking stick when having a conversation and only the person holding it can speak, while the other has to listen and can talk only when the stick is relinquished. This method encourages active listening because you are not allowed to interrupt or talk over someone. It also empowers the speaker by giving them a designated invitation to talk., You may find that your issues with your child are so deep-seeded that working on the issues alone may not be enough. Many families have used counseling as a tool to restore and repair their relationships, and you can do the same. There are many different kinds of counselors to consider who specialize in work with families; there are also spiritual counselors who you could consult as well if you and your child are both religious.


You can go to counseling together or separately.

, After this talk, your child will likely be feeling very emotional. Give them some time to process their feelings alone and tell them you will talk to them soon. Assure them that you love them and are willing to wait the necessary time to have them back in your life.


You might say to your child “I understand that our relationship has been difficult and that so much time has passed since we last spoke. This conversation has also been pretty heavy, as well. I’m sure you’ll need some time to think about everything but I want you to know that I am here and I will never leave you and I will never stop being your parent. I hope you will reach out to me soon, but if not, I will reconnect with you.”

, Remember, that it will take time to repair your relationship. More often than not, this will not happen naturally, especially if you have not spoken in a while. You must be willing to do the necessary work - whether this involves counseling, regular phone calls, or even being ignored, sometimes.Be willing to do all that you can to get your child back in your life.

, When you do see your child, focus on the similarities between the two of you. Often times, our differences cause us to fight, but if you can put those aside and instead focus on the ways in which you are alike, you will see improvements in your relationship.


For instance, if they tell you they got a promotion at work, tell them that their work ethic is similar to yours when you were their age and talk about the strides you made in your career, while still seeking to learn more about their job.

, If your child is young, or even if they are an adult, they are often looking to you for cues on how to respond. If you are positive and genuine, they will want to be, too. Remember that the negativity you sow will often be reaped so do your best to put your best face forward with your child.


For example, even if they raise their voice when arguing, respond by being calm. They may realize how inappropriate their behavior seems compared to yours and they may calm down.

, Take some time to sit with your child and reflect on the good times before your estrangement. Break out the photo album and revisit these times visually, as well. This will help both you and your child remember the times when things were less complicated and will renew your love for each other.


You might say to your child “remember the time we went to the beach and go so sunburnt because we stayed out for hours? Man, that hurt, but that was one of my favorite days because you were there.”

, Invite your child to come over for dinner or to go to a movie with you. Don’t allow the estrangement to fester. You must reclaim this relationship with your child, and spending time together is a great step towards reconciliation.


You can do other things together like cook, go for a walk, and even exercise together. Have fun!

, Your child may also have children of their own that you have not seen in a while, or that you have never met. Work towards becoming a staple in their life so that you can enjoy every part of them again. Work towards also communicating regularly and not letting much time elapse between contact, so that you don’t slip back into estrangement.


For example, call them and update them about your life and ask for updates about theirs on a regular basis. You don’t want to be out of the loop about important developments in your child’s life.

, If you know in your heart that you have done everything possible to make amends with your child and reconstruct your relationship, then it is time that you forgive yourself for any wrong you have done. You are not defined by the worst things you have done and each day provides an opportunity to become better and reinvent yourself. Forgive yourself just as you want your child to forgive you as well.Though you have likely thought about all of the wrong you have done to you child extensively during this process, take some time to think about what you have done right. There is no such thing as a perfect parent, but a parent who is trying to have a good relationship with their child deserves some credit. Give some to yourself.
If you are having a difficult time with this, consider consulting a counselor or therapist.

Be available.,

Be relatable.,
Engage with them often.,
Listen without interrupting.,
Maintain open and relaxed body language.,
Be wary of your facial expressions.,
Address their hesitations.,
Remain calm.,
Validate their feelings.,
Thank them for sharing.,
Avoid casting judgment.,
Keep their confidences.,
Help them take action.",How to Become Someone Your Child Wants to Confide in," In order for your child to feel comfortable confiding in you, they have to have the opportunity. If you’re always chatting on the phone with friends, locked into the television, or away at work, you’ll miss chances to communicate.Think similarly to professors and establish some “office” hours for your children when you remove distractions and focus on them. You can use this time to do chores together, engage in fun activities, or share details about your individual days.
Make yourself more available to your children even outside of these hours. If they need to talk to you, make it a point to clear some time as soon as possible. Let them know that you’re there if they need you.;
, One-on-one time with your children is precious. Quality time together helps you forge a bond, get to know your children’s individual quirks, and have time to talk about sensitive/personal topics that may not be brought up during family gatherings.Aim to spend as little as 30 minutes to an hour alone with each of your children every week. Go for a walk around the neighborhood. Toss a ball around in the backyard. Or, cut off your phone, turn down the radio, and use your chauffeuring time to get personal.

, Kids are more open to sharing with parents when you share common interests. If there is nothing shared between you, the child may have a hard time relating to you. If your child can’t relate to you, then they won’t see much of a point sharing—they’ll just go to their friends or the cool parent in the neighborhood.Watch an age-appropriate TV show together every week and discuss it afterward. This is a great way for your child to relate to you and vice versa.
Engage in common interests that allow you share and bond. You may opt to go fishing, hiking or camping, or you may want to try an activity they've expressed interest in such as a cooking or drama class at a local community center.
Another way to be relatable is to stay current on pop culture and things that interest your kids. You don't have to avidly watch these sources, but it can help to be in the loop when your kids bring them up.

, Regular communication is key to positioning yourself as a potential confidante for your child. Make chatting with you a typical part of their day. As you drive them home from sports practice or chop vegetables for dinner, ask questions about academics, friends, teachers. Even more keep track of important dates and details to demonstrate you are actually absorbing what they tell you.


For example, your daughter mentions her friend preparing for her first date. After the special day elapses, you might ask, “So, how was Amanda’s date?”, Parents often think “been there, done that” when communicating with their children. As a result, you might cut into their sentences or block their responses because you’re so sure you know what they were going to say. Doing this can cause you to miss key details. When your child is talking, give them 100% of your attention. And, wait until they’re finished to respond.Silence your phone. Turn off the TV. Go someplace private away from their siblings or peers. Make eye contact with your child. Nod or make sounds like “ahh” to show you’re listening.
Once they’re done, don’t immediately add your own feedback. Instead, summarize what they said like “If I’m hearing you correctly, you’re saying that…”

, Your words can break down the lines of communication, but your posture can, too. If you’re hoping your child will open up to you, the last thing you want is to frighten them away with threatening body language.


Don’t cross your arms, or hoover over your child. If they are sitting, sit, also. Leave your arms and your legs relaxed at your sides., The conversation could be advancing easily, and a frown on your behalf shuts it down in an instant. Just like intimidating postures, knitted eyebrows, flared nostrils, or smirks can make kids back out of the discussion. It’s okay to use nonverbal signals, but use the right ones.Follow a technique known as mirroring, in which you copy the nonverbal expressions of the speaker. If your child appears worried, match their expression. If they display a goofy grin, do that, too. Mirroring shows empathy and so naturally help the speaker feel more at ease, and keep them talking.

, A major roadblock with many adolescents is they expect their parents to have mind-reading abilities. They may drop clues or suggest what’s wrong, but expect you to figure out what the problem is. Of course, you can’t mind-read, but you can use contextual clues.


Consider what your child might be holding back based on what’s currently happening in their lives. If you have a suspicion about what’s on their mind, bring up the topic. Maybe they fear being laughed at or teased. Maybe they fear getting into trouble.
Bring their fears out into the open to make confiding easier. Say something like, “I heard their having a big problem with bullying at your school. You want to talk about it?” to get them talking., Once your child feels ready to confide in you, there’s a possibility that you won’t altogether like what they have to say. Resist the urge to go into a spiel, lecturing them about how they were wrong. Responding the wrong way now could threaten any future discussions.Take a deep, cleansing breath. Relax your body language and facial expression. Continue to listen attentively despite the content of their message.

, If your child appears upset after a confession, be sure to address their feelings first. Showing some empathy towards them demonstrates that, to some degree, you recognize their distress. Empathy at this time can also strengthen your bond. Even if you are upset, you see your child suffering, so you want to acknowledge that.Say, “I’m sorry telling me this made you upset. I can see this was hard for you. That sounds like a difficult situation to be in.”
Things that may seem trivial to you may not feel trivial to your child. Interact with them as an individual and let them know what they are thinking is valid and reasonable.

, Your child may have shared a big revelation or a minor admission of guilt. Or, perhaps they almost never talk to you and finally opened up. Regardless, it’s important that you show gratitude that they shared with you. A simple “thank you for telling me” goes a long way towards ensuring they will confide in you again in the future., As a parent, it can be hard to hold in remarks like “you should know better” when your child reveals they made a mistake. Think about it, would you be interested in confiding in someone if they judged you afterward? Of course not. It’s pertinent that you withhold any criticism at this time, particularly if you want to continue being your child’s confidante., Big or small, a disclosure from your child should be considered priceless. If it is not absolutely necessary to share this information, don’t. Keeping their secret demonstrates your trustworthiness.


Your child will likely be upset or embarrassed if you share their trusted information with your friends, or worse, their friends. Let them know that you won’t by saying, “You don’t have to worry about me saying anything. I will keep this between us.”

, If the content of your discussion requires some sort of action, tell your child upfront what has to happen. If they are older, you might ask, “So, what do you think you should do?” Don’t just solve the problem for them. Allow them to bounce ideas off of you and give them an opportunity to take action on their own behalf and be a part of the solution.For instance, if your child revealed that he is being bullied, you could say, “I will need to contact your school to inform them about this incident. Would you like to join me and tell the principal your side of the story?”
If you child hurt someone or broke a rule, you might say, “I’m glad you told me that you took this phone out of Tom’s bag. I hope you understand that we will have to return it. How about we do it together?”

Decide whether you plan to stay with your spouse.,
Determine what your role in the child’s life will be.,
Set appropriate boundaries.",How to Bond with the Child of an Affair1," As you think about the best way to move forward, take the state of your relationship and what you know about your spouse’s infidelity into consideration. Know that you may have to interact with your spouse’s child if you stay married. If you get divorced, on the other hand, the child probably won’t be part of your life.There’s no simple way to decide whether or not you should stay married. Your personal beliefs, your priorities, and any children you already have should factor into your decision.;
, Talk with your spouse about what they want for their child. Decide what you’re willing to live with and what you’re not.For instance, if your spouse wants you to legally adopt their baby and help raise them, think carefully about whether you are willing to take that step.
You might say, ""I am flattered that you want me to adopt your child, but I need some time to process all this and think about what that might mean. Can we pick this discussion back up in a few days?""
Since this involves the well-being of the child, a mental health professional should be involved in the decision-making process and the execution of the relationship.

, Be up-front with your spouse about your needs and expectations. If there are any situations you aren’t okay with, let your spouse know what they are.For instance, one of your boundaries might be that your spouse must stop contacting the other man or woman.
Your needs and expectations should center around your comfort, as well as restoring trust in your spouse.

"
"
Remember that the child is innocent.,
Think of the child as if they came from a past marriage.,
Invest in your relationship with the child.,
Ensure that all the legal issues are sorted out.,
Decide what to tell your children.,
Ensure your spouse is doing their part.",How to Bond with the Child of an Affair2," While your spouse’s child might be a painful reminder of the betrayal, don’t take your feelings out on them. Instead, remind yourself that they had nothing to do with the circumstances of their birth.In a way, you and the child were both affected by the affair because they were born into an illicit relationship that you were also negatively affected by. Remembering this may help you feel warmer towards the child.
Keep in mind that you will likely need some time to grieve before you can interact with the child in a positive way. Give yourself as much time as you need to grieve.

, Mentally reframe the situation by thinking of the child like you would if your spouse was married before. This can help you accept the situation and focus on the future.You might even remind yourself of this before you are in their presence. Say, ""This child is from a previous relationship. They are just as much a part of my spouse's life as I am.""

, All relationships take time and effort, and this one is no exception. Spend time with your spouse’s child regularly so you can get to know them. Try to let go of your expectations of what you think the relationship should be like and let it develop naturally. Find activities you can do together, and be available for them when they need love and support.If the child is a baby or toddler, playing with toys together is a simple and low-pressure way to connect with them.
Reading books or playing games together can be a good way to bond with older children.

, Make sure you and your spouse both understand how custody, child support, and other legal details work. Talk to a lawyer to make sure you understand your rights and what is expected of you.This is a precaution, as you may not need to go into the legalities. However, this is a wise step to take to protect your assets and be prepared if a custody battle occurs in the future.

, If you already have other children with your spouse, they will probably have to know about your spouse’s other child at some point. Before the new child becomes a part of your lives, talk with your spouse about how you’ll explain the situation to your kids.Explain the situation to your kids in an age-appropriate way.
If your children are very young, they will probably accept the presence of a “stepsister” or “stepbrother” without many questions.
Older children may require a more straightforward explanation. Be aware that older children may also get upset when they find out that one parent had an affair.
You might simply say, ""This is your father's son from a previous relationship. He's your stepbrother."" If further questions are tossed your way, decide how to answer on a case-by-case basis according to the kid's age and level of understanding.
Do not make the mistake of assuming your child will figure it out on their own as they get older. It is important for you to explain what happened.

, Don’t let your spouse shunt the responsibility of caring for their child onto you. Ask them to keep contributing as a parent as much as they can.If you end up caring for your spouse’s child more than they do, you might start resenting both of them.

"
"
Ask your spouse to end the affair.,
Commit to strengthening your relationship with your spouse.,
Make decisions together.,
Talk to other people for support.",How to Bond with the Child of an Affair3," No matter what else happens, if you want to rebuild your marriage, the infidelity must stop. Let your spouse know that you expect them to end their affair immediately, if they haven’t already.It’s ideal for your spouse to cut all contact with their paramour. However, since they have a child together, keep in mind that this may not be possible.
Even if going no contact is not an option, your spouse and their former paramour should not be alone together.
Ask your spouse to put your mind at ease by involving you in the conversation whenever they have to talk to their child’s other parent.
Decide on times and methods of appropriate communication, such as before 9pm and on the house phone only.

, Identify the areas where your marriage needs improvement, and prioritize working on your problems. If you still feel conflicted or resentful towards your spouse, it will be difficult to bond with their child.Repairing your marriage will require your spouse’s full commitment, too.
Marital counseling may be necessary to heal the relationship.

, As you move forward, act as a team with your spouse. Talk to each other and reach an agreement before you make big decisions, especially ones that relate to your marriage and family.It is very important to work as a team after infidelity. It may be a good idea for you and your spouse to establish weekly check-ins in which you discuss the state of your marriage, any potential issues, and any parenting decisions.

, While it is important to work on rebuilding your relationship with your spouse, you will also need to be willing to reach out to other people for support. Talk with trustworthy friends, family, and/or a counselor about what you are going through."

Reach out to parents.,
Continue to learn.",How to Become an Advocate for Parents," In order to set yourself up as an advocate for parents, try to focus on a specific issue and work toward a specific focus.


Get credentials in a specific field. For example, those who want to advocate on medical issues for parents can benefit greatly from a bachelor of science degree in biology, a nursing degree or other medical qualifications.
Practice in a specific field. Again, getting practical experience around the issue will help you to become a more effective advocate.
Evaluate legal issues related to advocacy. Make sure that you are approaching your advocacy in ways that will not expose you to liability over time. For example, if you plan to warn parents about a certain product, have your facts right and look into what constitutes obstruction of business to protect yourself from challenges.;
, Another step in becoming an advocate for parents is to promote your individual research and findings, and to present yourself as an expert on an issue.


Use a blog to pursue advocacy. The blog is a very popular format for this kind of outreach. Media reports have suggested that parents read blogs more frequently, on average, than other demographics. This can be a good way to get visibility for your issues.

Evaluate TV and visual media opportunities. Television and related video media can get you access to a much greater audience and springboard your role as advocate.

, Build your audience by speaking directly to families about issues that may impact them.


Find audiences at public events. Use public community events to promote your position as an advocate, displaying your experience and credentials and speaking out on parental issues.

Disregard people who tell you single people shouldn’t foster children.",How to Become a Foster Parent when Single," Each state has different legal requirements regarding foster care. Generally, states do not prohibit single people from becoming a foster parent based solely on the person’s single status. It is important for a prospective foster parent to review the laws from his or her state to determine whether the prospective foster parent meets the basic legal requirements. The organization Adopt Us Kids provides state-specific foster care information on its website.Generally, states require that prospective foster parents meet the following qualifications:

Be over the age of 21.
Have a regular income that can meet the needs of the foster family.
Have no felony or misdemeanor convictions for child or elder abuse or sexual abuse.
Have a home with enough bedrooms to accommodate a foster child.
Undergo and pass a home assessment of all family members living in the potential foster home.
Go to all required foster parent training sessions.;
, Some states offer prospective foster parents the option to attend a free orientation about providing foster care. This orientation informs prospective foster parents of the obligations and benefits of becoming a foster parent and raises questions so that individuals can make a more informed choice about becoming a foster parent. The orientation provides information about the foster application process and may present an opportunity for a single person to raise any questions or concerns that he or she has about becoming a single foster parent.Generally, foster care orientation is available through a state or city’s Department of Social Services or other agency responsible for children’s welfare, or health and human services.You can contact your state or local agency that handles foster care and ask whether they offer orientation programs.

, While all prospective foster parents should evaluate their finances, this is especially true for a single person who wants to become a foster parent. While most states do not have minimum income requirements for becoming a foster parent, a person does need to show that his or her income would meet the needs of a foster family. This financial burden may be more difficult to meet as a single person.


The U.S. Department of Agriculture has estimated that single-parent households spend between $10,000 and $12,000 per year on childcare costs.
While a foster parent receives funds from the state to support the child, the foster parent may be responsible for costs beyond those covered such as extended day care costs or costs not covered by the public school system, such as summer camps., As a single parent, prospective foster parents must look closely at his or her job and benefits to make sure that it will support the prospective parent’s child-rearing responsibilities. When evaluating your employer and employment situation as it relates to becoming a foster parent, consider the following:


The length of your commute to work.
Whether your employer is family friendly.
The amount of sick time and vacation time that you are allotted.
The amount of travel that your job requires and whether you can bring your child with you.
Does your position allow flexibility in your schedule?, Some states may have legal requirements about the size of your home and specifically about the number of bedrooms. Generally, foster children can share a room with another child if the child is the same sex as the foster child and the children are below a certain age requirement. If you are single person, you may need to rent or buy a larger home in order to accommodate your foster child and meet the legal requirements of your state.


As an example, in California children of the same sex can share a room if they are under the age of five and a child under the age of two can stay in the same room as his or her foster parent if the child sleeps in a crib., One of the first steps in beginning the foster parent application process is to locate your local foster care agency. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provides contact information for local and state foster care agencies on its website. It also provides links to resources to assist those who are planning to become foster parents., Once you have made the decision to foster a child, you should contact your state foster care agency. The agency will be able to explain the requirements for applying to become a foster parent, as well as any resources available to help assist single people who want to become foster parents. Some states or counties subcontract with private agencies to assist in the foster care process. Your local agency can explain who will handle the foster care process and the role of private agencies in the process., Each agency will have its own foster parent application. The application is often very time consuming. It will require that you provide your personal and medical history, as well as private and professional references. You may also be required to indicate specifics about the child that you are willing to foster, including age, race, ethnicity, language, gender, and special needs.Generally, a foster care application may require you to provide the following information:


Those applying to become foster parents will have to provide personal identifying information, which may include: name, address, alias, race, ethnicity, gender, place of birth and date of birth, social security number, education history and employment status, religious affiliation and primary language, and marital status.
Applicants may also have to provide contact information for their employers.
A list of all household members, including name, relationship, age, birth date, and a driver’s license number with the name of the issuing state.
A request to identify the number of children for whom the applicant is willing to foster, as well as the age, and sex of prospective foster children.
A request to provide information about any other applications that the applicant made to the state regarding adoptions, familial care, guardianship or other childcare.
Information regarding the applicant’s experience providing care to children.
Personal references.
Sources of income.
Information regarding the applicant’s home, including the number of bedrooms and whether the home is rented or owned.
The applicant’s certification that he or she will submit to a background check, fingerprinting or other child abuse clearance., All U.S. States, Washington D.C., Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico have laws requiring a criminal background check for prospective foster parents and any adults residing in their households. Depending on where you are applying to become a foster parent, your background check may include: fingerprinting; state, local and/or federal criminal records search; child abuse and neglect records check; and/or sex offender registries. You may be precluded from becoming a foster parent if the background check shows that:


You or another adult living in the home has ever been convicted of felony child abuse or neglect, spousal abuse, a crime against children (including child pornography), or a crime involving violence, including rape, sexual assault, or homicide but not including other types of physical assault or battery.
In the previous five years, you or another adult living in the home has been convicted of a felony for physical assault, battery, or a drug-related offense.
You or another person in your home has been convicted of a crime that would raise a question as to your ability to provide a safe home for the foster child., Generally, you will be required to have a home study and assessment by a social worker. There may be as many as three visits during the application process, during which the social worker is evaluating whether your home is safe and suitable for a foster child, investigating whether you are psychologically and mentally healthy, and to complete any additional paperwork required for your application. It is important to demonstrate for the social worker that you have thought through how you will care for a child as a single parent, and give examples of backup care and support that you have. During a home visit, a social worker may ask about or be evaluating the following:


A social worker may ask you questions about your marital status, work life and other questions to determine whether you are able to provide a safe and stable home for a foster child.
Whether you and all of the members of your household are healthy, both physically and mentally.
Whether you are employed and whether you have plans for the child’s care and supervision while you are at work.
Your character (the social worker may ask to speak to personal and professional references).
The reasons that you want to become a foster parent and your understanding of the responsibilities and role of a foster parent.
Your commitment to working with the child, the child’s family, and the agency to find a permanent home for the child.
Your self-assessment of your ability to form a meaningful relationship with the foster child.
Your understanding that the placement is temporary and your ability to provide a stable, loving, and supportive home for the child., Depending on your state, you may be required to complete 15 to 30 hours of foster-parent training. The training is designed to prepare you to better meet the needs of your foster child. In order to become certified as a foster parent, you may need to complete the following types of training:


Training to help you address the social, family, and personal problems that lead to the need for foster care.
Problems you may face in dealing with a child who has been separated from his or her family.
The policies and procedures that you must follow as a foster care parent.
The authority of the local, state, and federal agencies that oversee child welfare.
Foster care payment procedures.
Some counties require a specific training program called Model the Approach to Partnerships in Parenting/Group Preparation and Selection (MAPP/GPS) Pre-Certification Training Program, which stresses open communication and trust among foster families, adoptive families, birth families and casework staff.
You may also be required to undergo special training to address the specific needs of children who have special medical and mental health needs., Once you have been deemed eligible to be a foster parent, you will be placed on a list of potential foster parents. This means that if a child needs a home, you may be contacted for a short-term or long-term placement. A placement can last anywhere from one night to several months., You should communicate openly with the social worker who calls you to ask whether you can accept a child into your home. It is very important that you ask a lot of questions about the child, his or her background, and the child’s special needs. You need to understand the extent of your obligations, such as transporting the child to meetings with his or her birth parents or medical appointments, and make sure that you are able and willing to care for the child., Once you are acting as a foster parent, you will typically receive reimbursement for the child’s food and a clothing voucher. While the amount you receive depends on the number of children you are fostering and a child’s specific needs, it may not cover all of the child’s activities and needs. You must use the funds as designated by the foster care agency and inform the agency of any changes. For example, if you are receiving money for diapers and the child becomes potty trained, you must inform the agency that you no longer require a diaper allotment., All parents need support and this is especially true of a single parent. It is imperative that you determine who of your family and friends can help you provide care for the child if you become sick, have work obligations, or just need a break. Before fostering a child, you should speak to your family and friends and ask them whether they would be willing to assist you and in what ways they can provide help.

, While the majority of the children in foster care return to their biological families, when the families are not able to care for the child, the foster care agency looks to make a permanent placement for the child through adoption. More than half of the children adopted through foster care are adopted by their foster parents. It is important that you think deeply about whether you would ever be willing to adopt a foster child and communicate these feelings to the social worker. There is nothing wrong with not wanting to become a permanent parent and its important that you communicate your feelings, whatever they may be, to the social worker so they can find the best placement for the foster child., When you tell people that you want to become a foster parent, some of those people may tell you that you should not become a foster parent as a single person. If you have evaluated your reasons for wanting to become a foster parent, accept that no parent is perfect, and set up support systems for you and the foster child, naysayers should not dissuade you. It is a tremendous amount of work to be a parent and more so to be a single parent but that does not mean you can’t do it.There a number of ways that you can deal with family and friends who are critical of your decision to become a single parent, such as:


If you have a family member who suggests that the child would be better off with two parents, you can reply: Regardless of whether would be better off with two parents, has one foster parent. Are you saying that it would be better for to remain in the system than to live in a loving home with me?
This reply may be a little more assertive than you feel comfortable with, however, it is sure to quickly quiet down detractors.
If someone suggests that you won’t be able to handle raising a child on your own, you could reply: I have family and friends who love me and have offered to support me in any way that I need. I intend to take them up on their offer.
If you have a family member that constantly critiques your decision and you know there is no getting them to change their mind, you can say: , I love you but if you are going to continually critique me for my decision to provide a loving home for a child in need then I am not going to be able to spend time with you."

;
, Then grab the bottom corner and bring it to the center, forming a triangle. Then, fold it again, turning over the folded corner. The paper should end up being folded into thirds, slightly resembling a cone shape.









If you found that confusing, fold one side over about 1/3 of the way and then fold the other side over to cover the first side. Any better?
When you're handling your soon-to-be snowflake, always keep the point down. This is the center of your snowflake.

, You are cutting through all the layers just where the top layer stops. It should be pretty clear to see. You're now ready to create your snowflake!









, You may want to begin with a very simple pattern and then move on to more complicated patterns. Or dive in. The smaller the cuts (and the more in number), the more detailed your snowflake will be.

For example, instead of wearing your floral shorts and your old, torn up ""The Monkees"" shirt, or trying to dress like a rapper with baggy shirts, falling off your butt jeans and a gangster hat, wear nice, darker dress shoes, darker, well fitting jeans and a plain white dress shirt if you're a father. If you're a mother, try cute flats or cute high heels (Just don't wear hooker boots), flattering jeans (Any color, and, if you can pull them off, skinny jeans) for your body, a nice, fun-but-stylish-and-mature shirt (Pick a color that compliments your hair color, eye color, skin color etc.), and maybe a cute necklace and/or a bracelet. Hair doesn't really matter, just have a clean but fun, stylish cut, with a nice colour (In other words, not a strange color. Either dye it an average color, or let it be natural) so that, all in all, you are stylish. Those outfits are cool and stylish. You can be stylish and mature at the same time. Don't wear high socks or short shorts. You don't want to embarrass your child when you drive him or her to school.;
, Understand what he or she is saying. Get to know the vocabulary, like the following - Like, hey, wassup, yo, dude and others. Your child does not want you to sound like a teen, but you must understand what is said when talking. You can use some of the language in moderation, but, you know, don't greet your kid's friends saying ""Yo, wassup, radical dude?!"" Because that isn't how anyone cool talks. That's just freaky. Also, remember that words/sayings come and go as being cool. Even if the saying ""He-ey"" was cool in the 70's, it really isn't now.

, Look up on the internet about new things. Learn about teens from the newspaper or on television.

, Develop trust and responsibility with your child. Talk without prying into everything. If he or she wants you to know something, your child will tell you. Do not talk about your child to other children unless you have their permission first.

, As you ride, try not to talk about their private life. Talk about school, new movies and new music.

, Buy them a small gift for being nice to their little sister. Buy the little sister a small gift when she is nice to her big sister.

, Provide a secure and stable home environment. Be a responsible adult role model as you support your child. Your child must know he or she is safe because you will always be there.

, Make sure everyone has equal access to the living spaces, but that each also has a purely private space. Treat them with the same degree of respect you would require if you were sharing a house with non-family members.

, A kid may seem like they want nothing to do with you when you drop them off in your '84 Cadillac with Oldies playing full blast, but at the end of the day, when something goes wrong, they come to you for help. You are their first love, and they will always return to you for your aid and advice if you let them know you have it and will provide it.

Get a sheet of 8.5 x 11 paper.,
Fold the paper in half, in a triangle shape.,
Start making cuts.,
Carefully unfold your snowflake.",How to Make a Paper Snowflake2," Create a perfect square by taking the bottom corner and folding it over to the top, at a diagonal. A 3"" (7.5 cm) or so piece will be sticking out. Cut off the excess so you're working with just the square.









At all steps in this method make sure your creases are firm and straight. If they're not clean and symmetrical, you may end up with a wonky snowflake.

, This is the same fold you made in the first step and is only mentioned in case you unfolded it to cut. Once it's folded once, fold it again, forming an even smaller triangle.









At this point, you may fold it again to create a different, much smaller, base for your snowflake. Experiment! However, for kids, folding it again renders it much more difficult to work with.

, This is where the snowflake gets really good. If you get creative with it, you'll end up with a pattern that's intricate, delicate, and detailed. Or you could end up with a couple of slits in a piece of paper. Cut in curves, angles, and swirls to get the most out of the paper.









You may find it useful to hold on to the center of the snowflake -- the very tip. Though you can cut it off and the snowflake will hold together! The more paper you cut off, the flimsier it will be -- not necessarily a bad thing.

, If you've made a lot of cuts, the snowflake may rip, so be careful. And if your cuts were very small, sometimes the layers of paper stick together (think election day 2000).









If you're not happy with your pattern, fold it back up and take a few more whacks at the paper. Problem solved.

Show your love.,
Accept your child as an individual.,
Play with your child.,
Communicate well.,
Remember you are a role model.",How to Be a Great Parent to a Toddler1," You simply cannot be too loving toward your child. Children aren't ""spoiled"" by an overabundance of affection. ""Spoiling"" is the result of substituting things for affection. Toddlers, in particular, need time when they can just ""be,"" snuggling on your lap or enjoying a long hug., Your toddler is starting to develop his or her own personality. Some of these behaviors are learned, while others are genetic. You will find that he or she is becoming an individual, with a unique combination of traits shared with you and traits that may be distinctly different.


Find ways of nurturing your child's growing personality through positive reinforcement. A strong-willed toddler, for example, has the gift of perseverance. Encourage this strong will in a positive direction -- by providing a challenging toy, for example., Set aside a special time each day to play with your toddler. Play provides you with an opportunity to encourage your child's good behavior and build a positive relationship.


Prioritize creative activities. Encourage your child's growing imagination with dress-up play, kitchen fun, or arts and crafts (the more open-ended, the better), or invent your own worlds.
Provide age-appropriate toys to keep playtime safe and fun.Show enthusiasm for your child's interests. Toddlers often develop obsessions as they seek to understand the big, complicated world around them. Obsessing over fire trucks, car washes, fancy rocks, or sliding doors helps them focus in and understand one slice of their world. You may find your toddler's obsessive focus upon every piece of construction equipment you pass tedious, but feigning interest will help her learn her interests have worth., Pay attention to your child when he or she is speaking to you. While you may set ground rules about when and how your toddler should interrupt your conversations with other people, be sure you do follow through and give them your full attention in turn.


Bear in mind that ""interpreter"" is part of a toddler parent's job description. Your child's language skills are growing by leaps and bounds, but as you're well aware, they are still a work in progress. Exercise patience in discerning what your toddler is telling you. Keep phrases short, repeat yourself, and be aware of the context your toddler is communicating to you through gestures and tone of voice.Set aside time each day to talk with your child. You'll develop his communication skills and your relationship as you practice speaking with each other.
Praise your child. Positive reinforcement is key to encouraging good behavior and develops your toddler's sense of self-worth., Your child looks to you for guidance. Ensure you're teaching good skills by taking care of your own body and treating others well. Toddlers will parrot your actions; think twice before behaving or speaking in a way you wouldn't like to see mirrored by your 2-year-old.

Always keep your promises.,
Laugh a lot.,
Ask them, ""Did you have a nice day today?"",
Offer help with homework each day or evening or if you have an older teen who is has there own family, help them out with baby sitting and chores.,
Establish a tradition with your teen daughter.,
Find the time to go with your teen daughter to the ""big"" mall.,
Listen carefully to your child and try to understand why he or she is moody on any particular day.,
Share your good and bad moments of the day with your teen when appropriate.,
Work hard to build their confidence.,
Do not forget to say ""I love you"" to your teen on a regular basis.

",How to Be Close with Your Teen Child," When you promise something, for example, to buy them something, or to take them some place make sure you always keep your word.


Never make empty promises. If you say you are going to do something, do it. If you have a genuine reason breaking a promise, be sure to explain it to your teen-aged child.

They will copy your behavior and will do the same when they become an adult.
If you lie, even once, your child will find it very hard to trust you.

;
, Shared laughter and happiness helps to bond people. Try to have a good sense of humor, and exercise it!


If you did or said something funny, share it and laugh together.
Teens can be appreciative of their parents' good sense of humor. They will call you ""cool"" and ""funny.""

, when they come from school.


By asking this question:

You let them know you care.
You may find out what is wrong. For example, that your child was bullied. Be very concerned if your 18 year old is still having trouble with bullies.



, Make sure your child knows that there is an open invitation on the homework front, chores, baby sitting etc.


Encourage them to ask questions, and ask you for help.

, Example: bake her favorite cookies every now and then. This serves two purposes:


Girls get experience baking, not crucial but fun.
Girls often open up, naturally, during one-on-one interaction with a parent without getting distracted.

, Develop a nice open conversation with your child in a car no matter whether your teen drives a car or not.


This activity stimulates an open conversation in confidence. It is considered a fact by some that you get the most information about your child's life talking in a car without being interrupted by other family members or activities.
Eat lunch together when in the mall.
Buy clothes, shoes, accessories etc together so you both go home in a good mood.

,


Say, ""If you want to talk I am here for you.""
It's important to set aside everything you do, to completely clear your plate and empty your mind, then sit down with them and listen carefully to what they have to say. Otherwise, you may miss something important going on in their life.
If you are extremely busy -cooking, for example, at the moment when they need to talk say this, ""Please give me ten minutes and you will get my undivided attention.""

,


When they listen and sympathize, it brings you two closer emotionally.

, They need positive reinforcement. No matter how they've accomplished something tell them, ""You did a good job."" If they needed your help, let them know you are always there for them and truly enjoy help. Tell them you are proud of them often.

Give structure to your child's world.,
Practice independence skills.,
Encourage relationships with other loving adults.,
Focus on achieving interdependence.",How to Be a Great Parent to a Toddler2," Ritual and predictability help toddlers feel safe as their sense of their world expands. You may need to recite the day's events to your child each morning. Establishing mealtime and bedtime routines will provide important benchmarks for your child's day. A sense of security in everyday life will give your child a strong foundation for developing his own sense of independence.


Needing a special blanket or stuffed animal at nap and bedtime isn't just fussiness -- these tools provide an important sense of security. Respect your child's need for this structure., Toddlers sometimes experience separation anxiety. Even a child who was happy to be held by others as a baby may become clingy during her toddler years. Encourage your child's independence using incremental steps:


Keep your toddler posted. If you're heading into the next room, tell her. If Daddy is going to work, Daddy should be sure to say good-bye and mention where he's going.
Substitute voice contact. When a little voice starts demanding your attention through the shower door, respond -- but keep showering.
Provide ""long-distance"" help. If your child is struggling with a toy, for example, provide verbal encouragement from across the room, but don't immediately intervene. Give her the opportunity to solve her problem on her own., Grandparents, aunts, uncles, and family friends may all provide wonderful influences and help your child grow in independence. Invite others into your child's life so he learns that other people provide help and care, too. A child who understands ""safe"" relationships will feel loved and secure, and will be able to discern when a person or situation feels ""unsafe."", A baby is, of course, dependent. A toddler who demands to do something ""by my-SELF!"" is asserting independence. Aim to help your child gain a third step toward maturity: interdependence. An interdependent child has the drive to accomplish tasks by herself, but the wisdom to ask for help to do it better. Interdependence means you and your child rely upon each other to bring out the best in each other. After all, you won't be able to parent your child well if he isn't capable of challenging you to help him as he grows.


Monitor your child's play. Give him the opportunity to play alone, but be willing to join in when he asks.
Remain alert for signs your child is trying to make space between you. This is a normal and healthy part of child development as her imagination grows and develops."
"
Establish consistent rules and expectations.,
Explain your rules and decisions.,
Cope well with tantrums.,
Bring other caregivers on board.,
Treat your child with respect.",How to Be a Great Parent to a Toddler3," Again, toddlers thrive on predictability. Respond to your child's behavior in the same way every time. Family rules should focus upon clearly defined behaviors that are never okay.Minimize your list of rules. Prioritize safety, then focus on modifying a few behaviors at a time rather than overwhelming your child with too much detail. You may reward your child for good behavior, but emphasize social rewards such as affection, praise, and activities., Even toddlers need to understand why you want them to follow the rules.Explain, for example, that we don't run in the house because the hardwood floors are really slick.
If you institute a practice like touching Mom's knee and then waiting to talk when she's in a conversation, explain that it's important to give people your full attention. Mom's friend deserves her full attention when she's speaking; once she's finished, she'll turn to you and give you her full attention, too.

, Toddlers are easily overwhelmed, and as they lack the coping skills of older children or adults, their feelings tend to erupt into the outbursts we call ""tantrums."" Minimize the impact of tantrums by following a few wise practices:


Know your child's limits. Your child might not understand what you're asking her to do. Alternatively, if she is already tired, hungry, or otherwise stressed, her capacity to understand may be compromised.
Give your child guidance in how to follow the rules. Offer suggestions -- rather than simply telling him to ""stop hitting,"" suggest that he takes turns.
Respond to ""no"" calmly by simply repeating your request.
Pick your battles.
When possible, offer choices. Limit choices to two or three options to avoid overwhelming your toddler.
Avoid situations that could trigger outbursts. A toy that's too difficult is sure to cause frustration, and long outings can exhaust your child. Remember that your child is more likely to throw a tantrum when she's hungry, tired, sick, or in an unfamiliar situation.
Keep to your daily routine.
Encourage your child to use his words to express his feelings., Keep your child's world calm and predictable by working with caregivers and relatives to ensure you're all following the same rules and expectations. Sometimes grandparents and other relatives will seek to follow the practices they used when raising children and resist your requests. If all else fails, blame the pediatrician -- ""I'm sorry, but our doctor has told us Robert shouldn't have juice."", Treat your child how you'd like her to treat others. Speak politely, respect her opinion, pay attention when she's speaking, and treat her kindly. She'll mirror this behavior."

Assemble your materials.,
Cut two identical tree shapes out of construction paper.,
Cut slits in the tree shapes for joining them together.,
Join the two shapes and form the tree.,
Have fun decorating your tree!",How to Make a Paper Christmas Tree1," You can keep your tree simple, or get as elaborate as you like by decorating it with paint, glitter, stickers, paper cutouts, or anything else you can think of. This is a great project to do with a group. Supply the construction paper and a variety of decorative materials, and let everyone’s imagination run wild! Green construction paper (or any color you like).
Scissors.
A marker.
Clear tape.
Decorations for your tree; popular choices include glitter, stickers, ribbon, colored paper, confetti, etc.
Craft glue or glue dots to affix the decorations.
A hot glue gun and glue stick to affix the topper (optional).;
, Begin by stacking two pieces of construction paper together and folding them in half. Then use a marker to draw a half-tree shape on the outside of your paper stack. Finally, cut along the lines through both sheets of paper. You will now have two identical tree shapes.









You can make a large tree by using two full-size sheets of construction paper, or you can cut one piece of paper in half.

, First, find and mark the vertical center of each tree by folding it in half vertically (fold the pointed tip of the tree down to the base of the tree,) then lightly crease or mark the center. Finally, cut a slit in one tree from the top down to the center mark, and cut a slit in the other tree from the bottom up to the center.








, Slide the two pieces together along the slits so that the middles match. Then use a few small piece of clear tape at the top and bottom of the tree to hold it all together. Finally, fold the tree open so that it stands on its own.








, The sky is the limit with this step; be as creative as you like. You can use paint or glitter glue to add sparkle, or even “flock” you tree. Cut ornaments out of colored paper using scissors or a hole punch, and glue them to the tree. Create a garland out of metallic thread or ribbon, and don’t forget a tiny star or angel on top.


You can use the same 3d cutting/splicing method you used to create the tree to make a 3D star or angel for the top.
Hot glue works best for attaching things to the point of the tree.

"
Know what you want.,
Prioritise family time.,
Allow an hour for home management each evening.,
Ask for support.,
Be open with your children.",How to Be an Excellent Single Parenting All Rounder," The first step towards getting what you want, is knowing what you want. When you can get clear in your head about what’s going to work for you and believe it genuinely, then that sincerity will come across in your negotiations and you’re going to get the best results. Get clear about the benefits of why you want a great work-life balance and get clear of the benefits for the other people who will influence the outcome.;
, It’s easy to let minutes turn into hours and hours turn into chunks of time that keep you away from home until way passed the children’s bed times. It’s a slippery slope. Practice raising your productivity during the day – don’t stop to chat, don’t ‘Facebook’ or ‘YouTube’, don’t mess around with your personal emails. Work at work. Leave on time. Get home promptly. Children thrive on routine and will thank you (when they’re 50!) for being there for them on a regular basis. Remember, work-life balance includes a bit of everything; earning, playing, bonding, studying, health, fitness, dreaming, growing … and sleeping!

, When your children have gone to bed, check that the laundry’s up-to-date, there’s food prepared for the next day, the kitchen’s cleaned up, the bathroom’s tidy and any school correspondence, play dates or diary-planning is done. Now this may not take an hour every day, but allow that time to make sure that you're on top of your home life.

, If you’re working part time or full time, managing a home and caring for and encouraging your children single-handedly, you deserve a sainthood! Remember that to balance these things well over time is an art. It takes a clear head, it takes good health and it takes lots of energy and drive. Ask for help when you need it – if it’s a babysitter so you can have a night out, a friend to come over and cook one night a week, a family member to drive one of the kids to karate, or a colleague to take on some extra projects at work to keep you from tipping into overwhelm – whatever it is, ask, ask, ask! Asking for support is not a failing, it’s the practical application of wisdom. Your children rely on you to be at your best. True saints practice humility!

, It takes a lot to learn the balance of sharing with and shielding from our children. Age-appropriate conversations, when you need to have them can be a life saver. ‘If you’re scared in the middle of the night then call. If you just want someone to be here to lie with you, don’t call. When you have 2 more sleeps in the daytime, mummy is working very hard to get everything done so that I can get home for us to have fun before bath time, story time and bedtime.’ Tell your children about the consequences of you not going to work. Talk through that the knock-on effects of this would be no money coming into your household, the possibility of changing homes, how you eat and what you wear, stopping holidays, and maybe even changing some of your friendships. These conversations aren’t about laying huge burdens on our children. They are about asking them gradually and bit-by-bit to share a greater amount of responsibility for contributing to the smooth running of the household. Review the distribution of responsibility regularly as your children get older. This is not just about your work-life balance. It’s about your children’s too. And they’ll thank you for it in the end!

Accept your spouse and children the way they are.,
Remember to take care of yourself.,
Treat your family with kindness and respect, even when things become difficult.,
Build a relationship with your step kids.,
Allow the step kids alone time with your spouse.,
Be a good example.",How to Be a Stepmother," Decide to be okay with your stepdaughter listening to strange music or your stepson earning below-average grades at school. You cannot transform the people you live with, and in order to build a solid relationship, you must be okay with the core parts of their identity.


There is nothing wrong with helping your children (e.g. helping your son study for his quiz), but there is something wrong with trying to change who they are (e.g. trying to turn your son into a high achiever, when he simply isn't smart enough).
Accept yourself and embrace the new change coming your way. Remember that acceptance is not learned overnight, and allow yourself to adjust to the new role. Work on it on a daily basis.;
, Transition times can feel stressful—new living arrangement, childcare duties, spouse, extended family, work or chores—and it can wear you thin. Set aside time to enjoy your hobbies, get outdoors, and talk one on one with your spouse when the kids are asleep.

, Control your tongue, and leave the room if you are overwhelmed or angry. Sometimes it will be difficult to handle the change, but losing your cool will only make you do things that you regret.


It's natural to feel frustrated sometimes at the first wife, but remember that your stepchildren probably still care about her. Badmouthing her will only make them trust you less.
If you upset somebody or lose control of your temper, apologize sincerely.
Talk privately with your spouse if you need to vent or discuss a problem.

, Spoiling them is not necessary—your time and love are what they want most. Laugh with them, be there for them when they are emotionally hurt, play together, and when they want to talk. There are many valuable ways to strengthen the ties within your step family. In time, your foundation will get stronger and you'll all benefit from it.


Remember that it takes time to build a relationship. If your stepchildren are initially shy, don't worry. They will warm up to you.

, Let them talk privately, read books on their own, or do the things they used to before you entered the picture. They need time to maintain that relationship too.


A family change can be confusing for children. They may need extra time with your spouse so they can adjust and work through their feelings.
Sometimes your children may invite you to join them. If they do, you'll know that you're doing something right.

, Most children learn by example and you'll find them mimic your values and actions as you spend more and more time with them. Be a better person not only for them, but for yourself.

Assemble your materials.,
Cut out the cone shapes.,
Form the cones.,
Decorate the cones!,
Place your paper Christmas trees around your home, and get ready for the compliments to come pouring in!",How to Make a Paper Christmas Tree2," This tree begins as a simple paper cone that can be decorated as simply and elegantly, or as elaborately as you like. These trees can be made any size, and you can use any decorative paper that you have on hand, or decorate plain paper before beginning.


Decorative paper. Use green construction paper for a traditional look, or use a patterned craft paper or gift wrap to create beautiful, modern trees. Avoid using very lightweight paper.
A dinner plate, bowl or other large round object that can be used to create a circle template.
Craft glue, glue dots, or a hot glue gun and glue stick.
Scissors.
Decorations for your trees.

, Begin by tracing your plate, bowl or other circular object onto your desired piece of paper, then cut out the circle. Then fold the circle into quarters by first folding it in half and creasing it, then folding it half and creasing it, again. Now open up the circle and cut it into quarters along the crease lines. Each circle of paper will create four cones.









Use different sizes of plates/templates to create different cones of different heights and sizes.
You can create a larger circle template by using piece of string that is half the size you want your circle to be. Tie a pencil to one end of the string, and hold the other end fast in the center using tape, a pin, or a helper. Then pull the string taut, and swing the pencil around to draw a perfect circle., Hold one of the quarter-circle pieces with the point at the top, and wrap it around to form a cone. Then use the adhesive of your choice to secure the seam.









Be sure to hold the cone in place long enough for the glue to dry.
You can also use tape, or even staples for this step, it just won’t look quite as neat.

, Decorate the paper surface with markers, paints, glitter glue, or rubber stamps. Then use glue dots or craft glue to affix various ornaments and other decorations to the tree.


These paper-cone Christmas trees look especially nice with the addition of a textured or 3D component, so try using buttons, sequins, beads, or craft gems to decorate your trees.
You can also create a star to top the tree using metallic chenille stems (pipe cleaners), or by making a bow out of shiny ribbon. Hot glue works best to affix items to the point of the tree.

, Arrange a row of trees along a mantle, or use a cluster of varying-sized trees to make a beautiful and festive centerpiece.

Use pallet trees as the background to performances.",How to Make a Pallet Christmas Tree," You'll be cutting your pallet in the shape of a tree, so you may want to work outside where wood shavings will be less of an issue. You could also lay down a tarp to catch shavings for an easier clean up. You'll also need:


A flat, sturdy work surface, like a work bench. If you don't have a suitable work surface, you can make one by laying a flat board between two saw horses on level ground.
A clear, an unobstructed work area. You don't want to trip when operating your saw. Move all unused tools, equipment, and wires out of your work area.;
, You'll be using tape to guide your cutting of the pallet. Face the pallet so its top boards are oriented crosswise. The closest board will make up the bottom of your tree, and the farthest one the top. Mark your tape lines:








At the left and right sides of the bottom of the tree, on the inside of both lengthwise oriented 2x4 boards.
At the top of the tree, ½"" (1.27 cm) to the left and right of the middle, lengthwise oriented 2x4 board., Run two lines of tape, one line for each set of marks. One should run between the top and bottom marks to the left of the middle, lengthwise 2x4, and the other piece of tape between the top and bottom marks on the right. After taping:


Take your tape measure and check the distance on both sides between the outer edge of the tape and the outer edge of the pallet.
The distance between the tape edge and outside pallet edge should be the same on both sides., The cutting process will create sawdust, which can become airborne and irritate your lungs and eyes. For this reason, you should wear protective eye wear, like safety glasses, and a dust mask.Wood can also cause skin irritation from its roughness, or it can give you splinters. Wear gloves when working to protect your hands.

, Because pallets are most often held together by screws or nails, you'll likely want to use an automated saw that can cut through these, like a reciprocating saw. When cutting, do so on the inside of your tape line.








Hold your saw as level as possible while operating it, and use firm, steady pressure to push your saw through the wood as it cuts.The resistance to your saw will be greater when cutting through a board and less when moving through the gaps between them.
At this point in the project, you'll only be cutting the top, crosswise boards of your pallet.

, Now that the top of your pallet is cut, it's time to cut the opposite side. Pick up your pallet and flip it so the cut side is oriented downward. Cut the back boards away by sawing them on both sides of the middle, lengthwise 2x4.









Some pallets may only have one set of crosswise running boards. In this case, you won't have remove the reverse set of crosswise boards.
Be careful when flipping your pallet. During the cutting process, you may have created splinters or jarred pieces of wood loose.
Once you've cut along the left side of the middle, lengthwise 2x4, it should pull free easily with your hands or pry bar. Do the same for the right side as well., In many cases, a quick hand sanding with a medium grit sandpaper, rated between 60 and 100, should take the roughness off your cut wood.Focus on edges, burrs, and patches that appear splintery. Sand until the wood is smooth and even.


You can speed the sanding process along by using an automated handheld sander, like an orbital sander.
With automated sanders, pay close attention to screws and nails. These can tear the sandpaper, and can even do damage to your sander if you're not careful.
When finished sanding, wipe away wood shavings with a clean, damp cloth, and enjoy your new pallet Christmas tree.

, After your tree is sanded, you can stain and seal the wood, or you can paint it. Before painting, wipe the wood clean with a water dampened rag, allow the dampness to dry, then:


Open a can of suitable wood primer. Mix it according to its directions. Then use long, smooth strokes with a clean paintbrush to apply several layers to the front of the tree from the top to its bottom.Allow the primer to dry. Then open a can of suitable wood paint and mix it with a paint stirrer.
Dip a clean paintbrush into the paint, wipe excess paint on the inside lip of the can, and paint the front of your tree top down with long, even strokes., After your paint is dry, if you want your pallet tree to have a more festive appearance, use decorations, like ornaments, ribbons, glitter, tinsel, and more. These can be attached to your tree with a suitable glue or tape.


You can create the effect of snow on the branches of your pallet tree by dipping a sponge into a little bit of white paint and lightly stippling them.
If you want to draw a design on your tree but lack the artistic skill to freehand it, you can always make a stencil and use that to apply the design., For many Christmas celebrating cultures, a Christmas tree is not complete without a strand of lights circling around it. Take a string of lights and wrap it around the branches of your tree until it is completely strung.


If your lights don't hang easily on your tree, you may have to attach them in place. U-shaped tacks or sturdy tape, like duct tape, are useful for holding lights in place.
To give your tree the most polished and authentic look, you may want to hide the front and back end of your string of lights behind the tree., You should have two leftover 2x4 boards that you removed from the pallet when cutting the shape of your tree.Take these and use your hammer or pry bar to remove nails and any attached pieces of wood, then:


Measure and mark one long edge of each 2x4 board at its halfway point.
An inch (2.54 cm) to either side of your halfway marks, measure and mark a line that extends from long edge to long edge.
Lay each board so they are standing upright on their long edge, with your halfway mark oriented upwards.
Measure and mark the halfway point between the opposing long edges of the 2x4s. This mark will be at the midpoint of the short edge of the 2x4.

, Use your saw to cut the 2x4s at the lines extending between the long sides of the 2x4. The deepness of your notch should not surpass the halfway point you marked between the opposing long edges of each 2x4. Cutting deeper could result in a weak joint between the boards of your stand.


Assemble your stand by fitting the notches together to form an X-shape. You may want to use some wood glue or a fastener, like a screw, to provide additional support where the 2x4s cross., When you lack room to display your cards, you can use push pins or tacks to attach these to your pallet tree to show others.If you want to protect your cards and photos from damage, you might want to use a gentle adhesive tape, instead., A single Christmas tree adds a magical touch to the home in the holiday season. However, by adding a few pallet trees to the room your Christmas tree is in, you can create a magical, winter forest effect in your home.


To give your pallet trees a little more realism, you might want to drape them with similar accents to your living tree., Some festive decorations, like a full sized Christmas tree or wreath, might take up too much space in the smaller rooms of your home. Instead of relying on store bought fake trees, you could use a homemade pallet tree to add holiday cheer to these rooms.


You may be hesitant to use decorations outside your home out of fear they'll be damaged by the weather. Pallet trees are durable and inexpensive to replace, making them excellent outdoor decorations.

, The holiday season is a popular time for children and adults alike to put on live performances, sing in cantatas, and so on. Your pallet trees could be the perfect way of creating a woodland or holiday scene on stage.

If needed, touch the brush to a bit of water, not much to help it to spread with greater ease.
Don’t worry if you get the Mod Podge on other surfaces. Just wipe it off.

, This product dries quickly, so you need to move quickly. Leave a 1/8″ metal boarder showing,  Don’t go too “nuts” with this; just get it as close as you can.

, When you’re done,  allow the Mod Podge to dry for about 20 minutes.

, If it's to be used outdoors, use the outdoor version.

, You will need from 24″ to 36″ of ribbon depending upon the size of your star. You can just use ribbon you have on hand. 


You can purchase some fancy Christmas Ribbon if you want. 
If your star is the largest one, use a wide ribbon, at least 1 1/2″ wide.

Be sure to wear a mask if you're not painting outdoors, to prevent inhalation of paint fumes.

, Before the paint has dried on the pinecone, sprinkle it with the white glitter. The newspaper will catch any excess glitter. You can add a lot of glitter to simulate snow on the pinecone, or a little, depending on what looks best.

, Use the colored beads to simulate Christmas lights on the pinecone tree. You can either wedge the beads in between the petals of the pinecone, or you can glue them (safer).


If you're gluing, you may have to hold the bead in place for a minute or so, until the glue dries enough to stop the bead from slipping off.

Know that Atheists are people just like Christians.,
Continue to attend Church regularly on your own.,
Plan how you will raise your children in advance with your spouse.,
Plan in advance what kind of wedding you intend to have with your spouse-to-be.,
Avoid the subject of religion or politics with your spouse unless you can engage in the discussion peacefully.,
Avoid statements that imply or outright state that you think they're wrong or that you pity them.,
Don't try to force your spouse into your religion.,
Open the door for discussion, and use it peacefully.,
Agree to disagree.",How to Be a Christian When Your Spouse Is an Atheist," Some are nice, some are not. Some are happy and successful, some are not. Never assume anything about a person because of their religion, spirituality, or lack thereof.;
, Do not force your spouse to attend with you, if he/she does not wish to. That is disrespectful to their views, and may cause your spouse to harbor resentment.

, If you wish to raise them as Christians, make that clear with your spouse. In fact, this should be done with any interfaith couples, be they Christian/Atheist, Christian/Jewish, Muslim/Jewish, Muslim/Atheist, Christian/Confucianist, and so on.

, Plan whether you will have a church wedding or a wedding performed by a Justice of the Peace.

, Religion is a sensitive subject for many, so if things take a turn toward hostility, it's best to leave it alone. However, peaceful and insightful discussions can be intellectually satisfying, so if both of you are able to handle it, go for it.

, It's very hurtful to be told that what you truly feel is wrong or something to be looked down upon -- by your own spouse nonetheless. If you do feel that way, try to overcome them, or at least keep them to yourself.

, This will cause marital problems and will not help. Besides, their ""faith"" would probably come from superficial reasons instead of true belief in God. By that same token, nor should your spouse try to force you into his/her Atheism, nor mock your beliefs. That too, will cause marital problems, as your faith is really sacred to you.

, Explain that they can come to you if they have a problem, or if they feel that you aren't respecting them, and that you can discuss it together without anger on your part. Then, ask that they do the same for you if you feel that they aren't respecting you.

, Sometimes, you just won't be able to see things their way, and the same goes for them. If your spouse and you are constantly butting heads on the issue of religion, it may be best to learn how to walk away and accept that your views are different.

Learn how to communicate.,
Be willing to compromise.,
Take time apart when necessary.,
Help out around the house.,
Respect her standards for cleanliness.,
Pick up after yourself.,
Keep some mystery intact.,
Get daily physical contact.,
Laugh together.,
Surprise her.",How to Be a Better Husband," Open and honest communication is the most important aspect of a healthy relationship, and is the key to building trust. Without proper communication, simple misunderstandings can turn into full-fledged fights. Keep your relationship strong and avoid excessive arguing by simply expressing yourself on a regular basis.


Discuss issues as they come up rather than bottling them up and growing resentful over time.
Learn how to be diplomatic during arguments. Try not to get overly defensive if your wife is being critical of you. Similarly, try not to sound accusatory or angry when bringing up issues with her.
Listen to her. Being a good communicator isn’t just about knowing how to talk. It’s important to give your wife your undivided attention when she is speaking. Look her in the eyes, ask her questions, and don’t look at your telephone or computer screen if she’s speaking about something important.
If you are in a bad mood for any reason, then tell her explicitly rather than ignoring her or being short with her. This way, she can give you the space you need without taking your attitude personally.

, A healthy relationship is a two-way street. Over the course of your marriage, you will inevitably have to give up certain things to make her happy, and vice versa. If one of you is constantly giving in to the other’s demands without any reciprocation, there will likely be some resentment down the road.

, In any long-term relationship, it’s natural for one or both parties to need some alone time to unwind and focus on themselves. There’s nothing wrong with needing time away, but it’s important to be vocal about it and assure her that she shouldn't take it personally.


Designate one ""free"" day out of the week or month during which you can do your own thing, and let her do the same. If you have children, take turns watching them while the other one is out.
Never lie to your wife to avoid having to spend time with her. If she really loves you, she will understand if you need to be alone or spend a night out with the guys.

, Studies have shown that the average woman spends 10 more hours each week doing housework than her husband does!Excessive housework and other stress-inducing activities can attribute to decreased sexual desire in both men and women. Help balance out the workload by doing dishes, vacuuming, cleaning the bathrooms, doing yard work, handling repairs, and so on.


The key is to help out around the house even when you have not explicitly been asked to do so. Remember that it is as much your obligation as it is your wife’s to keep the house clean and in shape.
If you have children, help your wife by offering to pick the kids up from school, watch them when she is busy, etc.

, Some people are more comfortable living in a messy environment than others. To insure that you both feel comfortable in your own home, make sure that your house meets the standards of whoever is most nit-picky about cleanliness.


Just because you’re okay with extra dishes sitting in the sink overnight, your wife may not be, and you should respect that. If your wife is the messy one, then gently remind her every once in a while to clean up her surroundings.

, Even your schedule doesn’t leave extra time to do chores around the house, there’s no excuse to not clean up your own messes. The least you can do is wash your own dishes, put your clothes away, and take care of your own laundry.


If you are too busy during the week, then devote an hour or two each weekend to cooking, cleaning, and/or doing yard work.

, Living with another person means letting down your guard and seeing each other’s less attractive sides. While this level of comfort is a true sign of intimacy, it can also damage the level of sexual attraction you feel for each other in the long run.


Maintain your personal hygiene, be respectful when it comes to bathroom etiquette, and make an effort to stay in shape.

, Getting regular skin-on-skin contact releases a chemical called oxytocin, which reduces stress and increases feelings of intimacy in the long-run.Physical contact doesn’t necessarily mean sex. Kiss her goodbye every time you part ways, hug her when you see each other again, and cozy up in front of a good movie.

, Every marriage has its ups and downs, and the only way to make it through difficult times is to maintain a sense of humor and be silly every once in a while. You don’t have to be a stand-up comedian, but you should make an effort to put a smile on her (and your) face every day.


Get tickets to a live comedy show, host game nights with friends, or play sports together; anything to get the laughter going!
Getting regular laughter will not only improve your marriage, it can actually improve your health by lowering your blood pressure, increasing oxygen flow to the brain, and reducing stress levels., Just because you’ve put a ring in her finger, doesn’t mean you should stop trying to win her affection. Every once in a while, make the same sweet romantic gestures that you did in the beginning of the relationship. Bring her flowers, get tickets to her favorite show, or plan a surprise romantic evening.

Respect.",How to Be a Better Spouse," In essence, time is love where relationships are concerned. You can tell a lot about how a person lives their life, and what is important to them, by how they spend their time and money. Period. You must weigh what is important and spend your time there. Is your job or hobby more important than your relationship? How do you spend your time? How does your spouse spend their time? Being that this article is longer than most on wikiHow, actually taking time to read it might be a good start.;
, It is critical that you evaluate yourself, your spouse, and the relationship as a whole to determine where you need to work harder. For example, is your spouse always doing the dishes? Did the same person that cooked the meal clean up? In this example it might be time to step up and help shoulder some of the chores. You'll find that by better defining your relationship changing your thinking and behavior becomes almost automatic. Sometimes just knowing there is a problem is more difficult than fixing it.

, Change is never easy. Change is difficult, and in some cases can be violent and painful. For example, a junkie who is sticking a needle in their arm knows they need to change, but they cannot cope with the prospect of the withdrawal symptoms. People rarely refuse to change because they don't know how, they refuse to change because it will be unpleasant or awkward. If you don't control your life by making changes now, the changes will be thrust upon you later in an uncontrolled way. Anything unpleasant is better than something unpredictable. If faced with two evils, choose the one you know. Commit to make changes even if it hurts, because you might not get another chance to control the change itself.

, For example, your spouse might have personality issues that make them unable to take risks, or unwilling to socialize. It is important to pick an activity, invite your spouse, and engage the activity even if your spouse backs out. Pick something that you think is exciting but were never willing to do. You don't have to be extreme. For example, if you've always been unwilling to take risks that might result in injury you could rent some ATVs (4 wheelers), put on all the safety gear, and carefully put around. You don't have to be a speed demon. Just get you and your spouse outside of the every day ""bubble"". Through experimenting you'll eventually find something you both find challenging, exciting, and rewarding.

, You wouldn't drive your car endlessly without checking out important things like fluids. Once in a while ""check the oil"" on your relationship. Together with your spouse agree to see marriage counseling or spiritual counseling even if you both think nothing is wrong. Often times both members of a relationship will be participating in an undesirable behavior without really being aware. Sometimes bad communication or other lacking relationship skills are just dismissed. For example, John never talks to his wife about anything. A mutual friend points out that John has a communication problem and his wife Jane just shrugs and says ""He's always been like that, it is just how he is. I've learned to live with it"". Remember that acceptance of bad behavior doesn't exempt your or the relationship from the negative effects it can have.

, From time to time call your spouse by name, not ""babe"", or ""honey"". While pet names can be positive if used sparingly, if every time you open your mouth to speak with your spouse a whiny ""Baaaaabe?"" comes out first, you will eventually have a problem. Your spouse may secretly start to doubt that you can identify differences between them and every other relationship you've had. This is a bad thing.

, No one likes a lazy butt, so make sure you pull your weight. Even if you worked all day you should still offer to cook, clean, or whatever task is at hand. Don't assume that because you worked hard all day that it is fair for you to expect your spouse to automatically assume a task. Everyone likes a break. Go to bed early, and get up early. Be disciplined in your life, personal grooming, and cleanliness. Keep your self respect up and your spouse will also find you easy to respect.

, If you are incapable of implementing rules and enforcing them, then don't have kids or pets that require discipline. You'll end up with an impossible child or pet that consistently annoys or frustrates others (including your spouse), and will often times cause the ""good cop / bad cop"" mentality within the family. For example, if you always waffle on rules regarding snacks with your kid, then they get a stern talking to from your spouse, you've forced your spouse to pick an undesirable position within the authority structure. Remember if your kids and animals can't or don't respect you, how can your spouse keep respect for you. Spare the rod...spoil the child. Additionally spoiling a child is a good way to raise a thug or at least end up with an adult that is impossible for others to deal with. You condemn the child to a lifetime of frustration and isolation because their behavior is undesirable for others to be around. Seriously, handle it. If you are unable or unwilling to enforce rules, then why create them to begin with?

, No one wants to marry someone with whom part of their decision was based around attraction, only to wake up six years later to a total jelly butt. Stay in shape and eat well. This will also help you with sexual stamina.

, Many fantasies which involve breaking the rules of marriage such as stepping out (open relationship), or additional partners, almost always end in tears and are NEVER a good idea. Instead, try spicing it up. If you are the man do something different for your wife that she would never expect from you. Speak differently, or try to dress up like a fireman. Whatever you do, even if your spouse laughs at you, she will still respect and appreciate you for trying to cater to her. If you are the woman try wearing a wig that is a different color than your natural hair color, and speak with a pretend accent. You both can evaluate things that might be exciting ranging from using a camera, to using sex toys or food in your interactions. The point is keep it civil, respectful, and never vent suspicion such as, ""So you think I have the hots for that blond I work with, is that why you are wearing the wig?"". Just keep it simple. If you can't decide, try something very basic like using whipped cream.

, Ask your spouse to create a list of 10 positive things they like about you, and 10 things they don't care so much about. The 10 things they don't like don't have to be soul crushing, or seen as negative. Just see them as things that if they could change that aspect of the relationship they would. Don't pick impossible traits to change such as height, or nose shape. The effect will be undesirable. Instead target things that if your spouse worked on them they could change them (even if only a little). Both of you come up with the list then exchange lists. Don't be offended or attack your spouse about their list, try to understand their perspective. It is important to realize your spouse would have these opinions or beliefs regardless of whether they told you or not, so the list is a good thing even if it is hard to read. Besides now you have a tool that gives you the positive things they like which you can strengthen, and a list of things they don't like so that you can work on those aspects.

, Praise your spouse for legitimate reasons. Pick things they do that you really appreciate and vocalize it. For example a man might say to his wife after dinner ""I know that you work hard every day with the kids and the kitchen. I really appreciate that more than you know because I recognize that those tasks might sometimes be harder than my job."" Never assume your spouse just ""knows"" how you feel, say it. Be polite and choose your topics carefully. Saying something like ""Honey, you are just the best toilet scrubber in the world, and I really like that."" would be foolish. Think, then speak.

, Ask questions. Try to be a good listener rather than speaking. Getting to know your spouse is a lifelong thing that doesn't end at the altar.

, Treat things like depression, anger, or other personality problems seriously! Mental health issues can degrade over time, and if things eventually end in divorce your spouse might wonder ""where was she? why didn't she work harder to be sure I got the help I needed?"". Look at nature, when things go wrong the animals don't quit. They are there with their mate to the bitter end.

, Ever. No matter how good the opportunity might seem. If you can't control this behavior you need to end the relationship first. Have enough integrity to tell your spouse you can't keep your pants on and need to either get help, or get a divorce. It is okay to think someone else is sexy, just always take that energy home to your spouse. Don't put yourself in socially awkward situations. And for the record, even with a very mature spouse, having gobs of friends of the opposite sex and spending lots of alone time with those friends is never a good thing. It goes against the natural order. If you insist on having friends of the opposite sex then you better make sure you keep your spouse at arm's length when spending time with those friends. Trust is good, abusing it by constantly testing it is bad. If someone tells you they have absolutely NO jealousy where you are concerned means they are either A. lying and are very jealous inside, B. have no respect or attraction for you, or C. are cheating themselves and so don't really care what you do.

, Don't drink or smoke too much. Never do anything like drink and drive, or any other behavior which might endanger the health of the family or relationship. Remember that jail is NEVER a good thing.

, Get a job even if it is boring and doesn't pay much. Never be wholly dependent on someone, it will make them eventually feel used and manipulated.

, If you can not forget some offense, then say so, and make plans to set things right in whatever way seems mature. If you choose to forgive your spouse then forget it. Don't bring it up six years later saying something like ""this is just like the time you..."". One of the things people often have trouble identifying with is that forgiveness is meant to benefit the victim, not the offender. It is meant to alleviate the burden and let the victim move on. Remember, mercy is a powerful position.

, If your spouse tried really hard to make something special for you and failed, praise them wholly and let them know you think it is even MORE special because they took a risk to please you and failed. It shows a lot of desire to please someone to try to do something outside of your means and fail.

, Period. Always. Never curse, or call names, no matter HOW bad or angry you feel. Words are the hardest to heal. Don't say something in a bad mood or heat of an argument that you'll regret for years (or that can potentially scar your spouse emotionally).

Determine the size of the manger.,
Source wood pieces or scraps.,
Cut the wood to size.,
Create the legs of the manger.,
Build the body of the manger.",How to Make a Christmas Manger1," This style manger is simple to make with wood pieces of the same size. For example, you could create slats that are 24 inches (60.9 cm) long and 1 inch (2.54 cm) wide for a manger large enough to fit a doll (representing Jesus) that's under 1 foot (0.3 m) long. Plan for smaller slats if you want a tiny manger, and larger slats if your manger will be holding a larger doll.;
, Any type of wood is suitable for a manger. Consider using scrap pieces you already have from an old wooden crate, a piece of furniture you no longer use, or, for a very small manger, popsicle sticks. You could also purchase wood from a local hardware or home improvement store to create the manger.


Consider pre-cut wood pieces. You can buy packages of wood pieces at craft stores if you're prefer not to cut them yourself.
If you can't find pre-cut pieces and you prefer not to cut your own wood, many home improvement stores will cut the wood for you.

, Using a table saw or the saw of your preference, cut the wood into 11 pieces that are the same size. In this example, the pieces will be 24 inches (60.9 cm) long and 1 inch (2.54 cm) wide.


Be sure to measure the pieces before you begin cutting, so you can make sure they all end up the exact same size. Use a ruler and a pencil to mark where the cuts should be made.
Saw the wood outside or over a table covered with newspaper for easy cleanup.

, The legs will form an ""X"" on each side of the manger to hold it up. The outside surfaces of the legs will be visible, so use the four most attractive wood pieces for the legs.


Cut a 45-degree at 1 end of each piece. The angled cut allows the bottom of each piece to be flat on the ground, providing stability for the manger.
Identify the center of each piece. Measure each piece, mark the center using a pencil, and drill a hole through each piece at the center.
Assemble the legs by crossing the holes over each other so that they form an X. Place bolts through the holes, threading the legs together. Use washers and butterfly nuts to secure them.

, To create the slatted look, begin by placing one piece of wood across the sets of legs at the place where they meet, in the middle of the V shape they create. Use a hammer and nails to nail the piece into the V on both sets of legs. Space the 7 remaining pieces of wood along the top of the legs to create the manger. Space the remaining 6 slats evenly along the legs, so that they span from one set of legs to the other. Nail the wood pieces to the legs to finish the body of the manger.

Find a sturdy cardboard box.,
Create a wood pattern on the outside of the box.,
Add hay or straw.",How to Make a Christmas Manger2," Choose any size box that you desire. Boxes made with plain cardboard are easiest to convert into a manger, but you could also use a box that has a printed pattern.

, Use markers to draw wood grain on the outside of the cardboard box. Draw slightly curved lines across the box to resemble wood planks. Add details like wood swirls, knots and cracks to resemble wood. Consider drawing nails at each end of the box as a finishing touch.


If you're using a box that has a design printed on it, cover it first with brown paper or cut up paper bags. Use double-sided tape or glue to secure the plain brown paper to the box and completely obscure the pattern underneath. When the glue is dry, use markers to create the wood grain pattern.
Your manger doesn't have to be brown. You could cover the box with clay-colored paper, festive red and green Christmas colors, or any other colors you desire. If you're making the manger with kids, let them decide how to decorate it in honor of Christmas.

, Arrange hay or straw along the inside and outside of the box. The hay will help disguise the box and create the appearance of a manger.

"
"
Locate a feeding trough.,
Wash the trough.,
Decorate the trough.",How to Make a Christmas Manger3," If you have access to farm equipment, use an actual feeding trough as a manger. You can use a feeding trough made of any material, including wood, metal or plastic. Check your local farm supply stores if you don't already have access to a trough.

, If you're using a trough that has been used by animals, spray it down with soapy water and rinse it well. Let the trough dry in the sun before you decorate it.

, Drape the trough with tinsel, garlands, or other decorations to herald the coming of baby Jesus. Place hay inside the trough to create a realistic Christmas manger.

Make your marriage a priority.,
Present a united front Never take the side of the kids against your spouse, even if they are wrong.,
Take pride in your appearance.,
Give compliments.,
Maintain physical contact.,
Plan a regular date night, and if you can't hire a babysitter put the kids to bed early.,
Communicate.,
Have interests outside of the marriage, like a hobby or club.,
Don't nag each other.,
Show respect.,
Keep up with the little things.,
Be Romantic.",How to Avoid the Marriage Rut After Kids," Kids will eventually grow up and move away and the two of you will be left with each other. Your spouse should come before the children- always. That's not to say that there won't be times when the needs of the kids have to come first. But in general, do not use the kids as an excuse to not spend time with your spouse. By setting this example, your children will learn to expect their spouse to make them a priority also. They will also learn that the world does not revolve around them.;
, If you disagree with each other on an issue with the children, discuss it in private. But in public, ALWAYS support your spouse. Doing that will continue to create intimacy and trust between you which often is lacking once the kids come along.

, Look attractive for your mate. Remember what he/she found attractive about you before you had kids and continue doing it. Don't buy into the lie that since you're married you can ""let yourself go"".

, Make sure you let her know that she is still attractive to you. Show him that you still admire him and appreciate his hard work in supporting and protecting the family.

, Always kiss and hug as much as possible. Not only is it vital for you, it's vital your kids see your love for each other.

, Do something that both of you will enjoy, or try something new. Have romantic dinners and baths., Make time every day to discuss what's happening in your lives. You may talk all the time, but do you really sit down and hear each other out on all the issues going on? Or do you let them build and blow up? Write love notes that are short and simple.

, That way you always have some time apart. Time apart as well as together is vital. Balance the time you spend together with the time you spend as a family, and the time you spend apart.

, Nagging happens when our expectations are not met. If you expect your spouse to be perfect and meet all your needs, you will ALWAYS be disappointed. If you have a problem or need something addressed right now, instead of nagging, try to communicate better. Ask him to do something, instead of demand that he do it.

, Never berate your mate in public, in front of family, your children, or anyone else. If you have a problem, discuss it privately and rationally. Yelling and pointing out faults only drives a person away.

, They are what matter most. Flowers, shoes, clothing, etc., for her and a favorite meal, tickets to a concert or game, a hat, etc., for him as a surprise. Consider each other.

, Remember how it was before you had children - be attentive and romantic with one another. Candles, flowers, massage oil, satin sheets, lingerie, surprise gifts, filling up her car with gas, movie and dinner... these are essential in keeping things running as smoothly as possible.

Talk with your significant other about your relationship.,
Do not file any common law marriage documents with a Texas court.,
Sign a cohabitation agreement.",How to Avoid Common Law Marriage in Texas1," Communicate with your significant other and make sure you both understand the limits of your relationship. You and your significant other should both have the understanding that there has been no agreement made to be married. You should also communicate the following circumstances with your partner, as they will affect your ability to be involved in a common law marriage:


You cannot be involved in a common law marriage if either you or your partner is under the age of 18.You cannot be involved in a common law marriage if either you or your significant other is already married.;
, You and your partner should avoid filing certain documents with a Texas court, and you should avoid asking a Texas court to recognize a common law marriage. Doing so will result in the state recognizing a common law marriage. The important documents you should avoid filing and the proceedings you should avoid are:



A Declaration of Marriage. This is a document that formalizes a common law marriage.It may also be referred to as a Declaration of Informal Marriage.This document asks you to fill out, sign, and date a declaration stating that you meet all of the requirements of an informal marriage.

A Recognition of Common Law Marriage. This is a type of proceeding before a judge whereby you ask the court to recognize a common law marriage for a specific purpose, such as when you are filing for divorce.When you go to the court hearing, you will most likely have to fill out a declaration of marriage form and file it with the court.

Agreements signed as a married couple. You should also avoid filing any documents with a court that have been signed by you and your significant other as a married couple.Examples include leases, life insurance policies, and tax returns., You and your partner should draft and sign a cohabitation agreement, which is a document that specifies your rights as a couple and safeguards each person's individual interests and assets.The agreement should include a section that clarifies your relationship status and states that you are not agreeing to be married.


A cohabitation agreement should include sections on how household expenses and property accumulated during the relationship will be split; and set forth procedures for a breakup.Within this agreement, include a provision stating: ""Our relationship shall not be construed as a common law or informal marriage, and by living together and holding ourselves out as being a couple we are not agreeing to be married.""
The Texas legislature has not specifically addressed the legal issues surrounding cohabitation agreements, but they are likely to be upheld in court as valid contracts.Apart from those requirements, an enforceable cohabitation agreement is just like any other contract and must conform to your state's contract laws."
"
Consider living with your significant other only when you are ready to be married.,
Understand how you should sign a lease agreement, purchase and sale agreement, deed, or mortgage.,
Talk with your landlord or real estate agent and make your relationship status known.",How to Avoid Common Law Marriage in Texas2," Without evidence to the contrary, living together can be construed by others as evidence that you and your significant other are married.

, When you and your significant other decide to live with each other, you both need to make sure you do not sign any document as husband and wife. In order to make sure you are not living together as husband and wife, never sign a real estate agreement that contains the following language:


""Husband and wife.""
""Mr. and Mrs. .""
""We sign this real estate agreement as a married couple.""

, When you and your partner move in together, make sure you discuss your relationship status with your landlord or your real estate agent and make clear that you are not a married couple.

"
"
Sign documents carefully.,
File your taxes separately.,
Do not open joint bank accounts or get joint credit cards.,
Do not use your significant other's last name.,
Be aware of how you talk about your relationship with other people.,
Watch how you and your significant other act on social media.",How to Avoid Common Law Marriage in Texas3," When you and your partner sign documents together, make sure you are not signing them as a married couple. Always sign the following documents as an individual, or as a pair without portraying your relationship as a marriage:


Real estate documents.
Life insurance policies.
Credit applications.

, Your relationship status plays an important role in filling out tax forms. If you file jointly with your significant other, the government may review your tax return as if you are married. If this is the case, the government will then have direct evidence of you holding yourself out as married. You should always file separately until you are ready to be married.

, Opening up joint accounts is a clear indication of your relationship status. Having a joint account is likely not enough to hold yourself out as married, but it will certainly be strong evidence to that effect. If you really want to share your money, consider sharing cash you both pool together.

, Using your partner's last name is a clear indication that you are holding yourself out as being married. Taking someone else's last name is usually reserved for marriage, and while doing so before you are married may be legal, it will certainly hurt your chances of not being seen as married. Not only will sharing a last name look like you are holding yourself out as being married, it will also confuse things with your legal documents such as your photo ID, passport, birth certificate, and social security card.

, When interacting with others in public, make sure you do not claim you are married. The following examples will give you a good idea of what not to do:


When you move in together, do not tell your neighbors or house guests that you are a married couple.
When you are at social gatherings, do not introduce your significant other as ""your spouse.""

, You and your partner should not claim you are married on sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat. Doing so may be enough for you to be holding yourself out as married. For example:


Do not create a relationship status on Facebook that says ""married.""
Do not post a photograph on Instagram of you and your significant other with a caption that says ""married"" or anything else that could be construed that way.
Do not tweet anything on Twitter that states you are married or that you are with your spouse.

Gather the information you need.,
Provide a sworn statement.,
Prepare to pay a fee.,
Submit the appropriate paperwork.,
Be aware that the amendment won't replace your original document.",How to Amend a Marriage Certificate1," Amending marriage certificates is done in order to correct errors found on the original certificate. Amendments are not used to make changes on the document.Examples of errors include: spelling errors, grammatical errors, adding information to empty ""blank"" lines.
Examples of changes to a marriage certificate include: complete changes to first, middle, last or other names of either party; adding to or deleting any name of either party named on certificate.;

Check with your local county clerk's office for detailed information about what is required in your area.
If you are currently living in a different county or state from the one where you were first married, you'll need to contact the county in which your marriage was originally held.

, A sworn statement is a written statement testifying that your amendment request is genuine and true. It is similar to an affidavit, a statement witnessed by a notary public. Either can be used as evidence in a court of law.This is required in some states, but not all.
Sworn statements must be printed, with a signature and the date on which the statement was signed, to be legal.

, Most states or counties charge a fee for amending a marriage certificate. The fee varies by location.

If you are out-of-country, you should pay by submitting an international money order payable in US currency.
Many times, if you are filing for amendment within 1 year of your original marriage, you will not be required to pay a fee.

, The paperwork required by your local state or county authorities will vary by location. Your state office of Vital Records may not be involved in marriage certificates. Because marriage certificates are issued by the county, there is a great deal of variation in the requirements for amending the marriage certificate. Contacting your local Clerk of Court may help you better understand what documentation you need to provide.In California, for example, you will need to submit an original copy of the VS 24(C) form, including 2 signed affidavits.In New York, for another example, you will need an official Amendment Application.In Massachusetts, you must speak directly with a Registry Representative by calling (617) 740-2600 before coming to the Registry of Vital Records and Statistics to file an amendment., If someone requests your marriage certificate following your amendment, he will receive both the original marriage certificate and the amended certificate. The original record remains unchanged.The amendment will become page 2 of your marriage certificate.

If they can provide for their families, then they are succeeding at being a husband and father. This goes back to the hunter-gatherer mentality that human beings associate with the earliest ancestors; modern-day husbands, though hopefully more civilized than the deep-browed people from your elementary school text books, nonetheless show some similarities to their ancient forebears when they feel the need to provide and protect. By working long hours, they feel that they are securing their family's future to enable them to protect against life's dangers and deprivations. Their kids will be able to attend college, their wives will be able to have what they need to help raise the children well, their homes will be secure and comfortable. Such men feel that their mission is to take care of everyone, and they rarely lose sight of that..;
, He may not be working just to make money. His boss might have unreasonable expectations of his or her employees and pile on the workload with tight deadlines. Unless your husband is a glutton for punishment, this is a very stressful way to work. He might have to work long hours in order to keep (and keep up with) his job. Even though a lot of wives see their husbands as having no faults, your husband might actually be struggling at work. Demanding that he stop working the hours that he does will more than likely cause him to push back and shut you out. If you can't see what he's trying to do, even if he doesn't clearly explain it, he will see this as being disrespected. Maybe he's working a short-term project, and the amount of hours may taper off later. Rather than adding to this burden, try to help him feel better when he is at home.


Bring him a hot beverage.
Sit up with him.

, This is his way of providing for his family. He might not see the fact that he is missing out on precious time with his children. He might not see that you, as his wife, need him around to feel loved. He is working those hours for you and for the family. Unless he takes all of his extra money and spends it on himself and his hobbies, chances are he is just trying to help his family get ahead in life. Maybe he grew up without much food in his house and he remembers how miserable it was and doesn't want his family to be that way. He feels that he is doing what he needs to do in order to stop that from happening.

, He isn't cheating on you. He expects you to be understanding about his work load. He, too, should be understanding as to how that work load may affect you and the rest of your family.

, If the amount of hours your husband is working bothers you, express this to him in a way that he can understand. If he feels like you are challenging his reasons for working so much, you will more than likely not get the outcome of the conversation that you wanted. If you come to him gently and simply ask why he puts in so many hours, he will probably explain it to you. This is when you, as a wife, need to keep an open mind. If he is struggling at work, be supportive of who he is and reassure him in other ways around the house. If he is trying to get ahead in life and you aren't on the verge of starving, remind him that money isn't everything.

, Ask when these items will be accomplished. Rather than saying, ""You know, you walk through that front door every day and you still haven't done anything to fix it. It's been sticking all four years that we've been in this house,"" say: ""Honey, I was wondering if you could at some point find the time to rehang the door."" And then let it go. Give it a reasonable amount of time to get accomplished. If he still hasn't done anything about it a week, a month, a year later, simply ask, ""Do you know when you might get around to rehanging the door?"" It may seem odd, but some men literally have to be asked to do something more than once before it registers.

, He probably has someone at work to do that to him. It is called a boss. You are called a wife. Men view nagging as emasculating and disrespectful. Where women need to feel loved in a relationship, men need to feel respected. Rather than harping on his shortcomings (not putting down the toilet seat, for instance) find things about which to praise him without coming across as condescending.


For example, this doesn't work : ""You never put the toilet seat down. How many times do I have to remind you to do that. It looks gross when you leave it up since you tend to shed your pubes on the rim. Who does that?"" This stands a much better chance: ""Honey, thanks for snuggling with me in the middle of the night. It made me feel close to you.""

, A relationship is all about sacrifice from both partners. Tell him if he wants he can spend more time with the kids while you work more hours at your job. This tactic could pay double dividends: He can take some time off work, and he can also learn some of the challenges of being home without you (and with the kids). .

, Having a clutter-free house helps your husband to feel that coming home is more of a treat than a chore. Even if you only have 15 minutes a day to devote to cleaning the house, use that fifteen minutes like you're sprinting a race. If your house belongs on one of those extreme hoarders' shows, after a couple of weeks of daily, intense 15-minute cleanings, you (and he) will start to see a difference. Soon, you will be able to use that 15 minutes just for upkeep of the clean house. Everyone will feel better. Tension will drop and you will feel as though you have accomplished something major. If you hate cleaning, set a timer and when that timer goes off, stop the drudgery.

, Don't have them running around screening when he gets home. Greet him at the door with a nice tumbler of scotch or an ice-cold beer. Take his shoes off for him. Make him feel like he is the king of his castle. Indulge him by listening to his day even if it bores you intensely. It is nice to be listened to, as you know. Give him that respect. It will pay off.

, Maybe you could set up a taco bar. Have your husband dice tomatoes while you brown the meat. Have the kids grate the cheese or tear the lettuce with their clean, bare hands. Make your husband feel like he is a part of the family rather than just a nightly visitor. This will bolster the relationship between your husband and children. It will be a fun way to make memories, too, even if everyone is tired at the end of the day. The bits of closeness are beneficial to everyone.

Stop whatever you’re doing.,
Look at them when they talk.,
Don’t interrupt your spouse.,
Dedicate time each day to talk.",How to Relearn Listening to Your Spouse1," If you aren’t looking at your spouse, you aren’t giving them your full attention. Put down the iPhone or computer and turn off the TV. It’s nearly impossible to pay adequate attention to someone when our attention is divided., Making eye contact with your spouse lets them know that you are focused on them alone and ready to listen. Your facial expression matters, too. Don’t scowl at them or roll your eyes when they begin speaking., Often, we think we are listening to our spouse, when we are busy crafting our response or argument in our heads. This is not good listening because you’re only partially hearing your spouse because your main focus is on what you’re planning to say next. This leads us to jump into the conversation, usually before it’s our turn to speak. Few things are more detrimental to a spouse who needs to feel that they’re being heard than being repeatedly cut off mid-sentence by their partner.


To be a good listener, it's important to avoid dominating conversations. This is related to not interrupting and might seem obvious, but often couples begin to struggle with this concept over time: you can’t be listening if you’re speaking. Be patient and allow your spouse as much time as they need to talk or vent to you., Everyone feels busy and overextended at times between work, school, and family obligations. However, it is important to carve out even ten minutes a day to sit with your spouse and talk. The benefits of this are twofold. First, if you mention to your spouse that you want to prioritize talking to them, then that shows that you care about your relationship and are willing to be proactive to help improve it. Secondly, the ten or more minutes you set aside will help your overall communication if you use the time to give each other a “status report” on your days and how you’re both feeling.


Try to ensure that your discussions are productive. Don’t use this private time to complain that the house is dirty, even if it is. Use this time to talk about a tough project at work or an upcoming event you both have, for example. Then be sure to ask your spouse how their day went and actively listen to them.
If you have truly opposite schedules that make this difficult, then you might try Skype or FaceTime as ways to still communicate with each other."
"
Pay attention to non-verbal cues.,
Be sure you know exactly what your spouse is saying.,
Empathize with them.,
Listen for ways you can agree.,
Don’t one-up their concerns.",How to Relearn Listening to Your Spouse2," Making yourself appear to be open to listening to your spouse is almost as important as the actual listening. Are you fidgeting, standing with your arms crossed, or sighing? If so, you’re clearly communicating to your spouse that you are not listening and not interested in what they have to say. Sit upright or stand facing them and maintain eye contact. Think about how you would position yourself if your boss was speaking to you about something important and extend your spouse those same courtesies., To ensure you’re following what your spouse is saying, you need to reflect what they’re saying back to them. This doesn’t mean repeating verbatim exactly what they just said to you. It simply means listening for content and then zeroing in on key facts that show your partner that you were listening.


For example, if your spouse tells you that they are stressed out over a major project at work, you might say something like “That project sounds intense, and it definitely makes sense that you’re stressed. Is there anything I can do to help?” By saying this, you are reflecting back and validating their feelings, acknowledging that you heard them about their concerns, and then gently offering your help., Try to understand where your spouse is coming from, especially if they are voicing a complaint. Make an effort to understand their frustration. If they are complaining that the kitchen is filthy, for example, then think about their complaint. Is the kitchen dirty? Think about ways to address their complaints that show that you’re truly hearing them. Even if you feel like they’re overreacting, try to find the truth in what they’re saying., If your spouse voices a concern, try to find common ground on the issue. Even if you think their concern is an overreach or isn’t really valid, there is usually at least a nugget of truth in their problem, if you objectively examine the situation. Finding ways to validate your spouse’s concern shows both that you are listening and that you care about what they’re saying. At minimum, you're always able to acknowledge that your spouse feels a certain way, and that matters to you in and of itself, even if you don't agree with the logic behind the feeling.


For example, if they comment that you never help get the kids ready for bed, then you might reply that you understand where they’re coming from and volunteer to take over bedtime duties that night. You might follow up by asking if the two of you can sit down and determine a schedule or delegate duties that might help make bedtime duties not fall to just one person all the time., If your spouse opens up to you about a problem, avoid the urge to invalidate their worries by trumping their concerns with something bigger going on in your life. This sends the clear message to your spouse both that you aren’t really listening to them and that you also don’t consider their feelings and problems important. Remember that problems and stressors are not competitions. A good listener will hear out their spouse’s concerns and wait their turn to separately mention their own issues."
"
Drop your agenda.,
Don’t feel like you have to fix their problem.,
Remember the importance of being a good role model.,
Avoid being defensive about past poor-listening.,
Apologize and mean it.,
Ask for feedback.,
Try marriage counseling.",How to Relearn Listening to Your Spouse3," Have an idea of what direction you want your conversation with your spouse to go? If you want to embrace being a good listener, you have to get rid of it. Conversations in which two people are participating equally by listening and replying grow organically. Don’t sit down to listen to them with an expectation of guiding the conversation your way. When you do this, you aren’t truly listening.

, Sometimes our spouses simply want to come to us to vent or talk through their problems. When you step in with unsolicited, quick-fix suggestions, this belittles your spouse and minimizes their concerns. Avoid offering advice unless your spouse specifically asks you what you think.This especially applies to men. This tends to be a very gendered problem, with husbands seeking to fix their wives’ problems, rather than listening to their wives talk about their problems. For instance, if your wife comes to you with concerns about a disagreement she had with her mother, resist the urge to tell her to simply call her mother and apologize. Instead, actively listen and acknowledge her struggle., The way that you and your spouse communicate and listen to each other will be the model for your kids in their future relationships. Children are sponges for information, so make sure that the model that you’re providing them about how to best communicate with their partner is one of respect and openness.

, Your spouse might bring up that you haven’t listened to them in the past. When they mention this, it’s important to not become defensive or angry. Instead, acknowledge that you haven’t been as attentive as you should have been and that you’re working on it. Try asking them what things you specifically do that make them feel that you aren’t listening. This way, if they have specific examples, you’ll have concrete things that you can begin to work on.

, If you’ve been neglectful of your spouse in the past and failed to listen to them, then a genuine apology can go a long way. Be sure that your attitude is remorseful and matches your words. Avoid sarcastic or passive-aggressive comments that can seem more like a veiled attack than a genuine apology.


Try saying something like “I know that I haven’t been listening to you. Let’s set a date to go get coffee or lunch/dinner and talk. I want to know what’s going on in your life.” Then be sure to follow up and set concrete plans by picking a date, location, and securing a babysitter (if needed).

, Ask your spouse if they feel like you listen to them. You need to be prepared for their answer. Ideally they will say yes, but if they are hurting they might not be kind in their response. Asking them whether they feel like you listen to them can be tough, but it is your most effective means to gauge their perception of how well you listen.

, If things aren’t working despite your best efforts to become a better listener for your spouse, then you both might benefit from speaking with a professional. Find a trusted therapist or member of the clergy, and speak with them about your listening and communication related marital problems. They are trained to help couples in this area, and this can be helpful when managing the issues on your own have failed."

Start off small.,
Progressively get bigger.,
Show your love through thoughtful actions.,
Spend time being present with your partner.,
Speak your love.,
Speak the truth.,
Find out your partner's preferred ""Love Language."",
Remember that actions often speak louder than words.,
Trust that your partner acknowledges your efforts.,
Remember what love is.",How to Show Your Wife or Husband That You Truly Love Them," Small things can make a big difference if you put a little thought and feeling into it. Your wife or husband ultimately wants to know that, at the end of the day, you're thinking of them. All of the following can be done for little or no money.


Suggest an after-dinner walk through the neighborhood.
Turn one room into a dance floor and ask your spouse for a dance.
Camp out in your own back yard.
Read to your spouse in bed (with or without comic commentary).
Go to the gym together (some couples swear that sex afterwards is great).
Talk about ideas for a romantic vacation and store the details for safekeeping.;
, It's nice to mix up the small, more mundane actions with bigger, more meaningful ones. These ones take a little more work and may cost (some, although not very much) money, but they'll be worth it when your spouse screams with excitement or wriggles with joy.


Make a video montage of your wedding night.
Reach out to your in-laws and plan a surprise birthday party.
Recreate your first date, first kiss, or first run-in.
Write and record your spouse a love song (can be sincere or tongue-in-cheek).
Create a storybook fictionalizing the beginning of your relationship.

, They can be simple things, like drawing a bath, giving a massage, doing the dishes, or writing a poem. Choose an action that you know your partner will appreciate. Remember, denying yourself never means doing things begrudgingly. If you show affection, but drag your feet along the way, you may as well not be doing it.


Buy something for him/her when you know that they specifically want it. If he wants a Craftsman set of tools, or she wants a Fendi handbag, they might be upset at your well-meaning attempts to get them or make them something similar.
Make something for them when you're trying to show effort. It doesn't take much effort to buy your spouse what you know they want, but it sure takes effort thinking of a poem, writing it down, and setting it in a frame. This shows real commitment.
Numerous small gestures are easier than one big one. In case you thought you could wing it and make up for all your normal neglect, sorry: It's much easier to do small things for your spouse at regular intervals than it is busting out a grand gesture every blue moon. Practice small and steady.

, (This is often the least used, but the most powerful form of loving.) Turn off the phone, the TV, computer, and the radio and sit together allowing yourselves to experience each other. Being present with your husband or wife obviously provides the opportunity to serve him or her, so be available to love your spouse.


Go on a date at least once a month. Children, busy schedules, and apathy can all get in the way, but you both should shoot to be alone for dinner or the movies at least once a month. These moments can really help reignite the marital flame.
When in doubt, ask questions. People love talking about themselves, and your spouse is no different. Pepper them with great ""how,"" ""what"" or ""when"" questions instead of simple ""yes/no"" questions. Great conversations rely on great questions. Become a connoisseur.
Really get to know their past. Some spouses are surprised to learn, after many years, everyday details about their partner's past. Showing a concerted interest in their past shows them that you really care about who they are. Don't lie, tell the truth admitting to your mistakes shows you trust each other and accept your past.

, Clear communication will let your partner know how much you love them. Speaking from your experience is a way of sharing yourself so that your partner can hear it. You might say, ""My heart goes pitter patter when you walk into the room"" or ""I think about you throughout my day, and each time I do, I smile."" Say whatever is true.


Praise your spouse's talents and accomplishments. Figure out, if you haven't already, the ways in which your partner thinks they're unique or distinguished. Spend your time reinforcing those traits. If your husband fancies himself an intellectual, praise him for his smarts; if your wife fancies herself a fashionista, praise her for her style.
Get used to talking about feelings. Don't shy away from talking about what emotions you're going through. Dialogue about the emotions your partner is having. Share even inconsequential things that happened during your day, as it will make your partner feel more intimately involved in your life.

, Telling your partner the truth is a loving thing to do because it shows trust and respect. The truth doesn't have to be positive to be meaningful. It just needs to be true. Show your spouse unconditional love, but not unconditional acceptance. Always be willing to accept correction from your spouse too.This helps each of you develop and grow as better people and strengthen your relationship not build your relationship on a fantasy or falsehoods.


Don't raise your voice, used loaded words, or generalize using words like ""always"" and ""constantly."" These can make the truth sting more than it needs to.
Don't be caught up into the cultural notion that to love is to never seek to help someone better himself or herself. Trust that your significant other actually wants you to tell them the truth. You should strive to encourage each other keep coming up with ways to better yourselves and your relationship.
Use gracious words to point out your spouse's weaknesses and offer constructive suggestions on how to improve these things. If your spouse is especially sensitive, balance out criticism with praise.So they see what they need to improve, don't just lie and say they're perfect they way they are, point out what they need to improve, help them become better in a positive way.

, Do they know you love them when you speak words of love? Or maybe they feel loved by your acts of service? Some people feel loved by receiving little gifts, and others by loving touches. Real love is not based on your preference but your partner's.



Things that men might consider about women: A little physical affection goes a long way. Guys don't often show physical affection, and sometimes a little gesture like a kiss on the neck or a spontaneous embrace is just what she needs. Don't think of it as reassurance; think of it as reaching out.

Things that women might consider about men: Men sometimes think of physical affection as unnecessary or even clingy. That's not to say that you can't show your love; just be aware that to him it's not as important. Give your spouse time to voice his emotions, and don't punish him if he can't.

, Don't just say something, do something. It sometimes bothers your spouse when you consistently say you'll do something, but never get around to doing it. When your words don't have any initiative behind them, they start losing some of their oomph and your spouse may start trusting you less.


Don't make excuses. Excuses may be real for you, but they sound like excuses to your spouse. Don't bring your past ""mistakes"" into your new relationship, this is also seen as an excuse, no matter what the situation, abuse, hurt, financial suffering, don't bring it up. Anything can be over come and worked through with time talk to your partner about this, than leave it in the past, don't keep using it as a crutch hold in your future. Man or woman up, admit when you make a mistake, and try to make it better next time. Your spouse will notice.

, Love is not a competition: It's not about getting your due or being ""even"" with your spouse. Trust that your partner realizes how lucky s/he is to have you.


Don't always ask for validation. Validation is important, but learn to get by without it, even if you desperately want it. You may have just gotten your wife an amazing gift, and for whatever reason, she's not especially grateful; trust that she appreciates your effort and the present, and don't dwell on the lack of validation.
Trust your partner to be by him/herself. Unless there's a history of infidelity, trust your partner to make responsible, loving decisions in your absence. If they're out for beers with friends, or at a bachelorette party, trust them. They'll be surprisingly likely to honor your trust if you actually extend it.

, Love is an act of the will, not a warm feeling or a clever expression of experience. Although love is different for every person, and every person shows it differently, love often requires you to deny yourself and seek to meet your beloved's needs.


Think about the last time your spouse made you smile. What did s/he do to make you feel like you were the luckiest person in the world? Is there anything that you can do that might make them feel the same way back to you?
Go the extra mile for them. The modern world has made us busy; we're constantly doing stuff, and we never seem to have enough time to do it. Can you go out of your way to help your spouse do something that they need to do, that they dislike doing, or merely something they'd appreciate?

Get the oil changed in her car; press or iron his shirts before a big day at work or an interview; help in the kitchen so the two of you can enjoy the evening together.
Buy a gift certificate and urge her to go shopping with her girlfriends; help do the lawn, clean the gutters, or prune the trees.

Avoid excuses.,
Listen!,
Don’t discount the other person’s feelings.,
Practice your apology beforehand.,
Time your apology thoughtfully.,
Write a letter of apology.",How to Apologize After a Heated Argument1," However you choose to apologize, there are a few things you should avoid. Don’t automatically try to justify your statements or behavior, or try to reiterate why you were right about whatever you were arguing about. Pay attention to word choice and approach to prevent giving an apology that isn’t actually an apology.Avoid “ifs” and “buts”. Never start an apology with “I’m sorry if _____.” This makes your apology dependent on something else (and may even imply you think your apology is only necessary because of their feelings). This is simply not a sincere way to be apologetic.
Don’t say “I’m sorry but_____” either. An apology like this is making an excuse before an apology is even made.
Don’t try to explain yourself during an apology. Focused on owning up for what you did or said, the fact that you’re sorry about it, and that you intend to remedy the situation. Do not attempt to rationalize what had occurred during a heated argument.
Know that if there was a valid reason for the argument and for your role in it, that you should talk about it, but that that conversation ought to be independent of your apology.;
, Though it may seem counter-intuitive, listening may be the most important part of apologizing. Once you’ve made it clear that you are sorry, allow your loved one to speak and give them your full attention.Don’t allow the potential discomfort of giving an apology to turn into a monologue that you may have to apologize for all over again.
Whenever you’re unsure or whether you should continue speaking, pause. If your loved one begins to speak, just listen.
Don’t try to anticipate anything the other person is going to say. They may still be too angry or hurt to receive your apology. Even if they’re still upset, let them make their point.
If you’re feeling badly after a fight, recognize that the other person is too. Give them the time and space to articulate their feelings.

, Avoid attempting to downplay someone else’s negative feelings. Similarly, don’t act as though nothing happened. Acknowledge the feelings that they convey by responding specifically to each feeling they articulate.Use “I”-statements when responding, such as “I understand you’re upset”, “I know I disappointed you”, I realize that I said some hurtful things”. These statements can stand alone, or be accompanied with another clear “I’m sorry.”
Do not attempt to explain yourself when they still have more to say.
Avoid being falsely cheerful, as this may seem insincere or even malicious.
Say something along the lines of “I know you’re upset. So am I. When we calm down, let’s talk about it and get through this.”

, Apologize for both specific things you said during the argument, and for allowing yourself to get heated in the first place. Convey they sincerity of your apology by knowing what you’re going to say – and why – ahead of time.Tell yourself, and the person to whom you are apologizing, that you have no agenda that motivates your apology other than healing the damage to your relationship that the argument may have caused.
Choose words and statements that are honest and heart-felt. Don’t try to be overly-eloquent or too analytical. Be direct; you might not need to say much.
Ensure that none of your sentiments are framed in an effort to deceive or manipulate your loved one. Never be duplicitous in conversations that are important to your own or others’ feelings.

, Timing is especially important if you want your apology to come across as genuine. You certainly can’t give a heartfelt apology while you’re still worked up from the argument.Take a moment. You and your loved one will likely need a while to regroup your thoughts and gain composure. Avoid rushing into an apology for both your sake and the sake of the person you fought with.
Go somewhere private. A walk may be your best option; fresh air can help clear the mind and calm you down. Allow yourself to address your heightened emotions privately.

, A letter is a great way to calmly and courteously convey an apology. Even if you decide to apologize in person, writing a letter before doing so can help you organize your thoughts, express your feelings, and plan exactly what you want to share with your loved one.If you’re not going to see the person with whom you argued for a while, a letter is great way to convey your apology without putting them on the spot, which you risk doing with a phone call.
After you’ve written your letter, reconsider what you’ve written. Do so either immediately or over the course of a few days, depending on how quickly you want to give an apology.
Right before delivering an apology letter, reread it one last time.
Consider allowing someone you trust to read over the letter to help ensure you haven’t included anything that might be interpreted differently than you intend.
Do not apologize via text or email. A text is not an appropriate medium with which to have a meaningful conversation. Emailed apologies may be appropriate for professional apologies, but not for personal apologies to people you know well.
For more specific tips on apologizing, see the wikiHow on How to Apologize.

Acknowledge the reason that you had a fight.,
Include specific realizations about your behavior in conversations following an apology.,
Address potential causes of continued tension with your loved one.,
Don’t hold grudges.,
Commit to acting more appropriately.,
Give a token of apology.,
Consummate the apology.",How to Apologize After a Heated Argument2," The bad news is, there’s probably a reason that you fought, and it needs to be addressed. Don’t allow potential points of irritability or distance between the two of your to turn into deeper animosities by recognizing tensions before they lead to another fight.Self-reflection will lead to realizations that you can address after you’ve apologized.
Specific questions you might ask yourself include:

What are the specific things I said or did that likely hurt the other person?
Was I intending to hurt the other person, or get back at them for something? If so, why did I do so?
Do interactions such as this often occur between you?



, The answers you provide for yourself to these questions can help inform the specific things you need to apologize for.Be clear, by saying things like, “I’m really sorry about saying ______, I can see how hurtful that likely was.”
If fights are recurring, bring it up, especially if you’re at fault. Say something like. “I’m sorry for fighting with you again. I recognize that my behavior needs to change. Are you willing to talk about this with me?”
Let it go! Alternatively, you may realize that there wasn’t a good reason for a fight – it was just an especially bad moment for one or both of you. If you’re sure there’s not an underlying issue that needs to be talked about, letting it go (after apologizing) might be the best route to take.
More than likely there is something that needs to be addressed. Articulate not only the things you recognize that you did wrong, but also the things the other person said or did that hurt you, though do so after you’ve apologized.

, If you or your loved one feels as though one of your “gave in” during the fight, or didn’t get something off of their chest that they need to, there are likely unresolved issues between you.For instance, Ask each other, “Are you angry about how the argument ended?”
Did you try to convince your loved one to do something they didn’t want to do? Be sure to apologize and rescind any coercive agreements by saying things like, “I know I insisted on _______, and that I didn’t hear you out on why you disagreed. Let’s talk about it together, and I’ll be more open to your considerations.”
Articulate the things specific things that hurt of offended you that your loved one has said or done. Do so calmly, and avoid being accusatory, but you need to be clear about behavior that cannot continue. Say things likes, “It really hurt me when you said/did _______.”
Be ready to forgive your loved one, and expect the same, if you’re able to apologize to one another, have the constructive conversations to grow closer, and move on.

, Even if you are extremely upset or disgusted about what was said or done, recognize that holding onto the emotion of anger will not improve the situation for anyone. Ensure that there aren’t any grudges that may drive a wedge between the two of you.Don’t persist in giving others the cold shoulder or the silent treatment.
Similarly, if you find yourself being especially critical of one another, there are likely unresolved feelings that need to be discussed.
Monitor yourself and reflect on the observations you make about how you’re acting.
Take responsibility for your own actions by working to adjust your own behavior and being willing to speak openly and listen fully to your loved ones.

, You need to make it clear that you intend not to repeat any hurtful behavior.Your apology is only as good as your willingness to ensure you don’t have to make the same apology again.


Clearly and specifically articulate a commitment not to repeat any hurtful things you said or did.
Emphasize the fact that you do not want to hurt the other person, and are sorry for having done so.
Following egregious or repeated behavior during arguments with your loved ones, you may need to do more than apologize.
Commit to a plan or process to help you deal with whatever might be leading to your hurtful behavior, and seek professional guidance or join a support group to help you follow through on these commitments.

, Don’t ever think that simply giving a gift is a sufficient apology. If you go the gift route, it needs to be something well-thought out that will be meaningful to the recipient.


If you apologized in person, following it up with a letter about how much your relationship with the person means to you may be the best gift you can give someone.
Think of something the other person likes to do, and get them something accordingly.
Tickets or passes to a show or other activity you know your loved one will enjoy are a great option, as you can go together. Spending time together is another great gift, as it indicates you’re hoping to maintain your connection.

, If you fought with your romantic partner, tangibly re-establishing your commitment to one another is vital, not to mention (especially) enjoyable. Make-up sex has a reputation for solidifying a particularly gratifying reunion after a fight.Remind one another, both verbally and tangibly (with kissing, hand-holding, hugging), that even though you are capable of hurting one another, that you’re still there for one another as well.
When emotionally excited by the stimulus of an intense fight, the pleasures of sex may be amplified by a psychological (and biological) phenomenon called the arousal transfer.
Allow the relief you’re both feeling on account of your reconciliation to spill over into a session of romantic reunion that reaffirms the bonds between you.

Consider what your life would be like without children.,
See a therapist for help.",How to Talk to Your Spouse About Having Children," Before you strike up a conversation you’re your spouse about having kids, take some time to examine your own reasons for wanting to have kids.Write them out in as much detail as possible to help you prepare for a conversation with your spouse.


Consider whether your motivation is internal or external. Do you want to have kids because you think your friends and family expect you to do so? Or do you have an internal desire to have kids? How can you tell that your desire is rooted in yourself?;
, Don’t approach your spouse at the end of a stressful day or when he or she is distracted. Instead, plan your conversation for a time when you and your spouse are relaxed and can devote your full attention to the matter.For example, you might plan to talk on Saturday morning after you have had breakfast. Make sure that you sit down face to face and put away all distractions (cell phones, laptops, etc.) when you have your conversation.

, Be honest and tell your partner why you want to have kids. Use the notes that you made to help you explain point-by-point why having children is important to you and why you want to do it now. State your case in a calm, clear voice and be as detailed as possible about your reasons.

, If your partner is not ready to have children, then it is important for you to hear about the concerns that he or she has about the process. Ask your partner to share his or her concerns with you and to be as honest as possible., Even if your partner is 100% against having children, it is important for you to listen to your partner with an open mind and to show that you respect his or her desires.Make sure that you maintain eye contact, nod to show that you are listening, and ask questions if your partner says anything that you do not understand.


If your partner is in favor of having kids, then you will need to talk about your readiness and determine if there is anything that you need to do before you get started.

, Having children requires you and your spouse to be in good physical condition. Take some time to consider how healthy you are and what you can do to improve on your health before trying to become pregnant.For example, if you smoke or your partner smokes, then take steps to quit smoking. If you and your partner are overweight, then take steps to lose weight. Try to pinpoint your health challenges and identify ways that you can improve your health.

, Before you expand your family, you and your partner should take time to work out any challenges in your relationship. Having children can put a strain on both of you and if you have issues, then it is in your future child’s best interest to try to find a solutions to these issues.For example, if you tend to argue now and then about minor things, then work on improving your communication with your partner. If your issues are larger than small arguments now and then, you may want to consider marriage counseling to help you resolve problems before trying to have a child.

, Raising a child is expensive, so it is important to consider your ability to provide things like a crib, clothing, food, and toys. If you are struggling with your finances, then you may want to take some time to improve your situation and save a bit of money before you start trying for a baby., Raising a child also requires lots of teamwork between you and your spouse, so you should be on the same page regarding how you will raise your child. Talk about the values that you and your spouse share and how you can overcome disagreements about values.For example, do you and your spouse share the same ideas about how to discipline your child? Can you agree on what moral values to instill in your child? Do either of you have a strong religious preference?

, Longer relationships tend to have more stability and this is important for your future child. Consider how long you and your spouse have been together and if your relationship is stable enough for a child. It is a good idea to wait until you have been together for at least one year before deciding to have a child together., Even after you share your feelings with your spouse, there is a possibility that he or she may still not feel ready to have kids. In this case, it is important to be respectful of your spouse’s wishes and try not to pressure him or her.Pressuring your spouse about having kids is unlikely to make him or her think differently about the choice. In fact, it may even cause serious problems for your relationship.

, Children cannot fix a relationship, but some people think that having children will do just that. If you are considering children as a way to fix the relationship between you and your partner, then you should not have children.Try to work on your relationship with your partner before you make the decision to have kids.

, Many people opt to live without children and lead happy, rewarding lives. Consider whether you and your spouse could be happy without adding children to your relationship.


One way to determine if a life without children will cause you regret is to imagine your future self and consider whether or not you will regret not having children.Try to think about how you might spend your time and money if you never have kids. What would you do with the spare time, money, and energy that you would have spent on children?

, If you and your partner cannot come to an agreement about having kids and it is causing problems in your marriage, then consider seeking treatment from a marriage counselor. You may also consider seeing a counselor on your own for help dealing with your feelings about desiring children when your spouse does not.

Make sure that you're both ready for marriage.,
Pick the right ring.,
Pick the right time.,
Pick the perfect location.,
Ask the right way.",How to Propose Marriage," Before you take the plunge, you should know if you're really ready to be with your special someone for the long haul. A marriage proposal will change your life forever and you should understand that you're doing it for the right reasons. Here's how:


Ask yourself if you absolutely can't live without the girl you're asking to marry you. If you can't possibly imagine your life without her in it and if she makes everything in your life better and more meaningful, then it's time to propose.
Ask yourself if you've been in the relationship long enough to really understand your significant other. If you've only been together for a few months, then you may be rushing into the marriage. Of course, every relationship has its own timeline, but make sure you've truly seen the person you love both through amazing times and hardships so that you really have a sense of this person's long-term potential.
If you can't wait for everything that lies ahead with your significant other, such as traveling together, buying a house, or even having children, if that's what you both want, then it may be time to propose.
Don't propose just because you're feeling pressured, because you've been in the relationship for so long that you feel obligated to make a move, or because all of the people around you are getting married. You should propose when the time is right for you.
Make sure that your significant other is feeling the same way about marriage as you are. If you've been together for a long time and are serious about committing to each other, then chances are, marriage has come up and you understand that your sweetie is ready to make the move.
Even if you haven't outright asked if she would marry you, you should have a strong sense that she's ready to settle down and is in the same place as you are.;
, Before you propose, you have to choose the right ring. This depends strongly on the type of person your sweetie is. Some girls dream about their proposal their whole lives and have a ring picked out in their heads, while others don't even know that there's such a thing as a ring size. Here's how to make sure you have the right ring for the right girl:


Try to find out what kind of ring she wants. If your girl is pretty open about telling you what kind of ring she wants, casually ask her opinion. For example, if you have a friend who is recently engaged, you should study the friend's engagement ring and ask your girl what she thought of it. Was it too small, too chunky, or too shiny, or was it just right?
If your girlfriend is really picky about jewelry and you don't want to ruin the proposal with the wrong ring, ask her to show you the type of ring she wants online. Or if you want to be more suave about it, you can go for a walk in a neighborhood where you know there's a ring store and ask if she wants to check out some rings ""just for fun."" This will make your plan sound less premeditated.
If your girlfriend is vocal about her engagement hopes, then chances are that she's told her closest friends exactly what she wants. If you really trust one of her friends and know she won't spill the beans, and really want the engagement to be a surprise, then ask her.
Don't obsess too much about having the perfect ring. Plenty of girls don't spend every waking moment wanting the perfect engagement ring — really! (Except some)
If you have a family heirloom, such as a ring that belonged to your grandmother, then proposing with this ring will be a beautiful gesture because you'll be inviting your girl to be a part of your family. Giving your girlfriend your grandmother's ring is a more serious gesture than giving her something you paid for — no matter how expensive it is.

However, make sure your grandmother's ring is still in fashion. You don't want to create an awkward situation where your boy/girlfriend can't stand your grandmother's ring, but doesn't want to hurt your feelings or offend your family by saying so, he/she could be put off from accepting a proposal in the future (for fear you'll use the same ring) and worse, he/she could dump you.



, To have a perfect proposal, you need to pick the right time to pop the question. You need to strike a balance between being surprising and not completely throwing your girl off guard. She should have a sense that it's going to happen sometime in the next few months, but not know the exact date date and time. Here's how to pick the perfect time:


Surprise your sweetie. Your proposal will be much more romantic if she doesn't know the exact day of your proposal. If you've just talked about ring sizes, give it some time before you pop the question. You can surprise your girl by playing coy when marriage comes up, or withdraw from the conversation. You don't have to be aloof and she should know that you love her, but try to trick her into thinking that you're not obsessing over marriage right around the time you plan to propose.
Surprise your sweetie — but only to a point. Make sure that your girlfriend has a sense that an engagement is on the horizon. If marriage has never come up and she hasn't even had time to think about whether she's ready, you may be in gear for an awkward proposal.
Pick a relaxing time. Make sure you two can enjoy your engagement by choosing a time in your lives that is relatively stress-free. If she's in grad school, don't ask her the month before her dissertation is due. If she's working, don't ask her when you know things are incredibly busy at her job. Pick a time when you're both relatively relaxed and can even take a short trip to celebrate your engagement.
If you can avoid it, don't ask her to marry you when she's a bridesmaid in three or four other weddings. She will be too busy worrying about all the details of other weddings to focus on her own.
If you want to be surprising, avoid proposing on the obvious days, like Valentine's Day or when you take her home for Christmas.
Remember that timing isn't everything. If you really want to ask your girlfriend to be your wife, then go for it. Don't spend your life waiting for the time to be perfect to propose. People are always busy, things always come up, and it may never feel like you're both ready to devote yourselves to planning a wedding. If you want to get married, propose, and you will figure the rest out.

, Once you know when you want to propose, you need to pick the perfect location. To make the best impression, you should find a place that is romantic, private, and special to the two of you. Here are some things to consider:


Pick a romantic location. Propose in a rose garden, on the beach, or if you both like hiking, propose from a mountain top.
Pick a private location. Don't embarrass your girl by proposing somewhere really public like a sporting event, big party, or just out on the streets. If you really want to do it at your favorite restaurant, request a seat in the back. It's okay if a few people are around, but your girl should feel truly special — and not under pressure to say yes.
Personalize your location. A place that is special to the two of you will be more impressive than the most romantic place in the world. If you take her to your favorite restaurant instead of the fanciest restaurant in town, or to the place where you first met or fell in love, the proposal will be much more special than if you picked a cookie cutter romantic destination.
Ask her on a trip. If you book a special vacation, then your girl will already be on the lookout for a proposal. Take her to a place that is special to both of you, such as a place you've always wanted to visit together, or the place where you took your first vacation.
You can still try to surprise her by acting like you aren't going to propose on the vacation. For example, take a long walk on the beach without asking her, and she may think that the trip is just about fun. But if you're dying to propose and want to enjoy your vacation, just propose as soon as you get there and have a great time!

, Now that you've figured out exactly when and where you want to propose, it's time for execution. You want to ask her to marry you in a way she will never forget. Here's how:


Be simple. Tell her how absolutely lucky you are to have found her and how you want to spend the rest of your life with her. Then say, ""Will you marry me?""
Be creative. Ask her to marry you by having the staff at a restaurant write ""Will you marry me?"" on her favorite dessert. You can write ""Will you marry me?"" on a t-shirt underneath a nice shirt, if you think she'll be okay with the humor.
Be honest. Don't just ask her to marry you, but take the time to tell her how special she is. You can even tell her this by giving her a letter and watching her read it.
Don't overdo it. You don't need fireworks, a dance troupe, or a celebrity to tell her how special she is. Don't distract yourselves from the fact that you're taking a really important step together.

That will likely determine whether you drive somewhere a few hours away or hop on a flight to another country. Even if you don’t own a car, renting one for a few days may be cheaper than round-trip flights for two people, especially if you select a fuel-efficient vehicle.Visit websites like Kayak, Expedia, or Priceline to compare flight and rental car costs.;
, If you’re planning a weekend getaway, it’s best to choose someplace you could get to within a few hours. Otherwise you’ll spend too much of your time traveling rather than enjoying your destination.Start by searching online for destinations in your region. Type things like “romantic getaways near Chicago” or “romantic destinations within 3 hours of me” into a search engine.


It may help to determine what feature you want most from your trip. If you want to relax on a beach, but don’t live near the ocean, research nearby lakes that offer beach access. If you want to go hiking, look for destinations near mountains or national parks.

, Tropical destinations don’t have to be out of reach, even if you’re on a budget. Many travel websites offer deals on flight and hotel packages, and some packages even include meals and activities. Just be sure to read the fine print with these deals to be sure you know what’s included and whether they’re refundable if your plans change.Search websites like Orbitz, Hotwire, or Travelocity for romantic getaway packages. Compare multiple travel sites against each other since they may offer different prices, and consider setting up fare alerts to get an email when flights to a specific location drop in price., Cruises offer a convenient all-in-one getaway, with travel, accommodations, and meals often included in the price. And they’re available all over the world, from tropical destinations in the Caribbean Sea to mountainous regions in Alaska.

Cruises can be expensive, especially if you have to travel just to get to the port-of-call, but many cruise lines offer last-minute deals in order to fill empty rooms, so this may be a budget-friendly option if you’re feeling spontaneous., Search for hotels or bed and breakfasts near your desired destination. Try calling to see if they have special rooms, often called honeymoon suites, available during your stay. If you won’t have a car, be sure that the place you’re staying offers easy access to public transportation or a free shuttle service to local attractions.


Research local accommodations on Airbnb or VRBO (Vacation Rental By Owner). You can often find an entire apartment or house at a rate comparable to or less than a hotel room. Some hosts on these services will also offer recommendations on their favorite local places to eat or shop., Search websites like TripAdvisor or Yelp for romantic restaurants near your accommodations. Look for places with a view overlooking the water or mountains or try to find pubs with private booths or fireplaces. Also, consider cuisines that allow you to get closer and share plates, like tapas or fondue.

, Pick up local fare from a market or corner grocery store, or get takeout from a popular restaurant. Find a spot in a public park or along the beach to lay down a blanket or towel and sit and eat together., If you both enjoy being pampered, schedule a couple’s massage or facial. This is a good way to treat yourselves and relax together. If your hotel doesn’t have a spa, or you’re staying in an Airbnb, ask the concierge or host if there’s a reputable spa nearby they can recommend., Search online for any vineyards near your destination, and see if they offer tours and wine tastings. If there are multiple vineyards around, find out if any local tour companies will shuttle you among them on a guided tour.

Keep it budget-friendly by sticking to smaller vineyards and by just paying the winery tasting fee rather than buying any bottles., Research local opportunities for mountain climbing, hot air balloon rides, scuba diving, white water rafting, or horseback riding. Pick something that excites both of you, even if it seems scary. Doing this together is an opportunity to bond and make fun memories.

, Your romantic getaway doesn’t require you and your partner to spend every moment with just each other. A group tour is a great way to break up the monotony of seeing only each other for days on end. Plus, it provides the opportunity to have new experiences and make new friends., Ask your partner what they want to do and what they hope to get out of the trip. If you plan everything yourself, the other person doesn’t get to share in all of the excitement. And you risk planning a trip that doesn’t appeal to them as much as it does to you., Take clothes that make you feel sexy, like lingerie, sun dresses, or outfits that are fancier than what you ordinarily wear. Buy a special swimsuit to surprise your partner with if you’re going someplace near a beach or with a pool.

Bring sunscreen or mosquito repellent if applicable to your destination. Sunburns and bug bites won’t create a very romantic mood.
Bring massage oil to give each other sensual massages. Just be sure that you follow TSA guidelines for liquids if you’re flying., Don’t fill all your time with activities and not allow yourselves to rest. The point of the trip is to enjoy each other’s company. Quiet moments back at the hotel or bed and breakfast can be just as special as time at restaurants and local attractions., Take a break from texting, calling, and answering emails. Take pictures, but consider waiting to post them to social media until you get home. You took this trip together to get away from all that, so take advantage of this opportunity to unplug.

Make sure you feel fulfilled.",How to Improve Your Relationship With Your Spouse," Often times couples that have been together for a long time take the things that are said for granted. For example, your spouse might tell you that something you're doing has been bothering him/her, but you might assume that it's not a big deal because you've been together for so long. However, little things add up, and when your partner feels invalidated or unheard, that can lead to bigger trust and intimacy issues down the line.If your spouse tells you there is a problem, you need to take that statement seriously. Work on solving the problem, either alone or together, but make sure you take your partner's concerns seriously.
Address your partner's needs. If your spouse is telling you what he or she wants from the relationship, you need to put in the effort to make it happen or work together to find a compromise.;
, Quality time is time that you reserve unconditionally and completely for your spouse. No matter what happens, you should reserve this time for your spouse. Phone rings? Hang up and shut it off in front of your spouse. Listen to each other, sit together, watch each other. Enjoy each others presence and enjoy being together. Do this at least once a week for 30 - 60 minutes., Honesty is tremendously important in a relationship, especially if you're married. You want to feel that you can trust your spouse, and you want your partner to feel the same way. But honesty and openness extends beyond just telling the truth; it also means not withholding information, and not holding back when there's something you want to address.Never lie to your partner. Even a small lie, like saying something doesn't bother you when it secretly does, can eventually boil over into resentment and arguments.
Open up and let yourself be vulnerable with your partner. Tell your spouse your secret hopes and dreams, your deepest fears, and other things that you keep hidden.
Let your partner open up and be vulnerable with you. This can help build trust and foster a stronger sense of intimacy and affection.

, Compromising can be difficult, especially when emotions are running high after an argument. However, needing to be right for 30 seconds isn't worth the strain that argument could put on your relationship down the line. It's normal to disagree or even argue from time to time, but you need to be willing to let go of your side in the name of compromising and collaborating.


Don't think of arguments as something that need to be ""won."" This is dangerous thinking, as it pits you and your spouse against each other.Let go of things that aren't worth fighting over. Even if you weren't in the wrong, it's not worth the stress and frustration of an argument.
Be willing to cede an argument. Just because you think you're right, it doesn't mean arguing your point any further will get you anywhere, so work on dropping it before it escalates.
Compromise makes your relationship stronger. When you both set aside your needs, including your need to be right, you can work together as a team for the betterment of both partners., When you and your spouse have a disagreement, it's important to avoid using accusations or insults. One way many spouses inadvertently hurt their partners is by using ""you"" statements instead of ""I"" statements. Using ""I"" statements can help convey the way you're feeling and promote a productive, positive conversation, instead of hurting your partner's feelings.


A ""you"" statement conveys blame to your partner. For example, ""You're always late, and you make me look bad as a result!""
An ""I"" statement reframes the conversation in a way that focuses on the feeling, not on pinning blame or guilt. For example, ""I'm noticing that you are staring away during this conversation and it makes me feel like you're not taking my feelings into consideration.""
An ""I"" statement has three components: a concise and non-accusatory description of the specific behavior you're having problems with, your feelings on that behavior, and the tangible, concrete effect your partner's specific behavior has on you.The behavior component should stick to the facts of the situation, your feelings should be directly related to that behavior, and the effect should either specify the consequences or support your feelings on the matter.
The goal is to be as specific as possible and stick to the issue at hand. Don't drag up other unrelated issues or feelings, just focus on the tangible effects of the current problem.

, Many people begin yelling without even realizing it. When you have an argument, your emotions may be running high, and you might feel very passionately about the thing you're debating. However, yelling at your spouse will only have one of two results: either your partner will yell back, and you'll be screaming at one another, or your partner will become fearful of you. Either way, it's a damaging situation that can put a huge strain on your relationship.It may feel relieving in the moment to yell and let out your frustrations, but your emotions will be running high.
You're more likely to say things that you don't mean when you yell, and you won't be able to take back those hurtful words later when you're calmed down.
Avoid talking about important things when you (and/or your partner) are upset. Take a walk, or simply excuse yourself from the room for 5 or 10 minutes, then restart the conversation when you're both calm.

, Whether you've been married for two years or twenty years, it can easily feel like you and your partner have fallen into a rut. Routines form because they are convenient and they make it easier to navigate your day-to-day life, but falling into ruts and routines in your relationship can slowly kill the romance without you even realizing it.If you usually eat in most nights, try going out for a date night. If you typically make your own separate meals, try cooking a meal for your partner and eating together.
Do something exciting together that you and your spouse wouldn't normally do. It doesn't have to be anything crazy, but it should push you both to have fun and get excited together.
Take a romantic vacation together, or just plan a fun and exciting day together - even if it just means going to a carnival or an amusement park.

, When you and your spouse were dating, you probably flirted with one another all the time. So why did you stop? Most couples get comfortable with one another, which is obviously a good thing. But the downside of getting comfortable is forgetting how to turn on the charm, often because you haven't had to in several months (or even years).Make eye contact.
Smile at your partner and act giggly.
Use romantic body language, and mimic your partner's body language.Stand facing one another, avoid crossing your arms, and lean in towards one another when you speak.

, Physical contact is an important component of intimacy. Physical contact makes you feel desired, and it can make you feel comfortable and closer with your partner. If you're already very intimate and have a lot of physical contact, then keep doing it. If you've lost that part of your relationship, make an effort to bring it back.Physical contact doesn't just mean sex (although many people do consider sex a healthy part of marriage). It can mean holding hands, snuggling, embracing, kissing, or any other kind of affectionate contact.
Your partner probably wants physical contact as much as you do, but may be too shy or worried that you don't also want it.
Don't stress over physical contact, just initiate it. Your partner will appreciate it, and it will help you both feel closer to one another.
Remember that feelings often follow actions. If you put forth the effort and try to make a romantic evening for one another, the romantic feelings will follow., If you've been married for a while, you probably both feel overwhelmed from time to time with trying to balance your work life and your home life. This can be even more daunting if you have kids. But making time for intimacy without any distractions (kids, work calls/emails, etc.) can do wonders to bring back the spark in your relationship, especially if you make it a consistent priority week after week.Spending time with one another, especially with physical contact, often sets the stage for sex and will make you both feel closer to one another.
If you have to, schedule time for intimacy and/or sex. Experts advise that even setting aside 30 minutes for some intimate time alone can do wonders for your relationship.
Drop your kids off at a babysitter's, or if they're old enough to be out alone you can give them money to go see a movie or shop at the mall. That will buy you some alone time with your spouse.
Turn off your cellphones when you're being intimate together. Nothing kills the mood like your partner getting dragged into a long work-related phone call.
Intimacy isn't just a one-time thing. You'll need to work hard to make time for it every week, or several times a week, or however often you and your partner need it.

, This relates to being honest and open in your communication with one another. Some people are afraid to convey their desires to others, even to a spouse. However, your preferences are nothing to feel embarrassed or ashamed of. Talk to your partner about what your sexual preferences or fantasies are, and ask your partner about his or her preferences. And no matter what you or your partner want, be mutually respectful of one another's needs.Feeling like your sexual preferences aren't being met can make sex unfulfilling, which over time can feel almost like a chore.
The best way to mutually enjoy sex is to communicate to your partner what you like or don't like, and ask your spouse to do the same.
Be willing to explore new things together in the bedroom so that you and your partner are both having your needs met. Plus, trying new things in general can lend a spark to your relationship, and you might find you both enjoy your new routine.
Being respectful of your partner's needs doesn't mean putting yourself in an uncomfortable situation. It's okay to have boundaries and to expect your partner to respect those boundaries.

, Some people have the impression that couple's therapy is only for people who are on the verge of divorce. However, that is simply not true. Couple's therapy can help you and your spouse work on communication skills, find ways to feel more intimate, and work through any difficulties that arise in your marriage.There's no shame or stigma in seeing a therapist. Couple's therapy can help you and your partner at any stage of your relationship.
If you or your partner experience little to no sex drive after previously having a sex drive, your therapist may refer you to your primary physician to see if there are any medical explanations.
Sometimes certain medications can reduce sexual urges or the ability to perform sexually. Other times there may be an emotional reason why a person's sex drive decreases.
Be honest and open with your therapist and with your doctor to address any intimacy issues you're experiencing.

, A big risk in long-term relationships is taking one another for granted. No matter how much you love and appreciate your spouse, there's always a risk that you might get so accustomed to one another that you forget to be grateful for all that your partner does. If you make an effort to express gratitude, your partner will almost certainly do the same.Say thank you when your spouse does something for you, whether it's cooking a meal, fixing a broken cabinet, or just picking something up for you at the store.
Letting your partner know that you appreciate the little things will make your spouse feel appreciated, and your partner will be more likely to continue doing nice things for you (and vice versa) in the future. You could say something like: ""It made me really happy that you swung by work today - thanks for doing that. It was good to see you for a few minutes.""

, Another facet of taking your partner for granted is forgetting to compliment one another. You may think that your partner knows you love him or her, and that may be true. But nothing brings a smile to your face like hearing that someone finds you attractive and desirable, so work to make one another feel special as often as possible.It doesn't take much to notice your partner. Compliment your spouse on an attractive outfit, a recent haircut, any developments after beginning a new workout routine, and so on.
Try to praise your partner for his/her efforts in front of others. Bragging about your spouse's accomplishments when he or she is too shy to can really make your spouse feel loved., As your relationship goes on, you might find that it's harder to make time for a date, or to go out and have a romantic evening alone. This can be particularly troublesome if you have children. But having regular date nights spent alone with your spouse can bring back the excitement and the passion that you felt for one another when you were actually dating, and that passion is important in sustaining a long-term marriage.


Commit to spending the night alone together. Get a babysitter for your kids, or have them sleep over at a friend's house.
Choose a romantic restaurant. If you have a favorite place to go or if you can recreate your first date, even better.
Get dressed up for one another. Try to impress your spouse as though you were still just dating and not yet married.
Take a romantic walk after dinner, or go see a show together. Focus on making it an intimate evening alone together.

, In addition to feeling your sexual needs are fulfilled, it's imperative that you feel like your life has meaning and that you've accomplished something. It may come as a surprise, but experts agree that having your own personal goals and accomplishments separate from your spouse can actually strengthen your marriage.When you feel like your own personal goals are being fulfilled, it's easier to devote yourself to your partner.
If you're very career-driven, take time for your career. If you're an artist, work on your art. If you're athletic, train for a marathon.No matter what your partner's goals and accomplishments are, it's important for you to have your own goals. You and your spouse should be supportive of one another, and should celebrate each other's accomplishments.

If you haven't committed yourself to rebuilding the marriage, you won't be able to fully participate in restoring trust. Making an honest decision to rebuild your marriage rather than abandon it is the first step of practicing rigorous honesty required for this process.Sometimes people decide to end the marriage, rather than rebuild. This is not necessarily a failure or a bad thing; it's just the outcome of the situation. If this is the case for you, you'll be wasting your time to try to rebuild rather than moving on. You might even find your relationship with your spouse improves or changes to friendship once you've decided not to rebuild your marriage.
Only you can decide whether or not you want to rebuild your marriage. Your friends and family may express opinions regarding what you should do--and are often quite vocal about it. This is natural. However, you need to decide what's true for you and make your own decisions.
Having children in a marriage does complicate matters. But staying together for the sake of the children generally is not a good idea. Children adapt to divorce.;
, Consider whether you've changed your ideas about what you want in a marriage, and whether your ideas are realistic.

Sometimes people do grow apart. How you were 10 years ago may not reflect who you are today. But the other person may not change in the same way. And this can cause issues. It does not mean either of you are bad.
It is important to touch base with your partner on what he or she wants. He or she may not be happy too.

Many times, newly married people start out with idealistic expectations of what marriage should be like. This is especially true of young couples. When these ideas aren't always realized, they might feel betrayed--even if the other partner has not necessarily done anything wrong. Examining unrealistic standards can help what is a perfectly good marriage--but not necessarily idealistic--survive.
People who experience a crisis in their marriage often prove to have stronger marriages in the long run.
Part of making a decision to rebuild a marriage is to reconsider your expectations about marriage. If you and your spouse have very different ideas about what you each expect in a marriage, you will need to be able to work out a compromise.

Both partners in a marriage have to be committed to rebuild a marriage. Rebuilding a marriage takes a lot of hard emotional work, and if one person is not able or willing to undergo this endeavor, it cannot happen. While this may seem obvious, sometimes one partner desperately wants to repair the marriage and overlooks the fact the other is not going to do it. This sounds obvious, but sometimes one partner (and occasionally both) are in denial about the commitment to rebuilding.
Be clear about what sort of marriage you want. Different people want different things, and a good marriage has clear expectations, shared visions, and goals which will not be exactly the same from marriage to marriage. But first you need to be clear what that is for you. Rebuilding a marriage is an opportunity to examine what went wrong for you, and what you want to change.

, The process of rebuilding a marriage is very difficult. It can be helpful to talk to a trained professional. This person might be a counselor; a priest, rabbi, or other religious leader with training in marriage counseling; or a psychotherapist. Someone who isn't emotionally involved in your marriage may help you to recognize patterns of behavior or communication that are negatively influencing your marriage.Negative communication patterns can be difficult to change alone. If you are trying to make the decision to rebuild a marriage, it might require another person's help to learn to recognize communication that leaves you feeling depressed, insecure, or wanting to leave the conversation.
When you and your spouse have become ""like roommates"" rather than like intimate partners, a counselor or therapist might help you remember how you were initially intimate.
If you feel like the only reason to rebuild the marriage is for the sake of the children, it might be useful to talk to a professional. Staying together for the children's sake is generally an insufficient reason to decide to rebuild your marriage. However, it is also true that it is a reason to do everything possible to try to make a marriage work.

, If you are responsible for breaking the trust in your marriage, you'll need to take additional steps to establish your spouse's trust in you. Make a commitment to telling the truth, and allowing complete openness regarding your plans and communications (including emails, texts and phone calls). Don't hold anything back.Try to avoid sharing detailed information about the past transgression, if any. It is important to give clear, truthful, and accurate information to the other spouse. But obsessively recounting betrayals doesn't help your spouse to move on.

What it critical to one person to get answers about may not be for another. Let your spouse determine what he or she wants an accounting of.
Recognize that even if you have ""come clean"", it will take time to rebuild trust. Your spouse may not trust you to have a seperate bank account or have drinks with a person of the opposite sex. You may have to take steps to rebuild trust such as break contact with certain individuals, change jobs, or give up drinking without the other spouse present.


It may help to learn more about your own reasons for breaking trust with your spouse. This means learning about your own emotional vulnerabilities and insecurities. Be open about this process with your spouse.
Never blame another person for your betrayal. If you're making a decision to rebuild your marriage, you'll need to take complete responsibility for your actions.

, Stop saying anything bad about your spouse to anyone outside your marriage. When talking to your family and friends, only state positive things your spouse has done. Tell your spouse what you like about him.Many times a marriage in need of rebuilding will be focused on negative qualities. You can change a great deal about your marriage by focusing on positive qualities rather than negatives.
Eliminate the negative observations entirely. Even if you only state two positive qualities about your spouse in a week, you'll likely notice a difference.

, It's easy to develop an internal checklist of what a perfect spouse would be like, but it's unrealistic to expect your partner to fit this mold. You don't have to like everything about your spouse. Learning to accept each other's limitations is an essential step in rebuilding a marriage.Learning to develop a realistic form of trust will help you from developing resentments. Living with resentments undermines the quality of your marriage.
Many disagreements within a marriage are never fully resolved. By adjusting your expectations, two people within a marriage can ""agree to disagree"" without compromising trust. A disagreement doesn't have to prevent deep satisfaction and trust within a marriage.

, One of the reasons a marriage deteriorates is dissatisfaction with one's own life. Rather than looking to your spouse to provide for you the life you want, try making some of these changes yourself.If you've stopped doing certain activities you enjoy because your spouse doesn't care for them, try doing them again. You don't have to do everything together. If you enjoy hiking, for example, join a hiking group.
Being honest about your own challenges will help you rebuild your marriage. Look for areas where you can improve, whether these are large or small.
Learning to identify your challenges will help you become more forgiving of your spouse as well.

, Sometimes stating what needs to change is the only way to rebuild a relationship. For example, an alcoholic may need to stop drinking before any real change can be made in rebuilding a relationship. If you are married to someone in active addiction, it's okay to say that the addict must seek treatment before the marriage can be rebuilt.A 12-step group, such as Al-Anon, can be helpful in learning more about practicing healthy boundaries with an addict or alcoholic.
If you set an ultimatum, follow through with it. Setting ultimatums that are not really ultimatums just lets the behavior continue.
Not all ultimatums are about drug addiction. It can also be about ""deal breakers"" that is putting your marriage in peril. This could include affairs, excessive hours at work, getting control of spending, and so on.

, If you continue to bring up issues from the past, you may have trouble addressing real issues in the present. Take a break from discussing past disappointments or betrayals. Instead, focus your attention on the marriage as it is now.Whatever your parents did or didn't do, your marriage is yours today. Never use the past to justify your behavior or blame your spouse.
Eliminate the phrases ""You always,"" or ""You never,"" from your vocabulary. This kind of thinking sees current behaviors through the lens of the past, and prevents you from going forward in the rebuilding process.
Feeling resentments about things that occurred in the past is natural. Learn to attend to your feelings without reliving the events of the past. Remind yourself that whatever happened is in the past.

, This may be difficult, as many people are taught not to talk about our feelings. However, this is an essential part of rebuilding a marriage. An intimate relationship requires bravery. Saying your feelings means taking responsibility for them, rather than blaming the other person.As you move past the initial rebuilding stage, continue to deepen your relationship with one another. The best way to do this is through developing habits of trust and vulnerability.
You may want to find your own ways to practice talking about feelings. For example, some marriages are helped by setting a ""date night"" where honest communication can happen. Other people find that communicating difficult feelings via writing can be easier.

, In a healthy marriage, each partner takes responsibility for her own thoughts, feelings, and words. You have a choice in how you respond to each other.A good practice to develop is to use ""I"" statements when talking about sensitive subjects with your spouse. Instead of saying ""You did..."" or ""You felt..."", try to stick to your own perspective. ""I did..."" or ""I felt..."" This simple technique will open the conversation to a deeper level of honesty.
If your partner blames you for something, don't become defensive. This only escalates the situation. Instead, speak honestly about your feelings.
Remember, your emotions and your emotional reactions are your own. They are not the responsibility of your spouse.

, Sometimes disagreements occur even in the healthiest marriage. You can minimize the damage they do by exiting the argument on a better feeling. Ways that couples find to repair their relationship after an argument include: using humor, finding ways to agree with one another, and showing sincere appreciation for the other person's perspective.Keeping your commitment to each other helps keep your argument in perspective. Remember the adage, ""How important is it?"" In 20 years, likely neither of you will remember this argument anyway. Your relationship is more important than being right in this disagreement.
You can choose to focus on the positives in each other, even during an argument. Doing this is an excellent practice, offering deeper insight into your marriage.

, A therapist, professional or religious counselor can be helpful in understanding the patterns that developed in your marriage. Talk to each other about what kind of resources you might need to rebuild your marriage.While you may choose individually to seek help from a trusted resource, the person who helps you rebuild as a couple must work for both of you. For example, if you are a deeply religious person but your spouse is not, a religious counselor might not be the best choice for your marriage helper. Consider using a therapist or professional marriage counselor instead.
A couple that knows more about the way their problems develop may be able to better resolve them, or they might need additional help. A counselor can help you learn to be patient with each other while you rebuild your marriage.

, A marriage won't be rebuilt overnight. It will take time to recognize and change long-established patterns of communication and trust. Learn to give your spouse the benefit of the doubt, and assume that she's acting in sincerity. Don't rush this process. Forgiveness and trust are very intimate issues, different for each person. Allow your spouse the time he needs to develop these qualities for himself, and allow yourself the same thing. Don't panic if these don't develop immediately.
If you find yourself feeling angry or frustrated, take some time apart from one another to calm down.

Consider how you feel about children.,
Consider how your children will cope blending with a new family.,
Address any doubts that you might be feeling.,
Be very honest with yourself.,
Consider the children first.,
Trial run things.,
Be sensible, not selfish.,
If you do decide to go ahead, embrace the decision fully.",How to Decide Whether to Marry a Man With Children," If you have never had children, what is the reason for this? Did the opportunity simply pass you by or don't you really want to have children? If you don't want or don't like children, this is already a warning signal - you will not be able to simply dismiss or ignore your intended kids, and you won't be able to keep him away from his kids (at least, not if you're smart). On the other hand, if you like children but the chance has never come up before, this is a positive sign.;
, If you have children of your own who still require your care, it is important to think through how you will facilitate their passage into a new family. It is important to let them spend time with your new man's children, so that they can get to know one another. This will also allow you to observe how they get along, and it provides an opening for you to hold a conversation with them later.

, The initial advice is that if you do have any doubts, it is either not the time to marry, or maybe it will never be the time to marry this man. These are the sorts of questions you need to ask yourself:


Can I manage a relationship that comes with children?






Can I cope becoming a stepparent to someone else's children?
Is this something I can enjoy in the long-term (because it is for the long-term)?
Do I like the children? Do they like me?
Can I cope with any physical or emotional disabilities that any of the children have? Am I willing to take on the responsibilities that such care entails?
Am I willing to put in the time needed to teach, nurture, and raise these children as my own? Or at least to allow my man to raise his children and stay out of his way as he does so?
Do I agree with his parenting style and how will this affect me or my children?
Is this love enduring enough to cope with the initial upheaval learning to parent new children will cause?
Are there other sources of support to help me and my proposed new spouse?
Will their mother be able to help or is she ill, absent, gone for good? Or, is she resentful and spiteful, and likely to make this hard for me?

, Love doesn't overcome a lot of challenging parental arrangements. You must be able to walk into this with your eyes wide open, expecting some resentment from the new children, from your own children (if any) and possibly from other people linked to the relationship, including the ex-wife, grandparents, and siblings of your husband-to-be.

, While you may be feeling starry-eyed and blissful, the children may be wary and even dreading what's to come. Remember that his children were a part of his life before you were. And remember, too, that it's not going to be fair to make his children feel ""less than"" if and when you and your man choose to have a child of your own. There are a lot of very complex emotions and mechanisms that will come into play, particularly if your man is not the custodial parent of his children and your prior children live with the two of you - when they come to visit every other weekend, it's very likely they will already feel, not so much like guests, but more like intruders in the home. Any children that are the result of your marriage are their half-siblings - the prior children may love their sibling, but very much resent you. You must be prepared to cope with that, as well as policing your own instinct to see his children as threats to your own children. It sounds easier than it is in practice.

, It might be easier to test the waters by spending time together for a longer period rather than rushing into marriage. Even living together might be an option for you if that feels okay. Time will give you the opportunity to see if you are managing and it will let the children see that this new arrangement could work, giving them time to get used to it. On the other hand, time could also reveal that it isn't going to work, so be prepared for that possibility too.

, When there are children involved, the complexity of having a romantic relationship increases manifold. Unlike when you were younger and children were not part of the romance equation, the romance now is fringed by the need to take into account what works for every person involved, not just for the two people in love. Despite the romantic notion shown in movies of large families melding together, the realities are much harder; more costly, more prone to friction, more likely to not work out. If it doesn't work out between you and this man, it is important to remember that you may still have a connection with (and love for) children that aren't your own - children who may still want or need you in their lives. That's a lot of responsibility for children that belong to someone else - a someone else that you may no longer want to deal with. You may come to a point where you need to walk away from both this man and his children. As such, it is really important to be sensible and not selfish in the decisions that you reach.

, If you have answered the questions, faced the doubts, and addressed the possible challenges, you have done the hard preparation work. Be conscious that the road ahead will not be smooth running but if you have taken the time to do the groundwork and you are fully aware of what might be ahead, it should be a journey filled with love, dedication, and the determination from both you and your spouse-to-be that this is going to work.

Remind yourselves that it takes time to change.",How to Get Your Husband to Help out Around the House," In defining the mandatory tasks, you clear the first hurdle of your husband overlooking the tasks left undone. Moreover, identifying the exact chores can help both of you see what constitutes household work. Typical chores include:


Tidying all areas of the house
Laundry (washing, ironing, folding and putting away)

Grocery shopping, plus other store visits

Cooking, washing the dishes

Bill payment and sorting

Yard work, gardening and maintenance
Getting children to any extracurricular activities, medical visits, etc.

Pet care, including grooming, vet visits, feeding, etc.;
, Schedule your date after a fun day or at the end of the work week––just avoid booking time immediately following an argument or when something else has your husband's attention. Grab some wine, get away from the kids (and the TV), and bring your list to the date.Don’t broach the subject of helping around the house during an argument or tense situation; you’ll never get the help you need and deserve.Avoid treating your husband like a child or being bossy. This will only end in arguments and nothing will change. Also avoid pulling the martyr routine; all that does is have you continue to burn internally while everyone simply acknowledges that you put up with it even if they have to tolerate mumbling., Reference the tasks he performs already and talk about how his contributions make a difference in how well the family functions. Then go on to explain that because you feel as if you're taking on more than you can handle, you’d love him to help out more.


Show him the list of tasks so that he can see the multitude of household chores in black and white.
Tell him that his contributions would help maintain your energy levels and give your family more time to do things instead of waiting around while you finish the housework.Avoid yelling at your husband. No one responds well to being yelled at. If he feels scolded it may cause him to retreat., Keeping a home is a shared endeavor. Don't be afraid to point out chores that you need extra help on.


If your husband is resistant, be patient. You may have to compromise at first. Pick two or three chores you really want him to do and work on those first.
Let him know if you think certain chores could be done more effectively or quickly with his particular talents or temperament., Rate each task by considering how time-consuming it is, how strenuous, and how often it must be performed. For example, washing the floors may be a moderately difficult task, what with mopping, sweeping, waxing, etc.


When writing up the list, consider items that could make cleaning easier. For example, can you upgrade the vacuum cleaner or get better detergent? These can be excellent tasks to assign to your husband. Making him feel that he has bought the items can give him a greater sense of pride in using them to prove that they're doing the job better than the old items!

, Encourage him to choose some simple tasks, as well as some more complex ones, so that the housework load is evenly distributed. If he doesn't have the experience or knowledge to do some of the harder tasks, talk about when you can teach him how to do those things. , Part of your conversation when splitting up the chores might be to talk about what you are each good at. Some chores might be easier or less stressful for one of you depending on your skill set and temperament. This is also a good opportunity to talk about how you can learn from each other so that in the future you will both feel more confident taking on any chores that come up throughout the week.


Make your own lists of chores you feel like you are good at and compare notes.
Make a list of chores you really dislike doing and that you are hoping your partner can take on.
Problem solve together. If there are chores you both don’t like, work together to come up with strategies to complete them more easily. Maybe these are chores you decide to get done together.
Spend some time teaching each other how you do certain chores. If your husband has a particular way he likes to do the dishes that is different from you way, ask him to show you. Take on the role of student and be willing to see the benefits of doing something a different way. Switch roles for chores you feel confident in. Ask your husband to just listen and participate before asking questions or making other suggestions.
Be willing to listen. Don’t interrupt your partner when they are showing you their way of doing things. Keep an open mind. Ask your husband to do the same for you.

, Part of the reason no one likes to do chores is because they can be so dull and boring. If there is a particular chore you both don’t like doing try alternating days or weeks with that chore. For example, this week you do the dishes and he does the laundry and next week you switch. This will increase your sense of sharing the responsibilities while also breaking up some of the monotony that comes with doing the same chores everyday.

, Trust that your husband is doing the chores the best way he knows how. Be open to the fact that even though he may have a different way of doing them he can still be effective. If there are chores that you need or want done a very specific way, consider doing those yourself., Don't tell him that he must do the chores one way and on a certain day, but instead explain how you do it and what has worked for you.


Avoid speaking down to your partner. Try to think of this as an opportunity to share your point of view, rather than instructing your partner as though they are incapable or unwilling. Instead of saying things like, “Make sure you do it like this,” try using “I” statements like, “I like to do it this way. I find this gives me the best results.”
Be open to suggestions. Use “you” statements to ask questions. “Do you have any ideas about how to improve this process?” “How do you feel about doing the task in this way?”

, Saturday mornings can be a good time if there aren't other commitments since it frees up the rest of the weekend. Otherwise choose a time that fits and lets both of you do housework in tandem.Make dinner together. This can end up being a good time to talk about your day and for both of you to learn new skills by trying out new recipes once a week.
Let him wash the dishes while you dry. Or you rinse them and he loads the dishwasher.
Play music or a podcast while you dust the living room. Anything you can do to mix a bit of leisure or fun into doing chores can make the tasks seem less daunting and actually turn them into a bonding experience.
Call yourself a team. Think about you and your partner as a team and the chores as a game you working together to win. Keep a score chart for your team. Reward yourselves with an hour of TV or a glass of wine when you’ve completed all your tasks.

, Prepare his mind and his mood to be engaged when the weekend comes to clean the house. Do it together and limit the time so your family doesn't spend the entire day cleaning. The goal is to get your husband to get involved. If it becomes too much, he may not want to do it again. Start small and build from there.


Make a chore chart with each task listed out and when it needs to be done.
Plan in other activities like taking a walk or a break to do some reading so that the day doesn’t feel bogged down by just doing chores.

, This should go both ways. Try alternating tasks and rewards. Whoever cleans the bathroom this week gets to pick what movie you watch on movie night. Whoever cleans out the fridge gets a twenty minute backrub before bed., You both contribute to the harmony of the home, so both of you need to acknowledge this from time to time. The more you demonstrate your appreciation to one another, the more it becomes a good habit.Thank your partner for specific tasks. “Thank you for mopping the kitchen floor. It looks wonderful!” It can be easy to start taking for granted things that they do every week.
Remind your husband how much you appreciate being thanked.
Thank each other for doing extra work. No matter how hard you try there are going to be weeks where life catches up with your family and one of you ends up doing more of the chores than the other. This is part of being partners in a relationship. Be sure to point out when you see your partner taking on more of the chores to take some of the pressure off of other things that might be going on in your life. Be willing to do the same.

, Be flexible and patient. It takes time to change old routines and habits, especially when one person has been relied upon to keep the house clean. It may take lots of gentle reminders and additional persuasion, but persist until it becomes the norm in your household. And avoid keeping score; he's likely to slip up, and you are too. Just gently remind him of his end of the bargain when he fails to meet it.Have weekly check ins. Take some time to discuss how the chores went for the week. Avoid blaming each other. Everyone’s schedules are different and no week is exactly the same as the one before it. Start by talking about what went well instead of what didn’t work. Focusing on the positive will make it easier when you start to address the things that didn’t go the way either of you had hoped.

Make sure you have all the items you need before you get in line.,
Identify the fastest line.,
Find something to occupy you and your spouse while you wait.,
Deploy the “grab and stay” method if he or she tries to bolt.,
Leave the line too.,
Consider adding more items to your bill if he or she bounces.,
Communicate both at the time you're ditched in the line and back at home about how the escapee behavior causes you to feel.",How to Get Your Spouse to Stop Ditching You in Line at the Store," One way to avoid getting stuck in line alone is to ensure you both have thoroughly explored the store and/or picked up every item you need. Otherwise, there are too many excuses for your spouse to disappear back into the store, only to resurface when you're about to pay the bill.


Use a cart or a basket to hold your items. In some cases if you walk into the store without a basket or cart to hold all your items, your spouse could pull the “we didn’t get a certain item because we couldn’t carry everything at once” maneuver. Don’t provide him or her with that type of opportunity––grab a cart the minute you enter the store, even if you're only there to pick up a few items.
Make one more sweep (mental or physical) around the store. Even if you think you have everything you need, make one last sweep to make sure you are set. This will reduce the likelihood that he or she will need to run back to another aisle to pick up an item while you wait in line.
Confirm with your spouse that he or she is ready to check out. Verbally make sure your spouse has browsed every aisle and is actually ready to leave and is ready to get (and stay) in line.;
, This may not always be possible, depending on the amount of goods you're purchasing, but it's still worth checking. Learning to evaluate checkout lines is vital to getting through line as quickly as possible, and it's not just about how many items you're allowed––it also involves detective work on the people already in the line to see who looks as if they'll move through fastest.


Consider who is next in line. Check out how many items the next person in line has and what kind of items. For example, you may not want to get behind the lady with 30 cans of individual cat food. While it's not a great idea to make split second judgments about people's speed by just looking at them, see if you can assess whether they're likely to be fast payers or fussy ones who haven't even begun to get their wallet out.
Size up the cashier. Do they seem overly chatty or working slower than other cashiers? Look for the efficient, competent cashier who seems to move his or her line along quickly. (In doing so though, you may be setting yourself up for a less engaging service experience.)
Beware of the customer ahead of you with numerous coupons, codes or questions. Sometimes you can get stuck behind a customer who is chatty or who feels inclined to debate the price of a certain item––or more. While you may not be able to anticipate standing in line behind such a customer, you can often pick up the cues, such as the person with the large envelope of coupons or the person who starts to divide his or her orders in order to pay separately.

, One easy way to get your spouse to stick with you in line is to find something to occupy time for both of you while you wait.


If he or she is a smartphone user, play a game together in line while you wait such as Life, Draw Something or Words with Friends. Pass the time together using one of the thousands of smartphone apps.
Thumb through tabloids together. Especially if you're waiting at the grocery store, grab a few trashy tabloid magazines and read up on the “news.”
Plan your day. If you're doing some shopping early in the morning, consider plotting out your day and make a list of where you’ll go next and what other stores you may need to hit. Or, plan other things, like the next day or the weekend or even a vacation idea.

, This may be considered to be “guerrilla” but sometimes you need to make a physical statement to get your spouse to wait with you. It goes like this:


Firmly grasp your spouse's shirt sleeve and remind him or her that you're both waiting in line together (really emphasize the ""both""). When he or she tries to saunter away to browse the aisles grab his or her shirt sleeve firmly in order to stop your spouse from taking off.
Make eye contact with your spouse to non-verbally communicate that you’ll be very unhappy with him or her if you have to stand there alone. Look directly at him or her and either give the puppy dog look that says, “don’t leave me” or the serious, “something bad will happen if you leave” look. Your type of relationship will generally dictate which look you deliver.
If grasping and eye contact doesn’t work, simply tell your spouse politely but firmly that you don't want to stand in line alone while he or she occupies time browsing. Quietly, tell your spouse that you too are bored alone in line and want him or her to wait too.

, If your spouse feels that your teamwork hasn't achieved a finished cart-full yet, leave the line and peruse the aisle with him or her. In some instances, he or she may wonder why you are leaving too and actually reveal that he or she is bored and wants you to hold the line.


Alternatively, ditch your spouse before he or she can ditch you. Give your spouse a taste of his or her own medicine and see how they feel if you leave him or her alone to hold the line.

, If all else fails make a statement––financially.


Find something especially for you (that you can’t share) if you are left alone. Grab an impulse item in the check out (generally there will be something no matter if you are at a retail or grocery store) that you know your spouse won’t want or need (but you may fancy).
Don’t mention you added the item to your list; let him or her guess why the bill was higher. This may take a few rounds before he or she notices, but let your spouse try to figure out why every time you shop together the bill is higher than he or she anticipated.
Don’t go to an extreme in terms of adding items. Purchase something additional within reason that will get his or her attention but nothing that will bankrupt you both.
Be aware that this is fairly immature behavior and you may, or may not, get called out on it, depending on much your spouse cares about the bill. Also, it has the potential to hurt the bottom line of both of you as a couple and is suggestive that you'd prefer to buy comfort than communicate, so take care using this option.

, Tell your spouse how you feel. He or she may not realize that every time you go shopping together you don’t like standing in line alone. In particular, tell your spouse that you don't like the disrespect inherent in assuming that you're happy to wait in the line while he or she feels free to do as he or she pleases. Explain to your spouse that it makes you feel as if he or she treats the shopping as an optional excursion, while for you, no matter what, it's a constant responsibility. Explain that the boredom is the same for every other person in the line and that you feel it's a bit selfish to expect to be able to get out of it just because you still wait.


Seek compromises. Is this really a good use of your time, shopping together? Especially if it's frustrating you to this extent, you really do need to question the purpose of dragging along a reticent spouse. One excellent way around this is to divide the shopping responsibility up so that you share the burden equally. For example, you might do each weekly shop, while your spouse does a monthly shop. Or you might do one week on, your spouse the other week following, and so on.
Who in your household loves shopping and isn't fussed about line waiting? Send that person, regardless of who, and don't expect accompaniment.
Make better use of shopping lists. Less excuses for missed items and a speedier experience all round in getting through the selection of items.
Shop when it is quieter, such as early mornings, nighttime after dinner, or whenever there is a traditional lull for that particular store. Ask the store manager for advice on the best time to shop to avoid long lines.

Consider your reader(s).,
Decide how long your letter will be.,
Choose your content.,
Ask others for input.,
Decide on your salutation.,
Start with pleasantries.,
Write about your chosen content.,
Conclude your letter.,
Make changes in your draft.,
Make your card yourself.,
Buy a card.,
Use a good pen.,
Write your letter.,
Sign your letter.,
Do a quality check.",How to Write a Christmas Letter," Make sure your reader wants to read your letter, and your letter is appropriate. For example, a Christmas letter to your brother and sister-in-law might talk about your personal life more in depth than a Christmas letter to your co-worker. A Christmas letter should also reflect your relationship with the reader: include important life events or shared interests. Here are some things to consider before writing your letter:


Do they celebrate Christmas? If not, consider leaving Christmas out of your letter and focusing on the general holiday, festive, or winter spirit. Christmas letters are really “holiday greeting cards” that mention Christmas.
Are you very close friends?
What topics would be inappropriate?
What did you talk about last?
When will you see each other next?;
, No letter should be longer than one page, and most people choose to write about 1 paragraph. However, your message could be as short as two sentences, such as “Merry Christmas from the Joneses! Safe travels and a Happy New Year.”Decide your letter’s length based on how much information you want to share and you think your reader would like.
Also consider how your letter will fit into your envelope and travel through the mail; packaging and stamp prices might factor into your letter length.

, Write about topics that your reader would want to know. You can write about shared interests or new experiences. Typical Christmas letter content includes positive news, family outings and activities, accomplishments and awards, and life milestones.


If you have children, you can write about your children’s growing personalities and character. Sometimes these are more interesting milestones to hear about than accomplishments or awards.Consider writing about an activity you enjoyed and have a nice picture of. You can use this picture in your Christmas letter.

, If you’re stuck or don’t know what to say, see if someone else has a good idea. If you are writing a card that multiple people are going to sign, prioritize asking those signees what they think the letter should say.

, A salutation is the beginning of a letter where you greet your reader. Address your reader by name: “Dear Maria” or “Merry Christmas, Percy!” Think about what you find natural to say, and what your reader would like.“Dear ____” is a safe choice if you are unsure of how to greet your reader.
Your salutation may or may not acknowledge that your letter is a Christmas-specific letter.
Your salutation always ends with a comma after the last word of the salutation.

, After the salutation, your message should open with a friendly greeting. This sets the tone of your letter and tells the reader what to expect in the rest of the letter.“How are you doing?” or “I hope this year has treated you well.” are safe choices if you are unsure of how to start your message.
You can reference the time of year, either Christmas or winter, to start your message. This is equivalent to small talk before you deepen your conversation. For example, “I hope you’ve been having a wonderful winter! Our neighborhood is covered in snow and the kids are loving their snow days.”
You can also reference your reader’s personal life. For example, “I hope David has been enjoying tenth grade. I loved those pictures from his soccer game last week!”

, Whatever events, people, or ideas you thought of earlier, write down what you want to share with your reader. Remember, write at least one sentence and no more than one page; many Christmas letters are about a paragraph long.Be creative and flexible. If you remember something else to include, add it in. This is a rough draft you can edit and change into the final draft.
Don’t brag. While you can share good news, exaggerating or excessively praising loved ones can exhaust your reader.Most Christmas letters include photos that accompany the written message. Pick photos you like and that are appropriate for your readers to see.
Avoid unnecessary adjectives. This helps you avoid bragging and long letters.
Stay personal. Your reader wants to hear from you, not Hallmark. If you are short on time or effort, you can still write one sentence and sign the card.

, End your letter in a way that is personal and specific to each individual recipient. Adding a personal note to the letter makes your reader feel unique, even if you are sending letters to many people. If you are mass-printing the same Christmas letter to many recipients, you should still handwrite unique conclusions.“Merry Christmas” is a safe choice to end your letter with.
Leave space for people to sign the letter at the end.

, Read your draft out loud and change any phrases or sentences that sound awkward or unnatural. Remember your letter should be concise, personal, and appropriate. Keep writing drafts until you are happy with the product.


Get advice. Someone else might have a better idea of what to write.
If you share news about other people in your letter, ask for their permission first. For example, children might care what news from their life goes into the family Christmas letter.

, As long as your letter can still be sent to your recipient, get as creative with your card as you want. Most homemade cards are 1 piece of paper folded in half. The front flap is decorated, and the inside flaps contain the message.Use a printing store or online template to produce many letters at once. There are many templates for free, but the paper and ink will cost money.
Use colored or special paper. You could use red or green to emphasize that it is a Christmas letter.
Include pictures of you and your family. Your readers will like to see pictures of the people they are reading about.
Include motifs for Christmas. A tree, snowman, presents, reindeer, or Santa Claus can all add to the festive Christmas tone of your letter.
Get creative. You can add stickers, pictures, pipecleaners, cutouts, quotations, captions, or anything else you think is appropriate. For example, if your reader appreciates humor, you can write a joke on the front.

, Not everything about your card must be from scratch. Buying a card from a store can save you time and money, if the alternative is printing or writing customized ones.


Find a store that sells cards. Examples include drugstores, general stores, department stores, and stationery stores. Some stores sell cards in bulk. You can call a store on the phone or look at its website to see if it sells cards.
Pick an appropriate. It does not have to be a Christmas card; it could be a holiday or blank card. Your writing “Merry Christmas” qualifies it as a Christmas letter.
The card should not indicate a different holiday or event; for example, don’t buy a card that says “Thank you for your gift,” “Happy Halloween,” or “We’re sorry for your loss.”

, Your letter is going to close and travel inside an envelope, so you want to make sure your message is legible when it arrives. Pick a pen that doesn’t smudge, dries fast, and is in a legible color.


Use whiteout if you need. Try to make the letter still look nice.

, Copy your updated draft onto your card with your best handwriting.


Anticipate how much space your letter needs, and aim to make your sentences spaced evenly.
If you run out of space, write the most important things down or wrap up your letter. You can also run onto the back of your card, but generally your letter should not be that long.
Leave room for signatures.

, If you wrote the whole letter, you might still need signatures from other people, particularly your children or spouse. It is personal preference whether multiple signatures are in the same or multiple colors of ink. If a signature is illegible, you can write the name in print beneath.

, Look over the letter and reread it. If you are unhappy with the result, use whiteout, glue, tape, or scissors to edit your letter. You can start over if you have another card.


If you misspelled the name of your reader, especially in the salutation, then you should start over with a new card.
Do you think the card will survive travelling through the mail? If not, reinforce or make a better card.

Cook together.,
Teach the basics.,
Buy a cookbook.,
Praise him - a lot!,
Start with simple dishes.,
Remind him of advantages.",How to Get Your Husband to Do More Cooking1," Many people learn to cook by imitating someone who already knows how. Invite your husband to join you in the kitchen. For example, if you do all the preparation of raw meats and vegetables, your husband can help by stirring the vegetables as they saute.If you label your actions, your husband will learn what different cooking terms mean. For example, tell him that you're dicing the tomatoes, and he will see you chopping tomatoes into smaller pieces. If you tall him you're slicing the onions, he'll see you cutting a peeled onion in half, then into strips by cutting along the same direction as the onion's layers.
Having a good time while you're cooking is one of the best ways to make it seem like a fun activity.;
, When teaching someone how to cook it is essential to start by teaching a few simple techniques. Your husband may find cooking intimidating and mysterious. Show him that it's not by enlisting his help in cooking, teaching every step.Start by teaching basic terminology, and how each action is done. Many beginning learners will be helped by finding out why an action is done a certain way.
Another motivation will be learning to make food he likes. This might be risky, because when he's learning he might not make it exactly the way he remembers it. Keep it simple.

, Look through cookbooks together. There are some great cookbooks for beginning cooks, including Mark Bitman's classic How to Cook Everything. The qualities you're looking for in a cookbook include how well it explains the steps of cooking, and whether your husband likes the kind of recipes the cookbook contains.If your husband enjoys Italian food, Marcella Says …, by Marcella Hazan is a great basic cookbook. '

The Joy of Cooking by Irma S. Rombauer, Marion Rombauer Becker, and Ethan Becker is another classic, with many favorite dishes.
If your husband has a sweet tooth, the Fannie Farmer Cookbook by Marion Cunningham includes many recipes for desserts as well as basic recipes of all sorts.
Many men make their way into the kitchen via the outdoor grill. If your husband already knows how to use a grill, check out cookbooks that relate to grilling, barbecue, or side dishes that go along with grilling.

, Learning new skills is hard, and most beginning cooks have some failures along the way. Never disparage or criticize his cooking. Instead, find ways to compliment everything he does in the kitchen. Volunteer to clean up after him. Thank him for any help he provides in the kitchen.Teach him how to make your favorite dishes, and he'll know that your praise is genuine.
Name dishes after him. Deviled eggs become ""Dave's Deviled Eggs."" Lasagna becomes ""Ahmad's Spicy Lasagna.""
Let him overhear you bragging to others about his culinary skills.

, A basic lesson in teaching any new skill is that it's easier to build on success than recover from failure. Simple dishes include any recipes consisting of less than 10 steps which rely upon basic cooking techniques.No beginner's recipe should take more than 30 minutes to prepare, though baking may take longer.
You don't want him to get bored, even though the recipes are easy. The best recipes to start with will be highly motivating as well as easy to prepare.

, If he's a practical man, he'll be motivated by the many advantages of learning to cook. After all, cooking is a basic survival skill, and helplessness isn't usually considered a positive trait. In addition, cooking for yourself is frugal practice, far less expensive than eating out.If you're ever sick or injured, he'll need to be able to cook in order to provide for you and/or his children.
Cooking impresses people, particularly when done by a man. It might not be fair, but when a man can cook, people are generally more impressed than when a woman can cook. This is an advantage that you don't have to point out - chances are, he'll notice the compliments for himself.

"
"
Try to see his perspective.,
Ask for his help in the kitchen.,
Assign him a weekly meal.,
Sit down and have a talk.,
Hold a contest.",How to Get Your Husband to Do More Cooking2," If your husband already knows how to cook, he might be avoiding cooking for other reasons. He might feel insecure about his cooking skills, or unsure of interfering with what he perceives as your role.He might not even notice that you do all the cooking. He might take it for granted, genuinely unaware of the hours you spend in the kitchen.
Perhaps his father had strong feelings about who should be responsible for cooking. Maybe he grew up being told that men who cook aren't manly, or had feminine attributes. It might help him to hear that most of the most famous chefs in the world are men. Introduce him to Anthony Bourdain, Jamie Oliver, Levi Roots, or others.
Some men have had other people provide for their needs their whole lives. They're used to it, and it seems normal to them. Understand that changing this perspective may take time.

, It may seem simple, but sometimes all a man is waiting for is to be asked. If there are simple steps to be done in preparing a meal, asking him to do one or two of the steps is an easy way to start your husband's involvement in the kitchen.Remember that asking for his help is an invitation, not a demand. Be friendly and encouraging.
There is usually a certain amount of household entropy that occurs in a home, where a couple or a family get used to having things a certain way. Changing these routines will take time, so keep it simple.

, A common way to get husbands more involved in the kitchen is to trust him with dinner once a week. Plan it around your existing schedules, and it will become part of your weekly routine.Decide ahead of time who's doing the shopping. Planning a meal includes knowing ahead of time what ingredients you'll need, and shopping for them.
Provide lots of praise. The rule is, if he's cooking, you're not allowed to complain. The reverse is also true.

, If you really need your husband to do more cooking, you might need to talk to each other honestly about your household responsibilities. If it seems like both of you work long hours, but only one of you is coming home to spend additional hours cooking, this can develop into a resentment that undermines your marriage.Schedule the talk for a time when you're both relaxed and open. Don't launch into an angry tirade when you're frustrated and overwhelmed.
Prepare to listen to his perspective. Assume that your husband wants to help you, that he's on your side.
Come up with ways that you can work together to make your husband's cooking easier for him. Ordering groceries over the internet, eating off paper plates that don't need washing, using the grill, or something else.

, Some people, both men and women, respond well to competitions. Knowing that he might win something can motivate your husband to try new things, including cooking. Make cooking seem like a sport, and he may be more motivated to spend time in the kitchen.Try holding bake-offs with his male friends, or chili competitions.
Get him interested in watching other cooking competitions on television, such as Top Chef, Chopped, or other reality cooking shows.

Research the meaning of Christmas yourself or with your family.,
Go to the library and find books about the history of Christmas.,
Avoid confusing children with expecting to receive gifts and enjoying the Christmas lights, as if those carry the meaning of Christmas.,
Separate the pagan traditions from the Christian traditions.,
Purchase a Nativity set.,
Play Christmas carols.,
Attend a Christmas Eve service.,
Be part of a Nativity play.",How to Understand the True Meaning of Christmas1," You may decide to use different methods, if you are encouraging your toddlers or parents to participate in learning, than if you would do it for yourself.;
, If you are a book-lover or researcher, then this may give you the background needed to begin your understanding of Christmas. Consider the following research topics when looking into Christmas origins.


When was Jesus Christ born? Most scholars, both Biblical and otherwise, agree that Jesus was not born on December 25th. Rather, this date was chosen because The Church could use, overcome and deemphasizethe winter solstice celebrations that were commonly celebrated at the time. The Roman Catholic church is reported to have chosen this date in the 4th century.
Read about the story of the Nativity. Many books, in addition to the Bible, are written specifically on this subject. They can shed light on the customs and traditions associated with the story of the Nativity.
Study the intersection of Christian stories and pagan celebrations. The winter solstice included many celebrations to pagan gods. The customs of the Roman Festival of Saturnalia may be the common origin of giving presents. The druids brought home mistletoe decorations. St. Nicholas (""Saint Nick""/""Santa Claus"") was a bishop and cardinal who was said to give secret gifts -- and is celebrated in the Netherlands and other countries as the patron saint of children.

, Our constitutional freedoms may not always continue, but our freedom in Christ — including our freedom as we suffer for Christ can. Fear the situation where you’re relying upon civic and government institutions to protect the Christian rights. They will not unless they want to. The job of the Church is to get the Christian story right, which is comprised of Christ-alive, God incarnate (in the flesh), plus transformed, believing individuals.

, You can create a fun game to play with your family, which explains common Christmas traditions and whether they are associated with pagan events or contain Christian messages.
Jesus said, ""Whatever you do to the least of my children you do to me!""

, Many cultures have a rich tradition of collecting figures for the Nativity. This is an especially good way to embrace Christmas with children, because you can study each figure and what it represents.


In Italy, the Nativity scene, or ""presepio"", changes throughout the holiday season. They are set up on December 8th and taken down on the Epiphany, on January 6th. The baby Jesus appears in the Nativity on December 25th, and the wise men move closer and closer to him to illustrate their journey. This is an exciting way to get children to act out the Nativity story.

, Remove the modern versions of Christmas songs and regularly sing ""Angels We Have Heard on High,"" ""Away in a Manger"" and ""The First Noel."" These hymns are uplifting and meaningful, so raising your voice may help you understand the feeling of the season, as well as its deeper significance.

, Midnight Mass, as it's often called, is a service specially made to celebrate Christmas, so it can feel more meaningful and emotional than regular church services. Bring your family, hold candles and discuss what you liked about the special event when you are done.

, Many churches and schools put on these plays, and having a part in one can create a deeper feeling of belonging and understanding.

"
"
Read the history of Christmas and winter solstice as it pertains to your country or religion.,
Volunteer your time to a charity.,
Make a list of things you need to do for Christmas.,
Make new traditions based on your own family and friends.,
Be thankful, just as you are at Thanksgiving.,
Make sure the experiences outweigh the material goods in your holiday schedule.",How to Understand the True Meaning of Christmas2," You do not have to be of the Christian faith to reap meaning from the Christmas season. Learn about the other traditions and their deeper messages.

, So much focus is put on presents, that you can easily lose the true meaning of giving, specifically of yourself and your time, rather than money. Studies have shown that people who volunteer or give to charity during the holidays are happier and more positive, so perhaps the act of doing something will shed more light on the phrase ""goodwill toward men.""


Encourage your children to give time or goods to a charity. Many local charities pick up old toys, winter coats and more to give to children who are in need. Ask them to choose some things to share with someone who may need it more.

, Make note of a lack of traditions or time spent with family. Revise your schedule so that you do something that brings your family closer together every few days, whether it is caroling, driving to look at Christmas lights, baking together or volunteering.

, Decide if the regular traditions, such as giving presents or watching a popular Christmas movie, are your favorite, heart warming experiences, or if you do them just because they are easy. Creating your own recipes for traditions will give deeper meanings to your holiday season.

, Ask your family to make lists of what they love about Christmas, other than the material goods. Read them aloud to give everyone a chance to express their own thankfulness and significance.

, If your schedule is focused on quality time spent with people, you are more likely to feel a deep connection to the holidays, than whether you are short on money and gift ideas. If your family is too involved in materialism at Christmas, suggest a change of gift-giving tradition.


When money is short, psychologists believe that experiences create a more lasting feeling of happiness than buying material goods. Instead of buying each other presents, decide to put holiday money toward a vacation, visit back home or weekend adventure or caroling from door to door, and such. The memories are likely to live longer than the shelf-life of most goods.

Write ""Dear (name)"" as a variation of ""Caro (nome)"".,
Wish them a Merry Christmas.,
Get a bit more personal.,
Close the letter.",How to Write a Christmas Card in Italian," In Italian, the word for ""dear"" is ""caro"", although this word may vary based on gender. As most are in Italian, adjectives will change with gender and plurality.

For more than one person, you might also write ""I miei cari (nome) e (nome)"" (masculine plural) or ""Le mie care (nome) e (nome)"" (feminine plural), for ""my dears (name and (name)"". For both feminine and masculine names, always go with the (otherwise masculine-specific) ""I miei cari"".
E.x. Caro Davide; Cara Marzia; I miei cari Davide e Giuseppe; Le mie care Marzia e Laetitia; I miei cari Davide e Marzia...(David and Marcia will be used for the rest of this guide).;
, There's many different ways to do this. You can just write ""Buon Natale!"" (Merry Christmas!), or even ""Buon Natale e Felice Anno Nuovo"" (Merry Christmas and Happy New Year). To actually wish this, you would put ""ti auguro un"" or ""vi auguro un"" (""I wish you a""; ""ti auguro"" is to one person"" and ""vi auguro"" is to more than one).

E.x. I miei cari Davide e Marzia, vi auguro un Buon Natale e Felice Anno Nuovo!

, You can also wish them a Christmas filled with love and happiness. In English, this seems like a very personal thing to say, but if you're writing this to an Italian, stick it in there. Italian culture is very based around these things (love and happiness), and phrases such as ""I love you"" (Ti amo to a romantic partner or family member; ti voglio bene to a family member) are very loosely used. To say, ""I wish you a Christmas filled with love and happiness"", write ""Ti/vi auguro un Natale pieno di amore e felicità"".

E.x. I miei cari Davide e Marzia, Buon Natale e Felice Anno Nuovo! Vi auguro un Natale pieno di amore e felicità.

, Your note doesn't have to be too sentimental, so steps two and three could be adequate. To write ""Best wishes"", put down ""I migliori auguri"". End with your name and marvel at your completed letter!

E.x. I miei cari Davide e Marzia, Buon Natale e Felice Anno Nuovo! Vi auguro un Natale pieno di amore e felicità. I migliori auguri, (il tuo/la tua nome).

Evaluate your ornament supply.,
Maintain a supply of sturdy empty egg carton containers.,
Lay each ornament in the individual egg compartment before storing ornaments for the year.,
Stack egg cartons along the bottom or top of the ornament storage box.",How to Store Christmas Ornaments in an Empty Egg Carton," Take stock in the number of delicate ornaments you would like to protect as well as the ornament shape and size.


Count the number of ornaments that could fit safely in a dozen egg container.;
, You can stock up on containers throughout the year and just store containers in your Christmas box or a closet. Go for the strong cardboard containers instead of the flimsy Styrofoam holders. You will maintain your ornaments inside the containers so make sure the surrounding material is strong.


Clean inside of containers and make sure all residue is eliminated. Most likely you will only need to brush away any debris inside the carton, however if you experienced an egg debacle, either carefully wash the inside of the carton to remove the matter or discard the carton and use the next one.






Inspect each carton for damage. The idea is to ensure a safe haven for your ornaments so any cracks, rips or tears on the carton should eliminate the carton from being a contender.







, You may also want to wrap each ornament in tissue paper for further protection, but if you are using a sturdy cardboard container your ornament should remain in good shape.


Close the egg carton using the pre-determined ridges once you have filled it with ornaments. If the fit isn’t perfect, consider using tape around the edges or lightly wrap a rubber band around the carton.

, Storage will be easier this way as well because you can stack boxes neatly to avoid having the ornaments rolling around inside.

Clean the house.,
Set up the lights.,
Put up the Tree.,
Put out other decorations.,
Make a Gingerbread house.,
Make cookies.,
Buy presents.,
Put some of the presents under the tree.,
Finished.

",How to Prepare the House for Christmas," The decorations won't look nearly as pretty if they're nestled in with cobwebs. Give the house a deep clean, dust, vacuum, mop, and polish. Do all the laundry, or have everyone do their own if they're old enough. Bring in any potted plants from outside if they won't survive the cold and rake up any leaves left over from fall. If you have children, have them clean their rooms just as thoroughly, telling them that Santa may not come if they don't. You can also use this as a time for them to go through their toys and pick a few to donate to a charity or thrift store. If any toys are broken, throw them out.;
, If you already have lights, use them; if you don't wish to use the existing lights, or you want different lights, go to the store and buy new ones. There are no right or wrong lights, it's just a matter of personal taste. Be sure to buy plenty of light hooks and nails while you are out. If you are buying new lights, understand what you want to do with them first. Are you stringing them up just around the room on the side facing the street? Are you putting stripes across your roof? Know approximately how many feet you want to cover and where before shopping.

, You can buy one at a Christmas tree lot or use an artificial tree if you prefer. Put the lights on the tree first, wrapping them in and out of the branches for a fully ""lit-up"" look. Next comes garland, if you're using it, and then the ornaments. If you like, do the actual decorating as a family, letting everyone put on their favorite ornaments. Put the tree topper on. This could be a star, an angel, or something else entirely. Again, it's a personal choice.

, Do you collect Santa figurines or Nutcracker figures? Do you have a holiday table runner or Christmas throw pillows? Now is the time to set them out!

, You can buy kits to make them or make them from scratch. They don't have to look store bought perfect, just put candy and icing wherever it looks good to you!

, If they're in danger of all being eaten before Santa gets there, tuck a few away or plan on making another batch closer to Christmas Eve. Gingerbread men and Sugar cookies are popular choices. Don't think it's just the children who can decorate cookies!

, Make a list and check it twice, of who you're buying for and what you want to give them. Make sure the cost of each gift will fit into your budget before you do any shopping. Once you're bought the presents, wrap them up! Store bought wrapping paper, newspaper (especially the comics pages), brown paper from grocery bags, and gift bags are all options. Ribbons, raffia, or fabric scraps can be used to top them off. Don't forget the tag saying who it's for!

, If you have children, it's best not to put any presents to them under the tree until closer to Christmas. If you have aunts, uncles, other relatives, friends, or neighbors coming by that you've shopped for, put their gifts under the tree. It makes it look very Christmasy.

Set up a background that shows the nature of the blog. This can display any Christmas-related images, from snow to Christmas trees.
Use the two colors that are most noted to be Christmas colors to write your blog postings(if the page allows this). These ""Christmas colors"" include red and green.

, You can write about stocking stuffer ideas, recipes, Christmas songs/poems, and some Christmas shows you enjoy watching. Review Christmas-inspired movies you've watched either in-theater or outside of the theater. Especially for recipes, take some pictures of the item and post the final item on the blog posting (if the blog allows such items to be posted).

, Talk about times when you've had to try to keep Christ in yourself during Christmastime, or you can describe some experiences with cheap Christmas gifts, or mention putting up decorations either at your home or at a relative's house. You can also talk about your favorite version of the Santa tracker and why you pick one over the other (include any experiences you've had that you wouldn't think anyone else has had and what brought you to begin using that page), along with adding some information about Christmas crafts for the kids who visit your blog too.

,, Because Christmas traditions roll themselves from one year into the next, there's no reason to stop after the Christmas spirit runs out for most people that year. Roll yourself over right back into the next year's postings and continue posting more items of the Christmas spirit.

, This can be especially interesting if you have or have had a less conventional Christmas, perhaps in a hot climate.

, Explain some of the best and worst gifts you've received. Mention other gifts you wished you wouldn't have ever wanted to receive but received them anyway and why you feel those choices were made for you. Explain the basis behind these ideas.

, Use the Share button on the YouTube page with the video, to post the video directly to the service.

, Some countries celebrate Christmas differently than Americans do. Whether it's opening gifts solely on Christmas Eve or opening smaller gifts on each day of the month of December, give the reader some worldwide attention to the Christmas spirit too.

If responsible for hosting Christmas Day for a large group of people and anyone offers to help: TAKE IT!,
Plan your day and prepare as much in advance as possible.,
There is a vast variety of festive paper plates, cups and the like.,
When buying a present that requires assembly make sure you check all the components prior to putting it together, if leaving the assembly to Christmas Eve.,
Choose a theme for presents e.g.,
When giving a gift that has many little pieces, such as Lego or puzzles, to give a container that they can be stored in as well.

,
Buy presents throughout the year to save the end of year rush or lay by big items.,
Remember to buy batteries for any toy which requires batteries and also give some spares.,
Wrap presents as you buy them.,
Spread the Christmas gatherings and visits out, to reduce the rush to see everyone on Christmas day.,
If you have a large family rather than buying everyone a present try drawing names out of hat so each person gets one big present (set a price for each present) rather than lots of smaller ones.

,
Do something for someone who won't be having a special Christmas - place a gift under a wishing tree, have an elderly neighbour over for dinner giving to others is always a good thing.

",How to Survive Christmas as a Busy Mother," Have a list of jobs ready to delegate to each person or if you are having more than the immediate family over for dinner, allocate each family part of the meal to bring. Give them plenty of notice so they can plan what they are going to bring.;
, Buy non-perishable food, decorations etc early, so there is no last minute rush. Have a cold buffet rather than a hot lunch if this will work better for you and lessen your workload.

, Use them to save having to beat the sink half of Christmas day. Aluminum foil trays are also great for baking roasts.

, That way any defects will be picked up before it is too late.

, all the children get puzzles or sporting equipment and all the adults get a book or music gift. This cuts down the number of shops you need to visit to get presents.,, This helps spread the cost. Take advantage of the toy sales that occur in the middle of the year, but where you don’t pick up the gift until Christmas Eve.

, Also have spares on hand for any toys your children may be given.

, Remember to label them too, so that you aren’t doing it all Christmas Eve. Keep a record of what you have wrapped and bought, and where you have hidden it. Keep Christmas present receipts in a separate container so they are easy to access if you need to return something.

, Maybe do Boxing Day with one half of the family and feast on leftovers. Or make a tradition of having a Christmas in July with certain close friends.

If your spouse was unfaithful, you should confirm he or she has ended the affair and intends to avoid all contact with the person.Avoid deciding right away if you are both going to stay in the marriage. Rather than make this big decision up front, agree to work together to try to sort through your issues. This will put less pressure on you both as you work on your relationship and allow you both to try your best to get over the affair.;
, Don’t be afraid to express your hurt feelings to your spouse and be willing to listen to any hurt feelings expressed by your spouse. Often, it can help to process the affair if you acknowledge the infidelity and explain how it has hurt you and your marriage. If your spouse is the one who had the affair, he or she should be willing to listen to your feelings, apologize, and validate your hurt feelings. Expressing your emotions can help you gradually the hurt and pain you are feeling, and begin to move past the affair.When you first discover the affair, or when your spouse confronts you with the affair, it’s important that you do not make any rash decisions. You will likely be very upset and hurt. Avoid letting your emotions dictate your reaction. Try to discuss the affair openly with your partner and focus on expressing how you are feeling, rather than yelling or screaming at each other.

, It can be intense when you discover an affair or admit an affair to your spouse. You may act out of anger or be in shock.

To help keep your marriage together after your spouse discovers your affair or you admit your affair, it’s important to be willing to be transparent and honest. If you discover your spouse is having an affair, think about reasons why he or she may have cheated. Ask your spouse if he or she knows of why he or she had the affair and if certain factors were at play that may have lead to the affair. There are many factors that can contribute to infidelity, some of which have nothing to do with sex. Possible factors include:Sexual attraction to someone other than you, and deciding to act on this feeling rather than suppress it.
Feeling a strong emotional connection to someone.
Confiding marital issues to someone else other than you.
Developing unrealistic fantasies about someone and being blinded by these fantasies.

, Once you have moved past the initial emotional shock of discovering the affair, you should take some time to think about your overall bond with your spouse.

, Every couple will tackle the level of transparency in their relationship differently. Some couples may decide to share their phone messages and be open about where they are going and who they are going out with. Other couples may decide to have in depth conversations at the dinner table about their day and share their experiences that way.The idea is to prevent secrecy and lies from eroding your relationship as you both move forward in your marriage. Being honest and open on a daily basis can help to build up the trust between you again and possibly lead to a stronger marriage than the one you shared before the affair., Forgiving your spouse does not mean you need to forget or disregard the affair. Instead, allow yourself to be open to the idea of forgiving your spouse for the affair, one day.It can take years to truly forgive your spouse but it’s important that you don’t close yourself off to this possibility. Your spouse will need to earn your forgiveness by working with you to build up the trust again between you and to make the marriage sustainable after the affair. This could be through actions, like being open and transparent with you and attending marriage counseling. Or you may need time to rekindle your feelings for your spouse and to grow to forgive him or her once you have gotten over the affair.

, You should both seek help from a licensed therapist who is trained in marital therapy and can help you both work through the infidelity. A good marriage counselor can help you put the affair into perspective, identify any factors that may have contributed to the affair and teach you both how to rebuild your relationship.Your marriage counselor may also give you reading material to study and discuss together at home as you both work towards saving your marriage. It’s important that you show your spouse you are willing to try to make the marriage work by committing to weekly counseling sessions and reading any material given to you by the counselor.

, You may feel that you would like to go to a therapist on your own to work on your issues, especially if you are the spouse who had the affair. Though couples counseling is very beneficial for you and your spouse, going to a therapist on your own can show your spouse that you are willing to also focus on your own issues so they do not hinder the progress you are both making in couples counseling.You may want to consider going to a therapist on your own if you think some of your personal issues may have caused the affair or lead to developing feelings for someone other than your spouse. Working through your issues can help you to better support your spouse as you work together on your marriage.

, Look for a couples support group in your area that focuses on saving a marriage after infidelity. It can be useful to share your experiences with others who are also going through the same issues and problems as you.The support group is usually lead by a certified marriage counselor, who will moderate the support group and help to facilitate discussion between you, your spouse, and other couples."

Take a moment to identify your feelings.,
Find a healthy outlet for your feelings.,
Get the facts straight.,
Find out if your husband intends to stop cheating.,
Avoid blaming.,
Think about how to move forward.,
Suggest couple’s therapy.",How to Stay Calm when Your Husband Is Cheating1," Take a moment to relax before you have a difficult talk with your husband. Give yourself as much time as you need to calm down and emotionally prepare yourself.


Listen to music. Music can significantly alter your mood. Listen to something that you know relaxes you. Listen to that song in the time leading up to a difficult conversation.Do some light exercise. Exercise distracts your mind from whatever is agitating your emotions. You don’t have to work up a sweat to feel the benefits. Try taking a ten to thirty minute walk.Take deep breaths. One way to remain calm is to take slow, deep breaths. Inhale slowly through your nose as you count to five. Hold your breath for seven seconds. Exhale slowly as you count to eight. Repeat up to ten times to feel relaxed.;
, Taking the time to notice how you are feeling and consider what is causing you to feel that way may help you to confront your husband. After you have calmed down, such as by using deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation, ask yourself some questions to identify and understand your feelings.What am I feeling in this moment?
Where in my body do I feel this emotion?
What is the shape of this feeling?
What color is the feeling?

, After you have taken some time to identify your feelings, look for a healthy way to express your feelings. There are many different ways to do this, so choose something that seems like it will work for you. Some things you can try include:


Exercising, such as by taking a walk, going for a bike ride, or taking an aerobics class.
Writing in a journal.
Doing something creative like painting, playing an instrument, or baking a cake.
Talking with a friend about how you are feeling.

, Talk to your husband about the affair. Do your best to calmly find out the general facts about the affair.

Infidelity ranges from a meaningless indiscretion to a means of escape from a troubled marriage.


Ask your husband if he wants to continue your marriage and is committed to making a change that is satisfactory for both of you. For some couples this means that he must stop cheating completely. For others, you may decide to pursue a different type of marital arrangement., It is normal to feel angry and upset. Your goal is to stay calm. Getting into an argument in which you blame each other for your problems will probably not help you stay calm.Both partners should avoid making statements like, “This is all your fault because…” Blame will only make the other person feel guilty, hurt, and more likely to respond with an accusation that ignites an unproductive cycle.Instead, try to keep calm by taking deep breaths and listening to your husband, as challenging as it may be. Use “I” statements that reflect only your own feelings. For example, “I felt really insecure and lonely when you said you were working late all week.”
Be kind to yourself. Even if you aren’t able to keep calm and avoid blaming, there will be more opportunities to talk with your husband. The first conversation is not easy. Couple’s therapy and later discussions will give you a chance to have a calm discussion.

, Evaluate the relationship after the initial shock has worn off. You and your partner will have to decide if and how you want to continue your relationship. This is a big decision to make. It is not recommended that you make such decisions immediately. It may be best to give yourselves a few weeks to think it over and speak with your therapist.


If your relationship had many problems, or if this is not the first time your husband has cheated, this may be something to consider. It might be time to move on.Conversely, infidelity can make a relationship stronger if both partners are committed to the marriage., It is not a good idea to make any big decisions about your marriage right after discovering an affair. You or your husband may not be sure if you want to stay in the relationship. Therapy can be useful in determining the right course of action for both of you.Check with your insurance company to see if they cover couple’s therapy in your area. If so, call some therapists and set up a meeting.
Get in touch with a therapist that you know, or a friend who sees a therapist. You don’t have to see your friend’s therapist, but that therapist may be able to recommend another therapist that suits your needs.

Submit records into evidence.",How to Prove Your Spouse Is Cheating in Court," Hiring an attorney to help you prove adultery in court can be advantageous for a number of reasons, but it can also be a burden. Consider these factors in deciding whether hiring an attorney is the right choice for you:


Foregoing the help of an attorney may be advantageous if your spouse has openly admitted to cheating. In this situation, an attorney may only hinder your ability to talk honestly and openly with your spouse about all of the issues needing to be resolved. You should also be aware that if you do not have an attorney, you will be responsible for providing evidence to the court about your spouse's adulterous behavior.
If you do not have direct evidence of your spouse's infidelity and if you need help drafting and filing legal papers, then you should consider hiring an attorney. If your spouse is contesting your allegations, there may be a fight during divorce proceedings over children, property, and/or money. If this sounds like the divorce you might be going through, an attorney can help you craft legal arguments to ensure you get the fairest distribution of assets possible. An attorney will also be helpful when you do not have the time or expertise necessary to produce credible evidence.;
, If you decide you would like to hire a lawyer, start by researching possible candidates. Follow the steps here to choose the right one.


First, start by asking friends, family, and coworkers for their referrals. A referral can be a great way to obtain a qualified attorney so long as you trust the opinion of the person giving you that referral. If your peers do not know any family law attorneys, look online by using lawyers.com, nolo, or findlaw.All of these websites are great for searching out qualified lawyer candidates.
Second, once you have found a list of candidates, you should contact and set up an initial consultation with them. An initial consultation will help you get a feel for the attorney by meeting him or her in person and being able to ask them questions about themselves and about your case. Be prepared to pay a consultation fee. These often range from as low as $50 to as high as $500.

, Once you have met with your top candidates, you should follow-up with any of them you have more questions for. Once this process is complete, choose the attorney that you are most comfortable with. Look for an attorney with a fair fee, a good track record of handling family law cases, and a good reputation for honesty and integrity.


If you find out through your research and discussions that hiring an attorney will be too expensive for you, you can try finding an attorney that will take your case on a pro bono basis (taking on the work without charge). Try contacting your local or state bar association for help finding an attorney free of charge. In addition, there are many legal aid societies and nonprofits that may be able to assist you.

, Adultery is generally a valid ground for divorce.Therefore, if you believe your spouse has been cheating on you and you want a divorce, you may need to prove adultery in order to finalize your legal proceedings. Also, in many states, if you are filing a no-fault divorce (meaning neither party is taking responsibility for the divorce), you will need to wait for up to one year before you can file divorce papers.However, if you are filing for a fault-based divorce, which would include a divorce based on adultery, you will be able to file immediately., If your spouse commits adultery and you can prove it in court during divorce proceedings, some states will use the information when deciding issues of alimony and property division.In some states, proving your spouse was adulterous will bar that spouse from collecting spousal support all together., Proof of adultery is often hard to come by considering the act's nature of secrecy (i.e., you do not usually commit it out in the open for everyone to see).Also, adultery does not necessarily mean that your spouse had sexual intercourse, it could also mean you were sexually intimate.Therefore, most courts do not require proof of the adulterous act itself. Instead, most courts require you to prove:


First, that your spouse had a disposition to commit adultery.A disposition is a tendency to act in a certain way.In this case, it is a tendency to act in an adulterous manner.
Second, that your spouse had the opportunity to commit adultery.An opportunity to commit adultery is showing that your spouse had the time and ability to commit adultery in any specific situation., If you have direct evidence, which can be eyewitness accounts or photographs of the adulterous act, then you should be able to prove adultery.However, direct evidence is usually hard to come by because the spouse committing adultery is often keeping a low profile and cheating in private.In South Carolina, courts have recognized this difficulty and, like most states, do not require direct evidence in order to establish the charge., In all likelihood, you will have to prove adultery by using circumstantial evidence, which means you will be using certain pieces of evidence to make implications.Your indirect evidence should prove:


Your spouse had the chance to commit adultery, for example being alone with someone else; and
Your spouse had the disposition to commit adultery, which means that given the situation, adultery likely took place., When you get to court, if your spouse has a credible explanation for the acts you are alleging amount to adultery, a court may not side with you.Therefore, before you file a fault-based divorce based on adultery, make sure your spouse does not have another reasonable explanation for the acts you believe amount to adultery.

, If you take actions that can be perceived as condoning the adulterous activity, courts may not allow you to claim adultery as valid ground for divorce.Also, if you and your spouse reconciled after you became aware of the adulterous activity, you may not be able to claim it as valid grounds for divorce.Condonation and/or reconciliation can be in the form of getting back together with your spouse or writing letters of forgiveness., Letters, texts, and emails can be a great way to prove your spouse had an inclination to commit adultery.These things should have information about the adulterous activities your spouse is taking part in. For example, the text could discuss times your spouse was with someone else and a letter from someone else could say they love your spouse and enjoy the time they spend together. These letters should be romantic in nature., If you have proof that your spouse has signed up for online dating sites like Tinder, match.com, or any similar online resource, you should keep that evidence and present it to the court at the appropriate time., If you cannot find evidence yourself but you think your spouse may be committing adultery, you could hire a private investigator to collect evidence for you.A private investigator will attempt to obtain photographs and other evidence of the adultery., In a lot of adulterous situations, friends and family will know something is going on before you do.If you think something is going on, ask your friends and family. Be aware that while friends and family may know something is going on, they might not have any evidence to support their claims. While their information may still be helpful, it would be best if they had evidence to corroborate their claims.

, If your spouse admits to having an affair or being adulterous, you can use that admission to help prove your case. Ideally, this admission would take the form of a text or email, because you will have tangible evidence of the conversation.

, If you are already taking part in court proceedings, you may be able to request bank records, online records, hotel records and other records that may provide proof of adultery.You cannot subpoena records of a party to the divorce, so you should look to subpoena the records directly from a bank or hotel., When you are in court, you will need to prove the adultery by a ""preponderance of the evidence.""This is the type of evidence that tends to prove the matter you are asserting.In general, this means that you must convince the judge that the adultery more likely than not took place (i.e., 51%)., In court, your spouse has the right to not incriminate herself, which means she may not have to testify in court.Also, the court will not infer any bad behavior if your spouse chooses not to testify.Therefore, do not rely on your spouse's potential testimony to prove a case of adultery.

, If you have received help from friends, family, or private investigators, you will want them to testify in open court. When this happens, they will testify to what they themselves saw that made them believe that adultery was occurring.

, Apart from asking people to testify, you can also submit records into evidence. To do so, you will need to follow the rules of evidence in your state. If a piece of evidence is admissible, you will be able to show it to the judge and use it as proof of adultery.

Take the opportunity to refresh your relationship.",How to Rebuild Your Spouse's Trust After an Affair," After betraying your partner's trust, you will add insult to injury by continuing to lie, twist, hide, or deny. Take up the challenge of honesty at all levels. It is the only way to reclaim your own integrity.


Start to think of yourself as someone that your partner should and can trust. Thinking of yourself this way is the first step toward making it happen. Then let them know that you want them to trust you again.
Provide the complete story up front and do so voluntarily. A voluntary confession is a major step in beginning to restore trust. You may not have told the whole story/truth in the beginning, but it is very important to tell everything, even if you held back in the beginning. Your partner knows you and can sense when there is more. She may continue to ask questions or keep bringing the matter up because she is waiting for the rest of it, but feels she can't come right out and ask; It is up to you to tell everything.
Do not omit or hide certain aspects of the truth. This will not protect your partner. In fact, it is impossible to address guilt or solve problems without fully sharing the facts. Even though the truth may hurt your partner in the short run, your honesty will be necessary for long-term reconciliation. As mentioned before, your partner probably already knows you're still holding back. There may be holes in your story that she is having difficulty in understanding and is waiting for you to tell her. It may hurt her, but you MUST tell the truth. If not, this will and most always blows up in the future, and that is much worse.

Always tell the truth moving forward. Additional lying is likely to be detected and will prevent the reconciliation process from moving forward. Your partner may ask questions to verify truths that he or she actually already knows. He or she also may have learned to detect your dishonesty through body language, speech patterns, and other means. Finally, your own lying is likely to cause you and your partner to hold back in the relationship.;
, This person is a part of the problem, even if unwittingly. Their role can't be ignored. If you don't offer closure, there may never be any.


Be brave. Admitting your guilt to the other person may be a small embarrassment—particularly if they did not know you were cheating—but in the long run, it may restore trust in your partner.
Although you should keep in mind the feelings of the other person, don't make the excuse that you don't want to put the other person through the process of ending things, remember that your partner's feelings should be even more important to you.
Consider asking the other person to apologize as well (if the other person knew that you were cheating and was a willing participant). This is particularly important if that person will continue to be a factor in your lives.
If you cheated with a coworker, remember that your day-to-day encounters with him or her may make it very hard for your partner to start to trust again. Get your life priorities straight and do what you need to do.
Show the ""break-up"" message to your partner or let him or her listen as you tell the other person(s). If they never hear or see you tell the other person things are over (or that you had cheated to begin with), they may not believe you. Moreover, it may also help you communicate to your partner that he or she is more important—not other men or women. You cannot underestimate the value of this action.


, It comes from a place of entitlement. Own it as such.


Rebuilding trust is about selflessly doing everything in your power to help your partner feel safe.
Even if your partner is guilty of many mistakes of his or her own in your relationship, don't blame your partner for your cheating. Instead of cheating, you could have dealt with the issues in other, honest ways. While discussing your partner's mistakes, avoid the implication that your cheating or lying was because of these mistakes. It wasn't.
Don't expect sympathy. Your partner may have been unhappy or frustrated with the relationship as well, but instead made a decision not to lie to you, cheat on you or betray you.
Avoid tired, bogus excuses including ""it just happened"", temptation, seduction by someone else, confusion, not realizing that it was happening, not meaning to do it, it was only an emotional and not physical relationship or falling prey to the influence of others. Unless you were coerced, YOU made your own choice, and your partner knows this.
Avoid being defensive. Being defensive will just inflame the situation and prevent you from dealing with your mistake. This is not a time that “the best defense is a good offense.” This is the time to be regretful, remorseful, empathetic, compassionate, honest, and emotionally available.

, It is extremely difficult for a betrayed partner to know that there is another man/woman in the world who may know more personal details about their marriage than they do.


Your partner is going to want lots of details and ask questions about things you may not want to answer, over and over and over again. Too bad. Your partner is going to cross reference your prior stories and ask you to confirm if “this” or “that” was a lie. If you held anything back, beware, because it will come back to bite you!
She/he is struggling with the truth about all those little things that did not add up while you were lying and cheating, and if you allowed them to believe that they were imagining things, picked fights, turned your guilt on them, this is another injury that they will need to heal from. Therefore, asking multiple questions helps the betrayed partner get up to speed, thus obtaining necessary information to deal with feelings of being in the dark while their partner was trying to hide things from them. Many partners deal with these feelings during unable to sleep. Their mind is whirling and trying to put your story together.
Keep in mind that questions about the other man/woman (""Was she pretty/sexy/smart, exciting), may actually represent insecurities caused by the cheating. Although you should not lie about what you liked in the person you cheated with, use these moments as opportunities to reinforce why you like your partner.

, Suspicion and distrust are natural reactions when a person has been cheated on and lied to—after all, the evidence supports a belief that you aren't trustworthy. Trust can be rebuilt, but it does not come quickly, even for kind-hearted people.


Confess, apologize, and vow to remain honest in the future, but do not expect that doing so is enough for everything to return to normal.
Anticipate that your partner will be on a roller coaster of emotions. Mood changes, sleep and appetite disruption, health declines, and sudden tears, anger or withdrawal are natural. They may be alright today but devastated again tomorrow. Be patient as they go through the process. It is a process and it takes time.
Do not dictate the length of time it should take your partner to be “over it”, and don't ask them for a time frame either. Instead, do all that you can and check in with them periodically to find out where they are.
Your relationship with your partner during this time is not necessarily an indicator of how it will be from now on. Your partner's suspicion and distrust can eventually dissipate over time.

, Your partner needs opportunity to work through things with you. At minimum, you need to be emotionally available. However, physical presence can help further, as it will also counteract your partner's feelings that you don't value him or her.


Be there to listen, even though it is you that caused the pain. Otherwise, your partner will have lost one of the most important people in their lives that they turn to for support: you.
Be there to answer questions so that your partner does not have a feeling of hopelessness, to fill in the details correctly rather than let them fill them in incorrectly, and to prevent suspicions that often develop when cheaters are absent.
Be patient. Although it may be difficult repeatedly answering questions and dealing with him/her being suspicious, doing so in the short run will prevent explosions down the road.
Understand that, for a while, when you spend time with other people, your partner may become suspicious. Again, do not dismiss this sort of distrust as paranoia. Instead, work to combat it with openness.
If you can't be with your partner physically, keep your phone on whenever possible so that they have access to you. They may not even need to call or message you, but knowing where you are and that you are available may help them see you in a more positive way. Send text messages of love and that you are thinking of him/her throughout the day.
Proactively ask your partner if he or she is eating, sleeping, etc., and whether he or she is doing okay. This may seem basic, but if your spouse is in a traumatic state, he or she may not be functioning normally and may be too distraught to convey or even meet personal needs. It is, in part, your responsibility to try to predict and account for these needs.
Be available at an appropriate distance even if your partner needs some time alone.
If your partner tries to end the relationship, be very clear that you do not want that, and offer to make any additional changes to support your words with action. Although you may have to respect a break of some kind, if you do not make it clear (respectfully) that you don't want to lose them, they will think that you don't care. This is a message you want to be loud and clear, particularly after cheating.


, When you cheated, you gave someone else attention and value that normally you would reserve for your own partner. As a result, this may make your partner feel that you don't value them, or that they lack things you sought in the person you cheated with. It can also make your partner believe that other people don't realize that you value them. It is up to you to counteract these feelings and convince them that you will not betray them again.


Ask yourself whether you are failing to appreciate your partner. It could be that the things you looked for outside the relationship were actually available all along inside the relationship—and that you just failed to realize that or make it happen.
Make a list of things that are special about your partner. Seek to appreciate them in your own mind and heart. Tell and show appreciation, too. Compliments can help a bruised ego and wounded heart. But better still, give clear, action-based assurance that your partner is valuable to you.
Show them that you love them. Your actions may have caused them to question your love for them. Dedication to this goal is particularly important Immediately following the incident.
Show and tell other people that your partner is important to you. This will not only help you show your partner that you value them, but also help your partner overcome any feelings of humiliation. It may help you feel better about yourself, too.

, The more openness you demonstrate, the less urgency your partner will feel to check in on your activities.


When you are by yourself, your partner may wonder whether you are where you say you are. Ease their insecurities by letting know what you're doing and checking in with messages or quick phone calls when you aren't at home.
Invite your partner places you usually go alone (the gym, out with friends, etc.). Even if they don't take the invitation, the offer will show them that you have nothing to hide.
Keep in mind that your phone, email, voicemail, and even things like bills may feel like sources of secrets and lies to your partner. If you choose to provide voluntary access to these things, your partner may trust you quicker and easier than before. (If you can't do that, then it's fair to question what you are hiding.) Although your partner may never choose to check these things, the simple fact that you made them available could be a huge step in regaining their trust.
Some of these steps may feel like a violation of your privacy. Remember that serious relationships should involve this kind of openness to begin with. Besides, insisting on your right to hide things will just strengthen the distrust you bred in your partner when you cheated.
Don't attempt to spend time with others in secret. It may hurt your partner to know that someone else is worthy of the secret time, and worse, it will promote the sense that you can't be trusted.

,


Remember that just because your partner does not bring up the cheating, it doesn't mean that it's not on their mind constantly. They may not mention it because of the humiliation and embarrassment they feel, for what you did to him/her, or for fear that you may get angry.
Avoid adding additional stress to the relationship, particularly in the weeks just after the cheating comes to light.
Avoid putting your friends or ex's before your partner, spending time with friends or co-workers of the sex you are attracted to, commenting on the attractiveness of other people, or forming new relationships in the weeks after a betrayal. These may add salt to the wounds.
Choose your battles wisely. Keep in mind that now is not necessarily the time to pick fights over certain topics, particularly those related to privacy and possessiveness. You have shaken their feelings of security and trust in the relationship and in the world, and it is openness and understanding that will gain this back, not combativeness and arguments.
Don't give your partner the opportunity to think ""If you could stay up and do all the things with the person you cheated on me with then you can do the same with me.""

,


Be grateful. Your spouse is putting in the effort to remain with you and to repair your relationship after your betrayal. No matter how angry, emotional, petty, or unpredictable they may get, they have shown a great love for you and, in many cases, a great strength of character in choosing to rebuild his/her trust for you again. Give your partner respect and gratitude for this decision.
Your partner may now view you somewhat as a stranger. You may even feel like a stranger to yourself as you reflect on your choices to engage in behaviors that you are not proud of, and your deception and secrecy to hide them. Make the choice to live as the person that you want to be.
It may help to think about starting over, as if it were a new relationship. For example, find new places or activities to share. For some couples, renewal of marriage vows may be a symbolic reset to their relationship. This approach may help you and your partner address the betrayal (and other issues as well); many couples also report that their relationships are subsequently happier and more fulfilling, but this will not happen overnight.
Make sure that he or she and everyone around you (i.e., family, friends, coworkers, children) can see that your partner means the world to you and is (once again) first in your life. Speak highly of your partner in a genuine way, being careful to protect their reputation when you speak to others.
Tell them often that you love them and say it with meaning, from the heart, and while looking them in the eyes. Saying ""I love you SO much"" will have more meaning. But do not smother them; they are still hurting and trying to heal. Give them space, time to heal, time to reflect, time to put your stories together. Your spouse may not say those words back to you, but remember that they are trying to heal. Saying ""I love you"" back may make them feel like they are vulnerable. They feel betrayed and are trying to put up defense mechanisms to protect themselves. YOU cheated. It is your responsibility to take the ""walls of defense"" down; no matter how long it takes.
Appreciate the second chance—both initially and periodically over the next few years. Remembering what happened from time to time not only will solidify the hard work you did with your partner to recover, but will also help you avoid making a bad choice again in the future.
Don't cheat again. Third chances are much rarer than second chances.

, You may feel some resentment toward your partner or that if only he or she was there for you, you wouldn’t have emotionally strayed. Think about any grudges you hold toward your partner or any things that he or she has done that “made you” seek satisfaction elsewhere. In order to move through all the difficulties associated with an affair, learn to forgive your partner. Let go of bitterness and resentment and start valuing the relationship and the role of your partner differently.Releasing your partner allows you to step back from feeling like a victim and reclaim the power you have to not define your life by the ways you’ve been hurt.

, You may feel like you let your partner down and yourself down by having an emotional affair. Feelings of guilt can be helpful, however: they help you realize that this kind of behavior feels bad, and shouldn’t happen again. It’s healthy to feel remorse, yet, it’s unhealthy to ruminate on this feeling. Accept your actions, then take steps to make sure similar situations do not occur in the future., While you may see this person as just a “friend”, realize that if you’ve been secretive and your partner has figured it out, it can be hurtful to feel emotionally abandoned. While you may defend the status of friendship, it’s important to recognize that the situation has hurt your partner and caused him or her to suffer. Admit that the relationship is not harmless and that you have hurt your partner.While it’s easiest to stand up for your own independence and freedom to choose friendships, acknowledge the hurt your partner feels, whether it feels justified to you or not. The more you can put down your defenses and see things through your partner’s eyes, the quicker you can move through this difficult time.

, Ask your partner to confirm that the affair is no longer going on. It may be important to hear your partner acknowledge that he or she is sorry and truly remorseful. If the person is someone your partner works with, discuss what boundaries will be in place at the workplace in order to avoid further hurt and distrust.

, Don’t get caught up in blaming your partner for his or her actions, or for blaming yourself for not being emotionally present for your partner. While you may have regrets as to your part in the relationship while the affair occurred (perhaps being gone frequently or not responding to your partner’s needs for attention), it’s important to acknowledge that it was your partner’s choice to engage in the affair. You are not responsible for your partner’s actions, and there’s no use in blaming yourself.Instead, reflect on what you have learned from this situation and how things will be different in the future.


While it’s perfectly understandable to be angry, mad, and upset with your partner, blame doesn’t help move you forward. Let go of blaming your partner in order to begin moving forward with recovery.

, If your partner was angry or upset, he or she may use cheating as a way of getting revenge.Ask yourself if this was the case, or if your partner genuinely made a mistake and let things go too far. The motivation for intentionally hurting you versus getting caught up in something enjoyable is entirely different.

, While in many ways you may feel like a victim in the situation and that something horrible has happened to you, gently ask yourself if your actions (or lack of) played a role in the emotional affair. Perhaps you have been less attentive to your partner, or dismissive of his or her thoughts or actions. Consider any contributing factors that you may have played a role in, and how they affected your partner. Dare to share some of the blame for not being emotionally available.You may have been spending more time at work or prioritizing hobbies or other friendships, leaving your partner to feel emotionally abandoned.

, Forgiveness doesn’t mean forgetting what happened, or letting your partner off the hook for his or her actions. You may feel like a victim after finding out about the cheating. Forgiveness allows you to reclaim the power over your emotions and the power you may feel was taken from you. Forgiveness serves to validate your own emotions, and then to let them go.Holding on to bitterness, anger, and hurt damages your relationship. It hurts both you and your partner if you withhold forgiveness. In order to fully move forward in your relationship, forgive.

, It’s likely that your partner feels guilty and ashamed about hurting you and letting a situation get out of hand, even if he or she doesn’t show it. While you have every right to feel angry, distrustful, and hurt, remember that your partner feels bad as well. Keep in mind all of the mistakes you have made --both personally and in the relationship-- and have compassion on your partner. Relieve your and your partner’s suffering together by tuning in to your partner in a kind and loving manner.Expressing compassion allows you to feel less vindictive of your partner. Practice the loving-compassion meditation: Get comfortable and calm. Think of someone you love, and say in your head or out loud, “May you be free from this suffering. May you experience joy and happiness.” Notice how it feels to send this blessing. Then, say this to yourself, to someone neutral (like a grocery clerk or neighbor), then to your partner, or someone else you have negative feelings toward. How do you feel sending love and compassion to these people?, While you may want to pretend it never happened, try to understand the roots of the affair. Ask yourself or your partner, “Why did this happen?”; “What does it say about me/my partner?”; “What was the entry point?”; and “How did it go on?” Bringing up these points with yourself and with your partner can help you better understand the situation and the state of your current relationship.Once you have these discussions, you can start to find the holes in your current relationship and begin patching them together.

, Instead of waiting for problems to blow up or get out of control, talk about problems when things are going well.If you feel like there are things in the relationship that are going poorly, bring them up before they get out of hand; don’t wait for them to grow worse.


If changes in emotional or physical closeness occur, bring it up. Say, “I feel like we’re spending less time together, and I’m wondering why that may be.”
If you notice your partner spending more time at work and giving less attention to the relationship, say something.

, Consider telling your partner what feels like cheating to you, and ask your partner the same question, “What feels like cheating to you?”


Consider both physical and emotional aspects of cheating. What kind of touching is too much? What language or communication is excessive? What about if you tell someone else things you don’t tell your partner?

, Couples counseling can be helpful in bringing the two of you together to discuss openly what problems are occurring in the relationship, and what’s missing that the affair fulfilled. Counseling can help you two move into a place of restored respect and growth.For more information, check out How to Choose a Marriage Counselor.

, You may find solace in venting your frustrations with someone, yet be aware that this can be a thin line. When you share intimate details about your life and your relationship with another person, you’re allowing him or her to see your unmet needs, and in a way asking, “Can you meet this need for me in a way this person cannot?”Keep discussions about your relationship to a minimum, and don’t discuss your relationship with someone you feel attraction toward.


Be careful with whom you share information regarding your partner and your relationship. Be respectful of your partner even when you’re venting, and also be respectful of the relationship you are in.

, If you notice yourself experiencing an emotional high when you talk to someone, or can’t wait to talk to this person for the relief that follows your interactions, stop.This can lead to inappropriate relationships. Start to notice the high you feel after talking to someone, anticipating discussions, and saying things that you would not say to your partner.


If you find yourself longing for this kind of friendship while in a relationship, ask yourself, “Is there something missing in my current relationship?”

, Once you start making excuses for yourself and your behavior, it’s time to consider what boundaries you may be approaching or crossing. If you find yourself saying, “She’s just a friend” and justifying things to yourself or your partner, this can be a red flag.After all, you shouldn’t have to justify your friendships to yourself or anyone else.


If you find yourself making excuses for your actions, creating half-truths to yourself or someone else, it’s time to reconsider what’s going on.

You cannot comprehend that your spouse has been physically or emotionally intimate with someone other than yourself; that your spouse was sneaking around and going out of his/her way to make time and seek out this person. And all the while you were oblivious... you begin piecing the puzzle together and you realize that so much of your reality was actually a lie. During this phase, you will probably feel like you're in a dense fog while trying to make sense of what is going on and determine whether or not it is all just some sort of 'bad dream'.;
, You begin to realize that the situation is an actual reality and that it is not just some sort of 'bad dream'. During this phase you may become physically ill and find that you are simply unable to get out of bed, go to work, or interact with others normally in your everyday world. The affair is all you are able to think about. It is not uncommon for you to have episodes of crying, throwing things, breaking objects, screaming, fighting, and generally behaving way out of control.You cannot see past the anger and may choose to express your rage in ways that are dangerous, unhealthy, or even illegal.The desire for revenge. If you start feeling this, this is the point where you are at your most dangerous. If this is an emotion that you experience, be aware that you are not thinking clearly and simply want to enact revenge upon those who you feel have wronged you.

You might begin plotting and planning ways to get back at either the other man/woman, or your spouse.
Thoughts of a revenge affair move to the forefront of your mind and you may begin thinking of who you can sleep with in order to even the score with your spouse.
You might start looking for ways to bring down your spouse's lover by hurting him or her personally, professionally, or financially.


Please remember that this phase will pass, and pure emotional decisions rooted in pain often lead to actions which one later regrets.

, At this point, the initial violent, active rage subsides and you are left with a dull ache and the feeling of being emotionally wiped out. This is typically the time when you either begin entertaining the notion of reconciliation, or begin taking steps to end the marriage.Although deeply hurt, you start thinking more logically and are not as consumed with revenge, but rather you become more interested in taking an assessment of your life, your goals, and where you would like your marriage to go from here. You begin focusing a little less on the other man or woman and more on your spouse, and the mess that they have made in your marriage. During this phase, you are often too tired to fight, cry, or relive the horror 24 hours a day. You begin to desire closure, one way or another.

, If you are planning on, and are able to put your marriage back together, this is the point where you need complete, unwavering, total cooperation from the cheater. He or she needs to know that this is going to be a long and drawn out process which will only be longer if they set up roadblocks to your recovery.


Things the cheater might do to hinder progress include:

Refusing to answer questions regarding things that you have a right to know
Refusing any ""proofs"" that you have a right to ask for
Continued contact with the other man or woman
Minimizing the situation
Minimizing the relationship with the other man or woman
Putting the blame back onto the victim, or
Setting a time limit for when the victim should be ""over it"".


Be aware that doing any or all of these things is detrimental to the recovery of your relationship and make it nearly impossible for true healing to ever take place. If you are not planning to put your marriage back together, then this is the time you need to begin seeking space and time fillers. This does not mean people that you run to on the rebound and then screw up their lives for the sake of your recovery; this means finding activities and interests that you can move to the front of your life in order to fill up the empty space left by the loss of companionship. This will be a lonely time for you, but if you choose to sit around sulking and feeling sorry for yourself, you will remain in this space indefinitely.

, This is a difficult phase, whether you are trying to repair your current relationship, or begin a new one. It is not advisable to begin a new relationship any time soon, however, because you need time to heal and be comfortable being with yourself before bringing another person into your world. If you are trying to rebuild your marriage, learning to trust comes only from seeing a cheater lay all of his or her cards on the table and them making their life an open book. This is an extremely long and slow process which, plain and simply, can only improve with the passage of time. Once enough of your mate's stories check out as true, and when you can feel with complete certainty that he or she is no longer communicating with the other man or woman, then you are on your way to learning to trust again. But, as previously mentioned, if the cheater is not helping you along in the process then it simply will not work. Additionally, if you are dealing with a serial cheater, or one who continues to cheat even though they have vowed fidelity, this process will never end. Therefore, you likely cannot, nor will not, ever rebuild the trust necessary for a healthy marriage.

, Triggers are certain names, places, and events which painfully remind you of the time your spouse was having an affair or relationship. Perhaps it is a certain song that was popular during the time of the affair, a restaurant or motel he or she told you they visited, places they came in contact, people they work with or know, or mutual friends.


Triggers also come in the form of seeing someone who reminds you of the other man or woman, or hearing their name. Often, looking back at old photos will also become a trigger if in the photo you are standing there smiling at the camera blindly unaware that your spouse was sleeping with someone else at that time.
Triggers are all hurtful reminders.
There is really no remedy for triggers or way to avoid them. The only thing to do is to try to keep from obsessing over them and driving yourself crazy about things which you cannot control.

, This is the point when you need to figure out whether or not you will be able to continue in your present relationship. Of course, it will never be the same, and following traumatic events you must learn to settle into a ""new reality"". Consider:


Can you continue to live in this manner? Do you feel comfortable that you will be able to trust your spouse again and not keep beating them over the head every day with questions and comments about the affair? Have they taken responsibility for their actions, put an honest effort into repairing the relationship, vowed not only never to repeat the behavior again, but also to not allow themselves to create or support an environment or relationship where this could happen again in the future? If so, and if you feel that in time the relationship can be fixed, then moving on in your marriage is a realistic goal.
If, on the other hand, your spouse refuses to acknowledge the affair, will not answer questions, behaves suspiciously, and/or continues contact with the other man or woman, you need to ascertain if you can indeed continue to live with this. If not, then reconciliation is not a realistic relationship goal. Only you can do the assessment here: Although input from others might be nice, in the long run you need to take this time to determine what is in your best interests on your own.

, With or without him or her, you will recover and you will be okay. It does take time, but you will emerge from this experience a healthier, stronger, and more aware person. Recognize that you cannot entrust another individual with total responsibility for your happiness. During this process, you should do quite a bit of soul searching in order to discover if there was anything you could have done differently to strengthen the bond in your relationship. Becoming too needy, and overly dependent upon your spouse is never a good thing.


Develop hobbies, friends and interests of your own. This way, if your relationship does not work out, you have cushions to fall back on, and if it does work out, you have still been able to use this experience for personal growth.

, There is a lot to be learned about yourself, your spouse, and your relationship following an affair. Be sure not to overlook the lessons only to stay focused on the pain. Remember: That which does not kill us makes us stronger. (The trick is that you have to let it.)

Determine if your partner has stopped sharing important thoughts.,
Determine if sex has changed.,
Figure out if your partner is pulling away.,
Notice changes in what your partner says to you.,
Watch for gaslighting.",How to Know if Your Partner Is Having an Emotional Affair1," When in an emotional affair, a person may tell someone else their most important thoughts. This may be their hopes and dreams, their fears, or their successes. They share with the other person and not you.Figure out if your partner is sharing things with you like they used to. Ask them questions and see what their responses are, or listen during conversations to what they are saying.
If you hear your spouse sharing important information with someone else that they have not told you about first, then this can be a red flag since it may mean you are not their go-to person for important matters.;
, Though an emotional affair is not physical, the feelings involved in it can cause a physical rift between you and your partner. You may have less sex with your partner than you did before, or the sex may change and become less intimate and more routine.For example, your partner may rush through sex, not hold you, barely look at you, and not stick around afterwards.
Sometimes guilt may cause a person to initiate sex more often, or to lavish you with attention, gifts, or in other ways.

, People in emotional affairs may put distance between themselves and their partners. This occurs because they are worried that they might get caught or say something about the other person. If your partner is pulling away or not talking to you, they may be having an emotional affair.Take a look at what your partner does around you. Do they go to bed early, spend time working at night, or no longer want to do things together?

, When people have emotional affairs, they start talking to the other person instead of you about things. You may start to see differences in what your partner says to you. Maybe they don’t tell you about things you used to talk about often, or you notice they are quieter and share less than they used to.For example, your partner might have told you random things about their day, but now they barely talk about their day. This can be a sign of an emotional affair.
If you find out about things after the fact when you know they are important to your partner may mean they are telling someone else, especially if you know they are close with someone else.
Changes in your partner’s attitude and tone towards you can also indicate a problem. Consider whether they have started reacting to you with irritation or speaking to you in a condescending tone.

, Gaslighting is an abuse tactic where the abuser tries to convince the victim that their version of reality is inaccurate or even crazy.If your partner frequently tells you that your thoughts are incorrect or crazy and attempts to paint a very different picture than what you are observing, then they may be using gaslighting to deceive you.


For example, if you hear your partner share some important information with this person that your partner has not yet confided in you yet, then your partner might try to convince you that they already told you this information. This can leave you questioning your memory, even if you are certain that they never told you.

Look for any secret interactions with another person.,
Decide if your partner is trying to hide their interaction with the person.,
Notice if your partner is dressing differently.,
Pay attention to your intuition.",How to Know if Your Partner Is Having an Emotional Affair2," If your partner is having an emotional affair they may not tell you about all their contact with the other person. They may stop being at home as much because they are meeting with the other person.You may also notice that they talk on the phone, text, or chat online with people and don’t mention it. If asked, they may evade answering by saying they are talking to “no one,” “a friend,” or “a co-worker.”

, If your partner is having an emotional affair, they may start trying to hide their interactions. This might mean they delete call logs or texts, they go somewhere private when they talk on the phone, or they never let you around them and the other person.Your partner may not want you to see how they are with the other person because they act differently.

, Even though emotional affairs are not physical, that doesn’t mean someone in an emotional affair doesn’t want to impress the other person. Often, people in emotional affairs will dress up before seeing the person, wear perfume or cologne, and start changing things to make themselves more attractive.Notice if your partner has changed the way they look recently. This could be due to an emotional affair.
If your partner has started to dress differently to go to work, the gym, or to a business dinner, it could be a sign.

, Often, you know when something isn’t right in your relationship. This may be the case if your partner is having an emotional affair. If you start to notice a difference in the way your partner talks about someone or you feel like the relationship isn’t just friendship, your intuition may be right.If you feel like something is going on, then you want to look for other signs. Don’t go on just your intuition alone, but don’t ignore it either.
Another red flag to watch out for is if you advise your partner to be careful about developing a close friendship with someone else and they laugh at you or get defensive.

"
"
Watch for inappropriate behavior or drastic changes in behavior.,
Notice if your partner’s behavior is different around the other person.,
Listen to what your partner says about the person.",How to Know if Your Partner Is Having an Emotional Affair3," People who enter into emotional affairs sometimes engage in behavior that can be considered problematic or dramatically different from how they usually act. These behaviors can take various forms. Look for anything that is too intimate or personal between your partner and the other person.For example, your partner may text the person often. They may also call the other person. This often happens at night, and may even be done secretly. Look for anything that your partner shouldn’t be doing with someone.
You may also notice changes in your partner’s behavior such as staying up later, going into work earlier, spending more money, or drinking alcohol more often.

, Emotional affairs often give people an outlet to be different or act differently than they do around their partners. If you have contact with your partner and the person you suspect they are having an affair with, watch their interactions. Look for any differences from the way they act with you.For example, your partner may feel emotionally distant from you due to everyday stresses like bills, work, and home responsibilities. With this other person, they may be able to laugh, be relaxed, and be more playful. However, they might also because anxious or uncomfortable when they are around the person in your presence.

, As an emotional affair progresses, your partner may start comparing you to the other person, or they may start to express frustration with things about you that they have never mentioned before.. The comments may be random and not meant maliciously, but they may still point to your partner thinking about the other person.For example, your partner may say, “They think my jokes are funny,” “They like the same kind of movies I like,” or “They can run at the same pace as me.” Start noting if your partner says things like this and how often.

"
"
Talk to your partner.,
Remain calm.,
Evaluate your suspicions.",How to Know if Your Partner Is Having an Emotional Affair4," If you think your partner is having an emotional affair, ask them. See if they get defensive, evade, or get upset. If you don't feel comfortable outright asking, you may choose to instead ask questions about the other person.Try not to accuse your partner of anything. Instead, say, ""I feel you are spending a lot of time with this person. This hurts me because you are my partner, and I feel like we are not as close as we used to be.""

, During this conversation, you should remain calm. You will not get anywhere if you are both angry. If your partner denies or admits the closeness to this other person, don't yell and get upset. Instead, take a deep breath before responding.If your partner denies everything, then take the opportunity to discuss the problem in your relationship, like how you feel emotional distance or feel neglected.

, You may want to figure out why you believe your partner is doing this in the first place. Have they had an emotional or physical affair before? Have other people noticed your partner's behavior? Is this based on your own issues? Determining this can help you figure out how to proceed.


Examine your own feelings. Are you jealous by nature? Are you insecure? Have you been cheated on in the past? These things may make you more sensitive and suspicious.
Talk to your partner about your feelings. Sharing your insecurities or past can help you build a stronger future.
You may also consider talking with a trustworthy friend or family member about your suspicions. Choose someone who you think would give you objective feedback and who your partner would not feel threatened by you confiding in them. Make sure the person is someone who will not tell other people about what you have shared because this may cause your partner to feel betrayed.

Use a new piece of wire to affix the ends of pine cones or berries to the wreath.,
Finished.








",How to Make an Evergreen Wreath," Trim them to about 6 inches (15.24 cm). The greenery you choose is totally your choice. You can even mix!









It takes a whole lot less than you would think. You can make a door wreath with three 3 ft (.9 m) long branches (give or take). Cut the branch ends into 6"" (15 cm) pieces before you start. The only necessity is that you cut them before you use them -- Pine, Ivy, Boxwood, Magnolia leaves, Holly, etc. all work.;
, The embellishments you use to spruce up your wreath can totally change the feel and create a more classic or funky vibe.









There is nothing wrong with a simple green wreath. Attaching a red bow at the bottom is just as festive as spraying it with glitter and going to the nines.

, Get a wire coat hanger and fashion it into a circle. If you're not keen on this idea, you can buy wire frames in different shapes and sizes at your local craft or floral shop.









A single wire frame is good for a thin, delicate wreath. But if you're going for a show-stopper, stick with a double wire frame -- it allows your wreath to be more lush-looking and full.

, Take one end of the wire and twist it around the frame to hook it. No fancy Girl Scout knots needed; just make sure that puppy is gonna stay in place.









Don't cut! You'll be using one long strand of wire this entire time. Don't worry -- it won't be seen through the greenery.

, Place them where the floral wire is attached. Lay a small bunch of your greens on your frame, and wrap your floral wire securely around the stems at least three times. Don't cut the wire yet!








, Take a second bundle and cover the stems of the first bundle with it, at a slight diagonal. Wrap wire around the stems of each bundle and keep on adding same-sized bundles until you've gone full-circle.









Once you have completed the circle, tuck the last bundle under the first bundle. Adjust the greenery and stems as necessary.

, Tuck it under the nearest bundle, secure it with a knot, and cut. Leave a few extra inches before cutting the end. If you'd like to make a hanger, form a loop at the end of the wire and twist it around itself.








, Tie a knot in each piece when you are finished.

Purchase supplies to secure everything.,
Start arranging your decorations.,
Begin securing your decorations.,
Hang your wreath.",How to Make an Ombre Wreath," To create your ombre wreath, you’ll need to start with a basic wreath form. You can purchase these at your local craft store or online, and there are a variety of types to choose from. If you are going to be completely covering your wreath with decorations, you can purchase a cheap, foam wreath.If you aren’t planning on creating the ombre effect on every square inch of the wreath, you can purchase a straw, grapevine, or other wreath that doesn’t need to be fully covered., This is the most important part of your wreath. You can find ombre inspiration on Pinterest or crafting websites. If you know the color or colors you want to use, you can also search Google images for examples, for example “Blue ombre pattern.” By having some inspiration printed out or saved to your phone, it can help you visualize and pick out your wreath decorations once you get to the craft store.


While an ombre is typically different shades of one color, you certainly don’t have to limit yourself to one color for your wreath. You can do multiple colors, transitioning from the darkest shade of one color into the darkest shade of the next, or vice versa.
For more color ideas, grab paint swatches! These little paint charts, which can be found at home improvement stores or online, show different shades of paint in order from darkest to lightest. In other words, they're natural ombre inspiration!

, Once you’ve decided on your ombre color scheme, it’s time to select the items you’ll decorate your wreath with. This is where you can get extremely creative. You can purchase fake flowers and leaves to create a nature-inspired ombre wreath.You can purchase multiple shades of felt to create shapes, yarn to wind around your wreath, bows, or even beading and baubles.If an item works with your color scheme and you can attach it to a wreath somehow, it’s fair game.

, Depending on how you’re decorating your wreath, you’ll need different supplies to secure everything. Pins work well for securing leaves, flowers, and other lightweight, 3D objects.You can also consider hot glue, fabric glue, and so on. You might even need a little bit of everything! You want to make sure that your wreath doesn’t start shedding decorations once it’s hanging.

, First, you might just want to set out your decorations on a flat surface and start playing around with your color transition. Arrange your different items and decorations from light to dark, moving things around until you’re pleased. Then, place everything on the wreath so that it is covered however you prefer. Don’t glue or pin anything to the wreath until you’ve made sure everything is exactly where you want it.


You can create a lot of interest within your wreath by playing around with textures and shapes. For example, if you're using leaves, flowers, and baubles, intermix everything thoroughly (while maintaining your color scheme). It should look like an interesting and diverse blend of decorations!

, Once you’ve determined the layout of all of your decorations, begin securing them. Lift them up one at a time, gluing or pinning them onto the foam or other material as you go. By doing one at a time, you’ll make sure to protect your perfected layout! Take your time, making sure that everything is firmly secured.


It’s particularly important to secure things very well if you plan on hanging your wreath up outside, where it’s subjected to wind.

, Once you’ve secured everything and allowed any glue to dry, you’re ready to hang up your creation! These wreaths look great on the front door, but they can also brighten up any wall inside. If you don’t want to put a nail or hook in the wall, you can suspend your wreath with a ribbon or a suction cup hook. You can also prop your wreath up on shelves or in glass cupboards."

Look for succulents in your yard or at a local nursery and cut them at their stem. You can trim the ends of the plant's branches so that the plant survives, but you still get the materials for your wreath.Look for flowers or other eye-catching portions of the plants you have access to.


If nurseries around you don't have succulents, you can try purchasing one at a hardware or home and gardening store like Lowes or Home Depot.Examples of succulent plants that would be ideal for a wreath include aeoniums, echeverias, crassulas, haworthias, aloes, and kalanchoes.
You can purchase succulent clippings online as well.Succulent plants store their water in their leaves instead of the roots and stem, which typically leads to thicker leaves.;
, Lay out your plants on the floor to ensure that you have enough to cover the surface of your wreath. Configure them visually so you can get an idea of how they will look once attached to your wreath frame.

, Soaking your moss in a bucket of warm water will allow it to become rehydrated. Purchase sphagnum moss at a home and gardening or department store. Sphagnum moss absorbs water like a sponge and can keep your succulent wreath alive by providing water and nutrients to your clippings., You can purchase a wreath frame online or at a department store. If you want, you can also create your own wireframe using a wire coat hanger. Take your soaked sphagnum moss and wrap it around the metal in the wireframe. Squeeze the wet moss in the place to make it adhere. Do this around the entirety of the wreath frame.Wear gloves and clear out a free space when using moss.

, Poke holes around the wreath with a tool that is large enough for your plant's stems. Do this around the wreath in the spots that you want there to be flowers or plants.

, Lay your wreath flat on a table or other surface. Insert your succulent plant clippings into the holes that you made. To hold the plants together in place, you can use bobby pins or wrap thin wire around the plants and the underlying moss., Soak your wreath for 15 minutes once you are done placing your succulents into the moss. This will help saturate the stems of the succulents and extend the life of your wreath., After you clean off your work area, allow your succulent wreath to set for 6 to 8 weeks on a flat, waterproof surface. This will allow the succulent trimmings to grow roots and embed themselves within your moss. During this time, keep your succulents in an area that receives indirect sunlight.Make sure that during this time your wreath is laying out on a flat surface.

, Soaking your wreath in a bucket or in your bathtub is the best way to water your wreath. You have to water your wreath when the sphagnum moss has dried out. Feel the wreath with your hand to determine if it has dried out. In warmer or drier climates, you may have to soak your wreath more often.If you plan on hanging you wreath outdoors pointing south, it's best if you keep the wreath indoors.
Soak the wreath in room temperature water.

, Keeping your wreath in direct sunlight could cause it to dry out quickly and can damage your succulent trimmings.Sunlight is the hardest on the wreath during the middle of the day, so make sure that there is shade on the wreath. On the other hand, not providing adequate sun can cause your succulents to stretch out and look for sunlight, which can make your wreath look overgrown.


Hanging it on a door that has an overhang will give your wreath the shade it needs.

, Succulents can die in the cold weather or stretch out and become overgrown. As an alternative, you can also hang your wreath inside of a greenhouse during the cold seasons., Pruning your succulent wreath is important if you want it to maintain its aesthetic beauty. Trim off the branches of your succulents, leaving about an inch of the branch. Succulents grow very slowly, so pruning will not have to be frequent, especially during the winter when the plants grow slower.You can use pruned flowers or branches to start a new succulent wreath.

, You can hang your wreath virtually anywhere in your house or apartment. Decide on whether you want to hang your wreath inside or outside. Good locations for your wreath include a door, window, a wall, or bannister.Think of the climate before deciding to hang your wreath outside.

, If you are hanging your wreath to a wall or banister, you can use a nail or hook to hang your wreath. Simply embed the nail into a stud and use fishing wire to attach your wreath to the nail or hook using a loop or a knot. If you are drilling into hollow drywall, make sure that it's strong enough to hold up your wreath, or use wall anchors to help the wreath stay on the wall.

, If you don't want to create a hole in your door, you can hang your wreath using a ribbon from the inside of your house. Attach a hook to the inside of your door. Then, measure out a piece of ribbon that can go up and over the top of your door and hang on the other side. Attach the ribbon to the hook and pull the ribbon over the door. Tie the ribbon to the metal frame of the wreath on the other side to finish hanging it.You can also use this method to hang wreaths from windows., Magnetic hooks allow you to hang things from windows. Place one side of the magnet inside and the other side of the magnet outside. Test the strength of the magnet through the glass. If it is sturdy enough to hold the weight of the wreath, use ribbon or fishing like to attach it to the hook.It may be impossible to use magnetic hooks on thicker windows.

Get a 12 to 24-inch (30.48 to 60.96-centimeter) metal floral wreath.,
Cut five, orange pipe cleaners in half so that you end up with ten, 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) mini pipe cleaners.,
Imagine your wreath as a clock, then tie each pipe cleaner to each clock position, except for 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock.,
Gather the end of some orange deco mesh, and place it over the center of the 2 o'clock pipe cleaner.,
Twist the pipe cleaners tightly around the deco mesh to hold it in place.,
Gently pull the deco mesh downward to the 4 o'clock position, and tie it in place.,
Gently pull the deco mesh back up to the 1 o'clock position.,
Continue pulling the deco mesh back and forth across the front of the wreath.,
Finish by pulling the mesh from 10 o'clock down to 8 o'clock.,
Roll a 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) wide strip of burlap ribbon into a tube to make the stem.,

Cut two long pieces of green deco mesh tubing to make the vines.,
Tie the vines around the middle to the back of the stem.,
Gently fluff the deco mesh out.,
Hang the wreath up.",How to Make a Pumpkin Wreath1," If you can't find one, you can also use a grapevine or willow wreath instead.Do not use a Styrofoam wreath, as you won't be able to tie the deco mesh to it very well.;
, It might be a good idea to use a pair of wire cutters for this, so that you don't ruin your scissors. If you cannot find any pipe cleaners, cut some floral wire into ten, 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) long pieces. The orange pipe cleaners will blend in better, however.


You may also find pipe cleaners labeled as ""chenille stems.""

, Most floral wreaths have several ""rows"" or rings; you are only tying the pipe cleaners to the outermost ring. If you are using a different kind of wreath, then tie the pipe cleaners to the outer edge.


You only need to twist the pipe cleaners one of twice to close them.
You want to end up with a pipe cleaner tie in the following clock positions: 1, 2, 4 to 8, and 10 to 12.

, Make sure that the end of the deco mesh is pointing down and not up. You will be pulling the mesh downward, thus hiding this stub.

, Fold the pipe cleaner over to the left, so that it points towards the center of the wreath and out of sight.

, This will cover the 2 o'clock pipe cleaner. Gather up the deco mesh again, and twist the pipe cleaner ties around it to hold it in place. When you are done, fold the pipe cleaner down, and out of sight.Don't pull the deco mesh too hard, or it won't ""puff"" out like a pumpkin.
Do not cut the deco mesh. You will be pulling it back and forth across the top of the wreath in a zigzag pattern.

, This will cover the pipe cleaner ties at the 4 o'clock position.

, At you reach each clock pint, twist the pipe cleaners around the deco mesh, then fold them towards the center of the wreath. Here are the directions you should be weaving in:From 1 o'clock, pull the mesh down to 5 o'clock.
Pull the mesh up from 5 o'clock to 12 o'clock.
Pull the mesh down from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock.
Pull the mesh up from 6 o'clock to 11 o'clock.
Pull the mesh down from 11 o'clock to 7 o'clock.
Pull the mesh up from 7 o'clock to 10 o'clock.

, Fold the deco mesh over the top of the wreath and towards the back. Pull the pipe cleaners to the back of the wreath, and twist the tightly around the deco mesh, tying it firmly in place. Trim off the excess mesh so that you have a 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) long stub.

, Cut a strip of burlap ribbon. It does not need to be very long; about 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) will do. Roll the ribbon into a tube.If you want a neater finish, hot glue the end down. This will create a smoother seam.
You can also use 5½ or 6-inch (13.97 or 15.24-centimeter) wide green deco mesh instead.

, Position the stem so that about an inch (2.54 centimeters) or so is behind the pumpkin. Tie the stem in place using a piece of floral wire. If you have any orange pipe cleaners left over, you can use one of those instead.


If you are using a grapevine or willow wreath, you may be able to just stuff the stem down between the vines., How long you cut the ribbon depends on the side of your pumpkin. If you have a smaller pumpkin, about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) wide, then 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) long strips will do. If you have a larger pumpkin, go for 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) long strips.


You can also use narrow, green deco mesh for this. Choose something that is close to 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) long.

, Stack the two ribbon pieces, one on top of the other, and wrap a piece of floral wire tightly around the middle. Cut a V-shaped notch into each end of the ribbon.


Leave enough wire so that you can tie the leaves to the pumpkin.

, Once you have the leaves secure, gently fan the leaves out. If the ribbon had wire in it, you can shape the leaves by giving them a slight curve.


If your pumpkin is very puffy, you may have to pull the leaves downward in front of the pumpkin so that they are visible., If you can't find any green deco mesh tubing, you can cut long strips of narrow, green deco mesh, and roll them into tubes., Hold the tubes together, then wrap a piece of floral wire about the middle to hold them. Next, tie the tubes to the top of the pumpkin by winding the wire around the stem and the floral wreath.


You can cut the tubes down to different lengths.
If you tug on the tubes, you can make them thinner and longer.
Fold some of the tubes back up to the stem to make a loop, then tie the loops in place.

, This will give body to your pumpkin, and create the creases/ribs that real pumpkins have. At this point, you can also gently shift the leaves and the vines about, so that they lay nicely on top of the pumpkin.

, You can carefully hang the wreath from a nail on your door or wall. If you have a special wreath hanger (the type that goes over the top of your door), you will need to thread some ribbon or string through the top of your metal wreath, and tie it into a loop first. Then, you can use the loop to hang the wreath from your door.

Cut a long piece of green ribbon.,
Hot glue the ribbon a few inches to either side of the stem, then use it to hang your wreath.",How to Make a Pumpkin Wreath2," This will help conceal any gaps that might show up in the end. The best type of paint to use would be acrylic paint. Spray paint will be quicker, but some types of spray paint can dissolve Styrofoam.


Choose a tube-shaped Styrofoam ring, as opposed to one that is flat on the back. It will be easier to wrap the tulle around it.
8 inches (20.32 centimeters) may seem small, but the tulle will make the wreath appear bigger in the end., You will need 1 to 2 spools, depending on how full you want your wreath to be. The more tulle you use, the fuller it will be.


To make the cutting quicker: wrap the tulle around a 14-inch (35.56-centimeter) long piece of cardboard, then snip through each end to create lots of 14-inch (35.56-centimeter) long strips., Wrap the tulle around the wreath form, then tie it in a double-knot. Position the tulle so that the knot and ""fluffy"" ends are on the outside of the ring.


For a fuller, fluffier pumpkin, use two pieces of tulle for each tie., Push the pieces of tulle together as you tie them. This will give you a denser, fuller wreath., To create a simple stem, just cut a brown rectangle. To create a fancier stem, consider giving it bit of a curve, and making it taper outward towards one end.Look at pictures of real pumpkin stems to get ideas.

, Before the glue sets, pull apart some of the tulle wisps to either side of the stem. This will make it more visible.

, If you don't want to buy a whole spool of green tulle, you can use some green, mesh ribbon instead.


For fluffier leaves, use two pieces of tulle instead.
Cut the ends into V-shaped notches to give them some more texture.

, Before the glue sets, spread the green tulle outwards so that it sticks out to either side of the stem., The ribbon needs to be long enough to fit over the top of your stem; this way, you can hang your wreath without the stem getting in the way. You can use plain, green ribbon, or something fancier, such as pompom trim., You can hang this wreath from a nail or from a wreath hanger. Be careful not to get it wet, or the orange paint will run, and ruin your door or wall.

Consider your color scheme.,
Wrap one end of yarn around the paper towel roll.,
Wrap the two rolls together with yarn.,
Tie the rolls together at the center.,
Slip the yarn off the toilet paper rolls and secure the knot.,
Trim and fluff the edges of the yarn to create a pom-pom.,
Make as many pom-poms as you think you will need.,
Paint your Styrofoam wreath.,
Lay the pom-poms along the wreath until you get your desired shape.,
Glue your pom-poms to the wreath.,
Cover up any gaps with additional pom-poms.,
Embellish with a bow, if desired.,
Allow the wreath to dry before displaying.",How to Make a Pom‐Pom Ball Wreath," Before you select your yarn think about whether you want a particular color scheme. If you want to do something like Christmas colors, you could make pom-poms in shades of red, green, silver, and gold. However, there is no strict color scheme for a pom-pom wreath. You can also simply select colors you like that go well together., Once you've chosen your colors, take one ball of yarn. Loop one end around the empty toilet paper roll. Loop it about an inch from one end of the roll. You do not need to tie the yarn in place. Just wrap it loosely around the roll., Place the other roll against the first roll, lengthwise. Loop the yarn around the toilet paper rolls again and again, moving across the rolls. Stop when you're about half an inch from the other end of the roll.Make thick, overlapping loops. You want your pom-pom to look solid when you're done. Go over the same parts of the toilet paper rolls a few times, when necessary, so you can't see any of the cardboard when you're done.

, Cut the yarn from the main ball. Take the other end of yarn. Turn your toilet paper rolls sideways and make a vertical knot at the space where the yarn meets in-between each roll.You should have two toilet paper rolls connected with yarn. There should be a vertical line, made up of the ends of the yarn, separating the yarn wrapping the rolls into two roughly even sides.

, Gently slip your yarn off of the toilet paper rolls. Go slowly to avoid having your yarn come undone. Once the yarn slides off, tie your knot tighter. Then, secure it in place by double knotting.You should now have what looks like a small ball made of yarn, with looped strings of yarn on either end of your knot in the middle.

, Cut through the loops on either end of the ball. You do not want any bits of yarn to still have loops when you're done. Once you've sliced through all the loops, trim the yarn until all the edges are roughly equal.Fluff your ball as necessary to give it an even, pom-pom look.
You should now have a small pom-pom ball that's ready to go on your wreath.

, How many pom-poms you need depends on the size of your wreath. Keep making pom-poms until you have enough for your project.

A 16 inch wreath generally needs around 45 pom-poms., As a Styrofoam wreath has a white color underneath, you want to paint it in case anything shines through. Choose a color paint that matches with the color scheme you're using with your pom-poms. For example, if you're doing a Christmas theme, you could paint your wreath red or green.Use a small paint brush to make small strokes until you've covered the full wreath.
Set the wreath aside to dry before continuing. Drying times will vary. Check your paint's label for precise times.

, Before you glue anything down, experiment with the pom-poms a little. Place them along your wreath in a variety of patterns to find one you like.Some people prefer uniform lines of pom-poms. Other people prefer pom-poms that overlap.
Get a sense of the shape you're trying to create. When you're gluing the pom-poms down, this is something to keep in mind.

, You can now secure your pom-poms one at a time to your wreath. Dab some hot glue onto the spot where you want to place your pom-pom. Gently press your pom-pom in place. Then, glue down the next pom-pom.Make sure you press your pom-pom onto the wreath as soon as applying the glue. You don't want the glue to dry.

, After you've applied one layer of pom-poms, see if there's any more space you have to fill. Some people like filling in the sides of their wreath more, or adding smaller pom-poms in bare sections.You may have to make more pom-poms here, of a smaller size. You can do so by not covering as much of your toilet paper rolls with yarn.

, Once you're satisfied with how your wreath looks, you can add a bow you bought at a craft store. Place it on a portion of the wreath where you feel it would look good and then secure it with glue., Allow the wreath a few hours to dry completely. Once it's dry, you can display it anywhere in your home for a festive Christmas decoration."

Pull on the edges of the cotton balls and roll in your hands.,
Cut the scales from some pine cones.,
Glue some scales to the cotton balls to form an “X”.,
Pull apart one of the grapevine wreaths.,
Place some glue on the bottom of the cotton ball.,
Push the broken pieces of grapevine through the cotton ball.,
Repeat the process with the rest of the cotton balls.,
Weave the stems between the vines in the whole wreath.,
Add glue to the bottom of the cotton stems and reinsert them into the wreath.,
Attach some standalone cotton balls to the wreath.,
Tie a ribbon to the top of the wreath.",How to Make a Cotton Wreath," For the wreath, you’ll need approximately 40 to 50 regular size cotton balls. To make the balls appear more natural, pull on the edges to loosen them up. Next, roll the cotton back into balls in your hands.You can use natural cotton bolls instead of the balls if you prefer. However, they are usually harder to find and more expensive.;
, To help make the wreath look more natural, you’ll need the scales from approximately 3 medium pine cones. Use a pair of scissors or pliers to remove the scales from the pine cones and set aside in a pile.It’s usually easier to start removing the scales from the middle of the pine cone and work your way downward, leaving the smallest scales at the bottom on the cone. Next, finish removing the scales from the middle up.

, After you’ve removed all of the pine cone scales, use a hot glue gun to attach them to the bottom of the cotton balls. Arrange the scales so they form an “X” or “+” shape.While hot glue works best, you can use your favorite craft glue to attach the scales to the cotton balls.

, For the wreath, you’ll need two unadorned grapevine wreaths. Set one aside to serve as the wreath base, but use your hands or a pair of pliers to break off pieces of the second wreath. Gather enough to serve as stems for most of the cotton-balls.You can usually find plain grapevine wreaths at the craft store.
You can substitute twigs for the grapevine wreath pieces if you prefer.

, After you’ve broken off enough grapevine pieces for most of the cotton balls, apply a small amount of hot glue to the bottom of a cotton ball between the pine cone scales. Make sure to work with one cotton ball at a time so the glue doesn’t dry before you finish assembling the cotton stems., Immediately after you apply the glue to the bottom of the cotton ball, take one of the broken pieces of grapevine and stick it through the cotton ball right through the glue. Don’t allow the stem to go all the way through the cotton, though.Allow the cotton stem to cool for at least 5 minutes before arranging the wreath. That will give the glue time to dry so the cotton ball doesn’t fall off as you assemble the wreath.

, After you create the first cotton stem, continue the process with the rest of the cotton balls and grapevine pieces. Make sure that all of the stems have time to dry before you build the wreath., When all of your cotton stems are made and the glue has dried, begin placing them throughout the wreath. Push them through the grapevine so they appear to be woven in.Most grapevine wreaths are woven in a single direction. When you’re adding the stems, make sure that they’re going in the same direction as the wreath.
You can vary the length of the stems throughout the wreath by trimming the ends of the grapevine pieces.

, Once you know where you’re placing the cotton stems, take one out and apply hot glue to the area of the stem where it will be woven into the grapevine. Push it back into the wreath, and hold it for 30 to 60 seconds for the glue to set. Repeat the process with all of the stems., In some areas of the wreath, you may want to place the cotton balls directly on the grapevine without any stems. Add a dab of hot glue to the back of the balls and press them onto the wreath with the pine cone scales facing downward.If your wreath has any broken or damaged areas, use the standalone cotton balls to hide the flaws.
You can thin out pieces of the cotton balls that you’re applying directly to the wreath and wrap them over the grapevine for a more natural look.

, To finish off the wreath, wrap a piece of ribbon at the top so you can hang it. You can tie the ribbon in a bow or use a knot for a simple looking wreath.You can use any type of ribbon that you like, but burlap will give the wreath a charming rustic look.

Choose your pinecones.,
Glue a pony bead to the bottom of each pine cone.,
Bend a wire coat hanger into a circle.,
String the beads onto the hanger.,
Use pliers to twist the hanger back together.,
Spray paint the wreath or add decorations.",How to Make a Pinecone Wreath1," Either gather pinecones from outside or buy a package from a craft store. Short, round pine cones work best for this wreath, but use what is available. You’ll need around 40-60 pinecones, depending on how tightly you bunch them on the hanger.

If you pick up pinecones from outdoors, it’s a good idea to bake them in the oven at 200℉ (93℃) for about 20 minutes. This kills bugs and crystallizes the pine tar, which reduces the mess of the wreath.
Break or cut stems from the bottom of the pinecones.;
, Buy a bag of pony beads that are commonly used for crafts. They can be multicolored, if you intend to spray paint the wreath, or plain white. Use a hot glue gun to attach one bead to the bottom of each pinecone.When you glue the beads, make sure to glue the side of the bead to pinecone so the hole can be strung onto the coat hanger.

, Grab a wire hanger from your closet, or find one at the thrift store. Bend the coat hanger so it forms a circle. You may need to use a pair of pliers to get the shape just right, but it doesn’t have to be a perfect circle.Be sure to untwist the top part, as well, so you can add the pinecones.

, One at a time, stick the end of the hanger through the beads. Bunch the pinecones close together so they form a tight circle and the hanger is not visible. Alternate pinecones toward the center of the hanger and towards the outside of the hanger.How many pinecones you have and the various sizes of them will determine how close they will fit together. Don’t be afraid to cram them a little bit so that the petals hook together.
Fitting the pinecones together so that they begin to look like a uniform wreath is a bit of an artform. Move them around as you go until the wreath looks the way you want it to.

, Once all of the pinecones have been strung onto the hanger, grab the pliers again. Use them to twist the ends of the hanger together as they were in the first place. Make sure the top still forms a hook so you can use it to hang the wreath.

If you don’t want to use the hook of the hanger to hang the wreath, use the pliers to bend it down so it is hidden behind the wreath. Then tie a ribbon or a piece of wire around the wreath to hang it.

, If you want to leave the pinecones with a natural look, you are all done with the wreath. If you want to spruce it up, spray the wreath with silver spray paint. Add holly, ribbons, or other embellishments to finish the wreath off any way you want.Take a red ribbon and spiral it around the entire wreath. Then tie another ribbon in a bow and glue it to the top part of the wreath.
Snip some small sprigs from the pine tree and glue them around the wreath. Add a few flowers like baby's breath or poinsettias.

Select short, round pinecones.,
Paint the foam form with brown metallic paint.,
Remove all of the stems from the pinecones.,
Place a dot of hot glue on the bottom of the pinecone.,
Attach the pinecones around the foam wreath form.,
Add another layer of pinecones.,
Decorate the wreath.",How to Make a Pinecone Wreath2," If you have pine trees nearby, gather four or five dozen round pinecones. Long pinecones can be used, but they don’t fit the wreath shape as well. Look for ones that are not broken and are not totally covered in sap.

For a quicker solution, go to the hobby store and buy some pine cones which are used for crafts.
For pinecones from outdoors, baking them in the oven at 200℉ (93℃) for about 20 minutes kills any bugs they may house and crystallizes the pine tar for a shiny look.

, Buy a circular foam wreath form from the craft store or your local big-box store. Use brown or copper metallic craft paint or spray paint to cover the entire surface of the foam. This keeps the white of the foam from showing through.If you don’t mind seeing the foam, or you want to spray paint the entire wreath after assembly, you don’t have to paint it now.
Be sure to lay down newspaper and spray paint outside to avoid getting paint on anything in your house.

, Sort through the pinecones and look for any that still have small stems attached to the bottom. Break or cut the stems off of the pinecones so that the bottom of the pinecone is mostly flat. This makes it easier to glue them to the wreath form., Plug in your hot glue gun and insert a stick of glue. Give the gun a few minutes to warm up. Be sure to set the gun on a covered surface so you don’t get drops of glue on anything.The exact shape of the bottom of each cone will determine how much glue you need to use. If the bottom is dipped in, place a ring of glue around the dip rather than filling the dip.
If the bottom of the pinecone is slightly pointy, you may need to cut it a bit so that it becomes flat.

, Lay the form flat on the table and glue a ring of pinecones onto it. Then glue some more pinecones more toward the inside of the wreath form, and another ring toward the outside of the form. Place them tightly together and fill any bare spots with extra pinecones.As you go, make sure that each pinecone stays attached. You may need to add more glue or hold the pinecone in place for 5-10 seconds to make sure it sticks.

, If you finish three rows of pinecones but the wreath still seems a little sparse, start gluing more pinecones on top of the first layer. Do this sparingly, only filling in the spots that seem to need more pinecones., Use whatever extras you want to make the wreath all your own. Spray it with white or silver spray paint to give it a shiny, festive look. Add bunches of fake cranberries, sprigs of holly, or pieces of evergreen. Wrap a ribbon in a spiral around the wreath or tie a big bow and glue it to the top.

Use some white paint to put little dots all over the tips of the pinecones to imitate snowfall.
Gather a small assortment of fake flowers and sprinkle them around the wreath. The bright colors of the flowers will provide contrast with the brown of the pinecones.

Find grapevines.,

Shear the grapevines.,
Tie the bundle for transport.,
Loop the vines into a circle.,
Continue twisting the vines.,
Pull the strand through to the inside of the ring.,
Let the wreath dry.,
Decorate the vines.,
Hang the grapevine wreath.",How to Make a Grapevine Wreath," You can buy the grape vines in some craft or floral shops. However, they also grow in many places in the wild. You can get them from an arbor or even from a neighbor who grows grapes.


Sometimes you can find grapevines growing down fences, and some people grow them on a trellis in their yards.You can find the grapevine in some woods and along stone walls and roadsides.
It’s easiest to find grapevines in the end of August and the earliest days of September, although people find the vines from mid-summer through late fall.Many people use these vines to create wreaths for the upcoming holidays. You can also buy them for about $30 in flower shops.;
, Instead of hunting around for them, you could just plant your own. You will also get some actual grapes out of this method!Go to a nursery and purchase the grapevines. You want to choose vigorous 1-year-old plants for planting.Plant in early spring, and erect a trellis to train the vines to grow up.
Soak the roots in water for two hours before planting. Plant in a spot with full sun and about 6 feet apart. Dig a hole that is 2 inches deep and 12 inches wide. Fill the hole with about 4 inches of topsoil. Prune the leaves in the spring before the leaves grow long. Wind and insects will self fertilize the grapevines. Water the plants regularly, especially at their base., Once you’ve located the vines, use a pair of sharp shears to cut them. Then pull them out and away from their growing spot. Gather and untangle the pieces of the vine, and organize them into a bundle.


Remove the dried leaves or fruit that might still hang on the vines. You want to pull out the canes. Try to leave the curling tendrils if you can because it will make your wreath look better.
For a large wreath, you will want about 10 vines, six to eight feet long. For smaller wreaths, use thinner and shorter vines., Some people turn the vines into wreaths immediately after collecting them. That’s because it’s easier to mold them when they aren’t dry.


If you don’t want to do so, loosely wrap the vines in a bundle, and tie them together with tine or string. It will be easier to move the vines this way.
If you wait too long and the vines become brittle, simply soak them in water for a couple of hours, and they should be easier to twist.

, It will be easier to shape the grapevines if you use them right away after collecting them. Basically, taking a few of the thick vine strands, wind them around into a circular shape.


Make the first ring the size you want the wreath to be in the end, perhaps about 30 inches across. The first ring is the most important for this reason.
Start the process by looping the vines into a circle.Hold the thicker end of a strand in one hand, and loop the vine around in a circle as if winding up a garden hose.

, You will continue the process over and over again to continue making the grapevine wreath.


Every time you wrap the vine around the newly formed circle, twist it four or five times around the other pieces that are already in the circle.
Continue the twisting until you reach the end of the vine. Loop the vine around in the circle until you’re about midway through a second circle.

, This will help you to anchor the wreath together. It can sometimes take several attempts to do this.


Once the ring is secure, wrap the vine around the outside. Pull it back through to the inside of the circle in a spiral. Continue spiraling until you get to the end of the vine.
Tuck the loose ends into the body of the wreath. Because the vines are stiff, you probably won’t need to hold the circle together with string or wire. Wind the outer vines around the circle to secure it. Tuck in loose ends.

, Set the wreath somewhere so it will dry. This way it will take and hold its shape. It’s a good idea to store the wreath in a warm, dry place.


The wreath will shrink a little bit as it dries, so make it bigger than you want.Lie it flat, and do not hang it while it is still drying. If you hang the wreath before it dries, the vines might warp and make the wreath look too oval.
It usually only takes a few days to dry a grapevine wreath, as long as there is low humidity. The green grapevines will turn brown as they dry.

, You can leave the vines in a natural state or you can spruce them up with craft items to make them look better.Some possibilities include adding baby’s breath, dried flowers or ribbon. You can add items that will turn the vines into a Christmas or other gift. You could attach the items with a hot glue gun or florist wire. Decorate with plastic berries and bows for the holidays.You can use ornamental birds, silk ribbon ends; the possibilities are endless. Use your own creative spirit and artistic talents when figuring out how to decorate the wreath. Some people spray paint the grapevine wreaths.

, Now that you've finished your project, it's time to hang the wreath. First, choose the spot where you want to hang it. You can hang a grapevine wreath on a door or wall or outside on an arbor.


It's easy to hang the wreath. Simply hook one of the top grapevines on a nail. You could also loop a piece of wire through one of the top vines.
Twist the pieces of wire together, and then hang that onto the nail. You could also use a glue gun to glue a ribbon loop to the top of the wreath.

One full 6' or longer greenery swag
Brown or green pipe cleaners OR light floral wire
One bunch large-headed silk focal flowers selected for the season (Poinsettias for Christmas, Sunflowers for Fall, Pastel Daisies for Spring, etc.)
One bunch silk filler flowers, small-headed clusters, tiny long branches, etc. in colors that complement the focal flowers.
Two 9 foot (2.7 m) rolls of wired ribbon to match the season/holiday.
Hot glue and glue gun
Wire cutters
Wreath hanger
Optional accent items: large bunch of berries, pods, or other unique-looking accent flowers in a deeper accent color; three to five focal accents, pods, tiny flags, iced branches, plastic Easter eggs, Christmas ball/gift picks, birds etc.;
, Cut the individual flower stems from the bunches. Arrange them by variety and length. Plug in the glue gun and fill with hot glue cartridge. Cut the pipe cleaners in half, or cut 6-8 inch lengths of light floral wire -- whichever you have chosen to attach your wreath pieces.

, Wrap it around the base a couple of times. Secure it to the base with 6-8 pipe cleaners or pieces of light floral wire, evenly spaced around the base. This greenery will remain on the wreath throughout all of the seasons and should look thick and full. If you choose to use real greenery, keep in mind that your wreath will last for a few weeks to over a month, and you’ll end up disassembling the wreath to get the old branches off to reuse the base for another holiday., Insert the main focal flowers evenly around your wreath. Wind the stem into the wreath base, using the shortest stems at the top and bottom. The top flower will face forward and stick out about three inches, with each following flower tilting down slightly at an angle and lying closer to the wreath., The flowers and everything else that you place into the wreath should be inserted in a clockwise manner with the heads/faces of the flowers all facing the same direction as they go around. This will make your starting focal area be the top flower.

, Wrap the first 9 foot (2.7 m) section of ribbon loosely around your wreath, looped three times. Leave a long tail hanging on the front of the wreath. Attach it by securing it with pipe cleaners or light wire., Decide whether you want your bow to be on the very bottom of your wreath, or slightly to one side, about 1/3 of the way up from the bottom of one of the sides. This will become your new focal area. Make a large bow with the other 9 foot (2.7 m) piece of ribbon, leaving two 10 or 12 inch (25.4 or 30.5 cm) tails, and secure it with another pipe cleaner. Fluff the bow fully.

, Place the filler flowers around the wreath in the same manner as the focal flowers. It looks best to be symmetrical. For example, you might want to attach one after each focal flower, a little to the left of center of one, then a little to the right of center of the next one. Continue until you've used up most of the flowers. Shorter ones will be attached at the top and bottom, just as before. Allow a couple of the longer stemmed ones to extend past the edges of the wreath a little to give it a designer look. Hot glue two or three pieces of the flowers and some of the individual leaves into the folds of the bow., Place the filler berries, etc. that you chose in the same manner as you did the filler flowers, this time placing them before and to the right and left of your focal flowers. Again a couple can be glued into the bow. Don't forget to make sure a few pieces are sticking out of the outer edges and into the center of the wreath, not just on the flat surface., Make sure that the pipe cleaners that attach the ribbon are covered by flowers. These are called your ""mechanics"" and should be covered with these last pieces of flowers and greenery. Make sure your pipe cleaner ends, etc. are all tucked into the wreath. Don't forget to make sure that everything you put into the wreath is in the clockwise direction. This consistency is what makes your wreath look professional., Hang your wreath if you were working on a flat surface. Step back about 6 feet (1.8 m) and squint your eyes to ""see"" where your ""holes"" are. These are areas that lack color, fullness, or look somehow uneven. Attach your final embellishments, the picks, flags, etc., into the empty areas. Make sure to save one to go into the middle of your bow, you will glue it in and make sure it sticks out about 4 inches (10.2 cm), which will be the farthest thing of all to stick out of your wreath, making it the final focal point. Any small leaves or pieces that you have left can be hot glued into the bow or other areas as desired., Replace the flowers and embellishments, as well as the bows, three to four times a year, as desired. Change it to reflect the closest holiday. Replenish the swag when it starts to look thin.

Cut approximately 100 strips of gingham and other fabric.,
Take a strip of fabric and wrap it around the wreath form, so that the ends are in front.,
Grab another strip of fabric, in another color, and knot it above the last piece.,
Stop knotting when your wreath is completely covered in a thick layer of fluffy fabric ties.,
Trim the fabric carefully with fabric scissors if the strips are too long.

,
Take another piece of fabric and knot it around the top of the wreath.,
Embellish the wreath with Christmas décor, if you desire.,
Try to affix the decoration to the knot of a fabric scrap, rather than the ends.",How to Make a Gingham Christmas Wreath," They are available in wicker, metal or plastic. Choose wicker or metal wreath form that is approximately 1 foot (0.30 m) (30.5 cm) in diameter.


If you are unable to find a wreath form, you can make your own out of strong cardboard. Place the cardboard on a table and trace a circular form into it. Make sure the circle is at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick. Use a box cutter to cut out the outside circle and then cut out the inside circle.;
, Cut them into strips that are approximately 10 inches to 1 foot (0.30 m) (25.4 to 30.5 cm) long. They can be in different widths, because a rag wreath should appear varied in its colors and pattern.


For an even bolder design, choose fabric scraps in complimentary colors of red, green and white. You can take fabric from your own scrap pile or find many different designs at a fabric store.

, You may need to cut more later on, if you want your wreath to look fuller.

, Tie it in a double knot, so that it stays firmly in place. Allow the ends to fall open.

, Push it close to the last knot. Continue adding strips of different fabrics and knotting them close together.


If you are using a metal or wicker wreath frame that has a few different parallel pieces of frame, you can wrap them around different bars to make the wreath full and varied.

, Fluff the ribbons on the front to see how it will look.

,, Tie it in a knot and cut off the ends. Tuck the front part of hanger fabric behind the other cloth knots.

, Attach holly sprigs, fake poinsettia flowers, ornaments, red or green buttons and more with a hot glue gun.

Decide what color theme your wreath is going to have.,
Decide how you'd like to arrange the buttons before proceeding.,
Start gluing the buttons into place.,
Allow to dry completely.",How to Make a Button Wreath," If it's for a special event such as Christmas or the Fourth of July, the colors will be fairly specific. For a birthday wreath or an anniversary, choose the favorite colors of the person being honored. Or have a rainbow colored wreath, either in rainbow order or higgledy-piggledy.


Another approach is to worry less about the colors and more about the button shapes and textures. Work with what the buttons inspire you to do first and then decide whether the colors are working for you.
Great color themes for Christmas: Red and green, just red or green, all white, silvers and golds, etc.
Color theme for a patriotic event: The colors of your country's flag.
Color theme for spring: Pastels are a great choice.
Color theme for fall: Prefer browns, oranges, reds and golds.;
, Map out the design by arranging the buttons in a circle of the same size as the wreath. To do this, draw around the outside and inside rings of the wreath onto brown or white paper. Remove the wreath, then arrange the buttons as you'd like them. Include embellishments if you're using anything other than buttons.


Note that it tends to be easiest and prettiest if you overlap the buttons as part of your design. This covers up the wreath base and looks more filled out when completed. It also means you don't have to be strict about positioning.
Carefully keep this arrangement alongside you as you glue the buttons into place; this will ensure you keep any pattern you've come up with.

, Following the design (or no design if preferred), start gluing the buttons onto the wreath one by one. Remember to add in any embellishments as you go.

, Add a hanger the back of the wreath and place it on display.

Light it up.",How to Make a Christmas Tree Wreath," Manipulate a wire clothes hanger into an evergreen shape. First, bend the free end of the hook on top in towards its base, so that it closes into a loop, which will reduce the chance of your wreath falling from where you hang it. Then, along the bottom, mark a spot roughly two inches (5 cm) inside from each corner. Now:Create two new corners by bending the outside two inches in toward the center of the hanger.
Smooth out the original two corners so that you now have a taller triangle with a narrower bottom.;
, First, select about a half dozen short, healthy branches to attach to your wire frame. Make sure that each is long enough for the needles to cover half of the frame’s bottom, plus one of its sides, as well as the hook on top. Clip the stems from the tree a few inches from where the first needles sprout along the branch.You’re going to be bending these at multiple points, so you want thin, flexible branches, with stems no thicker than a pencil.
If you don’t have live trees to clip branches from, artificial branches are totally fine, as long as they’re flexible.

, Use green floral wire to secure your branches, which will blend in with the needles. Arrange your branches so that their stems line up. Clip a length of wire long enough to wrap around them and twist or tie a knot. Then bunch the stems together and wrap the wire around them, about halfway down from the first needles. Twist the wire tightly or tie a knot to keep them bunched together.


The bare stems will represent the tree’s trunk. If you like, you can tie their bottoms together to replicate a cut tree, or leave the bottom free so they spread out and resemble roots.

, Place your bundled branches face down on your work surface, with the wire’s knot or twist facing up. Keep this side as the wreath’s back, so the knot or twist is out of view. Now clip another length of wire to tie the top of the stems together, just below the first needles.From this point on, make sure all your knots or twists are on the same side of the branches for a more uniform look.

, Lay your hanger across the branches, top to top and bottom to bottom. Line the center of the hanger’s bottom up with the top of the bunched stems. Use another length of wire to secure the two together.From here, you will be bending half the branches one way, and the other half the other way. Because of this, applying hot glue here for a stronger bond is a good idea. You can do the same with later ties if you like.

, First, bunch the three leftmost branches together and bend them to the left, being careful not to break them. Secure them with wire where they meet the bottom left corner of your hanger. Bend them again so they follow the hanger’s left side up toward the hook at its top. Tie them to the frame halfway up and then again at the base of the hook. Then do the same with the three rightmost branches along the frame’s right side.Once you’re done with each side, go back and tie them to the frame again about midway between each previous tie.
This will keep them more secure in case any one tie starts to loosen.
It will also ensure that the wire frame remains hidden throughout the wreath.

, Create a festive look with more elements straight from nature. Adorn your wreath with pine cones, cinnamon sticks and holly leaves (or any other type of leaf that strikes your fancy). Hot glue the backs of each to the front of your wreath wherever you please., To liven your wreath up while sticking to the nature-theme, use small fruits with rinds, like kumquats, to punch it up with color instead. Since these are too heavy for hot glue, loop craft wire over and under each side of your wreath to create a diagonal pattern around the whole frame. Draw the wire tight after each pass, then twist each end tightly around the wreath a few times so it doesn’t loosen. Use straight pins to pierce through the fruit’s rind and hook it behind the craft wire along the front of the wreath.Accent the kumquats by adding a line of cranberry garland along each row’s top or bottom with more straight pins.
Hot gluing the craft wire to your wreath’s frame will add extra support for the fruits’ weight.

, Instead of using natural decorations, go with the Christmas-tree theme instead and hang small man-made ornaments. Hang them from the floral wire that you used to bunch the branches together. Then add more wire as you like so you can hang even more ornaments.


For a rainbow effect, hang warm, primary colors like red and gold on one side. Hang cooler colors, like blue and silver, on the other. Blend the two together where they meet with blended colors, like purple and green.If you’re hanging this outside, be sure to bend your ornaments’ hooks as you hang them so they’re less likely to fall off in windy weather.

, Wrap a short strand of battery-operated Christmas lights along each side of the wreath to complete the Christmas tree effect. Use the wires to hang ornaments. Then hide the wires by wrapping your favorite garland around them.


You can use removable velcro hanging strips to attach the lights’ power pack to the wall or door where the wreath will hide it.

, Before you begin, it's a good idea to think about how your want your finished wreath to look. If it's helpful, you can sketch it out and use the sketch for reference later.








, Dip the entire wreath base in water. You want it to be damp, but not saturated. (If you saturate it with water, it will drip when you hang it.)








, It is much easier to make a hanger for your wreath before you begin to decorate it. It also provides you a visual reference point for the top of the wreath.









Pass a length of florist wire through the center of the wreath base.
Bring the two ends together and twist them several times to secure.
If it is helpful, hang up your wreath while you work. This way you can see what it will look like when it is hung.

, The foliage or leaves will cover the base and serve as a visual backdrop for the flowers.









Leaving the stem on, clip each individual leaf from its branch.
Beginning at the edge of the wreath and working inward, insert the stems of the leaves into the form.
Make sure all the leaves point the same direction, and that you overlap them so that the base does not show through.
Continue inserting the leaves in a clockwise direction until the entire base is covered.
Make sure the leaves slightly overlap the inner and outer edges of the form so they do not show.

, Adding flowers to your wreath is where you can really let your creativity shine.









Clip the stem of your flowers to a length of about 3"". Strip away any leaves toward the bottom of the flower stem.
Insert the flowers into the wreath form according to your sketch or your design concept. Look for places between the leaves to insert the flower stems.

Fill out your bow.,
Make your central loop.,
Fasten your loops together.,
Cut some ribbon.,
Fasten your streamers to your tree.,
Make waves.,
Secure the rest of your streamers in place.",How to Make a Bow for a Christmas Tree Topper," Pull six inches of wired ribbon from your spool and pinch it tightly between the thumb and forefinger of your left hand.Pull some more ribbon from your spool with your right hand and form a loop. Meet your hands together and scrunch the bottom of your loop with the rest of the pinched ribbon between the fingers of your left hand. Twist the pinched ribbon in your left hand to secure the loop.

The size of your loops will depend on the size of your tree. For large trees, your loops should be ten to twelve inches long which means you’ll need to pull at least twenty inches of ribbon to form each loop.Use wired ribbon. Wired ribbon will hold the shape you put it in while other ribbon will go limp.
Most ribbon is one sided. Twist your ribbon so that the decorated side will be on the outside of your next loop.;
, Pull more ribbon from your spool with your right hand. Form a loop that is in the opposite direction from your first loop. Add the bottom of your second loop to the pinched ribbon in our left hand and twist it clockwise to hold it in place. Your first two loops should form the shape of an eight.Make sure your second loop is the same size as the first. You want all your loops to be uniform.
At this point you can hold your loops against your tree to make sure your bow will be the right size for it.

, Continue making alternating loops until you feel like your bow is complete. Ten loops should be adequate for an elaborate bow, but you can make less or more depending on your personal preference.

Remember to pinch and twist the bottom of each loop tightly. You should have the bottoms of all the loops in your bow scrunched up between the thumb and forefinger of your left hand.
The decorated side of the ribbon should be on the outside of each one of your loops.

, After you’ve made all your loops, make one final loop perpendicular to the rest. Pinch the bottom of it in your left hand and twist it just like you’ve done with all the other loops., Mold a piece of floral stem wire into a “u” shape. Insert the loose ends into your central loop and bend them around the bottom part of your bow. Pull the loose ends through the “u” part of the wire. Pull the loose ends in opposite directions to make a tight knot. Twist the ends of the wire several times to make sure they are securely fastened. Take another piece of floral wire and use the same method to fasten your bow to the top of your Christmas tree.

Floral stem wire comes in a green, silver or white. Make sure to pick the best color to match your bow.
The lower the gauge of floral wire, the thicker and less moldable it is. Twenty-six gauge floral stem wire is recommended for fastening bows.

, Measure at least four lengths of wired ribbon and cut them off from your spool. These will be your streamers. Decide which end is the bottom of one streamer and fold the sides in half from the inside. Use scissors to make a diagonal cut at the bottom of your streamers from the outside to the inside. When you unfold your streamer, you should have a nice finish to the bottom of it. Repeat this method with all of your streamers.The length of your streamers depends on the size of your tree. They should be as long as the entire length of your tree.You can make as many streamers as you want, but your tree may look cluttered if there are too many.

, Take a piece of floral stem wire and wrap it around the top of one of your streamers. Make sure it’s secure by pulling the excess wire in opposite directions. Use the excess wire to fasten the streamer to a branch on your Christmas tree under your bow. Twist the floral wire tightly around the tree branch so that it stays in place. Repeat this method to tie the rest of your streamers to the tree.

Make sure you hide the tops of the streamers under your bow. You want it look like your streamers are connected to the bow.

, Give your streamers the illusion of movement by placing a paper towel roll under the ribbon and smoothing the rest of the tail under it. Be sure to use smooth movements when you’re creating your waves. Make as many waves as you feel is necessary in your streamers.

Don’t press or pinch your streamers while you’re making waves. Unnecessary prodding can put unwanted ripples in your streamers that can keep your waves from standing out.
Don’t overdo it. Too many waves can make your streamers look stiff.

, Weave your streamers into your tree. Strategically fold branches around your streamers to hold them in place around your Christmas tree. Try to fold at least three branches around each streamer. Make sure the folds are spread out along the length of the streamers.

Don’t fold too many branches around your streamers or they’ll look cluttered.

Hang your wreath.",How to Make a Boxwood Wreath1," You don't have to be very precise here, but aim to make the pieces between 8 and 10 inches (20.32 and 25.4 centimeters). It would be a good idea to have a few shorter ones and a few longer ones.For a 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) wreath, cut your boxwood into 4 to 6-inch (10.16 to 15.24-centimeter) sprigs.If the boxwood is dirty, rinse it with cool water first, then pat it dry with a paper towel.;
, Choose a place on the outermost edge to start. Insert the end of the boxwood cutting 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) into the wreath. Angle the cutting so that it is flush against the wreath.Your grapevine wreath can be any side you want. The bigger it is, the more boxwood sprigs you will have to use.
If your wreath is thin, make small bundles of 4 to 5 sprigs first. Tie the sprigs together with floral wire, then tie the bundles to the wreath with more floral wire., Fill the outermost edge first, then start on the next row directly above it. Insert each clipping 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters), and angle it so that it is resting against the wreath. Make sure that all of the clippings are pointed in the same direction. Do not cover the back of the wreath.Use the shorter clippings for the inside ring.

, Once you have completed your wreath, go back over it and look for any gaps. If you see any gaps, fill them in with shorter pieces of boxwood. Make sure that no grapevine (except for the back) is showing.If the sprigs won't stick, secure them with a drop of hot glue., Go back over your wreath once again. Adjust the clippings so that they lay nicely. Trim away any that are unruly or that are sticking out too much., Cut a long piece of wide ribbon and thread it through the center of your wreath. Tie the ends together into a tight knot to make a loop.For a nicer touch, consider tying the ends into a fancy bow instead.The hanging loop can be as long or as short as you want it to be.

, Boxwood is pretty durable and it can last a long time. You can help it last even longer by squirting it with water a few times each week."

Plan on using one garland or about four sprays of faux boxwood., Simply pull the stems off of the garland or the spray.If you'd like, you can sort them by size.

, Keep the sprig parallel to the wreath. Place a glob of glue just below the stem, and set the next sprig down. Keep doing this until the outermost edge is covered. Make sure that the sprigs are all pointing in the same direction and that they are overlapping.Your grapevine wreath can be any size. Keep in mind that the bigger the wreath, the more faux boxwood you'll need.

, Make sure that they are all going in the same direction and that they are overlapping. You do not want the bare part of the sprigs to be visible. Save the smaller sprigs for the inner ring. You do not have to cover the back of the wreath.

, Go over your wreath carefully and note any gaps. If you see any, fill them in with extra sprigs of faux boxwood. Once again, you do not need to cover the back.

, Go over your wreath, and pull off any strands left behind by the hot glue. This will give you a neater finish. Consider fluffing the boxwood out. This will give your wreath a fuller, more organic look., Cut a long piece of ribbon. Thread it through the center of your wreath. Tie both ends together into a knot or bow.

, Faux boxwood can last a very long time, but it is still delicate. Keep the wreath away from rain. The rain won't hurt the glue or the boxwood, but it may cause the grapevine to rot.

Book pages, origami paper, tissue paper, and wrapping paper are all great options. Some scrapbooking paper may also work. Avoid using cardstock, as it is too thick.You can use the same color of paper for all of the circles, or experiment with using different colors.For a more interesting ornament, consider using double-sided paper.;
, If you are using double-sided paper, make sure you are folding them all the same way. The pattern on side A should be on the inside, and the pattern on side B should be on the outside.

, Make sure that the creases are all nestled inside each other. If you are using double-sided paper, make sure that the same design is facing upwards.If you are using two or more different colors, start with your first color, then stack the rest in groups of two. For example: Red, green, green, gold, gold, red., If you don't have access to a sewing machine, you can tie thread around the middle, using the crease as a guide. Leave the tail ends long, as you will be using them to make the loop.


Consider using gold or silver thread for this. You will be using the tail ends to make a loop so that you can hang your ornament.

, The loop needs to be big enough to fit over a branch on your Christmas tree. You can also tie the tail ends around a small jump ring, then trim them off; make sure that the jump ring is flush with the top of the stack. This way, you can slip an ornament hook through the jump ring.

, Set the stack down on the table. Place a glue dot along the right edge of the circle, one-third of the way from the top. Place another glue dot one third from the bottom.Use permanent glue dots; the stronger the hold, the better.If you don't have any glue dots, you can use a small dot of liquid glue.Use paper clips to hold the paper together while the glue dries.

, Use the crease you made as a guide. Once you have the paper folded, run your finger along the edges to seal the glue dots.

, This time, place the glue dot right at the halfway point. It should be right between the first two glue dots., Alternate between using two glue dots and one glue dot. When you reach the end, flip the stack over, and do the other side.

, When you get to the end, seal the final two pieces of paper using one or two glue dots (depending which you are on). This pulls the paper into a sphere shape. You may have to slip your finger into the slots to help them open up., If you added a jump ring, slip an ornament hook through the jump ring, then hang the ornament.

Pinch the end of your wire with a pair of round-nose pliers, then twist it until it forms a small loop. Pull the pliers out and set them aside. The loop will keep the bead from sliding off., You can also use a glass or crystal bead for a fancier ornament instead. Set the wire with the bead on it aside when you are done.

, Cut your paper down to 4½ by 10½ inches (11.43 by 26.67 centimeters) first, then use a ruler and pencil to draw vertical lines, spaced ¾ inch (1.91 centimeters) apart. Cut your paper along the lines that you drew. You will need 6 strips.You can also use scrapbooking paper or construction paper.

, A good way to do this would be to set the entire stack down on a piece of foam, then pierce the center and both of the narrow ends with a yarn needle or thumbtack.


If you don't have a yarn needle, you can use your wire instead. You will need to pierce the strips individually, however.

, Fan the strips out evenly, then place a drop of glue on top of the stack, right where the wire is., Take the strip that is on the bottom of the stack, closest to the best. Thread the left end onto the wire, and then the right end. Secure the paper with a drop of glue., Take the second strip of paper, and thread the left end and then the right end onto the wire. Work your way to the top, then seal the last strip with glue., You can squish your papers down as much as you'd like. The more you squish them, the more oval your ornament will be. Use your round-nose pliers to make the loop, and your wire cutters to trim off any excess wire., Tie the ends of the ribbon or twine to make a loop big enough to fit over a branch on your Christmas tree. When you are done, hang your ornament.


Alternatively, you can skip the ribbon/twine, and slip an ornament hook through the wire loop instead.

",How to Make Paper Ornaments3," You can make them all one color, or different colors. You can even use old Christmas cards. One of these circles will be your template., Take one circle, and fold it in half both ways to make an X. Fold three edges towards the middle, each one overlapping the previous one, to make a triangle. Unfold your triangle, and cut off the flaps. Discard the cut-off flaps, and save the triangle., Take your triangle, and set it down in the middle of your first circle, aligning the points with the edges. Fold the edges of the circle over the triangle, make a crease, then pull the triangle out. Do this for all 20 circles, and do not cut the flaps off.Once you have folded all 20 circles, you can discard the triangle.

, Take your first two pieces, and orient them so one is pointing up and the other is pointing down. Glue the flaps together. Glue the remaining 8 pieces in a similar manner to form a rope.If you don't have a hot glue gun, you can use regular glue instead, but you will need to use paper clips to hold the pieces together while they dry.

, Set the ring aside when you are done. This is the middle segment of your ornament.

, Arrange 5 pieces together to form a circle; make sure that they are all pointing upwards. Glue the flaps together, then set the top segment aside. Repeat this step one more time to make the bottom segment.

, Choose a ribbon that matches the colors of your ornament. Make sure that the loop is big enough to fit over a branch on your Christmas tree., Make sure that you are pushing the needle from the inside of the segment. Pull the yarn needle off the loop, and gently tug the loop until the knot is snug against the inside.

, Make sure that you align the flaps. Once the glue dries, your ornament is complete!

",How to Make a Burlap Wreath," You'll need two yards (1.8 meters). Cut it into 8-inch-wide (20cm) strips. Alternatively, you could purchase several rolls of loosely woven garland (at a higher price.);
, These often can be found for a dollar or two at the craft store.

, Weave it through the wires of the wreath base to start your wreath. This serves to hold the end in place while you assemble the rest of the wreath.

,, Fluff it out to the size you want the wreath to be. This is generally a 2-3 inch (5-7.5cm) high loop.

, Repeat back and forth until you completely hide the wire frame. This can be done with as little as 12 ft (3.6 meters) of burlap strip or as much as 36 ft (11 meters), depending on how thick and full you want your wreath to be. The wreath shown used two yards (1.8 meters) of burlap, cut into 8-inch strips.

, This will make space on the frame for more loops and ""puff out"" the wreath some more.
,, You can reuse the base many times so long as you avoid gluing anything to it. Instead, use decorations you can wrap around or wire to the frame so that you can easily replace them from season to season.

,"
"
Start by preparing the elements that will form the basis of the wreath around the oasis ring.,
Place the base wreath elements onto the oasis ring.,
Continue until the entire oasis ring is covered.

,
Using the stub wire, wrap it around the middle of the pine cone and feed it through the teeth of the cone.,
Push the stub wire prongs right through the apple.,
Use scissors to cut the 30cm /12"" lengths of cinnamon sticks into three 10cm / 4"" pieces.,
Wire the cinnamon bundles.,
Arrange the wreath display items.,
Cut 8 stub wires in half and bend them into hairpins.,
Add the ribbon to the wreath.,
Make a loop with the ribbon to secure the wreath to the door.,
Hang your Christmas wreath on the door and have a Merry Christmas.

",How to Create a Christmas Wreath,"


Cut small sprigs of blue pine, removing the bottom 2cm / 1 inch of needles.
You can either trim the needles with scissors or remove them with your fingers.
Cut 30 sprigs of berried ivy.;
, Begin with positioning the berried ivy on top of the oasis ring.


Always dress the oasis ring in the same direction.
This demonstration shows the design going in an anti-clockwise direction. This design gives a sense of movement and makes coverage of the oasis ring easier.
Place sprigs of blue pine both inside and outside the ring. Place the berried ivy on top, and weave blue pine in amongst the ivy.

,, Twist the wires together, leaving two prongs facing outwards that you can stab into the oasis ring.

, Pull both ends of the wire together and twist together 2 or 3 times.


Again leave two prongs to feed into the oasis ring. When pushing in the wire, ensure that half of the apples will show the bottom and the rest will show the top.
Repeat this until all 12 apples are wired.

,


Bundle together three of the short lengths of cinnamon and tie this together with raffia.
Feed the raffia in between the sticks. Wind it around a couple of times to secure the bundle.
Tie the raffia with a double knot. Cut the raffia to 4 cm / 2"" lengths.

, Simply feed one piece of stub wire under the raffia. Ensure that it is positioned at the opposite side to the knot. Twist the wire three times, leaving two prongs sticking out. Cut the wire to 8 cm / 3"" lengths.

, The arrangement will be in four groups consisting of: one cone, three apples and two cinnamon bundles.


First place the pine cones. Be sure to feel that the prongs reach into the polystyrofoam base, otherwise the pine cones may pop out when hung on the door.
Add three apples around the cone and two bundles of cinnamon. The groups should be added to both the top and sides of the oasis ring. Space the groups into 4 sections, evenly placed.
Continue placing these items until all four groups are complete.

, The hairpins will hold the ribbon in place.

, It's recommended to use wired ribbon.


Starting 10cm /4"" from the end of the ribbon, gather the ribbon between the thumb and forefinger and feed a hairpin either side of the ribbon.
Begin weaving the ribbon from inside the ring of the oasis. Loop the ribbon over the oasis and pin it onto the outside of the ring.
Arrange the ribbon where you like it. Allow it to loop and weave through the wreath. Pin it behind an apple here, a cinnamon bundle there, scrunching as you go. The more variety, the more the eye moves over the wreath, giving a rich abundant feeling for Christmas. When you get to the end, cut the ribbon next to the last hairpin.

, Using 2 meters / 2 yards of ribbon, tie a knot around the oasis ring.

, Be very careful, as both your knife/scissors and the sharp edges of the can can be dangerous. Make the cut a bit under the metal top. Even it out the cut with scissors.

, Mark off the bottom of the can with a line, a bit above the bottom metal part. It should loop all around the can, until you complete the circle.

, Use scissors to make multiple diagonal cuts down to the line you drew.

, It should look like a full sun now.

, Use it to roll every strip to a different amount. The strips will curl.

, Cut it out so it fits in the circular ""sun"" center of your ornament, and tape the photo into that space.

Use small amounts of dough as add-ons.,
Score the dough with a needle to create texture contrasts.,
Finished.

",How to Make Christmas Ornaments with Dough," This will give the dough more resiliency as you work with it.;
, Use your hands for best results. Knead dough for approximately 10 minutes.

, Roll out dough until it is approximately 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick. Dough rolled too thickly will take longer to dry and could be doughy even after cooking; dough rolled too thin causes the dried ornaments to break more easily.

, Reindeer, elves, stars, snowflakes, Christmas trees, birds, or angels are all great ideas of ornament shapes.


Alternately, let the kids design their own shapes. These ornaments won't have the clean, articulated lines of a cookie cutter, but they'll be one-of-a-kind, and entirely their own!







, The hole should be at least 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) from the top of the ornament.

,,, Allow ornaments to cool.

, This will prevent staining as you paint the ornaments.

, Decorate until ornaments are satisfactory. Once dry, spray with clear polyurethane on both sides to preserve.


These ornaments are not suitable or safe to eat. Do not attempt to eat them.

, Alternately, use ribbon or thread to hang.

, This will prevent staining as you paint the ornaments., Alternately, use poster or tube paints. Greens, reds, silvers, golds, and deep blues are considered traditional Christmas colors.

, For a gauzier texture, use cotton swabs. Decorate until ornaments are satisfactory.

, Cook for about two minutes at high.

, It should feel like a moderately dampened sponge. If it is already dried out, take ornaments out of the microwave and allow to cool.

, Take ornaments from microwave and allow to cool.

, This will give the ornaments a nice, glossy look.



Note: Do not microwave the ornaments after applying hairspray and /or acrylic finish. These products are flammable and will ignite in your microwave, causing a fire hazard.

,, This will give the ornaments a bit of sparkle by reflecting light.


Cookie sprinkles can be lightly applied and lightly pressed into the dough.







, Lightly wet the yarn before pressing it into ornaments: This will help you control its design as well as keep it from browning in either the oven or the microwave.

, Set small amounts of dough in different colors to be rolled into eyes, mouths, shoes, buttons, etc. Paint a different color for added contrast.

, Use checkered patterns, or score circles or simply squiggly lines.

Cut a pipe cleaner in half.,
Wrap the pipe cleaner around the elf's neck.,
Slip 4 small beads onto each arm.,
Fold the ends of the pipe cleaner to make the ends.,
Make a scarf for the elf, if desired.,
Add a ribbon loop so that you can hang your elf.",How to Make an Elf Ornament1," Trace a 1½-inch (3.91-centimeter) wide semicircle on a sheet of red or green felt. Cut the semicircle out with a pair of scissors. This will make the elf's hat.Red and green are the most popular elf colors. You can use other colors too, however.;
, Fold the semicircle in half widthwise with the straight edges touching. Sew or glue the straight edges together, but leave the tip of the cone open. This will allow you to assemble the elf at the end.


Hot glue will work the best for this.
For a more rustic touch, use embroidery thread in a contrasting color.

, Push the beads onto skewers or toothpicks, then stick the skewers/toothpicks into wads of clay. Paint the beads as desired, then let them dry. You will need 16 small beads for the arms and legs. You will also need a large bead for the body, and a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wooden bead for the head.


Paint the 16 small beads red or green.
Paint the body bead the same color as the small beads.
Paint the head bead a flesh tone that suits you. Don't worry about the face yet.

, This will make the skeleton for your elf. The ends will be visible as feet, so choose the color wisely. A red, green, or black pipe cleaner would work best for this.

, Slip the body bead over the bent part of the pipe cleaner first. Push it down about halfway, then add the head bead. Finally, add the hat. Position the hat over the elf's head.For a final touch, consider threading a mini jingle bell onto the pipe cleaner. Position it right above the hat., Adjust the body, head, and hat on the pipe cleaner so that the bent part is about ¾-inch (1.91-centimeter) long. Use a pencil to pry open the bent part so that you get a small loop.You will be threading a ribbon through this later so that you can hang your elf up.

, You can draw the face using a marker, or you can paint it on using a thin paintbrush and acrylic paint. Keep the face simple. A pair of black dots, a smile, and some rosy cheeks will be plenty.

, Spread apart the loose ends of the pipe cleaner skeleton, just below the body bead, to make a V shape. Slide 4 small beads onto each end, pushing them up against the body bead. These will make the legs., You should have a little bit of pipe cleaner sticking out from each leg. Fold the ends over once or twice to make the feet. Bend the feet so that they are at 90-degree angles to the beads. This will keep the leg beads from falling off.

, Take a new pipe cleaner, and cut it in half. This will make the arms and hands. You can use another red or green pipe cleaner for this. You can also use a flesh-toned pipe cleaner instead if your elf doesn't wear mittens.


Save the other half of the pipe cleaner for a different project.

, Place the mini pipe cleaner behind the elf, between the head and body beads. Make sure that it is centered, then twist both ends around the elf's neck to secure it. Spread the ends out like a T.

, Push the beads onto the pipe cleaner until they bump up against the body of the elf., You can fold the ends over several times to make hands. You can also roll the ends into tight spirals to make ""fists.""

, Cut a ½ by 4-inch (1.27 by 10.16-centimeter) strip out of red or green felt. Cut a small fringe into each end. Cut a small slit into the scarf, 1¾ inches (4.5 centimeters) from one of the ends. Wrap the scarf around the elf's neck. Pass the opposite end through the slit, and tighten it., Cut some thin ribbon, and thread it through the loop at the top of your elf. Tie both ends into a tight knot. You can use any color you want, but red, green, or white would look best.


The thinner the ribbon, the better. About 1/16 and 1/8-inch (0.8 and 3.2-millimeters) wide would be ideal.

Pull the cap off of a clear glass or plastic ornament.,
Pour some floor polish or polycrylic into your ornament.,
Swirl the ornament around to distribute the floor polish or polycrylic.,
Pour the excess liquid back into the container.,
Let the excess liquid drain out if you used polycrylic.,
Pour some glitter into the ornament.,
Plug the ornament and shake it.,
Pour out the excess glitter.,
Let the ornament dry before you put the cap back on.,
Consider adding vinyl lettering.",How to Make Glitter Ornaments1," The ornament can be any shape or size you want, but it needs to be clear. Set the cap aside into a safe place where you won't lose it.;
, Stick a funnel into the neck of the ornament. Pour a little bit of your floor polish into the ornament. If you want to make a half-glitter, half-clear ornament, use only a tiny amount of floor polish or polycrylic; a little bit goes a long way.


Floor polish is the cheapest and easiest option, but the glitter may fall off over time. The ornament also won't be as sparkly as polycrylic.Polycrylic is trickier to use, but it offers a permanent hold and helps bring out the colors of the glitter.Can't find floor polish or polycrylic? Try a decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge.You will have to dilute it with some water to get creamy consistency like half-and-half., You can coat the entire ornament, or you can partway to create a half-glitter, half-clear ornament.If you are creating a full-glitter ornament, make sure that there are no bare patches.

, Use the funnel again, if you need to. If you are doing a half-glitter, half-clear ornament, keep swirling it to distribute the floor polish or polyacrylic. You don't want it to pool at the bottom of your ornament, but if you pour it out, you might get streaks.

, Set the ornament upside down on a sheet of wax paper or aluminum foil. Leave it for 1 to 2 minutes so that the excess liquid can drain out. If you don't do this, the excess polycrylic will drip back into the ornament and pool at the bottom.If you used floor polish, you can skip this and move on to the next step.Be careful if you created a half-glitter, half-clear ornament. The liquid may create streaks on the clear part.

, Wash your old funnel or get out a clean one. Stick it into the neck of the ornament. Pour some glitter into the ornament. Plan on using about a spoonful of glitter. You can use any type of glitter you want, but the extra-fine kind used in scrapbooking will work the best.


Don't have another funnel? Roll some paper into a cone, and stick it into the neck of your ornament instead., Hold the ornament in your palm and cover the opening with your finger. Shake the ornament vigorously to distribute the glitter. If there are too many patches, you may need to add more glitter.

, Turn the ornament upside down over the glitter container. Tap it gently to help knock out the excess glitter.

, It will need at least 6 hours to dry, but it would be better if you left it overnight. Place the ornament upside down into a paper or plastic cup.Once the ornament is dry, you can pop the cap back onto it.

, Use a Silhouette (or similar) machine to cut your initials or a Christmas greeting out of solid colored scrapbooking vinyl. Use transfer paper to transfer the letters to your ornament.


You can use matte, glossy, or metallic scrapbooking vinyl.
If you don't have a Silhouette-type machine, you can use the letters or words out using a craft blade. Be sure to cut through both the paper and vinyl."

Cut your string, and tie it into loops.,
Attach the loops to each pipe cleaner.,
Thread a loop onto a pencil, then dip the pipe cleaner into a jar.,
Place the jars some place where they won't be disturbed, and leave them there overnight.,
Take the icicles off the pencil, and hang them on your tree.",How to Make Icicle Ornaments1," Fill a large pot with 3 cups (700 milliliters) of water. Place it on the stove, and let it come to a boil over medium to medium-high heat., Keep stirring until the Borax dissolves. This can take a few minutes., If you are making several ornaments, you can pour the water into several smaller jars. Keep in mind that your icicles will be a little shorter than the jar, so don't go too small.

, These will eventually become your icicles, so you can make them as long or as short as you want them to be. They need to be short enough so that the ends are at least ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the bottom of the jar when you stick them in.The color of the pipe cleaners may still show through. For best results, use white pipe cleaners. Light blue or silver may also look nice, however.

, Cut as many pieces of string as there are pipe cleaners. Next, tie the ends of each string together to make loops. These will allow you to hang your ornaments. You can use any type of string you want; a good option would be clear thread or fishing line, however.

, Slip the end of a pipe cleaner through a loop, then fold it over so that it hooks onto the loop. Do this for all of the pipe cleaners and loops.

, Place the pencil over the mouth of the jar so that it doesn't fall in. If the pipe cleaner is still too long, take it out of the water and trim down the end; alternatively, you can untie the loop, then retie it shorter. The pipe cleaner needs to be at least ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the bottom of the jar.If you don't have a pencil, you can use other items, such as a spoon, skewer, chopstick, pen, paintbrush, or popsicle stick.
You can put more than one pipe cleaner into a jar, but don't let them touch each other or the walls of the jar.
The fewer pipe cleaners you put into a jar, the more crystals will form.

, Anywhere between 8 and 12 hours should be sufficient., Be careful with these icicles, as they are very fragile!

Add a thin border on each face using acrylic paint. Next, paint a letter on each side. If you need to, use a stencil to make the letters.


Red, yellow, blue, and green are classic alphabet block colors.

, Cut a 1½ by 3-inch (3.81 by 7.62-centimeter) strip out of red or green felt. Cut a 1½-inch (3.81-centimeter) long slit into it to separate the legs. Round the ends of the legs to make the feet.The strip needs to be the same width as your alphabet block. If your block is narrower/wider, cut the strip accordingly.

, Coat the bottom of the block with hot glue. Quickly press it down onto the feet, just above the slit.


For a final touch, consider gluing little pompoms or jingle bells to the ends of the feet.

, Cut a ½ by 4½-inch (1.27 by 11.43-centimeter) strip out of red or green felt. Round the narrow ends to make the hands.If you'd like to, you can cut little notches into the side of each hand to make gloves or mittens.

, Turn the block so that the feet are facing you. Draw a horizontal line of hot glue across the top of the block. Quickly press the arms down into the glue. Make sure that the arms are of equal length on both sides.

, This will make the collar.If you want something fancier, cut a short piece of 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide white lace, and run a straight stitch along the edge. Gather the lace until it coils into a circle, then tie the ends of the thread to hold the collar together.

, Make a large top of glue on top of the arms, right in the middle of the block. Press the center of the white collar into the glue. Don't glue the entire collar down; this will allow it to stick up a little.

, The triangle needs to be wide enough needs wide enough to wrap around the a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wooden bead, plus extra for the seam., Fold the triangle in half lengthwise so that the slanted edges are touching. Secure the edges with hot glue.


For a final touch, consider gluing a mini pompom or a jingle bell to the tip.

, Draw a ring of hot glue inside the rim of the hat. Quickly push the hat on top of the head. You can stick the hat straight down onto the head, or angle it back slightly for a more fashionable touch.


Make sure that the bead's hole is inside the hat.

, Add two small dots for the eyes, and a curve line for a small. Add some rosy cheeks, and a pink or red dot for the nose. You can make the face using acrylic paint and a thin paintbrush, or you can draw it on using permanent markers.

, Coat the bottom of the bead with hot glue. Press it down onto the center of the collar. Hold it until the glue sets.

, Cut a short piece of 1/16 to 1/8-inch (0.8 and 3.2-millimeters) wide ribbon. Thread the ribbon onto a tapestry needle. Push the needle through the tip of the hat, and pull the ribbon through. Tie the ends of the ribbon together to make a loop.

Wrap the scarf around the elf's neck.,
Cut two mitten shapes out of felt.,
Glue the mittens to the sides of the pinecone.,
Add a loop so that you can hang the elf.",How to Make an Elf Ornament3," You will be hanging this on your tree, so the smaller the pinecone, the better. Look for something that is between 1 and 2 inches (2.54 and 5.08 centimeters) tall.


You can leave the pinecone bare for a rustic look, or you can spray paint it first.
Wash the pinecone to get rid of any dirt. Let it dry completely.
Consider using a scented pinecone from the store.

, How big the bead is depends on how big the pinecone is. It needs to be small enough to sit on top of the pinecone. It should also look proportionate to it.


Consider painting the bead a flesh tone that suits you.

, If you need to, break off the very tip of the pinecone so that the head can sit nicely on top of it. Make sure that the bead's hole it pointing up.


Don't worry about the elf's face just yet. You will be adding that later.

, This will eventually make the feet.The heart needs to be about the same width as the pinecone. You can make the feet any color you want. Red and green are the most popular colors, but pastel colors lend this project a rustic charm.

, Cover the bottom half of the heart with hot glue. Position the pinecone over the heart, making sure that the top part is sticking out—like feet. Press the pinecone into the glue, and let the glue set.

, The triangle needs to be wide enough to wrap around the bead you are using for the head, plus extra for a seam. This will make the hat, so you can use any color you want. It can match the feet, or it can be a contrasting color.

, Fold the triangle in half lengthwise so that slanted edges touch. Stitch them together using a blanket stitch and thread in a contrasting color. Don't turn the hat inside out. The stitching is part of the design.If you can't sew, use hot glue instead.

, Draw a ring of hot glue inside the rim of the hat. Quickly push the hat down onto the elf's head. You can position it right on top of the head, or you can angle it back slightly.


For a final touch, consider gluing a small pompom or jingle bell to the tip of the hat.

, Use two small black dots for the eyes, and a red dot for the mouth. You can use the face using acrylic paint and a thin paintbrush or a permanent marker., If you'd like, you can cut a small fringe to each end of the scarf. You can make the scarf any color you want, but your elf might look better if the scarf matches the hat or feet.

, Tie the scarf in place so that it doesn't fall off. For a more fashionable touch, position the knotted part of the scarf off to the side rather than under the elf's ""chin.""

, Start with a heart, then cut one side smaller/shorter than the other. Cut the bottom/pointed part of the heart into a straight edge. You can match the color to the scarf, hat, or feet., Place them more towards the front, and at slight angles. Point the rounded part of the mittens towards the feet, and straight part towards the scarf.

, Cut a short piece of thin ribbon and thread it onto a tapestry needle. Thread the needle through the top of the hat. Remove the needle, and tie the ends of the ribbon into a loop.


The thinner the ribbon, the better. About 1/16 and 1/8-inch (0.8 and 3.2-millimeters) wide would be ideal.
For best results, match the ribbon color to the elf's hat, scarf, mittens, or feet.

Get some glass or plastic ornaments.,
Wipe the ornaments clean.,
Block off the areas you don't want glittered with painter's tape.You can create stripes, zigzags, or other geometric shapes.,
Coat the areas you want glittered with a decoupage glue.,
Shake on some glitter.,
Gently tap off the excess.,
Add more glue and glitter, if needed.,
Remove the painter's tape or stencils, if you used any.,
Hang the ornament until it dries.,
Seal the glittered designs, if desired.,
Let the sealer dry before using your ornament.",How to Make Glitter Ornaments2," Clear ornaments will work best for this project, but you can also use clear iridescent ones, shiny metallic ones, or frosted-pearl ones.

, This is especially important if you are using old ornaments. Once you clean them, try to handle them only by the metal cap. Any dirt or fingerprints may prevent the glitter from sticking.

, If the tape is too thick to work with, cut it in half using a sharp pair of scissors.


If you wish to make polka dots, you can skip this step.
If you want to make more intricate shapes, use self-adhesive stencils.

, Handle the ornament by the cap so that you don't accidentally mess up your design. If your ornament is very large, it might be a good idea to work on a small area first so that the glue doesn't dry out.


If you wish to make polka dots, use a round foam brush or pouncer to dab the glue onto the ornament.
If you wish to use more than one color of glitter, apply the glue to the areas where you want your first color.

, Hold the ornament over a paper plate or sheet of paper. Shake some glitter onto the ornament, rotating it will you do. You can use any type of glitter you want for this, but extra-find glitter, like the kind used in scrapbooking, would work best.


If you plan on using multiple colors of glitter, shake on your first color and hold off on the others for now.
Scoop the glitter back into its container when you are done so that you don't waste any. If you are using a sheet of paper, fold the paper in half, and funnel it back inside.

, Shake the ornament over your plate or paper to knock off any excess glitter. This will help give you crisper lines and reduce shedding.

, If you need to cover more of your ornament, or if you need to add more colors, now is the time to apply more glue and more glitter. Keep repeating these steps, one color at a time, until the ornament is covered to your liking.

, Be sure to lift these straight up and away from the ornament, or you will risk messing up your design. If some of the lines got messed up, you can nudge the glitter back into place with a toothpick, or gently brush it away with a soft-bristled paintbrush.

, You can hang the ornament from your tree, a dowel, or a piece of string. Make sure that there's nothing close by that can bump into it and mess up the glitter. The ornament will require a few hours to dry.

, This is not completely necessary, but it will help protect your design. Use a paintbrush to paint clear, glossy sealer onto your designs. Extend the sealer just past the outlines of your designs—enough to seal them in but not so much to make it obvious. This is great for all ornaments, including matte ones!


Make sure that the sealer you are using has a glossy finish, or the glitter will turn out dull.
If you used a clear ornament, you can spray your entire ornament with a clear, glossy, acrylic sealer.Do not use this on matte ornaments.

, If you'd like to, you can tie a skinny ribbon in a bow around the cap, or you can add extras into the ornament itself, such as curled strips of sheet music or fake snow."

Clean the bottle and remove the label.,
Cut the top and bottom off of the bottle.,
Cut the bottle, lengthwise, into thin strips.,
Hold the plastic strip by each end, then hold it over a lighted candle.,
Move the strip across the flame, twisting it while doing so.,
Pull the icicle straight once you get to the other end, and wait until it cools.,
Poke a hole through the top/flat part of the icicle with a heated needle or nail.,
Pull some thread through the hole, then tie the ends into a loop.",How to Make Icicle Ornaments2," For best results, use a clear bottle. A translucent blue bottle may also work. Don't worry if the bottle has any bumps or ribs. Make sure that there is no paper or glue residue left on the bottle, however.

, Don't worry about being too neat here; you will fix any jaggedness in the following step.

, Taper the strips slightly so that they are flat at one end, and pointy at the other, just like real icicles. They should be no wider than 1 to 1½ centimeters (2.54 to 3.81 inch) at the widest point., Hold the strip close enough so that it heats up, but not so close that it starts to melt or burn. Keep the tapered/pointed part of the strip closest to the flame.Use a short, stubby pillar candle instead of a long candlestick. It will be less likely to tip over.

, Pull gently on the ends so that they don't warp or bend. You want the icicle and coil, but you don't want it to curve or bend., You should now have a coiled strip of plastic. Don't get disappointed if your first one doesn't turn out perfect; some people need a few tries to get it right., Hold a needle or nail over a candle flame until it gets hot, then use it to poke a hole through the top part of your icicle. Wait for the plastic to cool before moving on., You can use any color you want, but white, silver, or clear thread would look the best. If you'd like to make a garland instead, make several icicles, then thread them onto a long piece of string instead.

Spread some parchment paper over your work surface.If you don't have any parchment paper, you can use wax paper instead, but be sure to spread a thin layer of dish soap over it.,
Insert a hot glue stick into your hot glue gun, and let it heat up.,
Draw straight lines on your parchment paper.,
Consider shaking some glitter onto your icicles.Do it quickly, or the glue will set, and the glitter won't stick.,
Wait 2 to 3 minutes for the hot glue to cool.,
Carefully peel the icicles away from the parchment paper.,
Tie some thread into a loop, then hot glue it to the top of each icicle.",How to Make Icicle Ornaments3," Wax paper is a little different than parchment paper, and if you don't lubricate it with dish soap, the icicles will stick., You can use ordinary, clear hot glue sticks, or you can use the glittery kind. Silver, gold, or iridescent would all work well for icicles., If you'd like, you can vary the pressure on your hot glue gun while squeezing it to create lumps. You can also go back, and make the top part of each icicle thicker.

, White or iridescent glitter would work the best, but silver or gold would look nice too. If you used glittery hot glue sticks, then you can skip this step since they are already sparkly.

, If you used plain hot glue, you may notice it turning slightly foggy, which is normal.If the glue is taking too long to set, stick the parchment paper into the fridge or freezer for a few minutes.

, Hot glue sometimes leaves behind ""whiskers"" or threads, which can make your icicles look messy. If you got any of those, carefully peel them away.


At this point, you can flip the icicles over, and draw some glue on the back to make them more dimensional.

, If you have a very sharp needle, you can thread the needle, then pull the needle through the top of each icicle instead.


Clear thread will work best for this.

Purchase a box of transparent tree ornament bulbs.,
Select a variety of colored glitter.,
Gather some floor wax from your household supply cabinet.,
Squirt floor wax into the ornament.,
Swirl the floor wax around the inside of the ornament.,
Pour glitter into the bulb using a plastic funnel or paper cone.,
Coat the interior with glitter and shake out any excess.,
Replace the ornament lids.,
Insert the pins through the holes in the lid.",How to Make Filled Glass or Plastic Ornaments1," While you might think of the traditional tree ornament as spherical and glass, you can use plastic orbs instead for a safer option. You can also use an oval or elongated shape of bulb if you prefer. The only crucial characteristic of the bulb is that it be clear so that you can see the decorative filling within.


Most hobby or art supply stores such as Michael’s or Blick offer a variety of clear ornaments, or you can find a wide selection through online retailers such as Amazon or eBay.
If you’re using some old bulbs you’ve had lying around in the crafts closet for a while, be sure to clean them first using rubbing alcohol or an all-purpose cleaning spray.;
, Depending on what aesthetic you’re planning for your Christmas tree, you might want to pick out several bags of different colored glitter so that each bulb can be a different color, or you might want to use pre-mixed, rainbow glitter. You can even find solid white or black varieties for an edgy, non-traditional look.

, It might seem odd, but one of the most important ingredients in this lovely trinket is run-of-the-mill floor wax. You won’t need much of it, but it’s essential for getting the glitter to stick to the inside walls of the orb.


If you don’t already have some floor wax at home, buy some at your local grocery store or through an online supplier. Some brands that hobby enthusiasts recommend include Pledge and Future Floor Wax., Unscrewing the top of the ornament and holding the orb securely in one hand, pour a small amount of floor wax into the opening at the top of the ornament. You need just enough to coat the interior walls of the ornament, so a couple of teaspoons should be sufficient for each bulb.Be sure to place the lids in an old tin or rubber container where you won’t lose them.

, As you’re holding the ornament, gently swirl it in a circular motion so that the wax climbs the interior walls and covers all of the surface area. If any fluid remains in the bottom of the ornament, pour it back into the floor wax container before moving on to the next step.Take care not to shake or roll the bulbs too vigorously, as you could end up with some sticky fingers and floor wax on the outside of your bulb.

, Once your bulb is coated with floor wax, pour a generous amount of glitter through the ornament’s opening. In order to minimize the mess, use some folded paper or a plastic funnel to help deliver the glitter.Consider doing this outside on the driveway or a sidewalk, or lining your dining room table with newspaper or trash bags.

, Just as you did with the floor wax, hold the ornament and swirl it gently in order to get the loose glitter to adhere to the walls of the ornament. Do so until the bulb looks completely colored and there are no empty patches remaining, then shake any residual glitter back into the bag of glitter.

, Once your orbs are perfectly glittery, you can screw the discarded lids back onto the top opening. Before doing so, take out the pins sticking through it. This way you’ll avoid scraping the newly adhered glitter from the sides with the jutting pins.If the lids seem loose, secure them with a small amount of hot glue or rubber cement.

, Right before you’re ready to hang or box up your ornaments for gift wrapping, stick the pins back into the ornament tops. Going straight into the holes, the pins should make minimal contact with the decorated sides of your ornament. Even if you scrape the walls a little bit, both glitter and wax should be dry enough at that point to incur minimal damage.

Gather your supplies.,
Sprinkle some cinnamon on the area you are working on, so you don't have a stuck on mess to deal with later.

,
Mix the cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg together in a bowl.,
Knead the dough together until it holds together well.

,
Roll out your dough to about a quarter inch thick.

,
Take the cookie cutters and cut as many shapes as possible from the dough you've made.,
Poke a small hole with a straw about a quarter inch away from the top of the shape so you have something to hang it by.

,
Place the cut shapes carefully on waxed paper on top of cookie sheets.,
Set the shapes out to dry somewhere, preferably somewhere where they won't be disturbed by nosy pets, children, or spouses.

,
Allow them to cure and harden for a day or two.

,
Once dry decorate them, you can glue decorations on, paint with ""puffy"" paint, decorate with glitter, etc.

,
Once all your decorations are on and dried, slip a ribbon through the hole at the top.,
Hang the ornament on your tree and enjoy your creation for years to come!

",How to Make Cinnamon Cookie Ornaments,";
,, Stir in the glue and applesauce. If the mixture is too wet add cinnamon, or applesauce if it's too dry.

,,, If you want to add details into the dough (such as by using a little pin to poke holes in) now is the time.

,, They can be fairly close together, but make sure none touch otherwise they will dry together.

,,,, Tie the ends together so you can hang it on your tree! Alternatively, slip an ornament hook through the hole.

Gather plastic wine glasses or old light bulbs from around the house.,
Remove glassware stems or the bulb's inner electrical fixtures.,
Glue ornament hooks onto the stem or metal top of the bulb.,
Pour plastic beads, sprinkles, popcorn, or sand into the vessels.,
Glue a cardboard coaster or cut-out disc to the bottom of the glass.",How to Make Filled Glass or Plastic Ornaments2," Just because you don’t have any clear glass ornaments lying around, doesn’t mean you can’t make some gorgeous filled tree ornaments. Clear plastic wine, champagne, or margarita glasses all work great as improvised bulbs, or you can use some new or used lightbulbs.If you’re using old light bulbs, check to be sure that they’re not browned or yellowed from exposure. Clean out all used materials with rubbing alcohol or cleaning spray in order to remove unsightly dust and stains., Now that you’ve got your bare components gathered, you need to get rid of extraneous functional elements. If you’re dealing with plastic stemware, chop off the bulk of the stem with some heavy scissors or shears. If you’re using light bulbs, pull out the brass contact, filaments, glass insulator, and fill tube with a pair of pliers and a screwdriver.You should leave a half inch or so of the plastic stem on the wine glass. This will make it easier to sever the stem, as well as leave a pointed surface to which you can attach the ornament hook.
Be sure that an adult performs this part of the task if there are any children present. Also be sure never to use fluorescent bulbs, as the inner coating is toxic., Using ornament hooks you’ve purchased at a hobby or art store, adhere them to the top of the glassware stem or the metal bottom of the light bulb. Hot glue works well for this task, but rubber cement or super glue can also be used in a pinch.If you don’t have any ornament hooks handy, you can use ribbons instead.

, You can use almost anything to fill your ornaments, so get creative! Plastic or foam beads can be found at any crafts store, or you can use colorful cake sprinkles, bright candies such as M&Ms, or popcorn.If you’re using old light bulbs, you can make your ornament look like a snowman by filling it with all white beads or glitter.

, While old light bulbs have a built-in lid to close in the filling, you’ll need to create your own top if you’re using plastic stemware. Cardboard coasters are sufficiently sturdy for your purposes and require minimal effort to trim to size, but you can also use scraps of thick cardboard or foam and cut them into circles. Glue the makeshift lids to the rim of the glass and hold it steady before trimming off any overlap.If you have some small, plastic Christmas trinkets laying around, you can glue them to the coaster to create something resembling a mini-snow globe. Just be sure to use only a dusting of glitter or beads in these ornaments so that the figurine will be visible."

Create a rustic seasonal ornament.,
Fill the ornaments with beads.,
Use mini gift wrap bows.",How to Make Filled Glass or Plastic Ornaments3," Place tiny pine cones, sprigs of spruce trees or rosemary, faux snow and holly sprigs into the ornament. Give it even more of a terrarium feel by adding craft moss at the bottom of the ornament, then nestling the other items on top., You could do something simple, like filling each ornament halfway up with faux pearls, which looks quite elegant. For a little more color, use the beads from cheap costume necklaces. Just take the necklaces apart and fill the glass ornaments with the baubles of your choice.Mix it up by varying the color, size and shape of the beads.

, Continue a holiday theme by filling glass ornaments with mini gift wrap bows. Use bows that are all the same color, or mix it up by using red, green, silver and gold. You should be able to fit several into the ornament and the result is very festive."

Embellish it.",How to Make a Small Penguin Christmas Ornament," Attach the white belly to the body using one strand of black embroidery floss folded in half. Knot the end just like sewing with thread. Refer to the picture in the same area you find the pattern.
, Sew the body together with black sewing thread, leaving the bottom open to turn and stuff later. Keep your stitches small and as close to the edge as possible without missing any areas. Turn the ornament right side out and check for any missed areas., The hat base (the white square) fold into a long square then sew together with white sewing thread making a circle. Turn that right side out and glue that to the bottom of the hat. A hot glue gun is recommended it seems to stick a little better, but be careful of your fingers. Also, using hot glue, attach the pompom to the end of the hat. This is the reason his hat is flat at the tip, to accommodate for the pompom., Use just craft glue for this., Again, be careful with the little pieces., You can also put some fiberfill (stuffing) into the hat for body, before you glue it., You might want to experiment with the width and length of the scarf. You can also cut the ends in strips to make a little fringe. Tie that around him, you might want to glue a small section of the back down, as well as underneath where it's tied just so it doesn't come apart. He'll catch cold if he doesn't have his scarf on., Sew up the bottom.

, The form is up to your own creative wishes., For example, glue snowflake to his hat, and place a present in his hand."

Choose the beads.,
Arrange the beads you're using on a bead board or similar sorting item.,
Keep one line of the design stuck down on double-sided tape.,
Form a snowflake shape from the three pipe cleaners.,
Thread the beads on.,
Repeat for each stem of the snowflake being created.

,
To finish each end, dab the glue on to form a solid stopper.,
Place a hanger on the completed snowflake decoration.,
Repeat as many times as you need snowflake ornaments.",How to Make a Beaded Snowflake Ornament," The beads should all be of a similar size but they can be varied shapes. Choose crystal, pearl, plain, cylinder, faceted and round, to provide pretty variety. They must have threading holes in them, and the hole must be large enough to accept a pipe cleaner being pushed through.;
, To begin with, you'll need to develop the pattern for the beads you're using. This pattern will go along each stem and looks best when it is reflect symmetrically on each of the snowflake's stems. Hence, making a template makes it easy for you to follow for every snowflake stem per snowflake decoration being made.


For example, you could make a pattern that goes: One round crystal bead, one pearl bead, one cylinder bead, one round bead, repeat. Or, any other variation that pleases you. The important thing is to mix up pearl, crystal and plain to give the impression of ""glittering"".
Consider using a few larger beads around the center of the snowflake, allowing you to show off some very special beads and create the impression of a typical snowflake with a larger center which descends into smaller tips.

, That way, the design can be referred to again and again and if it's accidentally bumped, it'll stay in place.

,


Align the pipe cleaners in a row on a flat surface.
Twist the pipe cleaners around the middle two to three times to join them together.
Pull the untwisted lengths apart. Spread them out by their tips to form a 6-pointed star or snowflake shape, with all the sections evenly placed apart from each other.

, Following the order you've chosen for the beads (see Part 1 above), begin to thread the beads onto the snowflake. If you're using larger beads around the center, obviously these are the ones to start with. Push the beads all the way to the twisted join in the middle, right up the stem.

,, This will prevent the last bead (and any other beads) from slipping off. The furriness of the pipe cleaner will also assist in keeping the beads snugly in place. Allow the glue to dry fully.

, Use the invisible thread or monofilament and cut as long a hanging length as needed for your tree, window or other hanging location. Tie one end to one tip of the snowflake and knot tightly. Cut off any excess from the knot. Tie the other end in a loop for hanging over a cup hook, tree branch or pinning into wood, etc.

, A whole tree covered in these looks stunning. They also make nice gifts, especially if you include a ""handmade by me"" gift note.

Get a battery-operated tealight.,
Turn the candle so that the flame is pointing away from you.,
Draw a simple snowman face using a black permanent marker.,
Consider coloring the flame in with an orange permanent marker.,
Cut an 11-inch (27.94-centimeter) long piece of thin ribbon and tie the ends together to form a loop.You can use any color you want, but red, white, or green are most commonly associated with winter and Christmas.,
Hot glue the ribbon to the back of the tealight.,
Cut a 2½-inch (6.35-centimeter) long piece of pipe cleaner.,
Hot glue the pipe cleaner to the top of the tealight.,
Hot glue two mini pompoms to either end of the pipe cleaner.,
Cut a 4½-inch (11.43-centimeter) long piece of ribbon.Choose a thin ribbon, about ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) wide.,
Cross the ends together to form a loop, and secure them with a drop of hot glue.,
Glue the scarf to the tealight.,
Trim the ends of the ribbon, if needed.",How to Make a Tealight Snowman," You can find them in arts and crafts stores as well as in the candle section of a supermarket. A white tealight would work best, but you can also get a white glitter one for a fancier snowman.;
, Set the candle down on the table first, then rotate it until the tip of the flame is pointing away from you. Most battery-operated tealights have a flame that curves slightly to one side, rather than pointing straight up.Having the flame tilted upward will make the snowman look more jolly.

, Make two dots above the flame for the eyes. Make four to five dots below the flame to make the mouth.Make sure that the tip of the flame is pointing upwards, towards the eyes.


For a more dimensional look, use black puff paint.
If you are using a glitter tealight, draw the face using black puff paint. Regular marker won't show up.

, The flame will look yellow-orange when it is turned on, but it will look white when its turned off. You can fix this by coloring the flame in with an orange permanent marker.Don't use a washable ""kid's"" marker. The color will rub off.
Don't use paint or paint pens. They are opaque, and the color won't shine through.

, Choose the thinnest ribbon you can find, about 1/16 to 1/8-inch (0.16 to 0.32-centimeter).

, Place a drop of hot glue on the back of the tealight, close to the top. Press the knotted part of the ribbon into the glue, and let it set.

, You can use any color you want, but red or green would work best.

, Draw a line of hot glue around the top edge of the tealight, right above the eyes. Quickly press the pipe cleaner into the glue. If you need to, gently curve the pipe cleaner first, so that you don't risk accidentally touching the glue.

, Choose two pompoms in a contrasting color. Place a drop of hot glue at either end of the pipe cleaner. Quickly press the pompoms into the glue., Use a color that matches your ear muffs.


If you can't find any ribbon, use a strip of felt instead.

, Cross the left end over the right to form a loop, sort of like the Breast Cancer Awareness ribbon. Secure the loop with a drop of hot glue., Place a drop of hot glue on the back of the tealight, close to the bottom. Press the inside part of the loop against the glue, so that the crossed part is in front. Make sure that the tail ends of the ribbon are pointing down., The ribbon should pop up against the bottom of the tealight. If it keeps hanging down, use a drop of hot glue to keep it in place.

Select a half SmoothFoam Ball.,
Improve the texture of the surface on the curve side (optional).,
Cover the curve side of the ornament with glitter, paint, (optional).,
Cut a nativity scene out and paste it on the flat end of the ball.,
Seal the ornament with sealant (optional).,
Trim the edge of the flat side with decorative trimmings.,
Attach an loop for hanging (optional).",How to Make a Nativity Ornament with a Styrofoam Half Ball," This foam is the harder solid form that has a smooth feel to it. The ball can be any size. SmoothFoam is used here because it's durable and doesn't crumble or scratch as easy as the regular Styrofoam. Also, the finished project will not collapse from the inside under the weight of the trimmings, coverings and if you press on it too hard or sit, or step on it by accident.

If the ball is not already halved, get a saw or serrated knife saw it in half. It doesn't have to be perfect. Look for a seam line that perfectly divides the ball in half equally, and cut along that line as straight as possible. Saw and sand the uneven cuts and edges with sandpaper as needed.;
, SmoothFoam has a ""fake Rolex Watch"" or reptile egg texture not really suitable for Christmas. There are countless ways to do this.

If the ball is to be completely covered with glitter move on to next step.Same for anything that'll cover the texture.
Cover the ball with plaster, speckle, moulding paste etc. Get creative with textures using various methods and techniques .
Get sandpaper and rub it against the foam. Do this until the original texture is not seen.



 


Different grades of sandpaper produce different textures on the foam. Also experiment with other scrapping tools like nail files or wire brushes.
Coarse sandpaper will give the foam a rough rocky look.
Medium sandpaper to fine sandpaper will give a more sugary or sandy textured ball.
Ultra fine sandpaper can give a very fine smooth texture like a pearl.

, The ornaments here were painted but other items and techniques can be used. Unless using the flat side as a background for a lacy or open design nativity scene leave this blank. Make sure this covering is suitable for attaching the nativity scene.

Paint the SmoothFoam Ball curve side with good quality gold acrylic paint. Good quality acrylic paint is thick like toothpaste or butter and sticks to the foam ball nicely. Find these in the Fine Art section of the craft stores or in a art supply store. Liquitex© Acrylics is a good one. There are also many water-based inks and gel mediums which also are safe for the foam. Bad quality acrylics are watery and runny making a dripping mess. Also they have a tendency to peel off even after drying out or slide off the foam as well.

For rough balls and glitter paint: Daub paint from the tube on a section and spread the paint over with the brush over half or fourth whatever suits you the best until that section is covered. Let that dry and repeat the step on a different section until the ball is covered. For white spots that are peeking through dip a soft brush in paint and push the paint into the crevices that are what is peeking through. Let dry.

For smooth pearl balls: Put a small daub of paint on the top the dome and with a sponge brush press down and drag the paint to the bottom. Go to another spot and repeat until the ball is covered. Try also a very soft bristle brush but this will not be as smooth as the sponge brush and leave stroke lines in the paint finish. Let the paint dry. Once it dries use the ultra fine sandpaper or a scouring pad and gently rub the ball buffing out paint lines bumps until it's perfectly smooth. Wipe the crumbs with a soft brush or cloth and repeat the painting process and buffing again and again until the ball get's a reflective quality like a pearl when dry.
Another good idea is pinning beads, buttons and other decorative things to the ball until the curve edge is completely covered. Try covering the curve edge with fabric.
Reference other Wikihow articles, books, craft blogs, websites to find lots more Styrofoam covering ideas.

, Use a thick, heavy duty  glue that won't melt the foam. If using hot glue use the low temp versions or settings. Some glues just don't work. So experiment on scrap foam and paper before using on the main project.


Look around for nativity scene pictures in a number of religious books, children's religious books, magazines or in Christmas song books. You can find religious Christmas cards. Another good idea is to find nativity fabric or jewelry and pin/glue that on as well. Also look for nativity art on the web to print and download.
Some Christmas cards have a glossy finish that can distract from the picture. Remedy this with some card de-glossing solvent sold in craft stores.
Some stiffer and thicker papers and cards like in some children books are difficult to cut. Use heavy duty scissors or a crafts knife.Try copying them via machine or just use the thinner and softer ones instead. Also resizing to the perfect size on the printer/computer can be a hassle.
Some thicker cards are really a number of thin layers that can be peeled apart.
Thicker as well slicker, glossy papers don't stick easily to foam directly. Try roughing the back up before gluing with sandpaper for better adherence or glue it on a rougher paper that'll adhere to the foam better. Also press down on the paper for a few minutes to let the glue get a chance to grab and set.
As for positioning the picture on the ball, there are many ways to do this:
Trace the circle of the ball on the picture after measuring and editing the elements you want in the picture on the ornament. Trim the circle a wee bit smaller and glue.
Cut out figures from the picture and glue them on the painted background alone or as a collage.

, Good quality paint is pretty much permanent and water resistant. But if you feel if you need too protect a precious sentimental card, glitter coatings, or the whole ornament use Modge Podge or any water based sealant approved for Styrofoam and following the instructions on the package to protect the ornament.

It's a good idea to seal finishes with glitter so the glitter doesn't fall off the ornament leaving it bare or end up all over the place.Sealing a picture will protect it from looking beat up over time and also will protect it in case there's a spill, water, which will help it last for years.

, Make sure the trimming fits around the edge easily. Gathered lace ruffling makes a really pretty edge. Also make sure to cut enough length of trimming to go around the edge and extra before gluing. It's easier to cut away an extra inch than having to add that missing inch later.

A grand effect is created by placing a very wide lacy or pleated fringe (1 to 2 inches wide) around first then a narrower denser one on the inner edge of the first framing material.

, Use one of many ways to attach a loop for hanging if the ornament is to be hung.

Dip a decorative straight pin in the glue or add a bead to the pin press almost all the way into the ball. Take a cord or ribbon and tie in a bow or slipknot around the pin beneath the bead then press the pin into the ornament. You can also pin though the hanging material or through the knot of a ribbon or cord.
Press a hairpin or jewelry hook into the foam deeply. Dip the pin to the glue first before inserting. Leave the loop or hook poking out. Hook an ornament hook through this loop like a tradition glass ball ornament.
Repeat the first suggestion only pressing the pin all the way into the ball then filling this indentation with speckle and smoothing it out. Allow the speckle to set and cure before hanging.

When you get to the seam between the two balls, wrap a tuft of wool around the neck, then poke the needle into the balls themselves, and not the space between them.

Use as many tufts and layers of wool roving as you need to in order to cover up the Styrofoam.

, Get a sheet of small, black, self-adhesive gems from the scrapbooking section of your arts and crafts store. Attach two gems to the small ball using hot glue to make the eyes. Attach three gems to the bigger ball to make the buttons.If you can't find any hot glue, use fabric glue or tacky glue instead. Don't rely on the adhesive that's already on the back of the gems; it's not strong enough.
If you'd like, you can attach four to five gems to the small ball to make the mouth.
Can't find any black gems? Try black, mini, doll-sized buttons instead.

, How big or small the nose is, is up to you. It is better to make it too long than too short, because you can always cut it down.

When you are done, glue the hat to the top of the snowman's head.Consider stuffing the tube with polyester stuffing before gluing the bigger circle. This will make the hat more stable., Cut a thin strip out of red craft felt, long enough to wrap around the snowman's neck. Cut a short fringe into both of the narrow ends. Wrap the scarf around the snowman's neck, and secure it with a loose knot or a drop of glue.Make the scarf fancier by embroidering the edges with white embroidery thread and a running stitch., Cut two mitten shapes, and glue them together with a toothpick sandwiched between them. Coat the other end of the toothpick with more glue, and poke it into the side of the snowman. Repeat this step for the other arm.To make fancier mittens: embroider the edges with white embroidery thread and a running stitch.To make simpler arms: get two small twigs, coat the ends with glue, then poke them into the sides of the snowman.

, Use graph paper and sketch out the holiday shapes to be used for ornaments. If you're stuck for ideas, plenty of templates can be downloaded from online sites for you to trace around. The main thing is to keep it really simple. Cut out the designs on paper or card. Typical ornament designs include: Angel; snowman; star; Santa; reindeer; stocking.


Example: You've chosen an angel. The template can be as simple as a circle for her head and a triangle for her body, with two triangles for wings. Your children can draw it for you.

, Watch your fingers, as cut aluminum is sharp. If you want to remove splintered edges or sharp bits, it is possible to sand the edges but be careful while doing this. Wearing heavy duty, pliable gloves is advisable when cutting and sanding. Then flatten the can to allow for the designs to be cut out.

, Then cut around the design using the tin snips and a sharp pair of scissors for the more tricky parts.


If you have additional parts, these can be glued on, especially where it's too tricky to cut out the whole design but a lot easier to cut out basic shapes and glue them into formation. Heavy duty super glue will work best to bond the pieces.

, Thread some string or ribbon through and tie a knot to create a hanger.

Hang in the tree.",How to Make Beer Can Christmas Ornaments2," Eight become the reindeer and one the sleigh, so if possible, make the sleigh can different from the reindeer cans.

, On each reindeer can, make a mark about a quarter way down from the top of each can. You will be creating a hole here through to the opposite side of the can and in the exact same place on each can, to enable a dowel rod to be passed through all of the cans to keep them together.


Check that each mark is at the exact same height on every can. It helps to use the first can as the indicator.







, Make the hole big enough to fit the dowel rod through.

, Push the other dowel through the other four cans.

,

In the two front and two back cans in the rows of cans, make a mark about halfway down each can at the place where the cans would face each other when placed side by side. The marks must be exactly opposite each other, to ensure even joining, both ends.






Pierce holes at these marks and insert a piece of dowel about 3 inches (7.5cm) in length into the cans on one row.






Next, slip the dowel into the holes of the cans in the other row to join the two rows together. It's a good idea to add a dollop of glue too, to ensure the dowels don't shift when the ornament is hung or displayed.






The reindeer are now assembled. You'll get to decorate them shortly.







,

Find some strong wire and cut into two pieces about 4 inches (10cm) in length.






Pierce a hole into each can at the end of the reindeer set and insert the wires, one into each can.






Turn the sleigh can onto its side, lid end facing the reindeer. Then pierce two equivalent holes into the lid of the sleigh at to evenly spaced places in the middle half of the lid circle.






Check that the sleigh is held firmly to the reindeer––it should be hovering about halfway against the upright reindeer cans, in the air.







, Pull up the can tabs on each reindeer can. Attach antlers made from paper or wooden craft cut-outs. Stick a few tiny pompoms or glitter glue on to brighten them up. Ribbon can be zig-zagged across some of the antlers too.


Add a red pompom nose to one of the reindeer, for Rudolph.







, Glue some cotton wool onto the can for Santa's seat. Then glue a Santa figurine onto the cotton wool. Behind Santa, glue on some gifts. These can be made simply by wrapping small cubes of paper or card with Christmas paper.

,

For the reins, glue two long pieces of string either side of the front of the reindeer sets and bring the string up to Santa's hands (or as near an approximation of his hands as possible given your figurine).






To hang the ornament, attach a long piece of string tied to middle of the dowels in the reindeer sets and to the end of the Santa sleigh (you can use heavy duty glue or pierce two small holes in the end of Santa's sleigh and thread the string through and tie a knot).







, Check that it sits evenly––you might need to make a few adjustments to the hanger piece. Jolly good.

, To knit, hold the needle with all of your stitches in your left hand. Poke your right needle through the first stitch on your left needle. Drape the yarn over the tip of your right needle. Use the needle to pull the yarn through the loop. Keep the loop on your right needle, and slip the first stitch off of the left needle. Do this for the entire row and don't turn your work.


Unlike with regular knitting, you will not be turning your work. Consider using a stitch marker, safety pin, or piece of contrasting yarn to mark your first and last stitch. This will help you tell when one row ends and another begins.The stitches on your needle have two sides: a front and back. When you are sliding your right needle into the stitch, you are sliding it past the front part of the stitch first, so that the stitch twists a little.

, Start knitting as you usually would: poke your right needle into the first stitch, drape the yarn over the tip, then pull the loop through the stitch. 'Don't drop the stitch yet. Poke the needle into the stitch again. Drape the yarn over the tip, and pull the loop through the stitch. Now, you can drop your first stitch.Do this for every stitch in the row.

When you reach the 12th row, alternate between knitting one stitch, and then knitting two stitches together. You will have a total of 8 stitches., Knit twice, front-and-back (kfb) into each stitch all the way across the row. You'll have a total of 16 stitches., You can use polyester stuffing or cotton balls. Stuff it as firmly as you can. Don't worry if some of the stuffing pokes you; you can continue to poke the stuffing back inside the snowman as you work.

, Knit as you normally would for rows 14 and 16. For row 16, do your decreases by knitting every two stitches together. You will have a total of 8 stitches by the end of your 16th row., Knit the 17th row, then cut the yarn, and thread the tail onto a yarn needle. Finish stuffing the snowman, then pull the needle back and forth through the stitches on the knitting needles. Pull your work off of the knitting needles, tighten the yarn, and finish off with a knot. Trim off any excess yarn.,, You will have a total of 5 stitches., On the 7th, alternate between knitting 2 stitches together, then knitting 1 stitch, and then knitting 2 more stitches. You should have a total of 3 stitches when you are done., Cut the yarn, leaving behind a long tail. Thread the tail through your yarn needle, and pass the yarn back and forth through the stitches on your knitting needles. Pull your hat off of the knitting needles, pull the yarn taut, and tie it off into a tight knot. Trim off any excess yarn.The hat will be pointed at the top. If you'd like to turn this into a knit, ski-type hat, consider gluing a mini pompom to the top.

, You can use ribbon or yarn for the loop. You can also crochet a chain and use that instead. Thread your string onto a yarn needle, then push the needle through the top of the hat. Tie the ends of your string together to form a loop, then twist the loop until the knot is inside the hat.

, You will need some DK yarn for this. Your scarf can be any color you want, but red will give you the most classical look., Your stitches will transfer from the left needle to the right. This method is also known as the i-cord.

, Don't turn your work. Simply take the right needle, and slide your stitches across it to the other pointed end., Again, don't turn your work. Take put needle with all of the stitches into your let hand, and the empty into your left hand. You should now be back where you started: a needle with stitches in your left hand, and an empty needle in your right hand., Because you did not turn your work, the yarn will now be coming from the opposite end. Before you start knitting again, place the working yarn along the back of your work, towards the first stitch. Keep it nice and taut., At the end of the row, don't turn your work. Simply slide the stitches to the other end of the needle, then switch hands.

,, Once the scarf is the right length, bind it off, and knot off the end. Weave the tail back into the top of the scarf, and carefully trim off any stitches.

, If the scarf is long enough, you and tie the scarf into a knot, jut like you would with a real scarf. If the scarf is too short, cross the two ends over each other to form a snug X, then stitch them together using a yarn needle and matching yarn.

, Simply make a couple of stitches in one place using your yarn needle and some black yarn until you have a lumpy, black shape. Your stitches do not have to be neat; snowmen have eyes made out of coal, and coal is lumpy.


If you know how to embroider, try a French knot!

, The scarf will hide the mouth, but the rest of your snowman will still be visible. If you want to, add 3 buttons onto the body using the same technique as for the eyes.

, The length of the triangle is up to you; the longer your triangle is, the longer the nose will be.

, Draw a line of hot glue or fabric glue down the center of the triangle, then fold it in half. Hold it until the glue sets. If you don't have any glue, you can sew it instead using orange thread.If the nose is too fat, simply cut another one, but make the triangle slimmer.
If the nose is too long, simply cut a little bit off of the base.

, Place a drop of glue at the base of the nose, then place it onto the center of the face, just above the scarf. If you don't have any glue, you can sew it on instead., Depending on what type of glue you used, this should only take a few seconds to a few minutes.

Determine the weight of the ornament.,
Obtain the necessary hardware.,
Install the hook.,
Connect the monofilament line to the swivel.,
Spin the ornament.",How to Make a Long Spinning Ornament Attachment," Getting the weight correct is of most importance for the heavier objects - the lighter seasonal type objects usually are very lightweight and won't present weight problems.;
, Purchase monofilament (or fishing) line, a fishing ""swivel"" and a hook from which the ornament will hang. A sporting goods store or department is a great place for the fishing line and swivel:


Fishing line may be substituted by your choice of string, wire, etc. if desired; the reason fishing line is suggested is due to its transparency and strength. The fishing line is available in different ""pound tests"" but the values on the spools of line are not very reliable, so it is best to physically pull on the line to determine its ability to support the weight of the ornament. Choose line that will support at least two times the weight of the ornament.






A swivel consists of two small hoops joined together in such a way that they may turn independently of each other.






The hook should be selected on the weight it is expected to support (at least two times the actual weight) and the material into which it will be secured – examples are: wood, concrete, hollow wall, etc. A hardware store (or department) is the best place to choose hooks (and get advice on the suitability to task, as well).







, Secure the hook directly onto the surface over where the ornament will hang,using the supplied fastener for the surface's material.

, Start by cutting the monofilament line to length. Since this line is inexpensive and sold in 100 yard (91.4 m) lots, allow plenty of extra line.


Attach the line to the hook (installed in the previous step) and to the swivel by tying directly to it, or placing a slip knot around it.






Connect the other end of the swivel directly to the ornament (if the type with a close-able clasp) or, connected by an additional length of monofilament line if needed in the same manner as was done between the hook and swivel.







, While the ornament will spin for a long time, eventually friction will cause the ornament to stop spinning. However, if the decoration is located indoors, it may be possible to use a small fan to gently blow air at the ornament to keep it spinning continuously.

, Squeeze a few teaspoons of glue onto one piece of wax paper.

, Pinch two fingers together and run them down the string to remove any excess glue.

, Make sure the paper is flat.

, Lay the string across the first string so the two make an ""X.""

, Lay it across the first two strings so the three strings intersect in the center and are spaced evenly (like an asterisk). Reinforce the axis with a dab of glue, and press down firmly on it.

, You can tie a piece of thread around that loop later to hang the snowflake. Now, the three pieces of string should appear to be roughly the same length.

, Center it on top of the three strings and press firmly where it intersects the other strings. Add a dab of glue to each intersection.

, Pinch the circular string so it resembles a six-pointed star.

, Lay one piece on each of the six points of the snowflake so there is a three-pointed prong at the end of each point. Reinforce the axes with a dab of glue.

, Then shake off the extra glitter.

, When it is dry and hardened, gently peel it off the wax paper and remove any flakes of glue.

, Hang your snowflake with a piece of thread and enjoy!

You can create your own cut-outs from cardboard or wood, you can purchase ornaments in a variety of shapes and colors.Keep in mind that ornament bases with textures such as glitter will change how the gold leaf looks once applied.
Check your local craft stores, home goods stores, and thrift stores to find ornament blanks or supplies to make your own cut-outs.;
, If you do not plan on applying gold leaf to the whole ornament, decide if you want to add a base color to your ornament. Find acrylic or craft paint at your local craft store, along with brushes for application, to paint your ornament base.Keep in mind that you can purchase some ornaments such as ball ornaments in a variety of different colors, which can eliminate the need for the base paint.

, Paint the ornament in thin layers, and allow a full day for the ornaments to dry before you apply the gold leaf. Use a sponge brush or spray paint for the most consistent finish.


You can create a minimalist glass ornament by only applying gold leaf.
If you decide to paint your glass ornament, paint the inside by squeezing in a small amount of paint and rotating it around the ornament. This maintains the ornament’s polished surface.

, Gold leaf comes in a number of forms and colors. Check your local art supplies stores, craft store, or online to find a leaf that fits your needs. Decide if you want real or imitation gold leaf, whether you want a brilliant or antique finish, and what karat weight you want.True gold leaf is often more expensive and more difficult to find. A number of imitation leafs are available that look comparable to genuine gold at a fraction of the price.

, Gold leaf is traditionally applied with gold leaf sizing, but you can also use spray adhesive, which offers faster application for less precise or more abstract patterns. Decide what type of sizing method you want to use.


For a more precise pattern, traditional gold leaf sizing may work better, as it offers greater control over where the leaf is applied.
For more abstract or non-precise patterns, spray adhesive allows you to work faster and with greater ease.

, Decide roughly where you want your gold leaf so that you know where to apply the size. It may be as simple as deciding you want the bottom portion of each ornament to be covered in leaf, or you may have a more precise pattern.For more precise patterns, consider using a colored pencil or wax pencil for glass to draw out the shapes and patterns you want.
You can also use vinyl stickers that you peel away after apply the leaf to create a specific shape or pattern.

, Use a brush to apply the sizing to the area where you want the gold leaf. Size generally needs to sit to become tacky before the leaf is applied. Check the instructions on your particular brand of size to see how long you need to wait before applying the leaf.Rest your ornament on a side not covered with the size. If you plan on applying leaf to the entire ornament, do so one half at a time so that you have an area where you can hold and rest the ornament at all times.

, Once the size has had the chance to dry and become tacky, it’s time to apply the leaf. Hold the edge of the backing sheet and place the leaf down against the size. If you are using an imitation leaf, you may use a paintbrush or your finger to apply pressure to the gold leaf and transfer it to the size.If you are using genuine gold leaf, you will need a gilding brush to pick up and apply the leaf. Rub the brush against your palm or hair to create a static charge, then use it to pick up and dab on the leaf a little bit at a time.
Use a thin, soft-bristled brush such as a fan brush to wipe away the excess leaf once the gilding has been applied to all of the sizing.

, Use a spray setter meant for metallic leafing to set and seal your ornament.Hold the spray can in the hand opposite the ornament at a distance of around eight to twelve inches. Spray the ornament lightly, rotating to ensure full coverage.


Spray the sealant outside, if possible, and cover the ground in a tarp or newspapers for easy clean-up.
A water-based varnish also works to seal the leaf. You can generally find this any craft or art supplies stores.

, Decide where you want to apply the gold leaf and outline your design or pattern. If you want an abstract pattern, you may choose not to outline the area. Otherwise, you can use a colored or wax pencil to create a rough sketch.Wax pencils work best on glass.

, If you are using imitation gold leaf, hold the leaf by the backing sheet and spray a thin layer of adhesive directly on the leaf. If you are using genuine gold leaf, apply the spray adhesive to the ornament and use a gilding brush to pick up and apply the leaf.If you are spraying directly on the leaf, spray small sections at a time to avoid adding too much leaf. You may also cut the leaf sheets to achieve more precise patterns or shapes.

, Immediately after applying the spray adhesive, apply the leaf. If you sprayed directly onto the leaf, use a blunt tipped object to rub leaf onto the ornament. Otherwise, use a gilding brush to pick up and blot on the leaf.


Wipe off excess leaf using a fan brush in between layers of application.

, Use a water-based varnish or a metallic leaf setting spray to seal your ornament. Apply the setting spray in a well-ventilated area, holding the ornament about eight to twelve inches away from the spray can.Rotate the ornament to ensure that you get complete coverage on all the leafed areas.

Avoid letting your happiness depend entirely on others.,
Seek individual counseling.,
Move on, if you choose.",How to Handle Insecurity After Your Spouse Cheats1," Realize that your spouse’s infidelity does not mean you deserve to be cheated on or disrespected. You deserve dignity and fairness in your relationships, and it’s not your fault that your spouse decided to stray behind your back.Build yourself back up by reminding yourself of your positive qualities and achievements. Try making a list of all of your positive qualities. These can be anything from being a loyal friend to knowing how to play the guitar to graduating from college. Write down all of your positive qualities and review this list often. If you are having trouble thinking of things to add, then ask a trusted friend or family member to help you.;
, You may sometimes find yourself dwelling on worries about whether or not your spouse is going to cheat again. These thoughts can be disruptive, so it is important to learn how to recognize them and redirect your attention when they occur.


Try to replace an intrusive thought about your spouse cheating with a positive one. For example, if you find yourself thinking, “I know my spouse is going to cheat on me again and there’s nothing I can do to stop it!” then you might replace this thought with something like, “I am doing everything I can to recover from my spouse’s infidelity and I am proud of all of my hard work and progress.”, Focus on the basics of good nutrition, sleep, and exercise. Dealing with a difficult issue like infidelity is more manageable when your physical needs are taken care of.Self-care activities like meditation and writing in a journal can be good for your emotional health.
Avoid turning to alcohol, drugs, or other unhealthy coping mechanisms for comfort. You might feel better temporarily, but these substances will make your long-term problems worse.

, Carve out a few hours a week to devote to an activity you enjoy, or pick up a new hobby you’ve always wanted to try. Spending time developing a skill or exercising your creativity can help you feel more emotionally self-sufficient. Try starting a reading habit, learning a craft like knitting, or taking a class on something that interests you.

, When you share your life with someone, it can be easy to let them dictate your emotions. Remember that you’re a whole person on your own, and you’re capable of finding happiness outside of your relationships.Try using visual imagery to put this into perspective. For example, when your spouse becomes depressed or angry, imagine that they have just gotten on a roller coaster and you are standing on the side watching them ride. The roller coaster represents the emotions they are feeling, but you do not have to ride this ride with them.

, Self-esteem and trust issues may arise after learning that your spouse was unfaithful. Just as it can be helpful to seek help as a couple, you may also benefit from talking to a professional on your own.You might choose individual counseling as a tool to help you restore your confidence and heal after being cheated on if you do not want to work on the marriage. Your therapist can serve as a source of support and guidance as you navigate the decision to divorce.
It may also help to join a support group for spouses who have experienced infidelity. Sharing your story and hearing that of others can ultimately help you heal.

, It is entirely up to you how you choose to move forward after suffering from infidelity in your marriage. Perhaps if your spouse appears to be a serial cheater, or your trust cannot be mended, you might choose to divorce. Divorce is never an easy choice; yet, it is one that you should make only after discussing the ordeal with your spouse and various supportive loved ones.A therapist can help you decide what is best for your future (and your children’s, if you have any). This professional may also assist you in having the discussion with your spouse, family members, and children.
Take plenty of time to think through your options and make your decision. Even if other people advise you to act quickly, take as much time as you need to make this decision.

Either way, its time to have an honest conversation about your feelings.Prepare to have an open conversation about the problem. Your first step is to figure out your feelings.
Ask yourself why you object to his watching porn. Is it a religious issue for you? Or is it against your moral code?
Choose some words that describe how you are feeling. Be descriptive with words such as ""frustrated"", ""worried"" or ""nervous"".
Make a list of the things you want to say. This will help you to stay on track during the conversation and make sure that you make your points clear.;
, Talking to your husband about his porn habit is an important conversation. You want to make sure that you allow yourselves time to deal with this tough topic. Take care to choose an appropriate time to have this talk.Try to avoid having this conversation late at night or early in the morning. You two will not be at your emotional best if you are tired.
Give him a heads up. Try saying, ""I have something important to talk to you about. When is a good time for you?""
Don't rush the conversation. Choose a time when you know neither or you will be rushing out the door to work or being interrupted by the kids.

, You might have a serious aversion to porn. Those are your feelings, and that is okay. However, try not to base your talk with your husband purely on judgement.Try to use ""I"" statements. For example, you can say, ""I feel very uncomfortable when you watch porn in our home.""
These types of statements are more effective than ""you"" statements. Your husband will likely be defensive if you say something such as ""When you watch porn, you make me mad.""
Avoid eraser words. For example, try not to say, ""I love you, but your porn habit is disgusting."" Eraser words like ""but"" negate everything that was said before ""but"".

, It is important that you let your husband know how you are feeling. However, don't forget that effective conversations allow both of the participants to talk. Make some effort to understand your husband's point of view.Ask open-ended questions. For example, you could say, ""Why is it important to you to watch porn?""
Make it a point to ask for further information. Try saying, ""So porn makes you feel excited. Is there another way you could achieve that same feeling?""
Ask for new information. Consider saying, ""How do you see us resolving this issue?""

, Asking questions is an important part of having a constructive conversation. It is equally critical that you actually listen to the answers. Make it clear to your husband that you are listening carefully to his point of view.


Use non-verbal cues. You can indicate that you are listening by maintaining eye contact and making gestures such as nodding your head in understanding.
Try paraphrasing. You can say something like, ""I hear you saying that this is a long-time habit. Is that right?""
Show respect. Allow your husband to finish his thoughts and sentences without interrupting.

, Once you have had a constructive conversation about the topic, it is time to start working towards finding a solution. Don't expect that you will be able to resolve the situation overnight. This is a sensitive subject that might take a while to figure out.Allow yourselves time to reflect. Remember that your first conversation on the subject does not have to result in resolution.
After talking to your husband, take a few days to think about how you feel. Were you able to effectively communicate? Do you feel at all better about the situation?
Start thinking about possible solutions. Write down any ideas that you have. Writing things down can help you to gain mental clarity.

, Once you have addressed the topic for the first time, make sure that you keep the discussion going. You don't have to talk about it every day, but let your husband know that you still have things to talk about. Tell him that you would like to work together to find a solution.It is possible that your discussion of porn led to an argument. That's normal. Many couples fight about what are called ""hot button"" issues.
Take some time to cool down. Say to your husband, ""This conversation isn't productive right now. Let's walk away and take a little time to breathe.""
Make it clear that the discussion is not over. You can say, ""This topic is important to me, so let's revisit it tomorrow after we've both had time to gather our thoughts.""

, It might be very important to you that your husband immediately stops looking at porn. However, that might prove difficult for him to promise. Ask yourself whether you are willing to compromise.Compromises can often be very useful in resolving marital issues. They can make each party feel like the other is helping to contribute to a solution.
Figure out if you could handle a phased reduction of the porn viewing. For example, maybe you could say, ""Are you willing to start by reducing the amount of porn you look at?""
If you are willing to compromise, your husband will likely be willing to work with you. Eventually, you will likely be able to reach your goal of no porn.

, Many men say that they like to look at porn because it excites them. That does not mean that you are not attractive or that he does not enjoy having sex with you. It just means that sometimes he is looking for something different.Try making some changes to your sex life. Maybe you have been stuck in a rut lately.
Make an effort to have sex at unusual times and in different places. For example, you could approach your husband in his morning shower.
Talk to one another about your sexual desires. You can explain what you want and listen to what would make your husband happy.

, Intimacy is an important component of a healthy marriage. There are different types of intimacy. Emotional intimacy and physical intimacy are two examples.


Become emotionally intimate with your husband. This means being able to tell each other anything. Make it clear that no topic is off the table.
Try saying, ""I understand that sometimes you have an urge to look at porn. I want you to know that you can talk to me about how you are feeling.""
Connect on a physical level. Physical intimacy is not just about intercourse.
Be physically intimate by taking time to kiss and hug each day. Touch each other affectionately and do small things like hold hands.

, In a perfect world, your husband would agree to immediately stop looking at porn. However, the situation is likely more nuanced than that. As you go through the process of resolving the situation, check in with you how are doing.Ask yourself how you are feeling about the progress you've made. Are you feeling good about the possibility of a compromise?
How could you make the situation better? Do you want to have another conversation with your husband?
Take steps to make yourself feel in control. Remind yourself that you are actively working on finding a solution.

, Finding a solution could be a lengthy process. You might find yourself feeling more emotional than usual. Remind yourself that that is normal. Allow yourself to feel a range of emotions.You might go from feeling hopeful to frustrated in the span of one day. That's okay.
Don't judge your feelings. Simply acknowledge them and move on.
Consider keeping a journal. Writing down how you feel can be very cathartic. It can also help you track patterns in your emotions.

, When one partner wants to watch porn and the other doesn't, that can be a very tricky situation. Consider talking to an expert. Marriage counseling can be very useful in helping couples work through sensitive issues.Find the right counselor. Ask your general physician to make a recommendation.
Read online reviews. Look for a licensed therapist who specializes in relationship issues.
Ask for a consultation. You want to make sure that you like the therapists approach and demeanor.

, Trying to get your husband to stop looking at porn can be a frustrating situation. Remember that you don't have to go through this alone. You could seek individual counseling.You can also seek out alternate sources of support. Perhaps you have a spiritual adviser like a priest or minister who could offer you some guidance.
Lean on friends and family. It's fine if you don't want to give any details about your marital problems. But you can still say, ""I'm going through a rough time, and I could use some extra care and attention.""

If you find that you spend too much time discussing the affair itself, try setting aside 15 minutes a day to talk about it. Stick to other topics the rest of the time.

, After your trust has been compromised with an affair, it can be difficult to reconnect with your spouse on a physical level. However, if you choose to rebuild your marriage, this is a step you must take to fully recover and move on.


You can restore intimacy in your marriage by making an effort to communicate your deepest desires with your spouse—your inner thoughts and feelings. In addition, dating each other again may also help. Go on a romantic trip with your spouse. Return to your earlier days when you lovingly traded massages, cuddled on the couch most evenings, and discussed your days during dinner rather than eating in silence.
Marriage counseling can also be helpful in allowing you and your spouse to cross the bridge back to sexual intimacy. This may take time as you may have built up walls after the infidelity, and it may be the last thing that you work on. Try to focus one rebuilding your relationship and this should follow in time. It’s important for you to both be honest with yourselves and fully grieve the betrayal to become physical partners again.You can also make an effort to be physically affectionate with each other until you are ready to have an intimate relationship again. Simple things like holding hands, kissing each other goodbye, and giving each other hugs may help to improve your emotional and physical intimacy.

, Don’t call your spouse constantly to check up on where they are or insist that they spend all their free time with you. While this behavior is understandable, it’s likely to make your spouse feel smothered, which could drive a wedge between you.It is reasonable to ask for some accountability from your spouse after a betrayal. Just be careful not to cross the line into unhealthily jealous or controlling behavior.

, Doing new things can help you move past the affair together. Find things to do that will bring you closer and help you make new memories.Consider taking a weekend trip together, picking up a new hobby as a couple, or just making an effort to spend more time running errands and doing chores together.

Accept that you cannot control your spouse.,
Set goals for your relationship together.,
Discuss issues of privacy.,
Don’t assume you know what your spouse is thinking.",How to Handle Insecurity After Your Spouse Cheats3," Whether your spouse stays faithful in the future is entirely up to them. No matter how carefully you check up on them, if your spouse wants to cheat again, they will find a way. Likewise, if they are committed to fixing their mistake, you won’t have to try to control them.Remind yourself that you have proven through this process that you can take care of yourself and survive no matter what happens.

, Sit down with your spouse and think about what you want your relationship to look like in the future. Make some step-by-step plans for turning your goals into reality. Working towards a common target puts you and your spouse on the same team, helping you to rebuild camaraderie and trust., It’s valid for you to request access to your spouse’s phone and online activity after they cheat on you. However, they still have a right to privacy. Talk with your spouse about how you will balance privacy and accountability in the future.If your spouse remains secretive about their online or phone activity, consider whether they are really committed to helping you trust them again.

, No one is a mind reader, and it’s easy to imagine problems where there are none. Focus on the facts. Don’t let yourself get caught up in fears that your spouse is planning to cheat on you again unless there’s a concrete reason.Do a reality check with yourself when your imagination runs away with you. Stop and ask yourself, “Why am I thinking this? Is there a more likely explanation?”
Also, remind yourself that if they are cheating, then they will likely mess up and get caught again. You don’t have to constantly be on the lookout, so allow yourself to let go of this responsibility.

Cross-examine your spouse.",How to Prove Adultery," Before the advent of “no fault” divorce, proving adultery was one of the few grounds on which a divorce could be granted. Today, however, couples can simply claim irreconcilable differences and be divorced. Nevertheless, some states allow people to file for divorce immediately if they can prove adultery. If they claim irreconcilable differences, then they may have to wait a period of time (such as six months).

Some states still consider marital misconduct when dividing marital property or awarding alimony, but many states no longer do.
For these reasons, you should think about why you want to prove adultery. If your state doesn’t take adultery into consideration when dividing assets or awarding child custody, then there may be little reason to expend energy finding proof of adultery.;
, You should read your state law to see if adultery is considered during a divorce proceeding. You can find your state law by searching the Internet by typing “divorce” or “dissolution of marriage” along with “adultery” as search terms.


You also should see how your state defines “adultery.” States can define it differently, and many states refuse to provide a clear definition.Sexual intercourse may not be required. In South Carolina, for example, there is no requirement of intercourse. Instead, sexual intimacy is sufficient. Such intimacy has been found when a married woman shares a cruise ship cabin with another man even though they did not engage in intercourse.Mississippi, by contrast, defines adultery as “voluntary sexual intercourse.”Check to see how your state defines “adultery,” if it provides a definition at all.

, Before taking the time to try and gather proof of adultery, ask yourself why you suspect it. Studies show that men who suspect a partner of cheating are correct only 50% of the time. (Meanwhile, women are much more accurate in their predictions—85% are correct when they suspect a spouse is cheating.) Common warning signs of infidelity include:your spouse expresses less interest in sex
he or she is away from home an increasing amount
suspicious voice mail messages show up on your machine or suspicious receipts pop up in your spouse’s wallet or purse
your spouse often wants to go to events or functions alone and is hard to reach when at work
there is increased mileage on the car although your spouse does not work far from home

, If you are confused about the weight your state gives to adultery in divorce proceedings, then you should meet with an attorney. An experienced divorce attorney can advise you on whether or not you need to prove adultery.


A lawyer can also advise you on the legality of collecting certain kinds of evidence. For example, you can access your spouse’s cell phone records and emails with a subpoena. However, it is illegal to snoop or try to hack into someone’s phone or account. If you hire a lawyer, he or she can properly subpoena the necessary records that can help you prove adultery.
To find a qualified divorce lawyer, you should ask friends and colleagues who have gone through a divorce if they would recommend their lawyer.
For additional tips, see Hire a Divorce Lawyer.

, You do not need to actually catch your spouse in the act with someone else. Instead, you generally need to prove that your spouse had the opportunity and inclination to commit adultery.However, your circumstantial evidence must be sufficiently definite that you can pinpoint the time and place of the adultery.Although you don’t need videotaped evidence of the adultery, you need more than vague suspicions.
Testimony that you’ve seen your spouse flirting with someone else at dinner parties is not sufficiently definite to show that your spouse had the opportunity and inclination to commit adultery.

, You will have strong evidence if you can show affection between your spouse and another person. For example, the following is solid circumstantial evidence of a romantic relationship:sending or receiving love letters or romantic cards
physical contact such as hugging or holding hands
kissing
an expressed desire to get married
spending the night together

, You can look through the credit card statements and find expensive gifts that you can’t account for. If your spouse is spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on items but you don’t see them around the house, then you should be suspicious.


If you believe that your spouse is having an affair with a woman, then look for purchases made at lingerie stores, women’s clothing stores, or jewelers.Be aware that you can’t open mail unless it is addressed to you. For that reason, you can’t rip open your spouse’s credit card statement and go through it. Nevertheless, if you share an account then you can certainly look.

, If you and your spouse share a cell phone plan, then go through the records and see if he or she is calling someone regularly. You can use “reverse call lookup” services on the Internet to find out if the number belongs to a business or to a person.


If your spouse hides the cell phone bill, then you should be suspicious. You cannot open the mail and look at the bill, but you at least have some proof that your spouse wants to hide something.
If your spouse throws the bill in the trash, then you can retrieve it. Anything thrown in the trash is fair game for you to pull out and read.
Otherwise, you will need to have your lawyer subpoena the phone records. If you think your spouse is calling someone all the time, then let your lawyer know., Keylogging software captures every keystroke made on the computer. It is therefore an excellent way to find out who your spouse is communicating with and what he or she is saying.


Again, legal issues arise here because you could be intercepting someone’s communications illegally.If the court finds that you have violated the law when gathering evidence, then the judge will exclude it at trial. Speak to a lawyer if you have questions about the legality of installing keylogging software.

, People may have seen your spouse kissing someone on the street or disappearing into a building in the middle of the day with another person. You should try to get statements from these witnesses. Although judges will probably discount your own suspicions that your spouse is having an affair, the judge may credit the testimony of third parties.


Have the witness write down the day and time that they saw your spouse, as well as the location. Also ask the witness to describe the person that your spouse was with.

, You could also hire a private detective to tail your spouse and take pictures. You should not do this yourself. Instead you should look into hiring a bonded private investigator who knows the privacy laws in your state and how to work around them.To find a private investigator, you can ask your lawyer for a recommendation or you can search the web. You may also look in the phone book.

, You will need to cite adultery as a grounds for the divorce. You can do this by checking the box for adultery on your state’s printed, “fill in the blank” divorce petition. If adultery is not a grounds for divorce, then it will not appear as an option on the petition.


Many states have printed forms for divorce proceedings which make a Do-It-Yourself divorce possible. To find the forms, check with the court clerk for the courthouse in the county where you live.
However, if you have large assets at stake, then you should probably hire a lawyer, who can draft the petition for you.

, In order to make sure that a witness shows up at your divorce trial, you need to serve them with a subpoena. A subpoena is a legal command for the witness to appear at trial and answer questions.Typically, your lawyer can get subpoenas from the court clerk.


Subpoenas must also be served on the witness, either by mail or personal service (hand delivery). You must make sure that subpoenas are served early enough so that the witness has sufficient time to prepare to come to the trial. Ask the court clerk for how much notice you should give.

, Any documents that you want to present in court should be created as an exhibit. In practice, this means that you should provide print-outs of anything that exists on a computer or in digital form. For example, if you want to present emails your spouse wrote, then you should print out the email.Likewise, you should print out photographs or transcribe voicemail messages rather than have the judge look at the pictures on the camera or listen to a tape of the message.

, The most dramatic part of a divorce trial will be the cross-examination of your spouse. Your lawyer will prepare extensively for it. Once you have presented your circumstantial evidence of adultery—credit card receipts, emails, and photographs—you can expect your spouse to counter with an “innocent” explanation.


It therefore falls to your lawyer to show that your spouse’s innocent explanation is actually a fiction.
You can help your lawyer prepare for the cross-examination of your spouse by letting your lawyer know your spouse’s weaknesses.For example, he or she might have a short temper if interrupted. Your lawyer can therefore subtly interrupt your spouse constantly on the stand, in the hopes of drawing out an angry response.

Remain calm.,
Use non-verbal cues to get his attention.,
Acknowledge and laugh it off.,
Wait to have the conversation.,
Focus on your emotions with “I feel” statements.,
Be honest about your feelings.,
Avoid shaming him for his behavior.,
Notice his reaction.,
Determine what kind of look it was.,
Think about why he’s looking.,
Watch his behavior on social media.,
Look at his past behavior.",How to Get Your Husband to Quit Checking out Pretty Women," It will do neither of you any good to get angry right away. It is likely to make him more defensive. At that point, he may start blaming you for whatever arguing you do next, rather than considering ways to change it., Sometimes your husband is only momentarily distracted by what he sees. A gentle reminder that you are still there, like touching his arm, can snap his attention back to you. It can also be a subtle way to get back his attention while not openly stating that you saw him looking., Just because your husband is looking at a pretty girl doesn’t mean he doesn’t find you attractive. Saying so out loud to him lets your husband know that you saw him, but that you still want him talking to you. A friendly reminder like this can remind him of what’s important, while also having a little bit of fun.Something like, “That girls looks good in that dress, doesn’t she?” is a good way to acknowledge what is happening and draw your husband’s attention back to you.
It is okay to acknowledge that some people are just really good looking, or dressed well. Openly communicating about anything is the sign of a healthy relationship, and your ability to speak positively about another woman’s attractiveness will help him feel more comfortable with you., You don’t want to immediately start yelling at your husband’s looking. That will only make him more defensive about his actions, or turn the conversation back onto you and your reaction. Instead, talk about it later when you two are alone.


Waiting to talk can also help if you think your husband is trying to get a reaction out of you. When you don’t respond or acknowledge his actions, he will eventually notice. From there, he will certainly want to talk, which gives you an opportunity to discuss your feelings more in depth. , When you talk to your husband, using “I feel” statements is a good way to get your ideas across without necessarily accusing him of doing something deliberately wrong. This puts the focus on your emotions, which you can interpret and control, rather than trying to guess at his motivations.Try using statements like “I feel unattractive when I see you look at other women,” or “You make me feel unattractive when you look at other women,” rather than “I can’t believe you looked at that women!” They are less accusatory, and give him an opening to explain his actions., Whenever you talk to your husband about his looking, be clear about that fact that him looking at women bothers you. If you want your husband to be honest about his actions with you, it is only fair that you are honest with him. Besides, if he doesn’t know that it bothers you, he won’t know that he needs to change his behavior., You want your husband to be open with you, so it is important to not shame him if he does admit to staring or looking. Instead keep the focus on your feelings. You want him to think about you, and how his behavior affects how you feel., It is a good sign if he responds by reassuring you about how it is unrelated to his feelings for you. On the other hand if he becomes defensive, or accuses you of overreacting, that suggests he is not thinking enough about your feelings and how his behavior impacts them., Consider the way your husband is looking at these women. There is a difference between a quick glance, which can be a biological reflex, or a lingering stare, which is disrespectful both to you and the other woman.Consider any other behavior he exhibits while looking. Additional action like a gaping mouth, tongue-wagging, or making comments are inappropriate, and it is quite alright for you to feel uncomfortable with that.

, There are many reasons a man might look at a pretty girl when she walks by. The very act of looking isn't necessarily a rejection of you, just him acknowledging, however unconsciously, that he thinks the other woman is attractive.Men have much more testosterone flowing through their system, which creates a stronger sex drive and leading them to think much more often about sex and physical attractiveness. This doesn’t mean it is always appropriately displayed, but sometimes he really just can’t help but look.It is possible he is doing this to get attention from you. He may be looking because he feels your relationship is missing something. It may not seem like the most mature way to approach his problem, but it can give you both an opening to talk.

, Seeing your husband leer at social media postings can be just as detrimental was watching him stare at women who walk by. These are more deliberate actions, and should be watched carefully.Watch if he hides his phone or computer. If he continues to be embarrassed by his behavior, and tries to hide it from you.
Consider the timing. Many people use their devices and social media accounts as a way to unwind at the end of the day. That being said, if your husband is having conversations late at night, and doesn’t want to share them with you, that is something you should be willing to talk him about.

, If your husband is still looking at other women after you’ve asked him to stop, or has a history of inappropriate activity, then you have a good reason to be concerned about his looking. If you’ve never seen him stare down a woman before, there is already much less to worry about.Consider if you have talked to him about it in the past. If you have already had a conversation about his looking at other women, and he continues to do it, that is a sign of disrespect.
When thinking about past behavior, think also about times when he was loving and thoughtful. If your husband remains committed and respectful towards you, that is a good sign that his looking doesn’t suggest a serious problem in your relationship."

Try and observe sincere actions in a man before getting in a serious relationship with him. Look for things like:


Doing things without looking for a reward or recognition. For example, has he helped someone with something, not been rewarded, and been okay with that? Or has he shown resentment?
Standing up for his own beliefs. For example, has he stated he likes a person but then talks negatively when s/he is not around? Or, is he sincere and sticks up for that person?
Not acting against his stated values. For example, if he has remarked he does not like drunk people, does he avoid getting drunk himself?;
, You want a man who exemplifies honesty in his everyday life; this will, hopefully, translate into his love life. Watch, listen, and learn about how honest of a person he is before you commit yourself to a relationship. A man may lie to get into a relationship with you so it is important to look for a honest partner. Consider:


Do his actions match his words? Pay attention to the things he does, rather than the things he says. Does he say he loves to work out but he never seems to be at the gym, doing sports, or exercising? Look for inconsistencies in what he says and what he seems to do.Trust your own judgement. If you feel like he is lying to you, ask him about it. If he falters or tries to make excuses, he may be dishonest. It is better to voice your concerns then to let them fester., When meeting a potential partner, be sure to talk to him at length.See how open he is with his feelings, opinions, and responses. If he is defensive about his views or gets angry easily when you ask him questions, this might be a red flag in a relationship.

, It is said you can tell a lot about a person by how he treats wait staff.Observe how he treats other people such as waiters, service people, neighbors, and strangers.If he is rude or dismissing what is important, perhaps this may be a red flag on how he will treat you in a future relationship.

, The more time you spend in your man’s company, the less temptation he will have to be unfaithful. When looking for a partner, try to find someone who shares your interests. That way, you can spend quality time together doing something you both enjoy. Consider looking:


At the gym
At a sporting event
At a church or community event
At school/college

, Do not be duped by a man who is already in a relationship who is cheating with you on someone else. When you are interested in entering a relationship, be sure to ask about his relationship status. He may try and hide the fact he is still married or that he has another girlfriend. Be upfront and ask if you two are exclusive. Look for red flags of a man already in a relationship. Watch for:


Him getting defensive or reluctant to show you where he lives.
Not letting you use or see his phone.
Leaving to take or make phone calls when you are out with him.
Canceling plans unexpectedly.

, More 35% men polled reported that they give into the temptation to cheat while away on business trips.When looking for a man, avoid places where a lonely traveling man might hang out, like a hotel bar or restaurant.


Alternatively, if you enter a relationship with a man who travels frequently, be wary of him cheating! Make sure you talk to him about your concerns.

, The old adage of “once a cheater, always a cheater” may be true. Studies have shown that men who have cheated, and not have faced serious consequences of their actions, are more likely to cheat again.If you know, or find out, that your man has cheated, consider looking elsewhere for a faithful relationship.


You can determine if he has cheated on his previous relationships by discreetly looking into his past. Ask mutual friends of his ex-girlfriends to see why they broke up. If he has an ex-wife, consider talking, e-mailing, or social messaging her to see why they divorced.
It’s always a good idea to gather information before you get too serious into a relationship! It might save you a broken heart in the long run.

, This is a good way to observe how faithful he will be to you. Appreciating beauty is one thing, undressing with his eyes or ogling is definitely another! Be wary if he:


Stares at women for an unnatural or creepy amount of time.
Makes flirtatious comments to other women only to pass it off as a joke or insincere later.
Jokes with you or his friends about “how hot” other women are.
Tells you that you should change to look like other women.

, Some men might take advantage of you if you do not state your intentions clearly in a relationship. When you’ve met a man you want to have a relationship with, consider sitting down and having a conversation like:


”We are going to be an exclusive couple, right? I’m not interested in sleeping with another man. What about you?”
”My last boyfriend cheated on me and it made me really angry.”
”Have you ever been cheated on? How’d it make you feel?”

, 92% of unfaithful men said they cheated on their wives or girlfriends because of a lack of emotional connection.Once you are in a relationship, try and keep the emotional spark alive. Consider:


Talking to your partner about what makes him unhappy or unfulfilled.
Surprising your partner with a sexy night in or a nice date.
Tell your partner how much you appreciate him. Give specific examples like: “I really appreciate how sexy you make me feel.”

, There are some behavioral signs that you man might be cheating on you. Watch for evasiveness when you are asking direct questions on where he has been. Also, see if he gets defensive when holding a conversation. If he says things like this, you may be in trouble:


”It’s none of your business who I’m texting/calling”
”Why do you want to see my phone?”
”I’m an adult. I do not need to tell you where I was.”
”Where were YOU last night?”

, You deserve to be with someone who is faithful and makes you happy. It can be a confidence drain if you have been cheated on in the past. Consider seeking a counselor or therapist to build confidence and self-worth before looking for a new relationship. Try these ways to build self confidence:


Cultivate a positive attitude by avoiding negative thoughts or actions.
Practice daily affirmations such as “I am a strong woman who deserves a man who will treat me with respect.”
Surround yourself with a strong network of friends.

"
Decide whether you should forgive the cheater.,
Take time to cool off.,
Don't blame yourself.,
Take stock of your relationship.,
Make sure your significant other is committed to making things work.",How to Forgive a Cheater1," This is the most important step. Before you try to make things work, you have to decide whether it's worth it. No matter how much you love your significant other, you should know that forgiving a cheater may be one of the toughest, most emotionally taxing things you will ever have to do. But if you really want to see if you can make things work, then these are some potential reasons that you could forgive a cheater:


If it was a momentary indiscretion. Maybe you got in a big fight, maybe there was alcohol involved, or maybe he met someone who he thought was really, really special...for a moment. Though there are no great reasons for cheating, if it really, truly only happened once, then you may be able to move past it.
If your significant other is truly sorry. This is a big one. Is your significant other extremely sorry, depressed, emotional, and doing everything he or she can to show you that he or she is devastated by his own behavior and will never do it again?
If you feel like you're giving up if you don't work it out. If you know you have something special and that walking out will feel like calling it quits, then you should try to hang in there to see if you can make it work.
If you have had a long, healthy, intimate, incredible relationship. Though your relationship may not feel so great after you found out your loved one has been unfaithful, if it has been otherwise strong throughout the course of the relationship, then it may be worth saving.
Don't forgive a habitual cheater. If your significant other has done this before, it's time to bow out. Even if you have a home, kids, and a life together, it's just not worth it. What if this is the only time you found out about the cheating, but you've suspected he's cheated a few times before? Then you were probably right.
Don't forgive a cheater at the beginning of a relationship. If you just started dating someone and he already cheated on you, then your relationship's foundation is way too rocky for you to make it through. Feel relieved that it happened early, when it wasn't as hard to let go.
Don't forgive a cheater if the cheating is a sign of a doomed relationship. If you think the cheating happened because you and your significant other have nothing in common anymore, are barely attracted to each other, and are completely failing to make it work, then look at this as an excuse to let everything go.;
, No matter how much you want to talk to, yell at, or even hurt your significant other, don't do it right after you find out about the cheating. If you already had a blow-out after you found out, it's time to sit back and take a breather. If you found out about the cheating, but your significant other doesn't know you know, then you should take some time to reflect as you figure out what to say.


This is a difficult step. You may feel that the sooner you talk about it, the sooner you can start figuring out what to do, but this is not the case. If you jump into a conversation or an argument too soon, you will actually make things worse.
Spend some time going for a walk, working out, or just crying in your room. Do whatever you have to do to release some of your emotions and help yourself think a little bit more rationally.
This can even mean taking a few weeks to spend time away from your significant other. If you live together, this may be especially tough, but if you need to leave, try to stay with a friend or family member or even at a hotel if it's necessary.

, This should be a no-brainer, but it may be one of the hardest parts of the process. Don't think that your significant other cheated on you because you aren't attractive enough, because you aren't communicative enough, or because you're too busy with work or raising your children to take time to focus on your relationship.


Your significant other cheated and that's his or her fault, and nothing you have done should have warranted that (unless you were unfaithful first, but that's another story.)
You should never blame yourself for your significant other's cheating ways, but you can certainly think about ways that your actions have contributed to slowing down the relationship when you take time to reflect on the relationship as a whole.
Furthermore, don't ever let your significant other blame you. If that happens, walk out the door.

, Once you feel more levelheaded, you should think about your relationship with the person who cheated on you. How does the other person make you feel? Can you imagine a future without that person? Has this been a great relationship, or are you just afraid to let go? Here are some more questions to ask yourself:


What is special about your relationship? Are you willing to forgive the person for cheating because you truly want to save the amazing relationship, or because you're afraid to be alone? If you can't think of reasons why your relationship is special, then you should move on.
How would you describe the trajectory of the relationship? Have things been good for a long time and then have suddenly soured, or has your relationship been slowly spiraling downward? Try to think of the reasons that the relationship has been moving in a certain way.
Can you think of how the relationship led your significant other to cheat? Remember, this is different than blaming yourself. Try to think what it is about the relationship that could have made your significant other cheat, whether it's the fact that he's jealous because you're experienced, or because you've been together since high school and ten years later, he's feeling like he settled down too soon.

, Once you've decided that you want to forgive your significant other for the right reasons and that your relationship is worth saving, you have to make sure that your significant other is feeling the same way before you commit to months — or even years — of hard work.


Make sure your significant other is truly sorry. There's a difference between saying sorry and truly being sorry.
Make sure that your significant other is not only sorry, but also committed to moving forward with you.

Ask your significant other what happened. There's no need to get into the nitty-gritty of what exactly happened between him and the other woman. Just get the facts. How many times did they meet, and when did it happen?
Ask how he feels about the other woman. Best answer: ""I feel absolutely nothing for her."" Worst answer: ""I don't know."" Your significant other should not only say he's attached to the other woman, but he should truly feel nothing for her. You will have to pay attention to see what he's really feeling.
Ask him if this has happened before. Though there are arguments against revealing past dalliances or insignificant mistakes to your long-term significant other, since you already know the score, you might as well get as much information as you can so you can make the best decision.
Ask how he's feeling about the relationship. Find out why he cheated, and how he feels about being together.
Tell him how you feel again. Though you should have already communicated and validated your feelings, you can be firm about how you feel once he tells you his side of the story.
Discuss what you can do to make things work. You can be business-like about it and take notes. What will you do to make sure your relationship is stronger and that the cheating won't happen again? Will you spend more time together, be more honest with each other, or find a completely new relationship routine? Will you see a relationship therapist and talk to friends about the problem, or will you try to figure it out by yourselves?
Set rules. If the woman is a coworker, does your significant other have to quit his job? Many relationship therapists say yes. Does he have to communicate with you every hour when he's out? This may feel humiliating for him, but remind him that you're the one who feels humiliated.

, Once you've had an honest conversation about what happened, you can work on making honest communication a part of your daily lives. You should make a point of being open and honest with each other, and of taking the time to listen to what the other person has to say. Here are some ways to work on having open communication:


Make time to talk every week. Be open about what worked in the relationship that week and what you can do to make things better. This shouldn't feel too forced, but like a necessary step.
Make a point of telling each other how you feel. Though you may feel closed off after you found out you've been cheated on, you should work on talking about your positive and negative emotions when you're ready.
Don't be passive aggressive. If you're mad mad about something, then mention it when the time is right.

, Unless the cheating was truly an anomaly and everything is perfect between you and your significant other, you need to work on your relationship. There are many things you can do to help build a deeper connection and to try to start fresh. Here are some things to try:


Pick up a new hobby together. Both of you should try something you have never done before, whether it's rock climbing or ceramics.
Try to share more interests. Maybe you've grown distant because you feel like you have nothing in common and nothing to talk about. Make a pact to read the same book each month, or to watch a new television show together. Even sharing a few little interests can make a big difference.
Work on compromising. Don't let your significant other always get his way, and know that you shouldn't get your way all the time either, even though you're the one who has been cheated on.
Go on a vacation together. Doing something completely new together will give you a breath of fresh air. While a vacation is not a good long-term solution, it can help you feel more of a distance from the cheating. You should only do this once you've had some time to reflect and feel that you want to spend a lot of solo time with your significant other.
Stop blaming your significant other. This may sound impossible, but if you really want to work on your relationship, you can't mention the fact that your significant other cheated every two seconds. You can bring it up when you're communicating about your feelings, but casual jabs about your significant other's cheating behavior will only make things worse.
Minimize your significant other's groveling. Though you may be enjoying the constant compliments, flowers, and shoulder rubs, try to be on even footing as much as you can. Though your significant other is truly sorry, he or she can't spend the entire relationship groveling or trying to assure you of his or her love. It's exhausting.

, This is the easiest way to drive yourself completely insane and to ruin your relationship. If you know who the woman or man is or if you're unlucky to have met her or him or to even run in the same social circles, do everything you can to avoid contact with this person. It's natural if this feels completely impossible, but tell yourself that you should focus on your own relationship, not on what some other person is doing with his or her life.


Don't compare yourself to the other woman. Don't let her make you feel bad about yourself or inadequate in some way. You don't know her situation. Maybe she has fallen for your significant other, or maybe she had no idea he had a girlfriend. Just don't even think about it.
Don't stalk the person your significant other cheated with on Facebook and other social media. Don't search through his or her profile, looking for clues about what that person has that you don't.
Don't stalk the person in real life. Obviously.
Don't talk about the other person to your significant other. Focus on your relationship instead of dwelling on the past.
If you're really obsessing over the other person, you can talk to a friend about it, but you can only take that so far.

, If you have tried everything and are still filled with anger and resentment and can't possibly find a way to move the relationship forward, then it's time to end things. If you can't stand the sight of your significant other, let alone his or her touch, or if you're filled with paranoia any time your significant other is around a member of the opposite sex, it's time to call it quits.


It's much better to end the relationship than to force yourself to stick around in something that isn't working. Your resentment may only grow, and you could end up hurting the other person by cheating, or grow so emotionally distant that communication is impossible.
Remember that even if the person has tried incredibly hard to be the best significant other after he or she cheated, it may have just been too late. Just because the person is trying hard now doesn't mean you have to stick with it if you're just not feeling right.
You can feel proud that you tried to work through something incredibly difficult even though it didn't work. That still took a lot of courage.

Understand that not every phone number that you do not recognize will lead to a person that your spouse is having a cheating affair with. But you might find the proof you need. Call each unrecognizable number and wait to see who answers. If it's someone of the opposite gender from your spouse, explain that you had found their number on your spouse’s, and your phone bill , and were curious as to what it is.

Look for a change in your man’s sex drive.,
See if your man is suddenly showering you with kindness.,
See if he is suddenly much more helpful.,
Look for changes in your man’s mood.,
See if he’s changed his habits around his phone.,
Check out his behavior near his computer.,
Pay attention to his excuses.,
Notice what he says.",How to Find out if Your Husband Is Cheating1," There are two changes to look for here. The more obvious one is that if your man is seeing someone else, he may not be excited about sex anymore. If your sex life has been dwindling for a while, then not having much sex doesn’t mean your man is cheating, but if he used to be excited about getting into bed with you and isn’t anymore, it may be a sign that he’s getting it elsewhere.


Another change you may notice is that suddenly your man has an insatiable sexual appetite. This may mean that his sex drive has become more intense because he’s sleeping with another lady.
See what he’s like in bed. Is he suddenly much more adventurous than before? Has he always stuck to the same routine and is he now trying to spice things up every time you get into bed? He may be getting his moves from another woman.
You should also see if he’s suddenly shy with his body around you and doesn’t want you to see him with his shirt off. If he only wants to have sex in the dark, then it may be because he does not feel right about sharing his body with two women.;
, He may be much nicer to you because he feels guilty for being unfaithful. If he’s been distant or uncommunicative, or if he just isn’t a very demonstrative person, but he’s suddenly being very kind and sweet, and always telling you nice things, then it may be because he’s trying to compensate for seeing someone on the side.


But then again, he could just be being nicer because you are going through a rough patch and he is trying to make it up to you.
If he suddenly brings you flowers, chocolate, and sweet cards, he could just be trying to be bringing back that loving feeling. Alternatively, he may be compensating for cheating.

, If your husband is not normally too handy around the house, but now he’s doing the dishes, doing the grocery shopping, or even doing the cooking, then something may be up. He’s certainly trying to compensate for something, and it may be cheating.


But again, maybe he’s just trying to be nice suddenly, or wants something else from you as a result. Still, when he completely changes his household habits, you should be on the alert.

, If your man is usually moody and is suddenly walking on sunshine, or if he’s normally stable and now goes through erratic ups and downs, then something may be up. If he’s grinning ear to ear and looking off into the distance like he’s thinking of someone else, then his good mood may have nothing to do with you.


Also, look out if he storms home and looks upset, and then tries to blame it on work or something that never made him upset before.
If you see his mood change after he takes a “quick phone call” or reads a text, then another woman may be the reason.

, If he used to leave his phone out on the table for hours, or if he was the type of man who would leave the house and forget his phone all the time, but suddenly he and his phone are inseparable, then something may be up. If he never leaves his phone out anymore, panics when he can’t find his phone, and doesn’t check his texts around you or just acts every shady around his phone, then you may have reason to worry.


If he suddenly put a password on his phone but never cared for privacy before, then something may be up.
If he steps out to take a phone call and comes back looking either upset, excited, or apologetic, you may start to wonder who’s on the other line.
If you walk in when he’s on the phone and he abruptly ends the conversation, then he may be talking to another woman.
If he used to be diligent about answering his phone, and now you can go hours without getting in touch with him, then he may be spending that time with another woman.
If he shuts off his phone for hours and he never used to do that, it is not a good sign.

, If he never cared for the computer much before, but is suddenly spending all of his time online, it may be because of another woman. If he stays up late on the computer after you’ve gone to bed suddenly, or if he abruptly shuts his computer when you walk in, it’s a bad sign.


If you see him on the computer, and his face suddenly lights up, as if he’s talking to a crush, then it may mean he's cheating.
If he does not go on the computer when you are in the room, then he may not want you to see what is on the screen.

, If you and your husband spent most of your free time together, and he's suddenly never around for suspicious reasons, then he may be spending his time with another lady. If he's always having a ""guy's night,"" spending every night late at work, or has suddenly found a passion for a new sport and is spending all of his free time at the gym, then he may be using these excuses to get away with his mistress.


Of course, he could genuinely have picked up a love for a new sport, or he may really have to stay late at work every night, but if he's never done either of these things before and has shown several other suspicious signs, then it may mean that he's cheating.

, Several things that your man can say may indicate that he is cheating on you. Here are some things to look out for:


If he used to complement you all the time, but never complements you anymore, it may be because he is thinking of someone else.
If he wasn't much of a sweet talker before, but is always suddenly complementing you, he may be doing it to compensate for being with someone else.
If he just sounds different, using words you've never heard before, laughing in a new way, or just phrasing his words differently, he may have picked this up from another lady.

"
"
Look for a change in your man’s grooming habits.,
See if he’s paying more attention to his body.,
See if he smells different.,
Notice his body language.",How to Find out if Your Husband Is Cheating2," If your man was never an obsessive shaver or hair-cutter and now he’s always shaving his face, maintaining his hair, and checking himself out in the mirror, then he may be getting ready for another woman.


You should also check to see if he’s starting to shower more often, especially if he does it right when he comes home. This may be because he wants to wash another lady’s scent off of him as soon as possible.

, If your man never cared much about his physique before, but he’s suddenly going to the gym every day, running, or lifting weights in the basement, this may mean that he’s trying to get his body in shape for another lady.


Of course, you should consider other factors: maybe he is having a mid-life crisis and wants to look good again, or maybe he just became motivated to care more about his body.
You should also look out to see if he is suddenly obsessed with his diet. This could also indicate that he is paying a lot of attention to his body for another woman.

, This is a big red flag. If your man smells different suddenly, it may be because his body chemistry has changed from being with another woman. And if he just smells like perfume, girly lotion, or anything else feminine, then this definitely says that he’s been spending time with another woman.

, Your husband's body language can also say a lot about whether he is cheating on you. Even if he says the right things, his body could betray him. Here are some signs that something has changed for him:


Note the amount of eye contact he gives you. If you used to always look into your eyes when you spoke but now always looks away, he may be doing it out of guilt.
Note a lack of affection. If he used to kiss you, hug you, put his arm around you, and let you know how much he cared through his touches but never touches you any more, then something may be up.
See if he turns away from you when you are talking. If he crosses his arms, turns away from you, and does not face you with his body, then he may be retreating because he is uncomfortable.
Notice if he shows you affection when you are alone, but not when you go out. If he is all over you when you are home but he is distant the second you step out the door, it may be because he is afraid his mistress will catch him with another woman.

"
"
Look through his things.,
Follow him.,
Ask if he is cheating.",How to Find out if Your Husband Is Cheating3," Though looking through your husband's things is a quick way to break his trust, if you are sure he is cheating and want concrete evidence, you can try this maneuver. If you really want to know if he's cheating, here are some places to look:


His phone. If he's savvy, you won't be able to find evidence of him cheating on your phone. But if he's not, you can look for an exchange with a woman you've never heard of. He may even not have plugged his mistress' number in his phone -- look for texts and calls to unidentified numbers.
Search his computer. If you really want to know if he is cheating, check out his email or Facebook messages. You can wait for him to step away from his computer when he is logged into email. If he also has started meticulously deleting his emails, that can be a sign that he is hiding something from you.
Search through his stuff. Go through his suitcase, desk, wallet, or even the pockets of his pants for clues.
Check his bank statements. Look out for any time he has spent large sums of money at a restaurant you have never heard of. Check out the dates and think about where he said he was; if he said he was working late one night but spent a lot of money on a fancy dinner right then, which is a reason to worry.

, If you are afraid to ask if he is cheating or have not found enough evidence, you can try following him to see where he really goes. Again, this is another way to lose his trust very quickly. Here are some ways to pull this off:


Don't follow him in your own car. Borrow a friend's car so he does not notice that you are behind him.
Keep a safe distance. Whether you are on foot or in a vehicle, don't get too close, or he'll spot you.
Check in on him when he is not expecting it. If he says he's working overtime or watching the game at a friend's house, ""drop in"" unexpectedly and see if he's really there. Just make sure you have a good excuse for why you just showed up.

, After you have seen enough signs that he is not being faithful, it will be time to talk to your husband about it. Though the conversation will be painful, it's better not to delay it if you really want to have the truth. Here's how you can find a way to ask your husband if he's being unfaithful:


Ask him when he's not expecting it. As long as you are in a private place, you can have the conversation. Don't tell him you want to have a big talk, or he may know exactly what you have in mind and will already be prepared to make excuses.
Tell him that you want the truth. Remind him that he is not doing you any favors by being dishonest.
Show him that he is really hurting you. Let him see how upset the idea of him being unfaithful makes you.

",How to Still Love Your Granddaughter when You Hate Her Tastes," As you're offered a quick cup of coffee, your 12-year-old granddaughter walks in wearing ripped up jeans and a black and red zebra tube top (the tops with no straps) that's only a few inches long. Also in her ensemble is some black eyeshadow, red lipstick, blush, mascara, several coats of eyeliner and more other ""gunk"" that you've never worn in your life. You see her whole midriff. Her hair's in some 'do you've never seen before and she's wearing enormous sunglasses. Completing the look is a pair of red stilettos. She turns around and your eye catches something...a whale tail! The back of a thong sticking up from her jeans. While we as teens wouldn't see any issues, you might. Relax! When she walks in showing off an article of clothing-or a part of anatomy-you don't like, you might be tempted to scream something like, ""Why on Earth are you wearing that? You look like a hooker!"" Don't. She won't pay any attention when you say that, especially in front of people. Instead, try to look shocked. She'll probably say: ""Grandma, it's just a tube top. RELAX!"" You can say, ""No comment."" Later, when you have more privacy, you can casually bring it up again, but NOT after 20 minutes of staring. Just say: ""Is that how teenagers dress today?"" When she answers that it is, just tell her, ""Oh."" Her next move will probably be to ask, ""What's wrong with it?"" Just tell her the truth. If she doesn't seem annoyed, make a quick statement: ""Just asking."" Your dilemma should be somewhat fixed.;
, When she struts in, she's on her cell phone. She nods to you, then yells to some boy down the block: ""What the F---!"" and she's off on a string of words and references you don't approve of. You're shocked. When she's finished talking on her cell phone, tell her: ""I don't like profanity, and you need to learn to watch your language.""

, At dinner, she again gets out her cell phone and begins frantically texting someone. She just won't put the phone down! Why are teens so obsessed with technology? You need to remind her: ""This is not the time to use your cell phone. It's time to eat your dinner."" Hopefully, she'll listen.

, Your first impression might be to go over to her, grab her hand and shove it down by her side, bring her into a corner and yell at her relentlessly. DON'T! Go over and say, ""Excuse me! That was disrespectful!"" Hopefully, she'll understand and stop.

What are you to do when she hooks up to the iPod ready vehicle and scrolls through her playlists until, some song comes on from the top of the charts. You heard it on the radio the other night, and shook your head disapprovingly as the ""family-friendly"" edit was played because it was obvious what was missing. You still hope she's been listening to the edit anyway. Although you're best advised to bring earplugs, you can still say: ""Come on, you have to have another song on that thing! I'd rather listen to something else!""

, Just say, ""I can't believe you're watching that! I'd rather not. Is there anything else?""

, They're much different than they were years ago.

Whether you have been married for many years or a few months, it is important to assess their actions over the course of the time you've known them.Unfortunately, ""staggered disclosure"" is common in these situations, where the cheating spouse confesses to more secrets over time.


Have they been reckless in their financial decisions, their relationships with friends or family, and appear to lack self-control?
Do you feel safe and protected when you're with them, or constantly on edge about their behaviors?
Does finding out that they've cheated seem to simply add to a list of problematic things in the relationship, or does it stand out as an outlier in a seemingly healthy relationship?;
, Cheating is often a sign of something deeper going on in the relationship. Possibly one or both sides is not getting what they feel the need. Identify what your specific needs are to feel loved and appreciated in a relationship.Talking to a counselor, either alone or as a couple, is a good way to uncover these needs or dissatisfactions. You can start right now by considering these questions:


Do you feel appreciated by your partner through their words, physical touch, or appreciative actions?
What do you feel is missing from this relationship? Think about the realistic options to address this concern.
Do you feel like you want to rebuild trust with them?

, Cheating is not your fault. Do not seek to blame yourself for another person's hurtful actions. But avoid feeling debilitated by a sense of shame about what has happened. Focus on building up yourself. Know that you are capable and beautiful.Focus more doing activities that boost your self-esteem. Consider a weekend getaway with your friends, a relaxing spa day, or an adventurous trip to some place new.
Make a list of all the things that make you valuable and desirable, and review this list regularly. Ask trusted friends or family to contribute to it.
Avoid the desire to ""get back your spouse"" by, in turn, cheating on them or seeking out an affair. Ultimately it will not help you or your spouse to rebuild trust and confidence in your relationship.

, While you may be concerned about whether you can trust your spouse, it is important to self-reflect. Being honest with yourself will help you to be honest with them. Reflect on how you feel when you see your spouse, and whether you are willing and able to repair that relationship.


It may help to get away for a weekend to reflect, or to talk to trusted friends and family to help you gain clarity about your feelings.
Is there a formal way your spouse can make amends? What would help you feel that they are trying to repair the damage they have caused?
You are not making a final decision today. At most, you can commit to a period of time to give the relationship a chance, and evaluate how you feel again once that time has passed.

, Do you feel like you can talk with your spouse? Consider listening to whether they accept fault for their own behaviors, or appear to blame everyone and everything except themselves.

Try to listen to their perspective about whether this marriage matters to them.

Do they seem to act only defensive and negative? If so, they may not be ready or able to express what they think or feel about cheating.
After you ask to learn more about their motivations and behaviors, do they seem to blame you or others for their behaviors? This may be a sign that they don't see a problem with their behavior.
Do they apologize for their actions? And do you feel like you can trust their apology? It is important to gauge whether you trust their answers and their apology.

, A healthy relationship is about compromise. Identify whether your partner appears genuinely open to change, or is just trying to please you in order to feel less guilty. A cheating spouse will likely spur a desire for change. Evaluate if your spouse is really seeing change as an option for themselves.Try to rely on concrete evidence, not your gut or what your spouse says. Your spouse's actions are what count, whether they include visiting a counselor, talking to a spiritual advisor, or reading about the behavioral problems and how to overcome them.
Think about change as something that will happen over time rather than overnight.
Understand that some changes such as ending an affair may be different from long-standing behavior issues that your spouse may have. It may be easier for them to end an affair than it is for them to change their fundamental emotional or sexual behaviors.

, You may need to explain in clear terms your expectations of change in your spouse's behavior so that you can trust them. Use a timeline, such as six months or another reasonable amount of time, as a way to determine if trust can be rebuilt.


For example, you may want your spouse to spend more nights with you and your children, and less nights out late at work or with friends. You state that this is a change that you would like to see that can help to rebuild trust. You ask to see your spouse home by 7pm at least four nights during the week. After three months, check on how well your spouse has been following these rules.
If the agreed-upon timeline is not upheld, discuss consequences that could occur. If you feel like you can't trust your spouse, be honest about possible consequences such as separation, if that is what you foresee.
Make sure to avoid empty threats in which you may expect them to change, but continue to cave into their behaviors.

, If you trying to rebuild trust with your spouse, avoid dwelling in the past about previous pain and hurt. Discussing and reflecting on the past is important, but it's easy to get stuck there. Consider scheduling certain times to talk about past problems so they don't interfere with everyday life.


Try taking a more open and positive approach to the relationship moving forward. While this may take time, try making small steps towards positivity. See if your spouse is able to also work towards those small steps with you.
If intrusive thoughts come to you throughout the day, write them down to bring up at a more appropriate time.
If you feel like you can't let go of the past, this may be a sign that the relationship cannot stand going forward.

, For you to feel like you trust your spouse, you may need to openly define what is okay and not okay with your spouse's behaviors moving forward. For example, there may need to be new boundaries in who your spouse can interact with, order to feel less worried or anxious about their actions. You may also want to have access to their phone or emails for a period of time.Each relationship is built around your sense of security and trust. Be honest with your spouse that when they cheat, that sense of security and trust has been damaged. Ask if they are open to certain restrictions in who they spend time with.
For example, you may want to establish a rule that says there should be no contact with opposite-sex friends outside of work unless your partner is present for a period of time.
While monitoring their accounts may seem like too much invasion of privacy, be able to have a open dialogue with them if possible about what you need trust them again.

, If you have decided to stay in the relationship, both of you need to make an effort to keep the good times going. When you feel ready, invite your spouse to share activities and excursions together. You need to reconnect on a personal level, and not only meet to talk about the state of your marriage., Communication about one's thoughts, feelings, and worries in a respectful and honest way can help to guide trust. Don't just rely on your spouse to be more open. Make sure that you both are working towards this. While you may feel less able to be open and honest when you're hurt, avoid closing yourself off completely if your spouse appears ready and able to communicate.Think about the ways that you and your spouse differ in communication. Are you more talkative and expressive with your emotions? Is your spouse more closed off and hesitant to open up?
Be patient with yourself. Effective communication can be tricky when you're upset. If you feel like you can't talk without getting angry and upset, state this and end the conversation until you're ready to be more open. For example, say, ""I want to communicate with you more openly, but right now I'm too angry and upset to do so. I hope that we can continue this conversation in a few hours or later.""

, Find support and guidance from a professional who has helped many couples before. Therapists with training in marriage and couples counseling can help to foster understanding, trust, and open communication. See this as a way to learn how to communicate better with your spouse about your needs and concerns about trust.Many health insurance plans cover some of the costs of counseling. Look at your health insurance plan about costs involved and a list of counselors in your insurance network.
If you would rather pay privately, there may be sliding scale fee options through low-cost counseling centers or private practice therapists. Contact some counseling centers in your area about options.
Consider other counseling resources in your area via churches or places of worship.

, Take care of yourself in mind and body. When you make healthy choices for yourself, you can feel more clear-headed about your relationship and what next steps to take. Do things without your spouse that make you feel better and healthier. Consider these ways to make time for you:Exercise. Go to the gym. Get outdoors. Take walks more often.
Try new clothes and things that may you feel good about your body.
Do mindfulness exercises such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing. This can help to reduce negative thoughts and provide clarity in your thinking.

Speak clearly and lovingly.",How to Set Boundaries for Your Child's Grandparents," Take an inventory of what things the grandparents do and don’t do that upset you. Too much screen time? Too much junk food? Not enough discipline? What would you like to see and why is it important to you?From this list, decide what is really important to you and what you can let slide. Pick your battles and ask yourself whether addressing these things may affect your relationship or your kids’ relationship with their grandparents.;
, Instead of reacting to problems, be proactive in addressing them. Don’t yell at the grandparents after you pick the kids up and they’re wired from too much junk food. Consider talking to the grandparents prior to dropping the kids off or at a neutral time. And there’s no need to be stern or tense, you can make the conversation light and casual.For example, you can say, “I notice that the kids come home really wired after spending time with you. It would be great if you could help us teach them healthy eating as we’re working on that at home.”
You can also say, “We have decided to have the kids participate in more reading and less tv. Would you help us out by encouraging them to read instead of watch tv or play on the tablet? That would help us so much.”

, Grandparents can have strong opinions about little things. From potty training to wearing sunscreen to letting a child cry, the grandparents may interject an opinion lots of places. Instead of getting upset or worked up, acknowledge their desire to give advice.Say, “Thanks for your opinion, I’ll think about that” or, “That’s another way to look at it, thank you.”


Remember that just because someone is offering advice does not mean you have to take it. However, you can still acknowledge their input.

, While the children’s grandparents may infuriate you, be gentle in your approach. If you have feedback for the grandparents, take some time to think about what you want to say and why it’s important. Don’t go in with a list of things they are doing wrong or that you don’t appreciate.Focus as much as you can on the things they do right without immediately jumping into judgments or criticism.


Instead of saying, “The kids come home from your house hungry because they hate your food” say, “Would you like some recommendations on food to serve? The kids can be picky sometimes and I don’t want it to be a problem for you or for them.”

, Consistency is important for children, so talk to their grandparents about rules.Say to the grandparents, “We put the kids to bed at 7pm and wake them up at 8am, and this helps them to get enough sleep each night.” You can also say, “Emma has a hard time going to bed if she has caffeine during the day, so as a family we chose not to consume caffeine. This means not eating chocolate, drinking certain sodas or teas.” Be clear in your family rules and why they should be followed.


You can also say, “It makes our jobs really hard when the kids come back and want to keep breaking rules at our house. It would really help to enforce the family rules and have consistency for the children.”

, Along with consistency with rules, it’s important that children know that punishments that follow breaking the rules will be enforced.Talk to the grandparents about how consequences are handled. For example, if a child does not do homework, then they cannot watch tv. Talk about what actions get what consequences.


Write a list of family rules and consequences for the grandparents so that there is no confusion. If the kids are spending an extended period of time with the grandparents, go over the rules together with the kids and the grandparents so that everyone understands.

, Especially when grandparents shift their way of doing things or show their support in any way, praise them. If your in-laws teach you how to swaddle or a new technique for getting your child to try new foods, thank them. Showing that you recognize and respect what the grandparents do and say can help them to feel appreciated, acknowledged, and useful. Thank the grandparents for their roles in your children’s lives.For example, start by saying, “I really appreciate the time you spend with the kids. It’s important for them to have loving relationships with the family, and I’m so glad you’re there for them.”

, Some grandparents like to show their love by purchasing gifts for the grandkids. If the spending is excessive, ask the grandparents to participate in activities with the kids instead.That way, your kids can build memories with their grandparents while enjoying their time together.


If grandparents live far from the kids, ask them to play a role in the kids’ lives outside of gifts by video chatting, sending audio or video recordings, and sending photo albums.

, If a grandparent does something you’re not okay with, speak up.For example, if a grandparent insists on giving endless advice, say, “I appreciate your expertise. I’ll let you know when I need help” or, “I understand you see it differently, but I’d find it most helpful if you did it this way.”


If you’re feeling heavily undermined, say, “I know you had to figure out lots of things when you were a parent, and I find that to be a fun part. I’d like to figure things out on my own, too, and it would help me if you supported that” or, “I know you have lots to share, but I don’t find this kind of advice helpful. I’m working hard to parent my child the best I can.”

, If you feel worked up over something, don’t react right away. Take a moment to remove yourself from the situation, take a breath, and return when you’re ready. It’s easy to feel like your parenting is being undermined or that the grandparents are overindulging the kids. While this may be true, ask yourself, “Is this worth getting upset over?” Often, grandparents are so thrilled to be a part of their grandkids’ lives and show their love a little too much.Part of what many grandparents look forward to is a little bit of spoiling. If you find a grandparent occasionally slipping a chocolate to your kid, be flexible and find some middle ground.Grandparents want to show their love to their grandkids and mean no disrespect to you or your partner. Usually, it has little to do with you.

, Especially if problems occur with your in-laws, don’t handle this problem on your own. Ask your partner to get involved in the situation.When in the midst of conflict with family members, keep a united front.Agree upon what is best for you, your partner, and your children. When speaking with grandparents, consider speaking together.


Even if you write an email to the grandparents, say, “Me and my partner think it’s best” or, “Your daughter and I agree” so that you communicate that the boundaries are from both of you.

, While you may feel angry and irritated, approach any conversation about boundaries with love.Be clear in what’s important to you and why it’s important. Tell the grandparents that it’s important for your child to have positive family relationships, and that you’d like your role as parent honored.


Say, “I don’t want my child growing up with tension between their family members. We can all act loving together and support this child.”
If a grandparent says, “You’re doing it wrong” or, “I would have never done that when you were a baby,” remember that it’s like that they mean well. Grandparents want to give help and may not be aware of the most appropriate way to do so.Say, “Thank you, I’ll consider that,” or, “I can appreciate your perspective.”

, Tell them what's going on in your life, and find out what's going on in their lives. This is how you get closer to them and make a stronger bond.

Avoid allowing this situation to continue.,

Help them to brainstorm solutions.,
Come to an agreement about less responsibilities for you as a grandparent while still being able to see your grandchildren often.",How to Tell Your Children You Want Fewer Grandparenting Responsibilities," Eventually, it will take its toll and you will be too tired to enjoy the company of your grandchildren and might even take out your resentment on them by being irritable or frustrated all the time. Remind yourself that your health and well-being are also important.;
, This can the case especially where you have been caring for your grandchildren for a few years without finding it challenging and everyone has simply started to take your caretaker role for granted. If you've been putting on a brave face, it's impossible for your children to know what you're really experiencing. As such, don't assume they can read your mind and see just how tiring it has become for you––you'll need to tell them openly and with honesty.


Be aware that many families are so busy and stressed by being busy all the time that they don't necessarily take grandparenting care for granted, but rather assume that if they don't hear otherwise, everything is okay.

, Ask your children over for dinner or drinks when it's a quiet, good time for each of you to meet up. Tell them that you'd like the opportunity to have a chat about the care arrangements for the grandchildren, with their input and ideas.

, Tell them how much you have enjoyed looking after the grandchildren and the things that you've enjoyed the most, such as spending time with them and seeing them grow. Then explain that things haven't been as easy for you lately, that you're beginning to feel tireder a lot of the time or that you're finding the responsibilities more tiring than in the beginning. Some of the things you might like to explain include:


You're worried about your health. Grandparents don't live forever, and if you're starting to have health problems, your children need to know about it.
You're worried about what might happen if you got sick when the grandchildren were around or when there are no other plans in place to care for them.
That you really feel like it's time to cut back on how much you do caring for the grandchildren but still want to stay involved.

, Depending on how much less you'd like to do, you might suggest fewer school nights and more weekend visits. Also, ask about the possibility of after school activities near their home.

, Most children will be understanding and prepared to find ways to make it easier for you.

"
First of all, never disobey your grandparents, even if you may disagree with them.,
Never, ever, argue with your grandparents.,
Everyday, find something about your grandparents to compliment.,
Try to engage your grandparents to talk about themselves.,
Remember special days such as their birthdays, Christmas, etc.,
Try to take care of your grandparents' needs.",How to Live With Grandparents As a Teenager," Whenever your grandparents tells you to do something (e.g. clean the floor, wash the dishes, do your homework): say, ""Yes, grandpa!"" or, ""Yes, grandma!"" with a smile on your face and do it immediately, without delay. Be happy while you are doing it, and make it so apparent that everyone else in the house can tell you are happy. Exceed their expectations by doing the best job you can possibly do. When you are done, ask them if they have anything else for you to do. Repeat the process.;
, Even though you may disagree with them at times, understand that they have had much more real life experiences than you do, and you should show respect for that. Reciprocity works in a way that if you respect their opinions, they will appreciate it and learn to respect yours too! But if you do not respect their opinions, then they will be upset and will likewise not respect yours as well. A vicious cycle will then begin, arguments will beget more argument, until you can no longer live with your grandparents (or anyone else for that matter).

, E.g. ""Grandma, you made such a delightful breakfast! Thank you very much! I wish one day I could make something similar."" Give them a hug or a kiss.

, People like to hear themselves talk. Act very interested in what they have to say. Perhaps you can learn something from their experiences (most likely, you will).

, Surprise them with a gift.

, If your grandparents need to go see the doctors, take them there if you can. If they need to go shopping, go with them if you can. If they need help with work around the house, offer to help them in any way if you can. Living with your grandparents puts you at a position to understand their daily needs; as a teenager, you may have the strength and resources to help them with these needs. Living in harmony with others is all about showing outgoing concerns and taking good care of one other.

Do your research.,
Communicate the new guidelines clearly and thoroughly.,
Encourage them to ask questions.,
Provide an updated list of guidelines when they baby-sit.",How to Update Grandparents on New Parenting Guidelines1," As you prepare to talk with your parents or in-laws about new official parenting guidelines, it’s important to make sure you are providing them with the right information. Doing some research and talking with your pediatrician beforehand can ensure that you are fully informed.


You might ask your child’s doctor, “I know many guidelines have changed over the past several years and decades. I want to make sure the grandparents have the most updated information. Can you provide me with some materials or point me to some authoritative resources?”
Authorities on childcare in the United States include entities such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health. Refrain from taking information from products or services that claim to prevent sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other problems. Follow guidelines as set forth by trusted entities only.;
, Have the talk about new parenting guidelines as soon as you bring your baby home from the hospital or, at least, before you allow the grandparents to provide care. Emphasize the seriousness of abiding by these new guidelines, as failing to do so can be harmful for your child.


You might say, “Mom, Dad…we wanted to talk with you about some updates regarding what’s best for the baby. We know, years ago, it was okay to put the baby down on his stomach or even sleep in the bed with him. To reduce the risk of SIDS, the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends that the baby sleep alone on his back in a crib or co-sleeping attachment in the room with us. The bed shouldn’t have any pillows or bedding that can trap them or cause suffocation. Never let the baby sleep in the bed with you or on a couch or chair. Do you understand?”For older children, you might include addition instructions for riding in the car. “Old advice said it was okay to turn the car seat around after the first birthday, but that’s no longer recommended. Until he reaches age two, the car seat needs to be rear-facing.”, You want to repeat yourself often to ensure you got the message across. Therefore, it’s a good idea to ask if the grandparents have any questions, so that you can clarify anything that is not clear.


Say, “We want to make sure you understand how important it is to follow these policies. Do you have any questions?” Let’s say, your mom asks, “Is it okay to swaddle her?” Use your research to answer such a question: “Yes, swaddling is fine as long as it is not so tight that the baby can’t breathe or move her hips. I’ll show you how.”, New rules take some time to get used to for caretakers as well as kids. A visual reminder like a list can help grandparents remember what you’ve asked them to do differently. Print out a “cheat sheet” of the newest parenting guidelines and give it to them when you leave your child in their care.You might also keep a cliff-notes version of these guidelines on your fridge or in the nursery in your own home, so that your parents or in-laws can see them when babysitting at your house.
Keep your list concise. Focus on the most important guidelines you want your kids’ grandparents to follow, and leave the less important details off to minimize overwhelm or confusion.

"
"
Decide what guidelines you are changing, and why.,
Talk to your kids about the updated rules.,
Choose an appropriate time for the conversation.,
Explain your updated parenting guidelines.,
End the conversation on a positive note.",How to Update Grandparents on New Parenting Guidelines2," It’s a good idea to update your parenting rules periodically. You might want to give your children more responsibility and freedom as they get older. You might also decide to set stricter rules to prevent bad habits or negative behaviors.For instance, you might give a nine-year-old more daily chores around the house, or you might decide to let a sixteen-year-old have more freedom to go out with friends in the evenings.
If you’ve noticed that your toddler acts hyper after eating sugary foods, you might implement a no-candy rule.

, Make sure your kids understand what is expected of them now. Give examples of which behaviors are okay and which ones aren’t. If your children are over the age of five or six, tell them your reasons for setting the rules, too.For instance, help your middle-schooler understand his new bedtime by saying, “I’ve noticed that you have a hard time getting up for school when you stay up late. If you’re in bed by nine, the mornings will be easier for you.”
To help your kids get used to the new rules, role-play different situations with them. This is especially helpful for younger children.

, Avoid talking to your parents or your in-laws when you’re frustrated with how they take care of your kids. Instead, choose a time when everyone is in a positive, relaxed state of mind.Choose a comfortable place to have the conversation. Try chatting at home or over lunch.
Avoid having the conversation when you’re rushed or distracted. If you show that you take this topic seriously, the grandparents will take it seriously, too.

, Tell your parents or in-laws which rules you’ve changed. Make sure they understand why you chose to make these changes.Say something like, “We’ve decided to limit Dan’s screen time to just the weekends because he’s been having a hard time concentrating at school. We’d really appreciate it if you would help us by not letting him watch TV on weekdays when he’s at your house.”

, Express your appreciation to your parents or in-laws. Make sure to emphasize how much your kids love them and look forward to spending time with them.For instance, say, “Thanks for taking such great care of Dan when he visits. He looks forward to it every week, and we really appreciate your help.”

"
"
Work together to find solutions.,
Be vigilant.,
Wait until your child is older before letting them babysit.,
Reinforce rule-following with positive feedback.,
Know when to let something slide.,
Be open to accepting advice.",How to Update Grandparents on New Parenting Guidelines3," Many unnecessary challenges and problems you may face can easily be resolved through effective communication. As with any relationship, these tactics will work best if everyone benefits from the agreed resolution while understanding each other's expectations. Communication is important here so that the grandparents understand what is expected of them.

There is no easy solution. You need to work with the grandparents to identify possible solutions to current or potential issues together.
Both the parents and grandparents can be involved with telling the children about these rules or solutions. Allowing children to be involved will encourage them to learn how to work as a family unit effectively and respectfully. It may help prevent any future miscommunication between family members.
Your children come first, which means that you should be placing the child's needs first. Put any minor parental irritations or annoyances aside. Work out any arrangements so that everyone will be able to identify some benefit from the solution.

, Since it can be easy for grandparents to forget new guidelines and slip back into old ways of doing things, your job is to carefully watch them with your child to verify that they are following updated policy. This also goes for any other caretakers such as other relatives or daycare centers.If you notice a rule being broken, don’t overlook it. Correct the grandparent as soon as possible by saying, “No, Mom, remember there doesn’t need to be any stuffed animals in the crib when you put the baby down. Let’s remove that. It poses a safety hazard.”

, If you consistently spot grandparents making mistakes while caring for your child, or they seem resistant to following new guidelines, it may be in your best interest to delay having them act as caretakers until your child is older. That way, you can minimize any incidents, and give yourself greater peace of mind.

, Make sure your parents or in-laws know how much you appreciate their love and care for your child. Grandparents usually want to spend time with their grandchildren, but they need to feel appreciated, too. When you give them positive feedback, they’ll be more likely to continue helping you out and following the appropriate guidelines.For example, when you spot your Dad placing the car seat towards the rear, you might praise him by saying, “Great job, Dad! You caught on so quickly with these new car seat rules. I feel great leaving Caroline in your care.”

, It may not be possible to keep your household rules completely consistent between your house and Grandma’s house. Decide which issues are most important to you, and be willing to let smaller inconsistencies go without a fight.For instance, you might insist that your parents not give your daughter candy, but you might decide to overlook it if they let her stay up past her bedtime. However, rules that pertain to health or safety hazards should be consistent across environments.
Tell your kids that the rules at their grandparents’ house are a little different from the regular rules. That way, they’ll understand that things like sleeping in and watching movies are special treats they shouldn’t expect at home.

, You might bristle at the thought of letting someone else tell you how to raise your children, but grandparents have years of experience and hard-won wisdom about bringing up kids. When your kids’ grandparents give you advice, listen. Of course, you have the final say in parenting decisions – but you might gain a valuable new perspective from hearing them out.While some advice may be helpful, never negotiate on rules that you have set forth that compromise the safety of your child or your own parenting values. If you continually get unsolicited advice, simply say, “Thanks, Mom, but we’ve decided on how we’re going to handle this situation. I’d appreciate it if you could show your support of our choices. “

As a last resort, you could consider taking your family to court.",How to Deal With Being an Abandoned Grandparent," Go to counseling as soon as possible so you can discuss how the family fracture is affecting you. It's best to talk about this with other people rather than keeping it to yourself, and a counselor is the perfect person to help you.;
, Learn to forgive them, and realize that it is they that have the problem, not you. If they want to block you out of their lives, sometimes there is nothing that you can do about it - it's their loss.

, Start a journal that helps channel your feelings about this matter. You never know, it could end up being a best seller, and if not, it's a great way to get your emotions out instead of bottling them up.

, Just because you are related to someone, doesn't mean they are a good person.

, Start a new hobby and join interest groups. By keeping busy, especially while doing something that you really enjoy, it will help keep your mind off of your grandchildren. Have fun and begin to realize that you can live your life to the fullest, even without them.

, If you'd like, join websites like Facebook and add close friends and family members that you're still on good terms with as your friends. This will help you stay connected to the people that you love and who love you, and it will also help to fill the void in your life.

, Try contacting them, but don't push it as it may make things worse, especially if its an emotional letter. Slowly does it. If they still don't want anything to do with you, step back. Sometimes forcing them to contact you will ruin your relationship.

, Live your own life and trust in Karma to bring balance back into your life. Think good thoughts and do good deeds every single day, because by doing so something good is bound to come back to you.

, Be productive and contribute to your community and you will find a new family to love and fill your life. Sometimes the best family are the people you choose to be in it, not the ones you are related to by some accident of birth or marriage.

, In Australia, the Laws changed in 2006, making it an offense to block access to grandchildren except in the most extenuating circumstances (eg: pedophilia, psychopathy, etc). But, consider the long lasting effects on both your family and yourself if you do go down this path as there is no turning back.

Explain to your kids why it’s important to you and their grandparents. Make sure you talk about tangible benefits appropriate to their age and developmental stage.


Try saying, “Bobby, I am excited you want to spend time with Grandpa. I used to go horseback riding with my Grandpa as a child and those were some of the best moments of my life.”;
, Let your kids play a role in deciding how and when they will bond with their grandparents. Ask them to come up with a list of thing they love to do that they think Grandma would enjoy as well. You can also try asking your kids to write down things Grandpa might be able to teach them.

, Having a weekly meal where your children and their grandparents can get together and talk about the week’s highlights is a great way to encourage bonding between your children and their grandparents. If the grandparents are open to it, invite them to take turns hosting the weekly event. You can even encourage your children to help their grandparents prepare a dish for the occasion.


If the idea of a weekly dinner seems overwhelming, try a monthly gathering where everyone brings a dish or two to share. This will relieve pressure on both guests and hosts.

, Chances are your children are involved in a host of afterschool and weekend activities. Whether it’s a football game, dance recital, or the school play, encourage your children to invite their grandparents to share in these important moments with them. You should also extend the invitation yourself to ensure the grandparents feel welcome at these events.


If your kids are involved in sports, try giving their grandparents a copy of their game and practice schedule. This will allow the grandparents to plan ahead and participate more fully in such events.

, Many grandparents have busy schedules of their own. This often includes working full-time. It can be difficult for them to manage their own schedule as well as those of your children. This is why it’s important to keep inviting them to events and opportunities to get involved in your children’s lives. Just because Grandma couldn’t make it to the ballet recital last month doesn’t mean she won’t be excited to attend this week’s baton-twirling extravaganza., You will need to be clear about rules the children are expected to follow, and may need to ask the grandparents to childproof their home for younger children. Approach the topic in a friendly way by first thanking them for spending time with your kids. Let them know what your rules and expectations are, and listen to their responses while holding back your judgment.Try saying, “Dad, I’m really excited that you will be watching the kids after school this fall. We have some rules the boys need to follow. Do you think we can work together to make sure they follow them at your house, too?
Make suggestions for childproofing. Try saying, “Mom, would it be possible for you to put childproof locks on your kitchen cabinets? I’m more than happy to buy and install them for you.”

, If the grandparents do not have a close relationship with your children, knowing how to interact with the children may be awkward for them. Giving the grandparents some encouragement may help.


Try saying something like, ""Dad, thanks for putting that puzzle together with Jake. I know he really enjoys spending time with you."" Or, ""Mom, I know it's hard to connect with Jenna at her age, but you're doing a great job.""

Plan regular visits.,
Take advantage of technology.,
Write letters and send postcards.,
Update the grandparents on your child’s accomplishments.",How to Encourage Bonding Between Your Kids and Their Grandparents2," When grandparents live far away from their grandchildren, it can be difficult to bond. Planning regular visits can make bonding easier, even if it’s only possible a few times each year. Take the time to have a conversation with your kids’ grandparents about the importance of seeing each other as much as possible. Plan a visit or two in the near future where your kids can have some important face-to-face time with their grandparents.Try saying, “Mom, it is really important to me that you get to spend time with the kids. Would you like to plan on spending several holidays together this year?”

, There are endless opportunities for your kids to connect with their grandparents using technology. From a face time conversation on your smart phone to playing games together on the Internet, kids can bond with their grandparents using a variety of technologies. Try setting up regular Skype dates with your kids’ grandparents, or ask them to set up a Snap Chat account to share silly pictures.Encourage your kids to teach un-tech-savvy grandparents how to use certain technologies.
Ask your kids’ grandparents to post photos on social media and make sure you share photos of your family as well.

, Snail mail is a great way to encourage bonding between long-distance grandparents and your children. Have your kids write a letter to Grandma and send her a package filled with stationary, stamps, and pre-addressed letters to your kids. She likely be excited to start writing regularly to her new pen pals.Encourage your kids to send a postcard to Grandma saying, “Hi Grandma! I’m looking for a pen pal. Do you want to send letters to each other this winter?”

, It may be hard grandparents to get details about your child’s accomplishments and milestones by speaking with them, so you may need to update them on these things.


Try sharing your child’s accomplishments, milestones, and other significant information with the grandparents after your child has finished speaking with them. For example, if your child recently won an award at school, then you might share this information after your child finishes having face time with the grandparents.

Have a sleepover at Grandma’s.,
Plan a family vacation.,
Encourage one-on-one excursions.,
Cook one of Grandma’s secret recipes.,
Encourage Grandpa to share his gardening skills.",How to Encourage Bonding Between Your Kids and Their Grandparents3," A great way for your kids to spend quality time with their grandparents is to plan a sleepover. Sleeping over at Grandma’s can help your child build her independence and confidence being away from Mom and Dad while having fun watching old Disney movies in Gran’s living room., A great adventure to foster bonding between grandparents and their grandchildren is a family vacation. Consider inviting your kids’ grandparents to the beach next summer, or take a weekend trip to the city where kids can visit the zoo and play in the park with Grandpa. If your family loves the outdoors, consider a camping trip at a state park.


To reduce stress, consider booking separate accommodations for the grandparents.

, If you have multiple children it can be challenging for Grandma to get enough time with each of them during her weekly visits. Encourage your children’s grandparents to plan one-on-one excursions with your kids. This can be something as simple as catching a Saturday matinee or a more involved adventure like a weekend trip to see a show on Broadway. Make sure each child gets his or her own one-on-one adventure to avoid jealousy.

, Grandparents have skills that they can share with your kids, presenting a perfect opportunity for bonding between the two generations. Does Grandma have a secret family recipe for spaghetti? Does Grandpa still cook the borscht his mother taught him how to make years ago? Encourage your kids to ask their grandparents to share these skills with them., Hands-on skills like gardening, woodworking, or even bird watching can be a fantastic way for your kids to bond with their grandparents. If Grandpa has a skill set to share, encourage him to show your daughter or son how it’s done. Not only will this facilitate bonding, it will also ensure that the skills are passed on to the new generation.

Interview the grandparents.,
Make a family history scrapbook.,
Make a family tree.",How to Encourage Bonding Between Your Kids and Their Grandparents4," Oral history is a powerful tool for teaching kids about the past. Interviewing Grandma is a great way to not only learn about her life as a young woman, but to pass on family and regional history that might otherwise be lost. Sit down with your child and make a list of questions to ask Grandma about the past. Record the interview using your smartphone and preserve the resulting oral history for future generations.

, Grandparents often have lots of old photos lying around that tell tales about a family’s history. Ask your children’s grandparents to locate old family photos and then make copies of the originals. Using the originals, have your children work with their grandparents to create a scrapbook with the photos and any stories Grandpa might want to share.

, Learning about their ancestry is an empowering and interesting endeavor for kids. Consider asking your kids’ grandparents to sit down with the children and sketch out a family tree. This will give Grandma an opportunity to share stories about her parents and grandparents that she might not otherwise share.

Revisit your start together.,
Pick a gift that builds on the familiar in a new way.,
Go outside your comfort zone.,
Use what you have learned.",How to Select a Proper Gift for a One Month Anniversary1," True enough, it’s more awe-inspiring to recreate your first date after you’ve been married ten years rather than dating for a month.That said, even in the span of thirty days your relationship has surely developed in terms of comfort level and knowledge of each other. Replaying your first night out, or the moment when you gathered up the courage to ask your sweetheart out on a date, can demonstrate how your bond has strengthened and build excitement for further growth moving forward.


Wear the same outfits, go out to the same restaurant, sit in the same spot in the theater, and so on. Laugh about the nerves and awkwardness then and the increasing amount of comfort with each other now.
If you want to further emphasize the “looking ahead” part while reminiscing, present a gift during the date that you wouldn’t have known your partner liked a month ago.;
, You’ve probably been out to dinner several times already, and may have already gotten into a routine of “your places.” Why not try a new style of food neither of you have had before, or switch it up even further and hire a personal chef for the evening? Another option is taking a cooking class, where you get to eat what you cook and spend quality time together.


If, for instance, you both drive each other around a lot and have a friendly dispute over who is the better driver, settle it at the nearby go-kart track.

, If you're dating someone and he or she likes ice skating or canoeing and you don't know (or don't think you want to know) how to do it, try it! Doing so will show your significant other that you are interested in growing as a person in the relationship.


Alternatively, you can both agree to go outside your comfort zones together. It doesn’t have to be as extreme as skydiving (although that might be an awesome gift); maybe just doing a duet at karaoke night will bring you closer together. The options are truly endless., Whether you’re trying to decide between chocolates or flowers, or a hike or a shopping trip, draw from your experiences with your significant other. What likes and dislikes of theirs have you found out about? How do they like to spend their leisure time? What do they talk about trying or seeing “someday”?Make a conscious effort to take note of things that they like. Over the last month, you have probably heard your partner mention things that they really like. Think back to what those things may have been to help you choose your gift.
If you need a bit of help but still want to surprise the person you are dating, ask their friends if the potential gift is a good idea.

Put your technology away and set it to silent.,
Discover and share mutual interests.,
Try your hand at grandma's hobbies or learn a new skill.,
Suggest a change of pace.",How to Have Fun with Grandma1," Technology can be very distracting, both for you and grandma. Turning off your alerts and putting away your electronic devices will show her that she has your full attention. Have grandma do the same by saying something like:""Hey grandma, I don't want any interruptions today while we're hanging out, so I thought we could turn off our devices and do something else.""
""Grandma, you've been using your iPad for quite a while. Is there a game or an activity we can both do together?"";
, You never know when you and grandma might have something in common. You might both have a deep love of music, art, sports, reading, and so on. They only way to find out is to ask. Tell grandma about your interest, and ask about hers as well saying things like:""My English class has been reading the book Of Mice and Men. Do you like that writer, John Steinbeck?""
""I joined the dance team last week, and I'm having so much fun. Do you have a favorite dance? Could you teach me how to do it?""
""Grandma, today I want to do something we can both enjoy. Maybe we could play a board game in the park or go bird watching. What do you think?""

, If you think some of grandma's hobbies and skills, like sewing, crocheting, baking, and so on, are too old fashioned for you, you could be missing out on fun without knowing it. Give these activities a shot. At the very least, your grandma will likely appreciate you taking an interest in the things she does.Many of your hobbies will be too difficult or strenuous for your grandma. By picking up one of her hobbies, you'll both be able to have fun doing something together.
Puzzles and tabletop games, like cards or board games, will be less physically difficult for your grandma and can be a lot of fun.
Some common skills your grandma might be able to teach you includes things like making jam, writing shorthand, mending, and more., Your grandma probably has a daily routine that doesn't change very much. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but doing something different could be exciting and fun for both of you. Ask your grandma if she'd be interested in:Going on a photo safari. Use your camera or phone to hunt for interesting pictures, like a red bird, a three-legged dog, or a bird wearing a bread crust necklace. You could even turn your safari into a competition.
Visiting a local museum or art exhibit. Many museums have kids sections, so if you're younger, there will be something fun to do for you and grandma both.
Heading to the library or community center for local events, like movies, game nights, book clubs, and more.

Are you seeking the right to spend time with your grandchild? Do you want the court to establish a visitation schedule? Are you seeking full or partial custody of the child? While it varies by state, all courts will consider what is in the best interest of the child. When determining the best interest of the child in a custody case, courts will try to determine:


What arrangement will foster the child’s happiness, feeling of security and mental and emotional development.
Court’s may consider the child’s wishes.
Other sibling’s custody arrangements.
Accessibility to school.
Parental abuse or addiction.
The need for a continued and stable home environment.;
, Some grandparents will try to use the courts to reestablish their visitation with their grandchildren after a change in their relationship with the children’s parents, divorce or the death of one parent. While state laws vary on the circumstances under which grandparents can be awarded visitation, generally courts will evaluate the following:


The relationship between the grandchild’s parents and whether they are both alive. Specifically, if the parents are happily married and the child is healthy, the courts will rarely overrule a parent’s decision to deny the grandparents access to the children. If however, a parent has died or become incapacitated and the healthy parent has unwarranted animosity against the grandparents, the court may choose to intervene.
The relationship between the parents and the children.
The relationship between the grandparents and the children.
Ultimately, the court will determine whether it is beneficial to the child to have visitation with their grandparents.You can review a state-by-state summary of laws impacting grandparents’ visitation and custody rights here: http://family.findlaw.com/child-custody/summaries-of-state-law-grandparent-visitation-and-custody.html.

, It is much more difficult for a grandparent to be granted temporary or permanent custody of a grandchild if the child’s parents are still alive. If a grandparent petitions a court for custody, the court will still make its decision based on what is best for the child. However, grandparents must demonstrate extraordinary circumstances to win custody, such as:


Child abandonment;
Child abuse; or
Child neglect.Some states will only allow grandparents to petition for custody if they can demonstrate that they have been acting in loco parentis to the child, meaning that they have been acting as a parent for a certain amount of time. The courts will look to see whether the child has been residing with the grandparent for an extended time when determining if the grandparent has a custodial right over the child.Typically, courts will not grant custody to grandparents over a parent’s objection unless the parent(s) are shown to be unfit., Family law disputes can be very complicated, particularly custody disputes that are in opposition to a parent’s wishes. As the law favors parental custody and parents’ right to determine with whom the child has a relationship, grandparents are at a significant legal disadvantage. If you cannot work out a visitation schedule amicably with the parents, however, you may feel that going to court is your only option. You need to hire an experienced family law attorney to handle your case.

, Once you have decided to hire an attorney, your next step is to find an experienced and reputable family law attorney that can help you with your case. You can locate attorneys in a number of ways, including:


Referral from friend or family member. If someone you know used a family law attorney, you can ask them whether they would recommend that attorney. A recommendation from a trusted person who has personal experience with a family attorney is a good place to start.
Local or state legal bar associations. Local and state bar associations often provide referral services to attorneys in your area. Through state bar associations, you can check whether any complaints were filed against your prospective family law attorney. The American Bar Association has compiled a list of state-by-state resources that can direct you to attorney referral sites, such as contact information for state bar associations. The ABA provides this information at http://apps.americanbar.org/legalservices/findlegalhelp/home.cfm


, After compiling a list of local family law attorneys consider evaluating their experience, credentials, and reputation in the legal field. You can do this in the following ways:


Determine whether any complaints had been filed with state bar associations.
Read through their website to make sure they specialize in family law.
Examine their educational background.
Read reviews about the attorney.

, Once you identified several reputable family law attorneys in your area or in the area where the case will be filed, you should consider meeting with these attorneys to discuss your legal needs. Often, attorneys will provide a free consultation for potential clients. You should be prepared for your first meeting with the lawyer in the following ways:


Bring copies of any documents, photographs or information that is relevant to your case.
Ask for an explanation of the fees and costs associated with a lawsuit and how often you would have to ""refill"" a retainer.
Ask the attorney about their experience bringing visitation or custody cases on behalf of grandparents.
Ask the attorney about their experience bringing cases in the particular jurisdiction where your case will be filed.
Ask the attorney about the legal process and an estimate on how long the process will take.
Ask the attorney who in their office will keep you informed about the case and how best to contact them with questions.
Be open and honest about all of the facts that are relevant to your case.
Take notes during the meeting., If you choose to hire a lawyer, you will be asked to sign a retainer agreement, which is an agreement of services and fees between you and your attorney. Often you will be asked to pay a certain amount of money upfront for family law cases. You should read the retainer agreement very closely and ask the attorney to carefully explain the agreement. In evaluating a retainer for services, consider the following:


Is the agreement in writing? You want any agreement for services and fees to be in writing. While most states require retainer agreements to be in writing, some places do not. If your agreement is not in writing, an attorney could try to argue that they never represented you, which could pose a significant problem if they missed deadlines or did not handle your case appropriately.
Check whether the law firm conducted a conflict of interest search. You want to make sure that your attorney discloses any relationship that the law firm may have had with any party or witness in the case.
Does the agreement specify the scope of the work for which the attorney is being hired? For example, does your agreement include any appeals that may arise from your case? Does it set forth the cost for phone calls or experts. You want the agreement to specify the scope of work that they attorney is being hired to perform.
Does the agreement state how potential legal disputes between you and your attorney will be handled?
Does the agreement specify your right to terminate the attorney’s representation and describe how the termination will be handled?, While state laws vary with regard to what options a grandparent has in seeking visitation and custody, there are a variety of options that you should discuss with your attorney and determine what is best for you and your grandchild.


Temporary Custody is when you petition the court for custody for certain amount of time. If the parent is temporarily unable or unfit to care for the child, you can petition the court for temporary custody, which the parent could not terminate without going to court.
You can seek legal guardianship, which means you authority over the child until the child is 18. While parental right do not have to be terminated, a court would have to change the guardianship status if it was given.
If the child is already in your custody and you do not believe the parent will ever be fit, you can seek to terminate the parents’ rights and adopt the child yourself. This offers the most permanent form of legal custody. However, parents usually have to willingly terminate their rights or the conduct has to be so bad that the court views this as a last and only resort. It is very difficult to have someone’s parental rights terminated.You can also seek court-ordered visitation rights, rather than custody. Most states allow for grandparents to petition for visitation rights. However, after the Supreme Court ruled that overbroad or permissive laws allowing grandparents visitation violated a parent’s right regarding the care and custody of his or her child, state courts have given more consideration to a fit parent’s decision regarding visitation., Generally, you will file your petition in the family court where the child resides. You can locate this court by conducting an internet search that includes the name of the state and county where the child resides and the search terms “family court.”If there is an ongoing custody case, you will file your petition at the same court hearing the custody dispute.

, Most courts require that a grandparent file a petition with the family court when seeking either visitation or custody. Generally, courts will have a petitions for visitation or custody forms on their court website. You or your attorney, if you hired one, will file the petition in the jurisdiction where the child resides.


To locate the appropriate forms, conduct an internet search of the name of the county where the child lives, and the search terms “Family court” and “custody petition.”
Depending on the court, you may also be required to file a summons or citation for serving your case and/or a motion or petition asking for permission to intervene if there is an ongoing case.
You can also contact the family law court clerk and ask where you can locate the appropriate forms.

, While each state has different requirements for a non-parental custody petition, generally you will need to provide the following information:


Your name, address, and relationship to the child.
The name, address, and relationship information for the child’s parent(s).
The name and age of the child(ren) for whom custody is sought.
Jurisdiction information setting forth where all of the parties reside.
Statement that the parties were served the petition.
An explanation of why the court has jurisdiction over the case.
Information setting forth where the child resided for the previous five years and with whom.
Justification supporting claims to custody or visitation.
Information regarding health insurance and child support.
A statement of the custody or visitation that you want the court to grant., You should file your complaint in the appropriate jurisdiction, typically in the county where the child resides. You should follow the rules for your specific court or contact the court clerk and ask what you need to do in order to properly file your petition. Generally courts require the following:


Bring at least one original and two copies to the court clerk.
Submit the documents to the court clerk for filing. The clerk will stamp all of the documents as filed, return the copies to you and keep the original.
Pay a filing fee. Most courts will require that you pay a filing fee to commence an action. You should bring the fee in the appropriate form to the court at the time of filing. You may also be able to file for a waiver of the fee.Keep two extra copies of the petition for your records.

, After you file the petition, you must legally provide a copy to the child’s current guardian (the respondent) in a manner set forth by state law. It is imperative that you properly serve the defendant or your lawsuit may be deemed invalid.Personal service, which means that a person over the age of 18 personally hands the document to the respondent and fills out an affidavit describing the service. Depending on the state, process servers can include friends, family members, professional process servers, or law enforcement personnel.
Service by mail. Many jurisdictions allow you to serve parties to a lawsuit by mail. Typically, you would send the document by U.S. mail, “return receipt requested,” so that you can demonstrate for the court that the document was delivered to the residence of the respondent., After serving the petition, most courts require that you file a document demonstrating proof that the respondent was properly served. It is very important that you submit this document because it is often used to start the time period for when the respondent must file a response.

, In most cases, the parents have 21 or 30 days to respond to your petition. If you do not receive a copy of that response, ask the clerk to provide you with one. If they do not respond, consider filing for a Default Judgment in which the court grants your requests that are within the court’s powers to grant. A Default Judgment is simply an order from the court that grants you things you requested because the other party did not argue against it.
If the other party is not in the court’s jurisdiction, the court may not have the power to order that person to pay money, such as support, or take certain actions.

, After you have served the complaint on the respondent, you can request that the judge schedule a hearing to determine the custody of the child or visitation rights of the child. Contact the clerk of your court to learn the process of scheduling hearings in your court. Once the hearing is scheduled, you will need to notify the other party of the date of the hearing. Ask your clerk if your court has a form for that. The Notice of Hearing should include:


The date of the hearing.
The time of the hearing.
The location of the hearing.
The name of the judge who will conduct the hearing.
The amount of time the hearing is anticipated to last., After a petition is filed, the case moves into the “discovery” phase. During this pre-hearing phase of the case, both parties will seek information and facts from each other, as well as non-party witness who have information about the case.


Attorneys for the petitioner (grandparents) and the respondent will send formal, written questions and requests for documents. Your attorney will meet with you to respond to these requests and you may have to sign a verification swearing that you answered the questions truthfully.Attorneys will take depositions of individuals who have information about the case. Most often, attorneys will depose people who they may potentially call at trial. Witnesses must answer questions under oath and in front of a court reporter.
Sometimes you can require a party or child to undergo medical or mental health examinations

, Prior to the hearing, both parties will submit to the judge and each other a list of the evidence, testimony and experts they intend to use/call for the hearing. These disclosures may include:


Lists of witnesses to testify at trial and the topic of their testimony.
Lists of physical evidence you will present at trial.
Lists of experts (psychologists, etc.) who will be testifying at trial and what they will be testifying about., Each state court and federal courts have procedural rules that all parties must follow when bringing a case to court. Below is a list of potentially relevant procedural rules and where to locate them.What kind of evidence is admissible.
How to get admissible evidence entered.
Allowable methods of questioning witnesses.
You can locate the relevant rules by conducting an internet search with your state name and “rules of civil procedure” and “rules of evidence.”
You can locate local court rules by calling the court clerk where your case is being heard.

, Some family law courts require parties to a custody or visitation dispute to engage in mediation. During mediation, a neutral third party tries to negotiate an agreement between you and the parents. #*The goal of mediation is to get you and the parents to agree to the rights you should have as a grandparent and how those rights will be exercised.If mediation is successful, your attorneys or the mediator will prepare any necessary documents and submit them to the court for signature. This would likely end your trial if it was successful on all issues.
If mediation is not successful, you simply proceed to trial.
In most states, mediation is confidential, and nothing said in mediation can be used or disclosed outside of the mediation process. In a few states, the mediator makes a recommendation to the court, and there is no confidentiality in the mediation process., When appearing in court you want to dress in a professional manner. If you are a man, consider wearing a collared shirt and a tie. If you are a woman, considering wearing dress pants, a nice blouse or a dress.

, Generally, custody hearings will proceed in the following manner:


Opening statements of the petitioner followed by the opening statement of the respondent. During an opening statement, the attorneys for both parties lay out the facts of their case and tell the judge what they will prove during the hearing.
Witnesses called by the petitioner and cross examined by the respondent followed by witnesses called by the respondent and cross examined by the petitioner. Both parties will have the opportunity to present witnesses to support their version of the case. The opposing party will then have the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses and attempt to show that they are not credible or that they are biased.Closing arguments by the petitioner followed by closing arguments by the respondent. After both parties have presented their cases, each side will have the opportunity to give final arguments on the case.
Ruling by the judge. The judge will consider all of the evidence and make a ruling that he or she feels is in the best interest of the child., If the judge ruled that you have no rights as a grandparent, you can generally appeal to a higher court. Talk to an attorney to see if you may have grounds to overturn the ruling. You must usually file your appeal within 30 days of entry of the order. Check your state’s rules of appellate procedure to verify the time frame and procedure for appealing."

Decide when your anniversary is.,
Discuss the option of giving gifts to one another.,
Don't go overboard.,
Think carefully about shared gifts.",How to Select a Proper Gift for a One Month Anniversary2," This might sound silly at first, but couples can get confused over this question. Did the relationship begin the night you met, on your first date, or when you both decided to become exclusive? Asking this question shows that you are committed to the relationship.If you want to keep your gift a surprise, or are simply too embarrassed to ask, try to figure out which potential anniversary seems most significant to them. Which moment do they talk about most? If all else fails, choose the earliest potential day — it’s better to be early with your gift than to make it seem like you forgot!

, Especially this early in a relationship, who wants to be in the situation where one of you has a nice gift and big plans, while the other has … no idea what’s going on? Even if having a discussion eliminates the possibility of a surprise, it can reduce a lot of the stress and guesswork that may be occurring as you try to decide if you should get a gift (and what to get if so).There’s no rule that says you must celebrate a one month-anniversary, or that you must buy a gift. If you’d both honestly just like to let it pass without making a fuss, that’s fine. Or, if you decide gifts are okay, but want to keep clear limits — under $20; homemade only; etc. — that’s fine too.
For practical reasons, It may be important to let your girlfriend or boyfriend know that a gift is on its way, especially if you are buying tickets or if your gift is expensive. Also, you both might be planning something and the plans might conflict with each other.

, A one-month anniversary is an important milestone to celebrate, but it also still signifies the beginning of a relationship. Do not try to outdo the gift you are receiving, because it sets the bar at a place that may be tough to top. Something personal and creative always beats a gift that broke the bank.You may end up regretting it later if you jump immediately into the bigger gifts at the beginning of your relationship. If you buy your sweetheart a gold bracelet to celebrate one month together, what are you supposed to buy eleven months from now — the Hope Diamond (curse notwithstanding)?

, Of course you want to be optimistic and expect your relationship to continue for a long time. But stop and think before making any long-term shared investments — like getting a dog together or asking your partner to move in with you. Untangling yourselves from a shared circumstance like that can make even an otherwise pleasant breakup a messy affair.


If you want to share something as your gift, share an activity together.Take a cooking class. Learn to ballroom dance. If you do break up, one of you can always switch classes!

"
"
Make a gift instead of buying one.,
Give something with personal or sentimental value.,
Spend time together helping others.",How to Select a Proper Gift for a One Month Anniversary3," Even simple homemade gifts can often mean even more than a gift you purchased in a store. You can make them more personalized and it shows a lot of additional effort on your part to make something. If “it’s the thought that counts” is indeed true, then the thought and effort you put into your homemade gift will warm your significant other’s heart.For instance, if you have never cooked for the person before, give it a try. Even if your risotto turns out better suited as brick mortar, you can laugh about it over a pizza later on.
Once more, listen and learn. What does your partner like? Make something special that shows you’ve been paying attention.

, Is it too old-fashioned to give your class ring or letterman jacket to your high school sweetheart? Maybe, maybe not. But giving something that has special meaning to you lets the other person know that you care and that you want things to continue for the foreseeable future.


You know that old, faded, but ridiculously comfortable sweatshirt that your significant other likes to borrow when you’re watching TV? Why not make a gift of it?
Be realistic, of course. A one month anniversary doesn’t generally warrant giving away a family heirloom like your grandmother’s ring.

, Why not make your gift something that will help both of you be better people and improve the lives of others? Seek out volunteer opportunities in your community. Help clean up a playground. Spend time with seniors or shelter pets. Collect food for the needy. This gift will provide rewards for both of you and many others.


Think about a cause or issue that your partner is very interested in or concerned about. Try to find a way that you can spend quality time together supporting that cause.

Master popular family recipes.,
Help grandma in the garden.",How to Have Fun with Grandma2," Before computers, cell phones, and TVs became common, people had to find fun things to do in their free time. Your grandma probably learned many seasonal crafts, like apple picking, making Christmas tree ornaments, making leaf rubbings, making daisy chains, and more.

, Baking is an activity many grandmothers enjoy, and yours might too. As an added bonus, when you finish baking, you can look forward to a delicious treat. Ask your grandma if you can bake your and her favorite recipes together.


While baking, you'll have plenty of time to talk, but you can also groove to music at low volume. You could even alternate between your favorite albums and grandma's.
This is also a good opportunity to help grandma out. Often, you'll need special ingredients for certain dishes. While at the store, ask grandma if there are any heavy groceries she needs help with.

, Your grandma has had a long time to perfect her recipes and become a cooking pro. By learning popular family recipes, you'll be preserving your family traditions while having fun in the kitchen.


Small adjustments to recipes are often what makes them special. Ask your grandma what she does differently or adds to family recipes to make them taste so good.
You never know when a recipe and cooking lessons from grandma might come in handy. Your friends or significant other might be impressed by your skill in the kitchen.
If your grandma is a fan of cooking shows, you and grandma might have fun pretending that you are putting on your own cooking show as you make family recipes., Digging into the soil and working with plants has a relaxing and uplifting effect.Spending time with grandma in the garden might feel like work, but really you'll be creating something beautiful while you and grandma receive the benefits of working in nature.


If your grandma doesn't have a garden, you could buy her some potted plants and help her care for these. A small indoors herb garden can add color and life to her home while still being useful.
If grandma doesn't have space for potted plants, you might consider making her a living wall. This can be given as a gift, and then you both can enjoy caring for it together.

Respect cultural differences.,
Talk to grandma in a way she can understand.,
Take your time.,
Cut your losses when necessary.",How to Have Fun with Grandma3," In some cases, your grandma might live in another country and have a very different culture from what you're used to. But also, many grandmas are old enough that the culture today is very different from what they grew up with. This can make grandma feel out of her element. To respect cultural differences you can:


Avoid judging or making jokes about grandma. Even if some things she does seem weird in your home culture, she probably thinks the same thing about your culture.
Get to know your roots. Learning the meaning and history behind family traditions can be very interesting, and is also a way you can show respect., Some grandma's may have no difficulty following the lingo used by you and your friends. Other grandma's might struggle to understand, have difficulty hearing, and so on. You should talk with grandma clearly, choosing words that aren't slang.


You might say, ""Hi grandma! How are you? I'm good. I've been busy with school. My favorite subject is English. What was your favorite subject when you went to school?""
Instead of avoiding fun new slang words and terms, grandma might be interested learning fun, popular expressions and using them herself.
You might teach grandma slang by explaining, ""I'm sorry, you might not be familiar with that expression. When I said ""to' up"" I meant ""tore up"" or ""ruined."" ""
If your grandma is hard of hearing, you might get a little frustrated speaking with her. When you start feeling frustrated, imagine how happy you would be if someone took time to talk to you if you were hard of hearing.

, Grandma has spent her entire life working and taking care of people. It's only natural that at this point in her life she wants to take things easy and relax. When you push grandma to do too much, it can sometimes cause her to get cranky or overwhelmed.If you feel yourself rushing, you can slow down by breathing slowly in and out on a 10 count. Inhale deeply and completely as you count from 1 to 10, pause for a moment, and then exhale completely as you count to 10 once more., Sometimes, nothing you say can change your grandma's opinion on a thing, even if she's wrong. Then again, if you spent most of your life believing something, it might turn into a habit that's hard to break, just like grandma. When you find a conversation is going nowhere and beginning to frustrate you, change the topic by saying things like:


""Grandma, I love spending time with you, but talking about this is starting to make me feel uncomfortable. Could we talk about something else?""
""We can agree to disagree, but I hear what you're saying. Let's talk about something different. How have your hobbies been going? Have you made any new crafts?""

Be patient if your grandchild gets upset, throws tantrums or cries a lot.,
Reassure your grandchild that he or she is loved.,
Help your grandchild by explaining what it's like to be and have siblings.,
Consider exploring the ways in which your grandchild can help raise his or her sibling.",How to Help Your Eldest Grandchild Cope With New Siblings," In particular, you can look after your grandchild at times when the parents need some more time to cope with the new addition to the household. This will have the dual benefit of giving them time much needed to bond with the new child and will help spare your grandchild from having to sit around feeling left out when fuss is being made of the newborn.

Prepare for the next steps for your grandchildren.",How to Cope with Being a Parent to Your Grandchild," Seniors often have insight, patience, maturity, and wisdom that they did not have when they were younger. Unfortunately, there are a lot of fears about older people raising grandchildren that are stereotypes more than reality. In reality, older people are often in a very good position to raise children. Often just as much as younger people.


If you are reading this, you are likely in reasonably good health--you are not a frail old person in assisted living.
Senior citizens can and do use modern communication technology such as cellphones, the Internet, and so on. Perhaps it may not come as easily to you as your 9 year old, but that does not mean you cannot master the fine art of texting. In fact, the more sophisticated devices become, the easier they often become to use.
Older people are increasingly living longer, healthier lives. You may not have 50 years left, but there are no guarantees that a 30 year old will live to 80, either. It is a reality that you may not be around forever - but you are here now, and that is what matters.
You have experience. It is not easy to be a first-time mother. You, however, may know just what works for soothing a cranky toddler or comforting a teenager who has been dumped for the first time...because you have been there before. Some things really do not change over time.;
, Becoming guardian to a grandchild means you may have to re-think your plan. You may have been expecting to retire, and have the responsibility of child-rearing in the past. This also could be a sudden change, such as if an adult child cannot raise her child, or is killed in an accident. You may feel very positive about this change, or not so much, or maybe a mixture of a lot of feelings.


Your social life may change. While you bring your grandson to Little League, your friends may be hanging out at the Early Bird Buffet Special. Becoming part of the parent community will probably have you develop relationships with younger adults who are likewise raising children. This does not mean that you will never see your senior friends again, only that it will be a bit different.
Family dynamics may change. Suddenly, you may no longer be the grandfather who babysits once in a while. You have to deal with actual discipline issues, dealing with budgets, and so on.
You may have to resolve some longstanding issues if there were parenting issues in the past. For instance, your daughter and you fought a lot when she was a teenager, she ended up overdosing on drugs, and now you fear the cycle will repeat.

, Many families need a little help when big changes happen. It may be helpful to talk to other grandparents raising grandchildren, or attend a parenting workshop to help you refine your discipline skills. Also, if your children have had traumatic situations, they may benefit from therapy or counseling.


Check your local newspaper for support groups.
Craigslist.org can also be a source
Many churches and other places of worship can be a resource. For instance, your rabbi might be able to introduce you to a family who also is headed by a grandmother.

, Ask open ended questions and try to think hard how your grandchildren think, what matters most to them, what excites them, what they care for, what are their dreams and very importantly how they want to achieve their goals / dreams. Listen intently for some hints as to the concerns they might have; never ask for it (a child may be blissfully ignorant about it).

, This will help you to understand their world far better that you imagine, without talking to them.

, Remind yourself often that lecturing is not adequate and you need to deliver information and guidance in the way child needs it. Otherwise, you will make things difficult for the family, and more importantly, for the child. Define it as a purpose of life.

, Schedule your day around their activity schedules. For enjoying there company, your energy levels need to be high, and plan your schedule accordingly.

, Let the child know that he/she can depend on you, and see the world starts changing for them. Try to notice (don't ask) whether the child is willing to take up challenges similar to his peer group or is shying away. If she/he is shying away or unsure of taking up such challenges, you need to involve yourself more, as this is a clear indication that child is still not depending on you or unsure of your support.

, Don't forget to celebrate with them the successes that come your way. This will surely be a reminder for your grandchildren to rush to you whenever they need anything.

, Show readiness to go for it. Your grandchildren will feel the safety and security of their dreams and requirements in your being around them.

When a couple has reached the decision to have a vow renewal ceremony to commemorate a 25th or 50th anniversary, there are many things one can do to throw a simple or elaborate party.,
Certainly if a couple would rather not receive gifts that's ok, if they would rather share their gifts of commemoration with donations being given to a favorite charity in lieu of gifts that's fine and very commendable, but in no means must they be told they should not accept what friends and family would like to choose to do for them by insinuating its wrong, rude or wrong etiquette.

Consider appealing.",How to Get Grandparents Rights in Ohio," Family law is very detailed, and judges have quit a lot of discretion. Many things are likely to impact your case. Further, there is some tension between Ohio law and a US Supreme Court Decision regarding grandparents’ rights. If you can afford to hire a local attorney, you should do so. See How to Find a Good Attorney. If you can’t afford an attorney to represent you, consider hiring one to provide unbundled services. These services include:


Preparing documents
Giving you legal advice
Teaching you the law as it applies to your case
Coaching you through the process.;
, The US Supreme Court has ruled that courts cannot require grandparent visitation over the parents’ objections in most cases. The Ohio Supreme Court has determined, however, that Troxel does not apply to the Ohio grandparent visitation statutes. This determination has not yet been challenged to the US Supreme Court. In Ohio, grandparents rights exist where the grandparent has an interest in the wellbeing of the child and the visitation is in the child’s best interest. Grandparents can ask for these rights:


When both parents are unsuitable to care for the child
The parents are divorced or divorcing
When the parents were never married
A parent of the child is deceased

, The last thing the court must determine is whether the requested visitation is in the child’s best interest. The court will consider the following factors in making this determination:The desires of the parents
The child’s interactions with the parents and extended family
The distance between the child’s home and the grandparent’s home
Available time when considering employment, school, holidays, and vacations
The child’s age
The child’s adjustment to home ,school and community
The child’s wishes
The child’s health and safety
The ability of the child to spend time with siblings
The mental and physical health of all parties
The willingness of the grandparents to be flexible with visitation
Any convictions of the grandparents for crimes against children
Any other factor the court finds relevant

, In Ohio, domestic relations cases are heard in either the Family Court or the Court of Common Pleas.


Find the Family Court or Court of Common Pleas in the county in which the child lives
If there is a currently ongoing custody case, you will use the same court that is currently hearing issues regarding the children.
If there is a closed or completed custody case, you will file in the court that heard issues regarding the children.

, You can usually find pre-approved forms for family law on your court’s website. A packet for grandparent visitation rights will likely include:</ref>http:


A complaint to establish grandparent visitation
An affidavit of the child’s residential and legal history
A request for service
A magistrate’s order for hearing

, Sign all documents. Any that have a space for a notary to sign will need to be signed in front of a notary public. You can usually find one at banks, check cashing companies, or the courthouse. Many of them charge a fee. Make enough copies that:


The clerk can have the originals
You can retain a copy
Each parent can have a copy

, Take the original and all copies of your documents to the clerk of the court you located above.


Give the clerk the originals
Pay any associated filing fees
Ask the clerk to stamp your copies with the filing date
Ask the clerk to sign or issue your summons or citation and return it to you.

, Make the appropriate number of copies (for yourself and each other party) of the signed summons or citation. Attach one to a set of copies of the other documents. The parents must be served this entire set of documents within six months of filing. You may need to pay the clerk for this service, and the clerk will ensure service is made appropriately., The parents have 28 days from the date served with the complaint to file a written answer. You should receive a copy of the answer, but if you do not, call the clerk and ask if it has been received., Discovery is the process you use to gather evidence from the other party. Read Title V of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure to learn the various techniques. This is how you will gather evidence to convince the court to grant you visitation or custodial rights. Using discovery tools, you can:Require the parents or witnesses to provide you with copies of documents
Require the parents or witnesses to answer questions under oath, either written or orally
Sometimes you can require the parents or child to undergo medical or mental health examinations

, Throughout the case, you will need to disclose information to the parents. In some cases, failure to disclose information can result in you not being allowed to present evidence of the thing you didn’t disclose, which may be the proof you need to convince the court to grant you visitation or custodial grandparent rights. Required disclosures include things such as:


Lists of witnesses to testify at trial and the topic of their testimony
Lists of physical evidence you will present at trial
Lists of experts (psychologists, etc) who will be testifying at trial and what they will be testifying about.

, The evidence you produce in trial must comply with the Ohio Rules of Evidence. Without admissible evidence, you will not be able to show the court why it should grant you rights as a grandparent. If you don’t understand these rules, it is worth paying an attorney to help you. These rules will tell you:What kind of evidence is admissible, such as documents, pictures, and witness testimony
How to get admissible evidence entered
Proper ways to question witnesses

, In Ohio, mediation is considered a voluntary process, though a judge can refer parties to mediation. In mediation, a neutral third party tries to negotiate a settlement between you and the parents. The mediator does not make any decisions, so there is no need to bring evidence. The goal is to get you and the parents to agree to the rights you should have as a grandparent and how those rights will be exercised.If mediation is successful, the mediator will prepare any necessary documents and submit them to the court for signature. This would likely end your trial if it was successful on all issues.
If mediation is not successful, you simply proceed to trial.
Mediation is a confidential process, and nothing said in mediation can be used or disclosed outside of the mediation process.

, You will need to set a date and time for the court to review all of the evidence and determine what rights you have as a grandparent. Contact the clerk of your court to learn the process of scheduling hearings in your court. The clerk may schedule you for a scheduling conference or hearing, during which time, the judge will ask questions to be sure all issues are ready for trial and to determine how much time will be needed for the hearing. Once the hearing is scheduled, you will need to notify the other party of the date of the hearing. Ask your clerk if your court has a form for that. The Notice of Hearing should include:The date of the hearing
The time of the hearing
The location of the hearing
The name of the judge who will conduct the hearing
The amount of time the hearing is anticipated to last

, You should dress nicely for your hearing. Business suits are not required, but avoid shorts, flip flops, tank tops, mini skirts, or sagging pants. Speak only to the judge, and call him or her “Your Honor” or “Judge.” Remember that the judge is human and is more likely to grant you grandparent rights if you look and act like a person who will benefit the child. With some potential variation, the hearing is likely proceed in the following manner:Opening statements of the petitioner (a roadmap of the case and what will be proven)
Opening statements of the respondent
Witnesses called by the petitioner and cross examined by the respondent.
Witnesses called by the respondent and cross examined by the petitioner.
Closing arguments by the petitioner (a summary of the trial and arguments as to why the judge should rule in the petitioner’s favor)
Closing arguments by the respondent
Rebuttal by the petitioner
Ruling by the judge

, The winning side usually prepares the order, but the judge may keep blanks on the bench to fill in or tell an attorney involved in the case to prepare it. Without an order, you cannot enforce any grandparent rights the judge granted you. If you are tasked with preparing the order and cannot find a form for it:


Copy the caption (heading) from other documents in the case
Title it “Order” in the same location the other document lists the title
In the body, put the date of the hearing, the issue that was heard, and how the judge ruled
Insert the judge’s signature block that you copied from prior orders or got from the clerk or judicial assistant
Make enough copies for the court and all parties (including yourself)
File the original with the clerk
Send copies to all other parties
Contact the clerk to see when you can get a copy of the signed order for your files

, If the judge ruled that you have no rights as a grandparent, you can generally appeal to a higher court. Talk to an attorney to see if you may have grounds to overturn the ruling. You must usually file your appeal within 30 days of entry of the order. Check the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure to verify the time frame and procedure for appealing."

Leave him sweet surprises.,
Make your phone calls more personal.,
Do things together.,
Mix it up.,
Avoid complaining about the separation.,
Make your reunions happy.",How to Make Your Husband Miss You1," Whether you and your husband live together but rarely see each other, or you have a long distance marriage, it's important to talk about how you plan to make this arrangement work for you. Good communication is key to keeping your romance alive, even when you are physically apart.The conversation should be ongoing. Check in regularly with your husband to make sure the arrangement is still working for both of you. Don't be afraid to share your feelings if you feel that something needs to change.
Consider making a list of the benefits of the separation. When things get hard or you start arguing about how little you see each other, you can consult the list to help remind you about why you chose the arrangement in the first place.;
, Your husband will miss you tons if he's always finding little reminders of you while you are apart. Before your next separation, consider hiding little treasures for him to discover. They can be anything from notes to photos of the two of you or other tokens of your affection.If your husband is going away, you can leave him love notes in his suitcase or in the pockets of his clothing. Try to put them in places where he will discover them at different times.
If you are leaving home, hide things around the house for him to find. They can be notes or small mementos of your affection, like his favorite chocolate.

, Phone conversations tend to be centered around recounting daily activities. While this is fine, it's not the kind of conversation that will make your husband miss you. Instead, try to think of the kinds of conversations you have in person, and recreate these over the phone.Share something personal about yourself during each phone call. For example, you might tell your husband about something interesting you noticed today or about an activity you would like to try.
You can also remind your husband of all of the things you love about him. For example, you might tell him that he's an excellent cuddler or that you love his laugh.
While you may need to talk about household things, like bills or maintenance, be sure that they do no dominate the conversation. Balance them out by also talking about enjoyable topics.

, Instead of just talking on the phone and telling each other about your days, find ways to participate in activities together. This will help remind your husband of how enjoyable it is to be with you, even if you won't get the opportunity to see each other in person for a long time.For example, you could play an online game together, watch the same movie while talking to each other, or even bring each other to important events via video conference.
If you get the chance to see your husband periodically, make that time count. You may choose to do activities together or just relax together, but no matter what you do, make sure that you both enjoy the time you have together.

, It's easy to get into a rut when it comes to long-distance communication. For example, if you write your husband a letter every week or speak to him on the phone every evening, it can easily become routine. Keep your husband on his toes and looking forward to your next communication by doing something a little different every once in a while.For example, you might send your husband videos or silly cards at times. Alternatively, you might recite a poem that you wrote for him the next time you speak on the phone, Try to be a little unpredictable!

, When you talk to your husband, try not to say anything that will make him feel bad about being apart. You want to make him miss you, and complaining about the burden he has left you with by leaving will do just the opposite.Instead of complaining, try offering him some sweet compliments. For example, you might let him know that something he fixed before he left is working very well. This will make him realize how much you appreciate him, which will intensify his feelings for you.If you are the one who is away from home, you could let him know that a joke he told you made you smile all day.

, If you want your husband to miss you while you are apart, it is vital that the time you spend together is as enjoyable as possible. Let him know that you value your time together, and he will too.Avoid bombarding him with a to-do list if he is coming home from a long trip. Instead, take a few days to spend quality time together doing things you both enjoy.
If your husband is coming home from a military deployment, consider throwing him a welcome home party or meeting him at the airport with a welcome home banner.

Give him his space.,
Take care of yourself.,
Get happy.,
Remind him of happy times.",How to Make Your Husband Miss You2," Your husband will not have the opportunity to miss you if you are constantly seeing each other or talking to each other.

If you have a friend or relative you can stay with, spend some time there. You can let your husband know that you hope the separation will only be temporary.
Try this for about a month. This will give both of you adequate time to think about your relationship, and it will give him the time he needs to start missing you.
It will be much easier to not contact your husband if you avoid checking up on him. You may want to unfollow him on social media so you won't be tempted to comment on his status updates. Don't ask mutual friends about how he is doing either.

, Use your time apart to work on becoming the best version of yourself as you can. You may want to try to become more physically fit, work on your emotional stability, or expand your intellectual horizons. When you and your husband reunite, he will notice the difference and find it very attractive!In addition to making yourself more attractive to your husband, this will help you feel better about yourself. If the marriage doesn't end up working out, you will be in a much better position to get through it.

, You husband will be more likely to miss you if he sees that you are happy and fun to be around. Try socializing with friends and doing activities that you enjoy. When you and your husband begin communicating again, your happiness will be very enticing.Don't go out of your way to show him that you don't need him. Your goal should be to make him want to share in your happiness, not to make him resent you for it.

, Once you do start talking to your husband again, give him a reason to miss the happy times that you had together. Instead of focusing on the negatives of your relationship, try bringing up some of your favorite memories.There are many ways that you can remind him of happy memories. You could send him a photo from your honeymoon or reminisce about an adventure you had together, for example.

Think about his needs.,
Let him know you appreciate him.,
Talk about your conflicts.,
Calm yourself down during arguments.,
Avoid being defensive.,
Move past mistakes.",How to Make Your Husband Miss You3," Improving your relationship with your husband is the best way to make him genuinely miss you. You can start by considering his point of view instead of focusing only on your own. It's human nature to think about our own individual needs, but good husbands and wives also think about their partners' needs. Take some time to consider what your husband needs to be happy in life, and do your best to give it to him.For example, your husband may need some time to spend by himself pursuing a hobby, or he may need more quality time with you.
If you're not sure what your husband's needs are, ask him what you can do to help him be happier.

, Your husband probably does a lot of little things for you every day. While it's easy to overlook all of these little things, acknowledging them and thanking him for them can go a long way in showing your husband how much you appreciate him. The next time he fixes something around the house or makes you breakfast, be sure to let him know that it means a lot to you.He may also really like it if you brag about him to others once in a while. For example, when you're out with friends, you might say, ""My husband made me the most delicious dinner last night.""

, If you want him to think about you in a positive way, communicating well about conflicts is important. Every marriage has conflicts, and it's how a couple deals with those conflicts that determines how successful the relationship will be. If you want your marriage to be happy and healthy, keep the lines of communication open and discuss each and every conflict as it arises.Even if you need to take a break from a conversation, never leave it unfinished for long. Your goal should be to find a resolution that works for both of you.
Listen to your husband and try to understand his perspective, even if you disagree.
Be sure to say what you really mean, even if you think your husband may not like it. Dancing around the issue will not help resolve it.

, Personally attacking your husband is the way to make him want to see less of you, not more. Sometimes small arguments can turn into big blowouts because emotions are running high. To avoid this, consider taking a short break from the conversation when you feel like you're about to start yelling. If you both have a little time to think, you may be much better able to talk rationally.The break can be a few minutes or an entire day, depending on how much time you need to cool down, but be sure to return to the conversation. You don't want to leave the conflict unresolved.

, When you find yourself in a disagreement with your husband, it's important to be open instead of defensive. This means resisting the urge to criticize your husband or his point of view.The less defensive you are during disagreements, the less defensive your husband will feel the need to be. This will make your conversations much more productive.

, Both you and your husband are bound to make mistakes and hurt each other's feelings during the course of your marriage. When this happens, you have the choice to let the mistakes damage your marriage, or to let go of them and move on.It's important to forgive your husband for mistakes he has made in the past, as continuing to dwell on them will only create more tension in your marriage.
You will make mistakes too, and when you do, you must be humble enough to admit it and apologize.

Admitting that your marriage needs work is the first step to resolving the problem.;
, Before you try to fix your relationship, you need to take a look at your own thoughts and feelings. Although it may be painful, you must ask yourself if you truly love your spouse. If you don’t – and, furthermore, you don’t think you’ll ever be able to recover those feelings – then saving your marriage may be a pointless endeavor.


If you feel like you have stopped caring about your partner, ask yourself whether this might be a defensive mechanism. Sometimes, when you feel very hurt by your spouse, you adopt a “couldn’t care less” attitude to protect yourself from feelings of sadness, rejection, and vulnerability.

, When relationships are new, people tend to present the best versions of themselves: they work on their physical appearance, make an effort to listen attentively, and take the other person’s feelings seriously. Marriages are long-term endeavors, though, and as years pass, you may begin to take each other for granted. This is a sign that you need to work on your relationship, perhaps with the help of a counselor.

, Are you and your partner connecting romantically? Are you living together as affectionate, supportive partners, or have you become roommates? Consider whether too much distance is growing between you, and think about what you’re willing to do to bridge that gap – are you willing to commit to counseling and try to change your behaviors?


Take this issue especially seriously if you feel truly neglected by your partner. When one partner feels neglected because the other seems preoccupied with work, hobbies, or other interests, it can weigh on your marriage.

, Are you happy with your sex life? If your partner has suddenly stopped initiating sex, that may be a sign of a problem – he or she may be having an affair, may be preoccupied with other problems, or may be feeling increasingly distant toward you. That’s a real problem, and so is the reverse – if you are feeling a lack of sexual desire for your partner, that’s also a cause for concern.

, If you often feel like you are pretending everything is okay or suppressing your sadness, anger, or frustration, you should consider talking to your partner about counseling. A marriage counselor can help you express negative emotions in healthy ways.

, Your spouse needs to examine his or her own feelings as well, and the two of you need to decide whether you would be willing to see a marriage counselor. If one or both of you does not want to participate in the process, a counselor may not be useful.

, When one or both of you starts mentioning divorce or separation, it is time to assess your relationship seriously. If you both want to make it work, see a counselor as soon as possible.


This advice also applies if arguments are escalating to the point where one of you leaves the house, creating an unplanned, short-term separation. This pattern is a potentially damaging one, and it solves nothing: whatever problem you were arguing about remains unresolved, and it may continue to grow.

, Infidelity does not necessarily lead to divorce, but it can take a lot of time and commitment to work through such a major breach of trust. Professional assistance is recommended in these situations.


Infidelity can be emotional as well as physical. When couples feel distant, they may become vulnerable to an “emotional affair” – developing feelings for and closeness with someone else, even if the relationship does not cross the line into sexual activity. Emotional affairs are warning signs that your marriage needs serious work.

, If one of you is dealing with major depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues, your relationship may suffer. In addition to individual counseling for the person dealing with mental illness, you should check in with a marriage counselor together.

, People who suffer from a traumatic experience sometimes find that their marriages suffer as a result. If one or both of you has dealt with an extremely upsetting or stressful event, you may decide that marriage counseling can help you repair any damage to your relationship. Consider seeing a marriage counselor if, for example, your relationship has been affected by:


the death of a parent, child, or other close relative
a major illness
surviving rape, assault, or another violent experience

, Starting a family is a major adjustment that can throw your relationship off kilter. A marriage counselor may be necessary if:


you cannot agree on whether you should have children (or more children)
you cannot agree on how to raise your children
you argue a lot about discipline
you feel you are staying in your marriage “for the children”

, If it seems that every conversation ends in an argument, look into marriage counseling – especially if your arguments become increasingly negative or bitter in tone.


In healthy marriages, arguments should not generally cross the line into nasty criticisms or insults. There should be an underlying sense of respect and affection that prevents conflict from becoming too bitter or mean-spirited. If this does not seem to be the case for you and your partner, a counselor is definitely a good idea.

, If you find yourself involved in “broken record” discussions and arguments with your partner, that probably means that the issues involved are going unresolved. You may need professional help to communicate with one another and solve the underlying problems.

, In a healthy relationship, most of your communication should be positive and affectionate (or, at the very least, neutral). If, instead, you and your partner insult one another, complain about each other, or neglect each other’s needs, that’s negative communication – and it’s a sign of a serious problem in your relationship.

, You and your partner should be supporting one another and encouraging each other to pursue goals and become better people. If one or both of you feels neglected or unsupported, there may be a breakdown in communication. A marriage counselor can help you express your needs clearly and support one another more effectively.

, When couples have different or clashing perspectives, it can be tough to get through to one another and make your respective feelings understood. A marriage counselor can help you deal with many of these communication-related issues, including:


different value systems
different religious beliefs
different parenting styles
different interests
different ideas about what married life should look like

, Marriage counselors can also be helpful for dealing with arguments about money, which often boil down to communication issues. If you and your partner are not communicating well about how money is spent, what your budget is, or who should control the finances, a marriage counselor may be a good resource.

There will always be unexpected changes and challenges in life, and you and your spouse need to be able to work through them together. Be open and honest. There are going to be times that you need to bring up issues that might be uncomfortable or difficult, but you have to do it. Think about what you might say beforehand.”I’m really not sure that I’m ready to have a baby yet. It’s a big commitment and I need to think about it more.”
”I am really sad that you might have to move for work. Could we talk about whether there are any other options? I am really happy here.”
”I am worried that one of us is going to have to get another job. How can we make enough to cover our bills?”;
, Sometimes it’s easy to think that our spouse should anticipate our needs or doesn’t need to be acknowledged. But that’s not the case -- if anything, you should be more aware of making sure your spouse gets asked kindly for things and thanked afterward.

, No one likes them, and they typically don’t get you what you want. Even though it might be satisfying at the time to issue an ultimatum, chances are you will regret it later. The kinds of statements you might regret later include:

”If you don’t stop leaving dirty dishes in the sink, I’m not going to cook again.”
”If you keep smoking, I am taking back your birthday present.”
”If you don’t start looking for a job today, I’m not going to pay for your therapy.”

, Even though you might not have thought your relationships with friends would change once you got married, they usually do. It becomes harder to get out on your own and hang out with your friends as you once did, so it’s important to make plans so that you can continue to keep those friendships. Realize that some of your friendships will fade -- it’s just part of your life changing and getting older.

, It’s important to have activities and interests outside of your marriage. Even though you and your spouse may share a lot of the same passions, it’s necessary to have some things that are just for you as an individual. It might be as simple as going to a movie alone sometimes, or joining a yoga class.

, Don’t resent your spouse. It’s easy to get mad at the other person when they seem to be impinging on the freedom you had before you were married. And it’s often difficult to adjust to the fact that you always have someone waiting for you at home when you’re out with your friends. Think about your actions from the other person’s perspective, and ask yourself if you would like them to act in the way you are acting -- this can often dispel the anger you might feel at the person for wanting you to check in or let them know when you might be home.

, Are you going to have a joint account, or keep things separate? These are good questions to discuss even before you get married. Every couple has different ideas about how to make money work best in their marriage. If you are worried about it, you might want to talk to a financial counselor as you’re setting up your marriage finances.

, Make decisions together about where your money will be going. If one person is better at keeping track and being frugal, put him or her in charge of your savings account and working toward your goals. Some questions you might want to discuss include:

If one of you enters the marriage with debt, how is it going to be dealt with -- by the couple or just the person who incurred it?
What are your first priorities to save for as a married couple? Getting debt paid off, a car, a house?
How will you budget as a couple for monthly bills?

, These might be children, a bigger house, change in job. Think also about saving for difficult times -- job loss, medical bills, etc.

Are you planning to have children? If so, how will they fit into your money management?
Do you want to eventually move to a bigger house?
Are you worried that one of your jobs is not stable?

, Think about how you will save for retirement. Look at the kinds of packages each of your jobs give you, and think about whether you will need more money. Who is better suited to keeping track of your retirement funds and deciding what action to take? Make one person in charge of retirement saving.

, Think about where you want to be in 10, 20, 30, 40 years. Discuss where you want to live, what you want your work life to look like, and what role family and marriage might take in your life. Share your goals and ambitions.

, Most people talk about whether they might want children before they get married, but for many, it’s also an ongoing discussion. It’s also true that people change their minds about children and when they might want them. It’s particularly tough when one person decides they want a child and the other doesn’t. If you are certain you both want children, when do you plan to start trying to have them?

, Some of us will work at the same company all our lives, working up the ladder. Most of us, however, will work for a variety of organizations in many different jobs. Discuss with your spouse how he or she sees their working life:


What are your career goals?
How do you plan to deal with work/life balance?
Do you see yourself changing careers at some point in your life?
Would you be willing to move for the sake of your job?

, Since they are your spouse’s parents, you are going to be sharing holidays and important moments with them. Many of us have in-laws who are very different from ourselves, and at times it’s difficult to see eye-to-eye. But it is important to have the best relationship you can with your father and mother-in-law. Think about the ways you can welcome them into your new family composed of you and your spouse.Invite them over for dinner and make foods they like
Offer to help them out if there are tasks around the house or yard they find difficult
Take them to an event they would enjoy – possibly separately. This could be a movie, a sporting event, or a play.

, Holidays can be a stressful time, because now you have two families that will probably want you to be present. Talk to your spouse early about how holidays will work and let both families know.

, Make an effort to treat your spouse’s family the way you treat your own. Invite them to the parties and events you would ask your own family to. And if your spouse has siblings, make sure they are part of your events as well – not just your parents-in-law. Marriage is partly about the merging of two families, and you need to try your best to bring your extended family together with your spouse’s extended family. If it doesn’t work out, it’s fine, but it’s important to try, particularly in the early days of your marriage."

If you avoid each other and feel relieved when you aren't together, it could be a sign that you've completely disconnected from the marriage.Ask yourself how much time you spend with your spouse, then compare that to the amount of time you spend at work (excluding the time you must spend working), with friends, with family, or online. Evaluate the amount of time your spouse spends away, too.
While it's perfectly fine to spend time apart, you do need to spend time together. If you're devoting more of your free time to a source other than your spouse, or if your spouse is doing so with regards to you, there's a problem.;
, If you and your spouse are no longer able to communicate openly about topics that truly matter, you won't have the means to solve problems in your marriage.


You need to talk about issues beyond the mundane. Open communication is a foundational point of emotional intimacy, and without it, you'll inevitably become disconnected. This can be an even bigger problem if the two of you refuse to be open with each other but can talk to others with a greater degree of vulnerability.
Ask yourself who you share big with first. The answer should be your spouse. If you would rather talk to anyone else over your spouse, even if it's only a relative, you've already lost the emotional intimacy you need.
Similarly, ask yourself if you're really interested in hearing about your spouse's life, too. You need to be willing to listen and care about your spouse; otherwise, you'll end up pushing him or her away.

, Spouses who can work through everyday life as a team can typically make their marriages last, but if you abandon each other in pursuit of your own self-interests, you won't be able to coordinate your daily lives in an effective manner.


Marriage requires you to live your lives together, and teamwork is essential in making that work. You need to make joint decisions about matters that affect you both, including everything from parenting to finances.
You also need to view your spouse as a team when thinking about your own ambitions, and the favor must be returned. Spouses who work toward separate goals will naturally drift apart from each other.

, Physical intimacy is an important part of any marriage. Refusing to spend time in one another's arms signals a severe loss of both physical and emotional attraction.


A lack of physical intimacy doesn't always spell the end of a marriage if the problem if the problem is rooted in physical or mental health issues, but if the matter is caused by a simple lack of desire, it could be a very bad sign.
Note that physical intimacy includes sex, but sex isn't the only issue. Other forms of physical intimacy can be just as significant: holding hands, cuddling, etc.

, More precisely, think about a future without your spouse and evaluate how that makes you feel. If such fantasies evoke a strong sense of happiness, your subconscious might be sending you a sign that things are over.


This shouldn't be your only reason for ending things, though, and you shouldn't rush the process along after one or two fantasies. Such daydreams are often unrealistic, especially if they're the result of a mid-life crisis, so you shouldn't decide your future on them.
On the other hand, if there are other problems in your marriage and you find more bliss from the thought of separating than you find in the idea of staying together, you should take that as a red flag.

, Both spouses need to have a healthy level of respect for one another. If either one of you demonstrates a lack of respect for the other, you'll become opponents rather than allies.


Signs of disrespect are fairly obvious, and the disrespected spouse will usually feel rejected or condescended to on a regular basis. In many cases, this type of problem can be resolved through communication or counseling. If ignored, though, a lack of respect can wear things down beyond repair.

, Everyone demonstrates some degree of self-importance, but both spouses must be able to recognize the others' contributions just as well as his or her own.Ask yourself how you communicate about your contributions. If you're constantly competing by comparing how hard you work or how much energy you spend on your shared responsibilities (kids, household, pets, etc.), both of you probably assume that the other spouse has it easier. That can cause you to feel mistreated and view your spouse as an enemy.

, Spouses in healthy marriages will argue, but when your arguments and other negative interactions consistently out-number your positive interactions, your marriage could be in serious trouble.As a general rule, there should be five positive interactions for each negative interaction. These interactions can be both minor or major.
Chronic complaining and blame-throwing are standard signs of insurmountable negativity. Both acts pin spouses against each other, which will cause you to push one another away instead of drawing you closer together.
Note, however, that you may not need to worry too much if you're wondering about whether you're having more bad times than good. In most cases, marriages overwhelmed by negativity are obvious to those involved and those around them.

, If you or your spouse refuse to acknowledge the problem and try to fix it, it will be nearly impossible to save your marriage. One person won't be able to fix a problem that involves another person, so both spouses must commit to fixing the marriage.


Sometimes, this type of problem occurs when one spouse is unable to see the reality of the problem. If your spouse turns a blind eye to the strain, he or she won't be willing to take steps to fix it.In other instances, the spouse may acknowledge the problem but remain unwilling to fix it simply because he or she no longer cares.

, Marriage counseling can help many marriages, but if you've been seeing a therapist for a year or longer and nothing changes, additional counseling may not be enough to help your situation.


Even if both of you want to fix things, you might not be able to do so if your differences or problems run too deep.
That being said, understand that slow progress is still progress. If a year of therapy produces zero progress, it's usually a bad sign. If you've made even a little progress in that time, though, there could be a decent chance of working things out.

, Problems can arise when both spouses have polar opposite visions of the future. Differences like these won't always end a marriage, but they might if you are unable to find middle ground between your goals.


Disagreements regarding whether or not to have children are some of the most common issues here. If one of you is absolutely certain that you want kids and the other is absolutely certain that kids are out of the question, there's no way to compromise, and the issue will be a continual source of tension and strife.

, No two people will ever think exactly alike. Sometimes you'll need to compromise your wishes for the sake of your spouse, and your spouse will need to do likewise for your sake. Once either party refuse to compromise, you won't be able to reconcile yourselves to one another.


Some of your wants and needs will match, but many won't. Both of you need to be clear and honest about your own wishes, and in return, both must also be willing to listen and adapt to those wishes as needed.
When either spouse refuses to engage in the act of compromising, or when you reach a point where compromises can no longer be made even if you both wish you could do so, your marriage might be on its way to a dead end.

, If either you or your spouse has an untreated addiction, you'll need to treat it and actively work toward recovery if you don't want it to completely destroy your marriage.


Addictions will always be the primary focus of an addict's life, which is why they can be so destructive. If your spouse has an untreated addiction to anything, he or she will prioritize it over your marriage or your family.
Typically, an addict will also refuse to accept responsibility and may try shifting the blame onto his or her spouse. This only deepens the problem.

, Even though infidelity will strain any marriage, marriages can still survive if the cheating spouse mends his or her ways. Cheaters who show no remorse for their actions or otherwise refuse to remain faithful won't have what it takes to make a marriage work, though.


It's a bad sign if the cheating spouse remains friends with an ex-lover, especially when that ex-lover is the one with whom your spouse cheated. An unwillingness to part from that individual suggests a lack of commitment toward making amends within the marriage.
Similarly, if one spouse has cheated on the other more than once, it could suggest that he or she is unable to remain monogamous and, as such, unable to make a marriage work. This is especially true if the cheater refuses to accept responsibility.

, Sometimes, two well-meaning spouses may try working things out, but certain problems regarding lifestyle, health, or other ""set"" circumstances prevent a happy resolution.


For example, if you have a heterosexual marriage and your spouse confesses to being homosexual, there's really no way to work around the issue. Even if you two care about each other emotionally, you won't be able to remain romantically attached.
As another example, while some couples can remain together in the face of tragedy (e.g., the loss of a child), other are unable to do so. If being around one another deepens the sorrow to an unhealthy degree, parting ways might be the most caring response.

You can sow into your marriage and your mental health all at once with the help of a hobby. A shared hobby can increase the bond and deepen the spark between you and your spouse. Hobbies also help both of you fight stress.Any activity that engages the both of you is up for consideration. If you both are physically capable, you could sign up for a dance class. Other options include painting, fishing, cooking, hiking, or doing home DIY projects. It doesn’t matter what you do, just as long as you do it together.
If you or your spouse has serious physical limitations, look for a hobby you can work on at home. This could be anything from gardening to small home improvement projects or arts and crafts.;
, Just as you and your partner’s health is a top priority, maintaining your marital bond should be, too. Whenever possible, schedule in some one-on-one time to “date” your spouse like you did before marriage.


Go for a walk in the park. Watch a sunset together. Plan a romantic candlelight dinner. Don’t just wait around hoping for time to connect with your spouse. Plan it, execute it, and protect it from interruption by kids or other obligations. That’s the only way your romantic life will stay a priority.Remember that health concerns come first. If you or your spouse does not feel up to it, reschedule your plans for another day.

, Touch is the first form of communication that we learn as humans. Many would argue that it remains the most fundamental.When one of you is ill or hurting, you may not be able to find all the right words to say. However, offering your touch can help ease your partner’s worries about the health condition and create intimacy between you.


Touch between married partners can be as simple as a loving caress as he sits down to pay the bills, or a kiss on the forehead as she lies down to rest. If you are physically capable, also try to keep your sex life alive and well.
Focus on doing small things to please the both of you, such as kissing, erotic conversation, and foreplay. These options can all work in a variety of situations if you both are willing to try. A chronic medical condition can complicate your sex life, but it doesn’t have to. Talk to your partner about what both of you can do to stimulate and please the other sexually.

, If you are the reasonably healthy spouse, it can be easy to make assumptions about what your partner does or does not want to do intimately. Aim to remember them as the person you fell in love with and married, not a sick person. If you see your spouse this way, you may lose the intimate connection you once had.Allow the ill person to set boundaries and respect them. However, don’t refrain from touching or showing affection due to assumptions. If you want to know, ask.
For example, say to your spouse, “I’d like to touch you. Is that okay?” If they say “Yes,” ask them to let you know if anything is making them uncomfortable. Assure them that you will stop if they ask you to.

, Stop expecting your partner to guess or read your mind. Don’t assume that your spouse knows your needs or wants. Keep the lines of communication open always. A serious health condition can change the balance of power in a relationship. The sick spouse may feel like a burden or a medical patient rather than a partner. This can alter self-esteem and create resentment.


The ill spouse should try to be direct as possible about what you want from your partner—whether that includes help around the house to special attention in the bedroom. Say “Honey, I can manage with the laundry on my own. But can you cook dinner for the kids tonight?”, Communication with your spouse also includes the discussion of significant procedures or medical decisions. Talk with your spouse before making any major choices—even if you assume you already know what he or she will say. Simply making the effort to include them in the process of your medical care shows that you still respect your mate and their opinion.If your spouse is excluded from the kinds of decisions they used to be involved in when they were healthier, it may cause them to feel as if they no longer matter.

, Effective communication is vital to all marriages. However, in a marriage where there is strain due to a medical condition, it’s essential that you both are on the same page. If one spouse doesn’t feel heard, it can create more problems. Both of you should strive to listen to one another with the following strategies:Be mindful of body language. Refrain from showing “closed” signs like crossing the arms or legs. Keep the body open and responsive with arms and legs uncrossed and your body leaning towards the other person to reflect attentiveness.
Give your partner your full attention by removing any distractions. Cell phones, TVs, and children should be in another room so that you can fully focus on your partner’s message.
Listen completely to what the other says. Resist interrupting.
Paraphrase what you heard by summarizing it or asking clarifying questions (i.e. “Are you saying…?”). Use feeling words, such as “It sounds like you’re upset.”
Provide a non-judgmental response after you have gotten the other person’s message.
Keep in mind that each of you will experience a serious illness differently. Listen to what they have to say and make an effort to understand how their feelings and experiences differ from yours.

, Couples who are dealing with one spouse’s health issues may find themselves living and breathing medications, doctor’s appointments, and financial strain. The livelihood of your marriage depends on you keeping the spark alive.This translates to communicating with one another about topics that are interesting, not just mandatory discussions to manage a household or an illness.


Choose one or two times in a week to sit down with your spouse and talk about non-stress-related subjects. This can include planning a vacation, discussing movies or books, or even flirting with one another. Just be sure to find a middle ground in your communication and keep some of your discussions light and carefree.

, It can mean doom for your marriage and your health if either or both of you falls into negative thought patterns. In fact, research shows that having a more positive outlook can lead to greater well-being for those with chronic illness.Fend off negative thinking by:


Taking it one day at a time. Don’t worry about what tomorrow may bring—live for today.
Rejecting “why me?” or “why us?” questioning and gain acceptance of the illness.
Not using the word “problem.” Use “challenge” instead and your thinking will immediately change to solution-focused.
Celebrating every milestone or achievement.
Cultivating your passions and interests so that you regularly participate in activities you enjoy.
Turning to your spirituality.
Remembering that value or worth is not based on health and well-being. Identify other positive aspects of your life beyond health., When a spouse takes on the role as caregiver, he or she may start to neglect their own self-care in favor of caring for a spouse. Remember that you cannot pour from an empty cup. The caregiver must be able to identify signs of burnout and be willing to ask for support when needed. Caregiver burnout may include:Getting sick more frequently
Experiencing changes in sleep habits or appetite
Losing interest in previously enjoyable activities
Feeling angry, irritable, helpless or hopeless
Withdrawing from social support
Having thoughts of hurting yourself or your spouse

, Stress, worry, and anxiety may be common when you or your spouse is sick. Keep stress at bay by incorporating healthy strategies into daily life to help you feel more positive and calm.


Try out relaxation techniques together. Deep breathing, meditation, visualization, and progressive muscle relaxation are all terrific exercises to add to your routine for stress-management. What’s more, studies have shown that many of these relaxation techniques may help relieve issues such as chronic pain. Therefore, these strategies can be effective for both spouses.Attend church. Pray. Take walks in nature. Try out a number of self-care activities, such as soothing massages, bubble baths, and reading to ease stress and promote relaxation.
Try reading to each other. Sharing a book can be an enjoyable bonding experience, and may be especially helpful if you or your spouse has limitations that make reading difficult.
Get your household and finances more organized so that you don’t feel so overwhelmed.

, Social isolation can magnify issues into something bigger to the point that neither spouse feels in control. It’s likely that many friends, coworkers, family, and even spiritual or religious leaders have offered to help your family if needed. Take advantage of this goodwill and use your support system to prevent caregiver burnout.


Having healthy and supportive friendships can fend off depression, which is common in those with chronic illnesses. It may not be possible to attend every social function due to your medical condition, but try to stay engaged with friends and family and lean on them for support, too.Suggest specific things that your family or friends might do to help you and your spouse. Consider things that would help minimize stress for both you and your spouse, e.g. having a friend bring over a nice meal that you can share.

, A therapist can help you identify potential challenges and brainstorm solutions. This professional can also help you and your spouse develop better communication skills and improve intimacy.

Watch for self-inflated comments and behaviors.,
Be on the lookout for extreme reactions to criticism.,
Notice a lack of empathy.,
Check for exploitative behaviors.",How to Handle Marriage to a Narcissist1," A grandiose sense of self-importance is one of the most identifiable traits of the narcissist. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder believe that they are elite and special. They may select their friends and acquaintances based on their status or popularity. They may also go out of their way to make important contact as it cements their perceptions of themselves.Narcissists also often pose as helpers, make grandiose promises to people, and lie about good deeds they've done, leaving them with good reputations. But look closely to see if they have ever delivered on these. They will have often left a series of tragic relationships in their wake.
If your spouse is a narcissist, you may have felt as if they act like they are better than you or those around you. They expect to be admired and believe they deserve the very best of everything. This can lead to you feeling insignificant and even suffering from a low self-esteem.;
, Narcissists portray a unique dynamic when it comes to criticism. They are extremely sensitive to the criticism of others, yet they themselves are incredibly critical. Because narcissists are naturally arrogant, your spouse may act as if they know it all. You may receive the brunt end of this behavior as they attack various aspects of your character or appearance.


However, if you offered constructive criticism to your spouse, they may respond negatively. Although your spouse may appear to have a high self-esteem, you probably notice that it is fragile. They may become incredibly angry or even violent when criticized.They will also withhold love and affection if you criticize them, disagree with them, or do not give them exactly what they want.

, Narcissists have a hard time feeling compassion or concerns for others. You will often find yourself having to explain basic human decency to a grown adult. This is a warning sign. Your spouse’s #1 priority is themselves. Everything is “me” or “I.” They seem to have very little insight into your emotional needs and are unable to show empathy when you are upset.The narcissistic spouse may also lack an ability to recognize your feelings, interests, or personal values. You might say, “That was selfish of you and it hurt my feelings.” They will either be confused or say you’re too “sensitive.”

, Narcissists have no qualms about using others to get what they want. They may take advantage of acquaintances or family members to improve their own situation or advance in some way.


Being the spouse of a narcissist, you have probably felt manipulated or used on various occasions in order for your spouse to achieve their goals. For example, your spouse may open credit cards in your name without you knowing, or use your social connections to advance their own status."

Be direct and to-the-point.Your husband can appreciate you making your point clear right away rather than beating around the bush.,
Refrain from nagging.,
Use “I” statements.,
Ensure that you listen to him in turn.,
See a marriage counselor.,
Learn his love language.,
See if he prefers to talk over shared activities.,
Find out how he feels most respected.",How to Get Your Husband to Listen to You," While it might be tempting to call him on his cell phone in the very moment you become upset, calling at work or while he is busy is not going to end well.The best location is somewhere quiet, without cell phones or the TV on. If you have children wait until they are asleep or out of the house to avoid any little ears.;
, When you approach him, your husband may be in a bad mood, sleepy, or angry—these aren’t good times to talk. When you ask to speak to him, you have to also be ready for him to say it isn’t a good time and to respect that.If it isn’t a good time in the moment, ask him when it would be better. If you want a two way discussion, you have to respect his request if talking needs to wait.
Set a realistic time if it does need to wait, and stick to it.

, Sitting face-to-face can be intimidating and even making eye contact during a tough conversation can be distracting. Sitting next to him sets a more comfortable and open environment for the talk to start.Men want respect out of relationships, and forced eye contact can be a sign of aggression for some men.

, We all live busy lives and have learned to tune background noise out to get to the important stuff. He needs to know when you truly need his undivided attention.


We all have those moments where you say “Yes dear” without listening, so don’t take it personal if it takes a few times for him to hear how important the subject is. Make sure when he agrees to talk he has really heard your request.Some of the best ways to signal that the conversation is important would include getting closer to him and speaking in a different tone than you would normally banter back and forth in. Getting his attention does not mean yelling or raising your voice.

, What's more, if your message isn't succinct, you run the risk of losing your husband's attention. If you go on and on without getting to the point, your husband may eventually tune you out.


Getting to the point does not mean making accusations or jumping right into emotions. It means assertively telling him what you want to talk about as factually as possible and giving him time to respond.

, This is the type of stuff that is easy for him to tune out because nagging does not work. Nagging for a man is demoralizing and manipulative and gives them no real motivation to comply.Nagging does not work because you are asking him to do something over and over again that for whatever reason he hasn’t already done. You asking him to take care of a chore the same bothersome way for the 10th time tonight will not finally work.
Nagging does not work because men have learned to tune it out, and often feel like you are treating them like a child when you nag. You would nag and use a guilt trip with someone you have power over, not a partner. Men want to feel powerful and appreciated, that just does not happen with nagging.

, This prevents blaming on your part and defensiveness on his part. This does not mean simply starting out every line with “I” and complaining. “I” statements clearly take ownership of your emotions and give your husband a clear link to whatever action he has made that caused you to feel a certain way.


The formula for an “I” statement would be: “I” feel _____ when you ______ because ______.
Examples of “I” statements might include any of the following:

“I feel embarrassed when you tease me in front of your family because I want them to like me.”
“I feel frustrated when you were late for Sam’s teacher conference because I don’t know what to say.”
“I feel angry when you make financial decisions alone because I don’t know about them.”



, Your husband may not listen to you because when he speaks he does not feel heard. Observe your own listening behaviors to see if you could improve in this area. Practice active listening. Instead of listening to figure out your response or defense, really listen to what he is actually saying and acknowledge it.Paraphrase his key statements and repeat them back to him to make sure that, firstly, he knows you have heard him and, secondly, that you understand his statements. Understanding what he is saying is very different than agreeing, you may not always agree with him but you can always hear him.
Paraphrasing and putting the “echo” you repeat back to him in an “I” statement will help clarify what he is feeling and what he feels is the reason for that. It also serves to validate his feelings.An example of paraphrasing might go as follows:

Husband: “I am tired of your yelling. I am tired when I get home and don’t need to be yelled at. I am not stupid. I can’t even get in the door before you start.”
Wife: “I hear that you do not like me yelling and feel frustrated by being bombarded with requests when you first get home from work, is that correct?”



, Unfortunately, you can make a wide range of changes to your communication and still experience problems with your spouse not listening. Sometimes, your husband not listening can point to a deeper issue. The two of you should contact a marriage counselor in your area who can help you work through more serious barriers to communication.


For example, if your partner has an undiagnosed case of ADHD, you may often feel like he's not listening.Furthermore, your husband may not respect your opinion or withdraw from emotionally charged conversations. Any of these issues can be recognized and managed with professional help.

, Men and women simply communicate very differently, but that does not mean one is better than the other. Women tend to be more flexible in their communication styles so they are able to adapt to how the men need to be communicated with.


Women want to be appreciated in a relationship while men want to be respected.
Women can be more flexible when it comes to adapting because men are wired to be leaders not caregivers in a traditional sense. Knowing that a man is seeking respect and working to talk to him in a respectful manner goes a long way., Choosing an activity where you can be active together like taking a walk or playing golf gets his kinetic energy flowing and may open him up to talk.


If he is already feeling that you will not listen to him, an intense conversation is not going to be his first choice in communicating. A shared activity shows you “get him” and makes him more comfortable., Showing him adequate respect in the way that is fulfilling to him could be the ticket to having him listen more.Men tend to focus on what you do and less on what you say. Showing him you respect him may include taking the special effort to give him space when he first gets home because he needs time to unwind.

, If the other person responded in an unpredictable manner, try to agree with him or her and calm him or her down.

, If your partner is arguing with you in public, try to walk quickly until you get out of the situation and ignore him or her by all means. He or she is just looking for an audience to humiliate you in front of.

, Go to a relaxing place if the argument has happened in public. Perhaps by going home, things will eventually settle.

Stay respectful.,
Use “I” statements.,
Stick to the facts.,
Consult with a counselor.",How to Handle Disagreements with Your Spouse About Discipline Style1," Decide that no matter what your spouse says, you are going to remain respectful. Ask them to do the same, as well. Your disagreement likely already has you seeing red. You don’t want to add fuel to the fire with insults and name-calling.


For instance, before your conversation, say, “I know we have a difference of opinion here. However, I think it’s important for the both of us to stay respectful of each other and our beliefs.” Gently remind your spouse to remain kind if you feel the conversation is heading down a destructive path.If you cannot do this, then you are not yet ready to have the conversation. Ask for some time to cool off and collect your thoughts, and then discuss things when you're in control of your emotions.;
, Avoid pointing blame at your spouse when attempting to come to an agreement. Starting sentences with “you” makes it seem like you are saying that it is all their fault or they are the person who is causing problems. Using “I” can help you get your point across while still having a respectful conversation.


For example, you could say, “I felt hurt when you chose that type of discipline when it’s something I don’t agree with.”, When talking to your spouse, don't make assumptions or accusations about what the other person was thinking or trying to accomplish. Let them explain themselves so that you can see things from their perspective.

For example, avoid saying something like, “You disciplined our child that way even though you knew it would upset me.”

, A counselor may provide assistance if you and your spouse can’t come to an agreement together. Speaking to a therapist is also extremely helpful if you find that your upbringing is getting in the way of being the type of parent you wish to be.


If you experience hesitation from your spouse about going to a counselor, you could say, “I think going to a counselor is a good idea. We can’t come to an agreement ourselves, and a professional may be able to give us the insight and suggestions we need in order to understand each other.” You could also suggest that you try it at least once and discontinue going if your spouse doesn’t believe it will help.Suggest that your spouse find and pick the counselor themselves if they have reservations about it. Avoid going to see a counselor you already use individually, as your spouse may feel they are biased toward you.

Share your concerns with your spouse.,
Accompany your spouse to see a professional.,
Be supportive.,
Participate in support groups.",How to Handle Marriage to a Narcissist2," If your narcissist seems open-minded, bring up the topic of getting help. In many cases, narcissistic behavior patterns have led to problems in the narcissist's marriage, family, friendships, and career. Use one of these aspects as a benchmark to convince your spouse to get help.For instance, if your spouse is very career-oriented, but has been struggling to work as a team player, you might use this as fuel for a conversation.
Say, ""Sweetie, I know you were hoping for a promotion this year, but you've been having trouble with the team at work. I think it would be a great idea if you talked with someone who can help you build on the skills you already have to increase your odds of getting chosen for the position.""

, Although it may seem like a good idea to search for a marriage therapist to help your spouse, avoid this dynamic in favor of having your spouse attend individual therapy. In many cases, couples therapy results in the narcissist playing the victim role, leading to very little change.Instead help your partner find an individual therapist who has experience treating personality disorders. You don't have to share your suspicions about the specific disorder with your spouse, but this increases the odds of your spouse being properly diagnosed and treated.
Be sure to let the therapist know about your suspicions that your spouse is a narcissist. However, do not let your spouse find out that you have shared this information or they may become enraged.

, Refrain from trying to steer your spouse into treatment one way or another. Treatment for personality disorders like narcissism require long-term, intensive one-on-one therapy, and your spouse must be a willing participant. However, it can be helpful to ask how you can show support as they go through treatment.


You might say, ""Darling, I'm so proud of you for seeking help with what you're going through. What can I do to show my support or help you through this time?""
Be open to your spouse's response. They may simply ask for space while they come to terms with the disorder.

, Since family members are often left to sort through their own emotional situation alone as the narcissist seeks individual treatment, you might find support by attending a local group or joining one online.


Ask your spouse's therapist for a recommendation of a support group for loved ones of those with narcissistic personality disorder. You might also research forums online to locate other spouses or family members of narcissists. It may also bring awareness for your spouse to attend these groups as well.
Spouses of narcissists may also benefit from seeing a therapist to resolve the emotional damage inflicted by their spouses and help them learn to cope."

Know that the majority of narcissists never get treated.,
Stop taking their behavior personally.,
Don’t expect your spouse to meet your emotional needs.,
Use flattery before making requests.,
Praise positive behaviors.",How to Handle Marriage to a Narcissist3," Narcissistic personality disorder involves a long-term and enduring behavior patterns. This condition must be diagnosed and treated by a qualified mental health professional such as a psychologist or psychiatrist. Unfortunately, an overwhelming majority of narcissists never seek treatment.Without treatment, it is unlikely that the narcissist will get better.


Your spouse may only see a professional when the consequences of their behavior significantly interferes with their ability to function at work, at home, or socially.
You might try talking to your spouse about getting help, but expect resistance.

, If you are going to try to make your marriage work with a narcissist, then you will need to build an emotional wall around yourself. Because the narcissist’s behavior is purely self-driven, it’s important to recognize it as a part of the disorder and not take it personally.This will undoubtedly be difficult to do, but it is necessary if you want your marriage to work. When your spouse says or does something particularly offense or exploitive try reciting a mantra to yourself like “What he/she does is a reflection of him/her, not of me.”

, Narcissists are a classic example of being takers rather than givers. Your spouse requires a great deal of admiration and/or affection, but they are unlikely to provide the same to you unless it serves them in some way. Expect for the relationship to be out of balance.Instead, use your friendships and relationships with family members for emotional support.

, Your narcissistic spouse likely responds well when you pump up their ego, so try this tactic when making demands on them. That way, you are able to keep your spouse satisfied and see to it that your own needs are met also.


For instance, if you need your husband to complete a home-improvement project, you might say, “Darling, I know you are super busy, but your amazing carpentry skills are needed in the garage. The new shelves need to be hung, and I know no one will do as great a job as you can.”, Positive reinforcement may also be helpful when trying to deal with a narcissistic spouse. Your husband or wife wants to be reminded of all the things they’re good at, and they can barely handle learning about their shortcomings. So, try your best to ignore the undesirable behaviors, and when you see them doing something helpful, be sure to praise them.For example, when your wife asks “How was your day at work?” you might kiss her forehead and say, “How wonderful is it for you to ask that?” This reinforces the likelihood that she will inquire about your feelings in the future.

Regain your identity by pursuing passions.,
Develop realistic personal goals for yourself.,
Surround yourself with a positive network.,
See a professional therapist.,
Consider ending the marriage if your spouse becomes violent.",How to Handle Marriage to a Narcissist4," When you’re married to a narcissist, self-care should be a #1 priority. It’s important for you to take part in activities that make you feel good about yourself and connect you with positive people. Narcissists often try to isolate you from other people, which may make it hard to maintain your relationships. You may also find that it is hard to keep up with your interests because you are trying to keep the peace at home.


Think about some activities that you have put off since becoming married, or have been dying to try out. Sign up for a class, a Meetup, or check a book out from the library to learn more about a specific interest. You might learn a language, start crafting, become a writer, or start taking kickboxing. Do something you love, just for you.
To ensure that your time away doesn’t create a sore spot for your attention-hungry spouse, check in often while you’re engaging in hobbies. You might say, “I’m at my writing course, dear. Is there something I can get for you when I’m headed home?” or “I’m enjoying kickboxing, but I sure miss your handsome face.”, Marriage to a narcissistic spouse can feel like everything is about your partner while nothing is about you. Combat feelings of inadequacy by giving yourself permission to be a little selfish and set some goals you have been secretly harboring.To make sure you achieve them, make them SMART goals—that is, specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound.


Have you always wanted to go back to school? Make a list of steps you must take to reach this goal. Your list might include researching universities, deciding on a major, taking entrance exams, and getting letters of recommendation.

, Just because your spouse isn’t attending to your emotional needs doesn’t mean no one can. Find a trusted friend or confidant to share your feelings and experiences with. Spend time with people who value who you are as a person and give as much as they take.


You can reach out to an existing friend by saying, “Hey, Randy, some things have been happening in my marriage and I could really use someone to talk to. Can I trust you to keep this between us?”
If you don’t have a trusted person to talk to, try attending a support group for loved ones of narcissists. In such groups, you can connect with people who are going through similar experiences and learn how they cope., Although it can make your marriage more fulfilling if your spouse gets treatment, it can also be helpful if you see a professional as well. Years of belittling, criticizing, and being put in second place can take a toll on your self-esteem, leading to anxiety and depression.


Research a therapist in your area who has experience working with the spouses of narcissists. Interviews several professionals before selecting one you feel comfortable with.
Seeing a therapist can also help you learn more about the disorder affecting your spouse and learn more skills about how to cope with it in your marriage., You may be completely against divorce, but you should reconsider your decision if your spouse starts to abuse you. Although many narcissists never become violent, it can happen. Speak with a professional to develop an action plan to follow in times of crisis.


Even if your spouse never physically abuses you, narcissistic abuse still involves emotional and mental abuse that can have lasting consequences to your well-being. Talk to your therapist to weigh the pros and cons of leaving your marriage, especially if you have children because this behavior can be learned."

Identify each of your non-negotiables.,
Create a mutual plan.,
Take turns.,
Praise them, if their way works out.,
Avoid overcompensating for your partner’s parenting style.",How to Handle Disagreements with Your Spouse About Discipline Style2," You likely have a few statutes you hold dear when it comes to your discipline style. Your spouse probably does too. Pick a few and have your spouse do the same. Then make a pact that you will not argue about these. While it’s okay to have a couple non-negotiables, understand that you must be flexible in other areas. Compromise means that you are going to make some concessions.


For instance, you may be adamant about having a no spanking rule. Your spouse may feel that withholding works the best. Choose one or two methods of discipline that you feel the strongest about and work together to make sure both of your wishes are granted., Already having a plan in place for certain behaviors can stop you from disagreeing when it’s time for discipline. Discussing how you want to resolve the problem before it shows up allows you to maintain a united front. It can also prevent arguments between you and your spouse when it’s time to take action.


For instance, discuss what disciplinary actions you will take for common misbehaviors, such as talking back, getting bad grades, fighting with siblings, and staying out past curfew. Attempt to come up with a punishment that you are both comfortable with., Suggest that you try your way of disciplining for a month and then offer to try your spouse’s way. Taking turns gives you both an opportunity to try what you believe will work. It can also prove helpful if you’re having difficulty finding a style that is effective with your child.


For instance, you could say, “Let’s try my way of grounding this time. Then we can try your method of taking away the electronics the next time. Perhaps we will settle on whichever works best.”, Tell your spouse that they did a good job with their choice, if the child responds the best to it. Avoid withholding a compliment just because your idea wasn’t the most successful. Offering support to your spouse is not only encouraging, but may strengthen your relationship, as well.


For example, you could say, “It looks like your way was the best way. Good job and good idea.” Your spouse will likely appreciate your humility and courtesy., Often, one parent will be far too lenient or go overboard on treats because they think the other person is too strict. Other times, one parent will become hyper-militant in their parenting because they think the other parent provides no structure. This damages their relationship with their child. Do your best to compromise in a way that allows you and your spouse to carry equal weight."
"
Consider what is appropriate for the child.,
Maintain a united front.,
Avoid criticizing your spouse’s technique in front of the kids.",How to Handle Disagreements with Your Spouse About Discipline Style3," Don’t get so caught up in wanting to win this fight that you forget what is best for your child. Consider the child’s age and temperament when deciding on what discipline style would work best. Head to the library or seek out some research-based information or help concerning age-appropriate disciplinary techniques from a mental health professional to determine what expectations are realistic.


For example, you may think that using a time out is the most effective type of discipline style. However, your child may scream and cry the entire time which makes them even more upset and ill-behaved. This could be because they are too young for a time out approach.
Ask yourself if the time out is actually working, or if you are just holding onto the method because you want to prove you are right. It may be time to consider a different tactic., One of the most effective methods of parenting is maintaining a united front. Showing your kids that you cannot agree on this matter can make them feel uneasy and that their family may not be as strong as they thought it was. It may also give them an opportunity to take advantage of this weakness between you and your spouse.


For example, your older child may figure out that you can’t decide what punishment works best on them. As a result, they test you with bad behavior. They may think that because you can’t agree on what to do, that you may not do anything. Simply end the argument and wait until the kids are gone before finishing it., Your spouse may deliver a punishment in the heat of the moment without discussing it with you first. Although you may be upset, avoid telling your spouse what a bad idea that was in front of the kids. Not only will it likely start an argument while the kids are watching, but it shows them that you aren’t on solid ground, which can be frightening for them.


Instead, talk to your spouse about it afterwards. Simply say you wish they would have consulted you before they doled out the punishment.Try to find some empathy for your spouse, as parenting is a full-time, ever-changing job and mistakes are going to be made when anyone is thinking on their feet that much. You will want them to extend you the same courtesy.

You will also need to be willing to let go of a strong emotional attachment to your partner, so you should try to make the decision to get a divorce from a clear, unemotional standpoint.
Ask yourself: What is my intent in getting a divorce? Any other agenda, other than ending the marriage, is an indication you may not be ready to get a divorce. Divorce has no power to right wrongs or change people’s hearts. Divorce can only end your marriage and your relationship with your partner.
Keep in mind that spouses who consistently threaten divorce can lose credibility with themselves and their partner. So, if you are serious about getting a divorce, you will need to express this to your partner in a clear, but appropriate way.;
, In most cases, both spouses are usually aware there is something wrong with the marriage. You may have tried marital therapy together, done individual counseling, or had discussions about the troubles in the relationship. If possible, try to pursue counseling or therapy together first before jumping into a conversation about divorce.If the feelings are mutual, you and your husband will have more options. If your husband has no idea, it can be a devastating conversation. Surprising your husband with this difficult news may also result in a more difficult transition for you both during the separation.

, This is going to likely be a very hard conversation to have with your husband. So get out a piece of paper and write down a few possible things you may include when you tell your husband about the divorce.Keep in mind you are about to break some bad news that will probably evoke strong emotions. Compose a few sentences that do not contain strong language or an angry tone.
Focus on using neutral language. Make “I” statements, such as: “Michael, I have some difficult news to tell you. I have reached a conclusion that you and I need to divorce.”
Avoid giving any false hope to your husband if you are serious about the divorce. Saying something like: “I haven’t been happy for a long time. But I want to see if we can work on some of the things that are troubling me” will give your husband the impression you want to fix the marriage. So if this is not your intent, avoid statements like this., Choose a time when you are both alone and no one is going to barge in during the conversation. Look for a space in your home, like the living room or the dining room, that is quiet and comfortable.


Turn off your cell phone and ask your husband to do the same. If you have children, ask a family member to watch them while you talk to your husband, uninterrupted.

, Perhaps you are divorcing for troubling reasons, like your husband’s angry or abusive behavior. If this is the care, have a third party present like a therapist or a counselor, or choose a more public place to talk to him.You cannot control how well or how not well your husband takes the news. But if there is a history of violence or abuse in your marriage, make sure you have another person in the room with you.
You can also tell your husband over the phone if you are concerned about your safety and do not want to be in his presence when you tell him the news.

, Treat the conversation with all the gentleness you would use if you were telling him a loved one had died. Be direct, but also compassionate.Being respectful during the conversation will also make it easier to talk about other logistical things like shared custody of the children, if there are any, and the division of your financial assets.

, Do not try to assume how your husband is feeling about your marriage. Instead, report on the state of your own feelings and avoid placing any blame or shame on your husband.For example: “I know this may be hard to hear, but I believe our marriage is over and I would like a divorce.” Or, “We have both tried but it’s not working between us and I do not believe that any more counseling or therapy will help. I think the marriage is over and that we have to divorce.”

, Even if your husband may be aware there are issues in your marriage, he will likely be upset when you tell him you want a divorce. But it’s important that you do not retaliate, try to defend yourself, or try to justify your decision.For example, he may respond to you with: “This is just another example of you trying to run away from responsibility. You are so selfish and only think about yourself. I have given you everything I have. I’ve tried so hard to make this family and this home. I don’t deserve this and the kids don’t deserve this.”
Avoid a response like: “Don’t lecture me. I’m leaving because I’m sick and tired of your childish crap. I’m sick of living in this house and I’m sick of living without sex or affection. I’ve tried to make this marriage work and you block me out whenever I ask you to change.” This response may feel good for about two minutes but will ultimately lead to a bitter fight.
Instead, respond with: “I know this is very painful and I am so sorry I am doing this. But I just can’t see an alternative. I don’t have the feelings that we would need to make it work. There is too much distance between us to overcome.”
This response is better because it is not defensive or angry. You are showing your husband that you feel your decision is correct and it is not coming from a place of self defense. You are also showing your husband that you are aware that any anger or defensiveness from you will only create more anger and hurt between the both of you.

, Once his initial anger simmers down, your husband may try to negotiate with you on the terms of the separation. He may ask for a trial separation, where you both are separated but legally still married. Or he may ask you if you can both try therapy or counseling again. You should be prepared for these types of questions, especially if your husband will be devastated by your wish for a divorce.If you are serious about the divorce, be firm about your decision. Tell your husband: “I don’t think a trial separation is the answer. We have tried to fix our marriage and I don’t think, at this point, it is going to work.”

, The initial talk with your husband will likely be emotionally charged. So don’t rush into hashing out the details of the divorce when your first tell your husband of your desire to separate.Reassure him that you are willing to work with him to achieve a fair and civil separation and to work with an attorney to find the best arrangement for the both of you.

, Although you are both now anxious about the future and the details of the divorce, assure your husband that he can take some time to think about what you have discussed.Acknowledge that the divorce will create some big changes for the both of you. Then, let him know you are going to be staying with a family member or friend for a few days. Or that you would like him to stay somewhere else so he can process the information.
For example: “Thank you for listening to my thoughts, I really appreciate it. I know this is a lot to process. So take your time and think about what I have said.”

, It's a good idea to determine if you are going to be staying in the home or if you are going to move out. Coming to an agreement about the living arrangements will help you both to adjust to this big change. Remind your husband that the living arrangements are temporary until the divorce is finalized.

, If you and your husband have children, you will both need to agree on the best time and place to break the news. You should both sit your children down together, after dinner in a common area like the living room or the dining room, and explain the details of the divorce.Tell the truth. Your kids are entitled to know why you are getting a divorce, but very detailed reasons may only confuse them. Pick something simple and honest, like “We can’t get along anymore.” You may need to remind your children that while sometimes parents and kids don't always get along, parents and kids don't stop loving each other or get divorced from each other. In general, younger children need less detail, while older children may need more details about the divorce.
Say “I love you.” However simple it may sound, letting your children know that your love for them hasn’t changed is a powerful message. Tell them you’ll still be caring for them in every way, from fixing their breakfast to helping with homework, and that you will both always be there for them.
Address changes. Preempt your kids’ questions about changes in their lives by acknowledging that some things will be different now, and other things won’t. Let them know that together you can deal with each detail as you go.
Avoid blame. Try not to be critical of your husband or his actions. Agree in advance to show a unified front and tell your children the same reasons for the divorce. Explain the temporary living situation with your children and when the divorce will be finalized.

, Though it may be tempting to console your husband by showing physical affection toward him, it’s important to maintain your distance and not fall back into the habits of your marriage. You want to avoid sending him mixed signals or hurting him further by staying emotionally or physically involved with him. Demonstrate how serious you are about the divorce by keeping your distance., Don't be afraid to do this if your husband threatens he will take the children from you. In fact, a judge will likely be more sympathetic towards you if you remove your children from a potentially dangerous situation with your husband.You want to also give your controlling husband as little power as possible, and this means taking the children away from his control.
You may need to ask for help from a friend to leave the family home and get away from your husband.

, If you are trying to divorce an abusive husband, it's important to have a plan in place to protect yourself and your children, if you have any. A restraining order can give you a legal way to create distance between you and your husband. You may want to get the restraining order before you tell your husband you want a divorce or once you and your children are in a safe place, away from your spouse.The most dangerous time for an abused woman is the first 24 hours after a restraining order has been issued. If you feel unsafe and decide to get a restraining order, ask the police if they can drive by your house. You can also contact your local shelter to see if you can stay in a safe house until things are settled.

, It is much easier to have a collaborative approach to the divorce. It’s also less expensive if you and your husband are able to settle your issues without legal involvement.If it is not possible to keep a lawyer out of it, make sure you hire an attorney that is willing to litigate your case before a judge. The attorney should know the value of settling the divorce quickly, but he should also be willing to fight for you in court should the need arise.
Interview at least three attorneys before you decide on one. Look for a divorce attorney who has at least 5-10 years experience practicing family and divorce law.

, You need a clear picture of where you and your spouse stand financially. One of the main goals of a divorce is to have an equitable distribution of marital assets and debts. To get your fair share, you need to know what is owned by you and your husband and what is owed by you and your husband. To do this:Make a list of all possible assets that you own or partly own. Some shared marital assets are obvious. The marital home and any financial accounts and vehicles are assets that should be split equitably. Other assets might include artwork, pension plans, inheritances, or belongings brought into the marriage.
Gather all documentation for each asset, including present value, when and where the asset was purchased, and whether it was purchased with joint or separate funds. Turn over all documentation to your attorney and keep a copy for yourself.
Determine the debt in your marriage. When determining what you owe, it doesn’t matter whose name any debts are in. Marital debt will be split based on who is more financially able to pay the debt, not by whose name the debt is in. The easiest way to determine marital debt is to get a copy of your credit report. Turn this information over to your attorney as well.
Determine your income. If you and your husband are salaried employees, give your attorney a copy of your most recent pay stubs and your most recent Income Tax Return.

, It’s important that you figure out how you are going to live once you are divorced.Think about your living costs, and how much income you will have after the divorce. Some women experience a major drop income post divorce. So avoid getting dinged with bills you can’t pay by creating a budget for yourself.
Figuring out your expenses post-divorce will also influence how you negotiate your divorce settlement. Your attorney can use this information to determine your settlement options or what you may ask for if your case goes to court.

Be clear with what you want and why you want it before talking to your spouse. The decision will affect your lifestyle, economics, your children’s lives, and marital investment. Consider these things carefully before talking this over with your spouse.Ask yourself, “What are my options, and what are the positives and negatives of each option?”Ask yourself about the emotional impact of the divorce. Some questions to consider include, “What do I want? What are the reasons this divorce is in my best interest? How will this affect the family?”
Think about logistics as well. Ask, “Where will I live? How will I manage my finances? What will we do with the kids?”;
, There’s no way to know if you’re making the “right” decision in asking for a divorce. You may doubt yourself that you are being too hasty, or not considering all of the factors. Unfortunately, it’s impossible to know for sure which decision is best.Don’t rush into a decision. Instead, note your feelings and see how they change over time. If you remain steadfast in your assertion to want a divorce, trust that feeling. If you go back and forth on the decision, give it some time or perhaps talk to a friend.


It’s okay to ask for outside opinions, but notice if you start asking for more and more reassurance from others. Remember that it’s your decision to make.Ask yourself, “Is this decision emotionally driven?” If so, wait a few days to see how you feel. Make the decision as rationally as possible.

, Your spouse may be aware that you are unhappy, or be completely surprised by your request for a divorce. The more you take your spouse by surprise, the harder it may be for him or her to accept the divorce.If you think your spouse will be shocked, don’t be surprised if he or she tries to talk you out of it.


Especially if you’re feeling unsure about your marriage, talk about the problems first before discussing divorce. Don’t hold your problems in or expect your spouse to know what you want or need.

, Choose a time to talk that is quiet and allows for discussion. When planning a time to talk, ensure that neither of you have to run off for an obligation. If you have kids, make sure they are out of the house. Choose a time when you are both home and can talk without distraction., Telling your spouse you want a divorce is not a conversation you expect to go smoothly or one that you will enjoy. Chances are, this will be a very uncomfortable discussion that will make you feel uneasy throughout. Accept the discomfort and know that it will feel this way.Feeling uncomfortable isn’t a valid reason to delay telling your spouse you want a divorce.


Take some deep breaths to calm your body and your mind. Especially if you start to feel tense, deep breathing can relax you., He or she may express anger and ask you why you would do this to him or her or the kids. Your spouse may accuse you of being selfish or of all kinds of terrible things. Or, your spouse may express sadness, cry, and feel abandoned. On the contrary, your spouse may also feel relieved if he or she feels the same way. Expect that your spouse will have an emotional response.


Prior to the discussion, prepare yourself for these emotions, and ask yourself how you will handle them.
If your spouse is emotionally reactive, don’t respond with more reactivity. Practice active listening instead by intently listening to your spouse talk without interruption and without planning what you’re going to say next.If you have problems managing your emotions, check out How to Be Less Emotional.

, Before you have the discussion, tell yourself not to get pulled in to discussions about fault, blame, or wrongdoing. These are irrelevant at this point. Talking about the past will not solve any problems but may more likely add to them. Instead, take responsibility for your actions and take ownership of your feelings. Refuse to discuss these issues and instead focus on clearly communicating your needs regarding the future.


Agree that both of your actions have contributed to the demise of the marriage. No one person is at fault.
Avoid blame speech by using “I” statements and not “you” statements.For instance, there’s a difference between saying, “You let me down too many times” and, “I feel abandoned and forgotten by you.” Keep the focus on you and your own feelings.
If you think the discussion may turn into blaming or fault-finding, find a way to deter this beforehand. Say, “This is irrelevant to our divorce and I do not want to get into discussions about blame or fault. It’s best we focus on the the future and how to end this as civilly as possible.”

, If you want a divorce, be firm in this assertion. Don’t hesitate or be wishy-washy. Be firm in saying, “Yes, I want a divorce” and stick to it. If you want something else or are unsure about the divorce, say these needs first. Don’t give unclear signals, as this can be confusing to your spouse. Be clear, even if you know it will hurt your spouse’s feelings.Perhaps you want a separation or for things to change in your marriage. If you want something else, such as therapy or more attention, don’t say you want a divorce first, but ask for these changes first. Say, “I feel like our marriage isn’t working, but I’m not ready to give up yet. Would you consider therapy or a mediator?”
If you are absolutely ready for a divorce, say so clearly. You can say, “This is a difficult conversation to have, but I need to tell you that I want a divorce. I’ve struggled with this for some time, and I suspect you are aware of how difficult this relationship has been. This is something I’ve put considerable time into thinking about, and I believe it is the best decision regarding this marriage. I know this will be painful and difficult for all of us, but I believe we can get through this and be decent, reasonable, and mature from this point forward.”, Don’t monopolize the discussion. Allow your spouse the space to speak his or her mind and feelings. It’s important not to interrupt or cut your spouse off. Allow your spouse to speak openly, and encourage the discussion. Make sure you understand how your spouse feels, and reflect back your understanding.To reflect understanding, say, “I hear you saying that you’re unhappy too, and that although you feel sad, you agree this is the right thing. Is that right?”

, This isn’t the time to blame your spouse or tell them all of the things that have gone wrong or sour between you two. This is simply a discussion of you sharing your feelings and your need for a divorce. While it’s an uncomfortable discussion for you, it’s likely your spouse is uncomfortable, too, and perhaps a bit caught off guard. Treat your spouse with compassion and respect through the entirety of the discussion. Remind yourself that this isn’t easy for your spouse, just as it isn’t easy for you.The way you treat your spouse in the first discussions of divorce can set the tone for how the divorce will continue. Stay calm and empathetic toward your spouse.
If your spouse is angry, say, “I know this is difficult, and I can understand why you feel angry. I feel a lot of emotions, too, yet it’s important we be respectful to one another.”

, In talking about the impending divorce, show that you are willing to be fair and reasonable in the following proceedings. Before filing for divorce, communicate that you want things to be respectful and address everyone’s needs, including your spouse’s.This can help set the tone for the rest of the divorce.


Say, “I don’t want drama to follow us as a result of this divorce. I want you to know that I am willing to be fair and reasonable about how we move forward, and I hope you feel the same way.”

The key is to pick somewhere that doesn’t tolerate loud talking, or a place in which you’d be embarrassed if anyone heard you yelling. By choosing the right spot, you may have a more productive conversation.


Libraries, coffee shops, busy parks, and even the shopping mall are all good places to have a potentially heated conversation. There are enough people there that you and your partner may be shy about raising your voices.;
, Your spouse may be troubled, but that doesn’t excuse bad behavior or treatment. It’s important that you speak your mind about what is going on so that you can be happy in your marriage.


To get the most out of your conversation, write down everything that is bothering you before you have a conversation about it. This allows you to stay organized and focus during the discussion.
You likely know your spouse well enough to predict how they’re going to respond to your concerns. It’s helpful to come up with counterarguments to what you think they’re going to say. This helps you to get your point across if you become frazzled and lose your train of thought during your conversation., Although you may feel like you have to sugar-coat the situation because of your spouse’s troubles, doing so isn’t going to help your relationship. Be direct and tell your spouse how you really feel and what is bothering you. They won’t know what’s wrong and won’t be able to solve the problem if they aren’t aware of what is going on.


In a calm tone, tell your spouse what troubles you. For example, you could say, “I feel helpless and afraid when you go on your rants, and I don’t know how to handle that.”
Or, you could say, “It really upsets me when you decide not to take your medication and skip your doctor appointments. The way you behave when that happens puts a strain on our marriage.”You will likely encounter the most resistance if your spouse is abusing alcohol or drugs, unless they are ready to seek treatment.

, If the troubles in your marriage are abusive in nature, your first order of business is to keep yourself and other family members safe. A variety of mental illnesses could cause your spouse to become abusive, and until they get the help they need for that, you’ll have to take steps to ensure your safety. No relationship is worth abuse.


Ask friends and family members if you can stay with them if you feel that your safety is in jeopardy. You may also need to call the police and have a restraining order put in place if you’ve been harmed.
Even though you may want to make your marriage work, you can’t do it if you feel that you are in danger.If you have children, they will have to be your top priority before your spouse.

, If your spouse has anger issues, is mentally ill, or abusive, it may help you to distinguish what tends to worsen their symptoms. Knowing their triggers can help you avoid these issues until they learn how to effectively cope.For example, if your husband becomes depressed after a period of not getting adequate sleep, you might make getting consistent, quality sleep a priority. Help him wind down at night with relaxing activities to improve his sleep quality.
If your spouse is verbally or physically abusive, you might try to avoid the behaviors that set them off until you can get yourself and your children to safety.

, Sometimes, putting yourself through the trauma of attempting to save a relationship just isn’t worth it. If you’ve tried numerous times to repair the situation, or your spouse has committed what you believe is a “deal breaker,” the best bet may be to simply walk away.


Putting in the effort when your spouse isn’t willing to reciprocate may not be worth it. If you decide your marriage is worth saving, tell your spouse you aren’t willing to put up with the same behaviors anymore. You’ll both need to put in lots of hard work and put your marriage first.
However, make sure you are both on the same page and want the same outcome; if you are the only one making the effort, your marriage will likely stay the same or become worse. , Your happiness should be on your list of priorities. You can’t be a good spouse if you aren’t happy. If your partner isn’t fulfilling all of your needs, take care of the ones you are able to meet yourself. Your happiness can have a positive effect on your relationship.


Do something you enjoy, even if it is without your partner. For instance, join a club, take a class, make time to hang out with your friends, and schedule some “you” time. Having a source of enjoyment outside of your marriage may help you to handle your relationship obstacles better., If you’re really committed to saving your marriage, you can’t hang on to what happened previously in your marriage. Constantly thinking about your spouse’s past mistakes or infidelities only harms the relationship instead of helping it heal. Decide that the past is in the past and you’re going to work on the future.


If your spouse cheated or otherwise betrayed your trust, be willing to forgive, but that doesn’t mean you have to forget. If your spouse is willing to get help and improve your bond, you have to learn to move on from those previous mistakes and make your marriage work., A major aspect of taking a marital vow is being with someone through times of sorrow and happiness. A marriage that is chronically troubled may be problematic, and you may need to decide if you are willing to continue to stand by your spouse. However, if your spouse is going through something and seems willing to get better, give it time.

, Speaking to a therapist with your spouse about what troubles you may help you resolve your issues, together. It may also make each of you feel more comfortable talking in the presence of a professional about what is bothering you. The therapist may be able to offer you advice on how to deal with your troubled spouse’s problems and the issues they are creating for the relationship.


Finding a therapist that both you and your spouse feel comfortable with is key to making the counseling effective. Ask friends and family members for names that they have experience with.
If you don’t want them to know, look online for recommendations. If you or your spouse don’t feel a connection with the therapist or don’t feel safe, you may hold back, which will only hinder you., Support groups offer solace to people who are married to troubled spouses. They allow them to meet others who are going through similar situations and give them the opportunity to vent about their experiences. Attending a support group regularly can give you hope for your situation and help you figure out how to make your marriage work.


Look online for support groups in your area or online-only groups if that is more convenient and comfortable for you. You can also ask your spouse’s therapist or doctor for recommendations on support groups.If your spouse has anger problems, you can take part in related groups for spouses. Similarly if your spouse has a mental illness, you can participate in a group that helps you learn how to cope with their condition.

, Being married to someone who is troubled is extremely challenging and can take a toll on your physical and mental health, especially if being with them puts you in danger. Talking to a therapist about what you experience and feel may help to offer you insight on your situation.


A therapist may also be able to give you techniques to cope with the experience and help you improve the marriage.If you are being abused, or have reached a dead end in the relationship, then a therapist can work with you to develop a plan to leave your marriage safely., As the spouse of a troubled person, you can only do so much. It’s perfectly acceptable and appropriate to ask your friends and family for help. More than likely they would be happy to help, which can make your life a lot easier.


Ask friends or family members to take on some of your chores, cook a meal for your family members, provide transportation for your spouse or kids, or anything that would give you some breathing room. Even just having some alone time with them can help."

Know that it’s perfectly acceptable to grieve the end of your marriage—it was a very important relationship in your life.Just like any other type of grief, everyone grieves differently after divorce. You are the only one who gets to decide what that looks like or how long it takes.
Grieving can take on many forms. You may cry, withdraw from friends or family, or find it difficult to get excited about interesting things happening in your life. All of this is normal.;
, Supportive people may look different on any given day; you may find yourself looking to friends for a distraction while a support group may be best for relating to others who have been there too.There may be times where the best form of support is a distraction, that’s where a good group of friends comes in handy because they will probably be more than happy to find something fun to do if all you need to do is anything besides divorce “stuff”.
Support groups can be a great place to really explore the feelings tied to the divorce since they usually have a set start and end time, allow that small block of time each week to dive into things and deal with the feelings. It is also a good way to form boundaries with others if you do not want to talk about it with them since you can nicely let them know you are attending a group to talk about things., You may find yourself feeling a variety of emotions, but going without eating or not keeping up with normal gym times will only make those feelings worse. The divorce process also often takes a lot of formal paperwork so being at your mental best is important.Many people simply forget to eat when under stress or the opposite they overeat to mask feelings. Try to remind yourself to eat a healthy diet to stay focused on what needs to be done and to stay healthy.
Eating right also includes not falling into the trap of drinking more alcohol or depending on extra coffee to mask emotions or not sleeping. It is better to address the underlying issue instead of using some sort of substance to hide the cause.

, Make sure you have outlets to relieve the stress that comes with getting a divorce. Stress management can cover a range of options, including meditation, listening to music, getting a massage at the spa, or playing with a pet. Make time daily, if possible, to do something that relaxes you and eases your stress.Self-medicating with alcohol, drugs or even too much caffeine is not managing your stress, it is just numbing it.

, Some people going through a divorce may stop eating, stop performing at work, and feel hopeless about the future. Depression is common during such an ordeal.A marriage and family therapist counselor can help you work through your emotions and venting by offering you personalized support without judgment.


Such a therapist can also help you sort through logistical details like talking about the divorce with your children or how to know when you're ready to start dating again.
Your divorce lawyer may be able to refer you to a quality therapist who is experienced in working with people going through divorce., If you are a stay-at-home parent, explore what type of arrangement will support the household going forward.


Depending on the divorce agreement, moving may or may not be an option. That is important to keep in mind if you are looking for a new job since you may need to stay in the local area.

, Even if you end up getting spousal support, you still need to learn how to manage household expenses on your own.


Tracking how you spend your money will give you a better idea about areas that may need to change or be cut all together. Suddenly going from two incomes to one will change the disposable income.
Mistakes in the settlement process can impact you far beyond the immediate future. That's why it's very important to thoroughly understand the process and your rights., The divorce requires that you rethink the trajectory of your life completely. Choose a few goals to move towards over the next months and years, such as buying a home or going back to school. SMART goals are those that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timelyGet a sheet of paper and write out goals that meet these criteria. Then, come up with actionable steps you can take to reach them. Return to your goals on a regular basis to track your progress.

, After being a part of a couple for any length of time, you may find yourself a bit lost if you suddenly have free time. Trying a new hobby is a way to explore something new, and to meet new people without the pressure of dating too soon.A hobby is also a good distraction if you go from a full time parent to the children being gone part of the time; it gives you something to do as you get used to the free time.
Even before you are ready to date again, you need to take time for yourself.

, With the responsibilities of marriage you may have sacrificed some of your previous passions. Perhaps you always wanted to go back to school. Or, you once enjoyed baking, but soon lost the energy to create complex recipes. Maybe you simple enjoyed reading yourself to sleep or practicing a certain religion.


Consider a passion or pastime that you once enjoyed and consider trying it out again. Your divorce could represent a door opening for you to rediscover a long lost love., You may hear all sorts of advice about when you should date or “get back on the horse” so to speak, but your own personal feelings on the subject matter the most. Only get back out there when you have dealt with your divorce emotionally and mentally and feel capable of being a true partner in a new relationship. Here are some tips for getting back out there.


Don't divulge too much information about yourself too soon. Spoon-feed on the details until you feel comfortable that the connection is going somewhere.
Relax your expectations and decrease the pressure. Instead of dating to look for a long-term partner, just start off having a good time.
Try creating an online profile. Casually messaging someone online might reduce some of your newly dating nerves. However, be sure to practice safe dating methods and protect yourself, if you decide to meet in-person., The children will handle the news better if they see that both of you are involved in the choice,even if that isn’t fully the case, and you will remain their parents regardless of the divorce.Before you have the talk with the children, take a bit of time together to decide how you will answer the questions about why you are divorcing. Both of you need to be on the same page about the “why” and not placing blame on one party or the other.

, They may often be fearful of what life is going to look like from now on, so be ready for a lot of logistical questions. Allow the children to ask you both anything, but also understand you may not have all the answers and that’s OK. They may want to know about where they will live in the future or if you will remarry. Those issues are not easily answered and you can always tell them you do not know yet.If they ask questions about why the two of you are divorcing, this is not the time to pour your heart out to them. They are not your support system, and they do not need to know details about what has happened.
Even if you are not sure where everyone will end up living, reassure the children that they will be safe and have access to both parents. Security is a big part of their fear at this point, seeing that both parents are on the same page even if one moves physically out will help.
Part of supporting the children through this process is also giving them the freedom to talk about it with you and with others if they need to. Feeling like they need to keep this “secret” can be very stressful for children, tell them who else you are telling so they know other adults they can talk to if they need to.

, Set clear boundaries as far as which parent is staying in the home and what time with either one of you will look like.As the children process this news, they need to know what to expect. This means being clear about what happens after one of you moves out and how your family will look going forward. The parent who moves out should not be staying over, for example, since this sends a mixed message.
Of course, some married couples are able to eventually work things out, but this is not always the case. If you are trying to work things out, this should not be done in front of the children, in case it does not work.

, Your marriage is ending but you are both still adults, staying civil with the soon to be ex-spouse will make co-parenting easier.Your children may feel like they are stuck in the middle if they see one or both of you angry at the other. They need to know they do not need to make a choice as far as only “loving” one of you. In addition, it is not fair to them to say negative things about your spouse to them.
During the transition, there may be times where things feel awkward, but they should never get to the point where either of you react out of anger or violence. Your spouse is no longer a love interest, but he or she will always be a parent. Focus on that.
Neither parent should ask the children to supply details about the other parent like if he or she is dating anyone new or other non-essential details. That’s not related to the children and it’s not any of your business., The fact is, even after a divorce, you are still family because you share a child or children. Addressing the adjustment for the new dynamics or giving each member of the family time to openly talk about their feelings is a good use of family therapy.Children do need to understand this is not a time to force their parents back together, it is about moving forward with the new separation.
The therapist may see the family all together or different variations of the group depending on what needs to be discussed.

Support is necessary during and after your divorce because connecting with others makes you feel less alone.

Schedule in all your mandatory responsibilities like work and household obligations, but make room for new tasks that allow you to explore a new side of yourself, too.Your new routine should include healthy activities that allow you to connect with others and heal. Try starting a new workout regimen, meditating, joining a club or organization, or visiting new areas in your city.

, One of the most noticeable aspects of divorce is the many new hats you may now have to wear. Where you once split your to-do list with a spouse, you now have to handle all your responsibilities. Many of these may be tasks you always counted on your spouse to do like balancing your checkbook, cooking, or housekeeping and yard work.Ask relatives, friends, or experts in these areas for advice. If it seems like too much, focus on learning one new task at a time. You may be able to get helpful information by reading blogs, checking out books from your local library, or signing up for classes.
However, be aware that you may also have to let some things go because you cannot do it all.

Go room by room in your new home, really thinking about how you want the space to look and feel.

, Divorce presents an opportunity to go back to the drawing board and really ask yourself who you want to be and what you want out of life. Some people may have trouble being single, but spending time sans relationship is integral to figuring out yourself—and making sure you choose a more fitting partner next time around.Use this time to reconnect with your personal values, redefining your beliefs and life purpose.

Travel the world.,
Change your look.,
Date only when you’re ready.",How to Start over After Divorce3," Many people find that the landscape of their social circle changes after a marriage ends.

Make a point to seek out new friendships with people who reflect your personal values.Connect with people through your professional network, parenting groups, social and political organizations, volunteer commitments or religious/spiritual groups. You might also make friends by participating in a support group for divorced people or joining a local Meetup.
Keep in mind that there is often a secondary loss of friends and family members who do not approve of divorce, and who are no longer there for you.

, There’s no better time to revive old passions or explore new ones than after a divorce. You may find your social calendar has more free space, so fill up those empty hours doing activities you enjoy. Pursuing a hobby also helps you connect with potential friends.Think about an activity that you have always been interested in, but never tried. Find a class or group in your area and sign up immediately. Don’t second-guess the decision—just go for it.

, A great way to reinvent yourself post-divorce is by creating new memories. Identify a place, near or far, that you would like to visit and plan a trip. You can ask close friends or family to join you, or venture out on your own., There’s no better way to send the message that you’re starting over than an actual makeover. Look at yourself in the mirror and decide how you want to present yourself to the world moving forward. A change can be minor like selecting a new signature scent, or major like getting your hair colored or cut.You might even choose to sort through your closet, getting rid of clothes that no longer reflect your style. Go shopping for new pieces that flatter your body and compliment your skin tone.
Many people also like to replace the marital bed, and re-do the bedroom in their own style.

, Dating is a tricky area post-divorce. Some loved ones will hound you with blind date proposals. Others will remind you that you should “take your time.” Ignore others’ advice and tune in to yourself and your own needs. You might be ready to date three months after your divorce, or you may decide to wait a year. It’s completely up to you.When you do decide to date, don’t take yourself so seriously. Try not to focus on finding “the one.” Instead, have fun casually meeting new people and going to interesting places.

Look for new friends.,
Join a divorce support group.,
Offer to help people.,
Avoid the temptation to feel sorry for yourself for an extended period of time.",How to Rebuild Your Social Life After Divorce," Of those, who has been a source of support for you throughout the divorce? Continue seeing them and nurturing your friendships with them. Once you feel stronger, be sure to reciprocate their support and recognize all that they have meant to you.;
, There might be some friends it is worth reconnecting with, even after a long time. People can be very understanding, especially when they've been through similar experiences themselves, and it will help to grow your circle of friends.

, Divorce is often a time of life when you reassess your personal direction and the things that you have done. It is an ideal time to start hobbies, sports, activities, jobs/job changes, volunteering, etc. Think about the things that you like doing and would like to do. Explore the ways in which you might fulfill these desires such as joining a club, a gym, a charity, a sports team, etc. When doing something that you really enjoy, you will meet others of a similar mind and inevitably, some of these people will become your friends. Meeting people this way tends to be far more reliable and solid than meeting people in entertainment contexts.

, It will amaze you how similar the experiences of other people can be and how you can derive an incredible sense of solidarity and support from hearing others express their emotions and experiences. All of a sudden you're no longer alone but you are with people who know what you've been through. Discussing these issues in a safe, pressure-free environment can help you to rebuild your social life through an increased sense of self-worth, commonality and shared strength.

, This doesn't need to be any formalized volunteering, although it can be if you wish. Offer to drop an elderly neighbor off at the mall, offer to collect a friend's daughter from dance class, offer to help bake cookies for the upcoming bake sale. Don't stop doing the helpful things that you did pre-divorce and consider increasing this helpfulness. It will get you out and about, meeting people, interacting with the community. And it will help create networks for you, connecting you with opportunities that you're not aware of. In turn, people will help you.

, You have suffered a great loss and you have been grieving. It's likely you're thinking about ""what could have been"". While these emotions and feelings are important to go through and to acknowledge, there must be an end to the grieving. Sitting at home feeling down all the time will not improve your life and won't result in creating a social life for yourself. Talk back to your negative feelings and remember that you are a very worthwhile and valuable individual no matter what has happened. Divorce happens to two people and it is soul-destroying to live on blame and recriminations. Be confident that you can rebuild your life in small steps and that the most effective rebuilding occurs when you reach out to others.

Family members and neighbors
Healthcare providers
Financial planners, accountants, and insurance agents
Teachers and administrators
Employers and professional advisors
Babysitters and day care centers
The parents of your children's friends,school, and teammates.

, Even though you have already changed the passwords to your accounts, your social media presence - especially Facebook - will be highly scrutinized during your divorce.

Draft a marital separation agreement.",How to Separate from Your Wife," You need to be clear in your own mind that you want to separate before informing your wife. You can expect your discussion to be emotional. For that reason, you might back out of the separation. Before even mentioning separation, you need to be clear in your own mind that this is what you want to do.Remember that separation does not automatically mean you get divorced. Instead, separation could be a way for you and your wife to gain some perspective on your relationship.
You can also “legally separate.” Legal separation is a form of long-term separation where you remain married. However, you and your wife would no longer be jointly responsible for finances and debts. For all intents and purposes, you live like a divorced couple.;
, Separating isn’t as easy as walking out the door. You need to think through exactly what will happen before you drop the bomb on your wife. For example, you should consider the following:Do you want to stay in the house or do you want her to leave? If you leave, where will you go? Does she have a place to go if you ask her to leave?
Do you want the separation to be a temporary trial or permanent?
Do you have access to important documents and information, such as birth certificates, financial account information, etc.? You should get this information first.
Do you want to stay with the children? If so, you shouldn’t leave the house. You generally need a court order before you can take children out of their home., You will probably be nervous when you tell your wife that you want a separation. For this reason, you should write a script where you tell your spouse why you are leaving and also your expectations for the separation.


Focus on using “I” statements instead of “you” statements. For example, “I think I’ve changed” is better than “You’re not the woman I thought you were.”
Focus on why the marriage isn’t working for you and why you are leaving.For example, you could say, “I’ve been married since I was 22 and think I need to find out what I really want. I think that might only happen if I spend some time on my own.”
Avoid trying to convince your wife that the separation is a good idea for her, too. You can’t speak for her. For this reason, avoid saying, “You should take this time to figure out if you’re happy.” Instead, focus on your reasons for separating.

, It is better to schedule a specific time to talk about separating than to blurt out that you want to separate in the middle of a fight.You should tell your spouse, “We need to talk about something important. Is now a good time?” If not, then ask to schedule a time to talk.If you are afraid of your wife physically attacking you, then you might want to schedule a discussion in public. People often control themselves better when there are other people around.
You should also realize that it may take your spouse a long time to just process what was said. For this reason, you may need to speak more than once to hammer out the details of your separation.

, Try not to be defensive or aggressive when telling your wife that you want to separate. Instead, remember to go through your script slowly and pause to judge her reaction. She might immediately go into a state of shock and not really hear what you are saying.


For example, you could say, “Mary, I need some time to figure out how I feel about our marriage. I think a separation will allow me to get some perspective on our relationship and on what I want. Maybe if we live separately for a while, we can sort things out.”, You need to listen to whatever your wife says in response to your request for a separation.If she needs to vent, then let her vent. Also, if you think she is keeping emotions bottled inside, you could say, “Please, Sherry, I’m willing to listen to whatever you have to say.”


When you interrupt someone, you invalidate what they are feeling. Your wife’s resentment could harden if she feels like you are trying to silence her. Let her talk, and make eye contact as she talks.
Remember that separation is a process—you will probably see your wife frequently in the coming months and years, even if you don’t have children. It is best to try and be as understanding so that the separation can be as smooth as possible.

, Many couples never tell their children that they are separating, particularly when the children are very young. However, you need to tell your children. Remember to follow these rules:Don’t blame. You don’t need to blame your wife for the separation. Don’t say, “Your mother has made it impossible for me to stay.” You could instead say: “I need to go away for a while to think things through.”
Don’t overshare. Your children don’t need to know the details of why the marriage is not working out. In fact, the more children know, the more harm they suffer.
Avoid asking the children who they want to stay with.
Tell your children you love them and tell them that you will stay in constant contact. Tell them where you are staying and that you will see them soon.

, It is probably easier to be the one who leaves the house. After talking about why you want to separate, you should leave. Give your wife your phone number so that she can talk to you.Be sure not to leave with property you own together with your wife. She might think you are permanently trying to deprive her of it.
Instead, pack a bag full of clothes and personal items, like toiletries or anything you will need to get through a week.

, Because of the emotional toll separation can take on a family, you should consider therapy before, during, or after the separation. Therapy can help family members deal with the feelings of guilt, depression, and anxiety.You should also have considered therapy as an alternative to separating.


You can get a referral to a family or couples therapist by asking your family doctor.
Some websites, such as Psychology Today, also have locators you can use. Type in your city or zip code to find therapists near you., Separating from a spouse almost always reduces your income and increases your expenses. Accordingly, you need to create a budget, preferably before you separate.You can make a budget with your wife. However, since you will be living alone, you really need to take control of financial decision-making yourself.


Look at all sources of income. If you are staying with the children, you can expect child support payments from your wife. But these can take time to establish. Also, you should ideally manage to support yourself as best as you can without relying on your spouse.
Take a hard look at your expenses. If you were used to splitting the cost of car insurance, food, and entertainment with your wife, you will now be entirely responsible for those. Your individual expenses could increase as a result.

, You will need a cushion to help you transition to your single life. Ideally, you should save at least three months of expenses. This amount will give you time to set up your new life., Any balance on a joint credit card is generally the responsibility of both you and your wife. You want to make sure that no new expenses are added to the card. Call up the credit card company and ask that no new charges be allowed on the card.If necessary, you can close the card.


You also should try to get a credit card in your own name. You should not use any joint card after you separate.

, Once you decide to separate, you don’t want your wife cleaning out the joint bank account. For this reason, you should move quickly to either close the account or require that both spouses provide signatures before money can be removed.Call up your bank and ask how you can limit withdrawals. Also cancel overdraft lines and lines of credit.
Make sure to have any direct deposit routed to a new bank account. This may take some time to go through so start as soon as possible.
If you need your wife to agree to close the account, then you should find a good time to talk and raise the issue with her. You could say, “Since we’re living apart, I think it would be a good idea for each of us to have our own bank account. This way we’ll each have a better sense of our expenses. I’ve talked to the bank and they need both of us to sign a form.”

, There are many legal issues involved with separating from your spouse. You are advised to meet with a family law attorney and discuss the separation. Each person’s separation is different, and only a qualified attorney can identify and untangle any legal issues.To find a family law attorney, you can contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral.Once you have the name of an attorney, you should call and schedule a consultation. Ask ahead of time how much the attorney charges.

, You and your wife need to discuss who will take care of the children. Generally, it is best for the parent who stays in the house to have custody, since there is rarely a good reason to remove children from familiar surroundings.


You might find it easier to leave the house but want to seek custody of your children at a later date. In this situation, you need to remain closely involved with your children.
Make sure to visit often and also have your children frequently spend the night with you. In fact, you and your wife should draft a temporary child custody agreement. It does not need to be particularly detailed, but it should identify when each parent will have custody of the children.You and your wife could also agree to divide your time in the home. For example, you could both pay to rent an apartment in town. On Mondays through Thursdays, you could stay in the apartment while your wife stays at home. On Fridays through Sundays, you could then stay in the home while your wife is in the apartment.

, If you aren’t the person who will take care of your children, then you can expect to pay child support to your wife. You must pay child support even if you aren’t divorced.There really isn’t any wriggle room for getting out of child support payments, so you might as well try to estimate how much you will have to pay each month.


There are many online calculators you can use to estimate monthly support payments.You enter information about your salary and the number of children that you have, and the calculator estimates your payments.
See Calculate Child Support for more information.

, Your wife may have abused you or the children. In these situations, you will need to get a restraining order. You can get a restraining order, also called a protective order, by stopping into your local courthouse and asking for the forms.


See Get a Protective Order for more information.

, Sometimes separation is temporary, but other times separation can be permanent. In some states, you can get a “legal separation,” which is like a divorce although you remain legally married. When you legally separate, you divide assets and debts just as divorced people do. You also settle on child custody arrangements.You should discuss this option with your attorney and identify your reasons for seeking legal separation:


You might want to stay married but legally separate if either you or your wife has a religious objection to divorce.
Legal separation can also be helpful if one spouse needs to stay on the other’s insurance or if one spouse is close to qualifying for spousal Social Security benefits.

, You can begin the legal separation process by drafting a marital separation agreement, which is like a divorce settlement agreement. You and your wife agree on a division of assets, debts, child support, and spousal support (alimony).Although you can create a marital separation agreement if you separate temporarily, they are more common for people who choose to permanently separate.


The marital separation agreement becomes a contract between you and your wife. If either of you violate the agreement, the other could sue in court.
You each should have your own attorney draft and look over the agreement.

Check that it's okay to take gravestone or tombstone rubbings in your local cemetery.,
Assemble the items needed.,
Select a suitable gravestone.,
Clean the gravestone.,
Place the sheet of plain paper over the desired gravestone.,
Hold the paper while you tape it in place.,
Start rubbing.,
Once completed, carefully remove the tape or poster tack from the back of the gravestone.,
Return home.",How to Make a Gravestone Rubbing," Some headstones may be considered too fragile to take rubbings but on the whole, most people won't mind you taking a rubbing.


Be considerate if there is a funeral taking place nearby.
Don't trespass! If the cemetery asks that people keep out, it is for a good reason, most likely your safety or for preservation of the graves.;
, You'll need a soft brush, scissors, masking tape, large sheet of paper or rice paper, rubbing wax or a large, sturdy dark colored crayon, spray bottle with distilled water, a clean rag, rubber band and a poster tube.

, In choosing a gravestone for a rubbing, look for well defined text and patterns that interest you. If you like how it looks, that should be enough of a reason to take a rubbing of that gravestone. Another reason might be that you're researching the family tree and want to take a rubbing of a specific family member's gravestone. Or perhaps you just want to take a rubbing of a historical gravestone.


If you can't find a particular gravestone that you know should be in the cemetery, ask the cemetery caretaker to assist you.

, Be respectful when deciding whether it's okay to touch a gravestone. Some look better with the signs of age on them but usually cleaning off moss, dirt, bird droppings, squashed insects, etc. is fine. Start by using the soft brush to take off the easiest dirt build-up, and if needed, wipe over gently using the water sprayer. You only need to clean enough to show the distinguishable features on the gravestone. Some key things to note are:


Some gravestones are very fragile. If you notice breakage, decay and erosion, err on the side of alerting the cemetery caretaker rather than attempting to clean it.
Never use anything stronger than water to clean the gravestone. A few spritzes and a wipe with the rag should sufficient. If the dirt is not coming off with this method, then leave it well alone.

, Cut off any excess but having a little tuck around the back of the gravestone makes it much easier for you to tape it in place and gives the paper the most stability.

, You might also consider using poster tack. Make sure that the tape is easy to remove afterwards and isn't likely to harm the gravestone in any way. Be especially careful to avoid taping over any eroded parts of the stone, as the sticky side will lift out crumbling stone when you remove it.

, Using the rubbing wax or crayon, begin from outer edges of the headstone and work your way in. This way, you identify the border or edging and can gradually rub in the remaining design outlines. Be sure to get both the text and any patterns used on the gravestone.


Keep rubbing until the design depth and wax or crayon shading is sufficiently to your liking. There are no rules on what's enough––it's what suits your needs that counts.

, Roll the rubbing up with care and place a rubber band around it. If you've brought along a poster tube, slip the rubbing inside it for protection on the way home. If you wish to make more gravestone rubbings, select the next one and repeat the steps above until you've made enough rubbings.

, Once back at home, trim the rubbing into a neat shape along the sides and decide what to do with it next. If you'd like to display it, it can be simply framed on a wider backing of cardstock in a nice color or even just tack it straight to the wall as it is. If using for genealogy purposes, you may need to take a photo of it to upload online for other family members.

Determine your reason for creating a genogram.,
Understand what you are looking for.,
Decide how many generations you need to represent in your genogram.,

Write down what you know already.,
Talk to family members.,
Search through family books and documents, and the internet.,
Look at your own history.,
Learn the familial relationships.,
Learn the emotional relationships.,
Design your genogram.,
Use standard genogram symbols to represent family members and relationships, both normal and dysfunctional.The symbols act as a visual indicator of the information you gathered in your interviews.,
Organize the chart based on family interactions beginning with the oldest generation you want to represent at the top.,
Look for patterns.",How to Make a Genogram," The purpose of your genogram will help you to focus on the type of family information you want to collect. It's also likely to help you decide with whom you will share the completed diagram––sometimes the information might be considered upsetting or too sensitive for some family members, so you'll need to judge that depending on the context.


Genograms can focus on a number of hereditary patterns and issues including substance abuse, mental illness, and physical violence, as well as many physical illnesses.
Genograms can provide health care workers with a visual document that tracks the history of your current mental or medical proclivities through your family bloodline.;
, Once you know why you're making a genogram, whether it’s for a healthcare provider, school project, or just to get to know you and your family more, knowing what it is you want to learn can help you to organize how you go about populating your genogram.


Genograms are like family trees. Only in addition to looking at the branches, you also look at the leaves on each branch. You'll not only learn who is in your family, but how everyone is connected through physical and emotional relationships.
For example, a genogram can tell you who is married, divorced, widowed, etc. It will also tell you how many kids each union (typically between two individuals) has, what each child is like, and what the individual relationships are between members on more than just a physical level.
Think about what kind of information you want to learn from making your genogram. Do you want to know who in your family has depression, addictions, or a history of cancer? Perhaps you want to know more about why your mother and her mother never get along, by looking for the right clues you’ll be able to make a genogram that serves your goals., This will give you a clear idea of who you will need to approach for information to complete your diagram and whether this will be possible given people's ages and geographical location.


Luckily, you can always use email, Skype, and other communication devices to get in touch with family members that you may not be able to meet in person.
Knowing how far back you need to go will also make the process easier and quicker. Do you want to start with your grandparents? Maybe you want to go further back to your great grandparents. Deciding how far to go back will give you an idea of who you need to contact.

, Here are some examples:


”Beginning with your grandmother, what was her name, who was she married to, and when/how did she pass away? What was her ethnicity?”
”How many children did your mother’s parents have?”
”Did abuse drugs or alcohol?”
”Did have any mental or physical illnesses? What were/are they?”

, Chances are, you already know quite a bit about your family history, especially if you’re close with one or more of your family members.


Take a look at the questions you’ve formed and see how many you can answer on your own.

, Once you’ve exceeded your own knowledge, it’s time to talk to family members. Ask questions about family relationships and significant events. Take good notes.


While the questions you have written down will help you with the outline of what you’re trying to learn, you may also get useful information you didn’t think about when you listen to stories from your family members.
Be mindful that these discussions may be difficult for some family members.
Be prepared to listen to lots of stories. Stories are some of the best means by which we remember and transfer information––encourage these as they arise by listening attentively and asking open-ended questions that motivate the person to share more information.

, Sometimes your family won’t be able to remember everything you need to know, or they may not wish to share it with you.


Web searches or family books can be used to cross check what you’ve learned from your family or fill in some gaps.
However, you should be sure that this information is accurate if you decide to use it.

, You have a wealth of information within your own personal history that can help you with a baseline.


Gather information from your own medical records.
Take into account what medications you may be using, as you can use this information to find out if any of your family members take the same, or similar medication for a condition.

, When making a genogram you’ll need to know how everyone in your family is connected. Research the unions between family members, gathering information on marriages, divorces, children, etc.


Take note of who is married, who is divorced, who may be living together outside of marriage.
Is anyone widowed? What about separation, or forced separation?
Depending on what you’re trying to learn from making a genogram, you may have to ask some deeper, and sometimes uncomfortable questions to determine relationships. You may have to know if anyone in your family had one-night or very short term relationships and how many. Or, if anyone was ever in a forced relationship.
Be mindful of who you are talking to and what kinds of questions you are asking as this could be uncomfortable for some.

, Now that you know how everyone is connected, it’s time to learn what kind of emotional relationships your family members have/had. Uncovering the answers to the emotional questions will be extremely useful when trying to determine any psychological factors in your family.


Are members of a union loving? Do members get along? Maybe some of your family can’t stand each other.
As you dig deeper, look for patterns of abuse or neglect. You can go even further and differentiate between physical and emotional components.

, Genogram templates are available online or you can start from scratch and fill one out by hand.You can also purchase software programs designed specifically for creating genograms.

, You can draw the standard genogram symbols by hand or by using the ""draw"" or ""shapes"" options in a word processing program.


Males are indicated by a square. When indicating a marriage, position the male symbol to the left.
Women are indicated by a circle. When indicating a marriage, position the female symbol to the right.
A single horizontal line indicates marriage and two slanted lines separation.
The oldest child is always below and to the left of his family, whereas the youngest should be below and to the right.
Other available symbols help you describe family events such as pregnancy or miscarriage, illnesses and deaths. There is even a diamond symbol to represent pets.

, For example, you may decide to start your genogram with your grandparents or even your great grandparents. Genograms can be used to show the diversity in family relationships as well as patterns of illnesses.


A genogram includes symbols to indicate family interactions such as conflict, closeness, estrangement, etc. Emotional relationships have specific symbols that help keep the flow of the genogram clear.
There are also symbols that denote sexual and physical abuse as well as mental and physical disorders.

, Once you've made the genogram, look carefully to see what patterns can be identified. There may be hereditary patterns or particular psychological tendencies that are very noticeable when grouped together in this way.


Be careful about making assumptions. The data is one thing, but avoid using it to confirm that your family has a particular disease, or mental issue. Talk to a medical professional about any potential for hereditary problems of this type.
Avoid using the genogram to make assumptions about the motivations of family members as well, or using this to confront them. While you might find your aunt has a tendency to quit every job she has ever had while your cousin has always seemed to steal other people's boyfriends, it's not a good idea to use the genogram to ""prove"" your point that a family member needs psychoanalysis. Be very careful to avoid approaching your family members in a judgmental way as a result of making a genogram; talk to your family or personal counselor before proceeding to reach conclusions from a self-generated genogram.
If you're writing up the family history, patterns established in a genogram can be very helpful as a way of explaining why ancestral family members left one geographical area for another, what sorts of relationship issues members had and may help to unearth other family members who were not officially recognized.

Choose the divisions of the shield.,
Choose the shield’s color.",How to Create Your Own Coat of Arms1," Shields are often shaped like an upside down triangle with a slight curvature of the vertical lines. Feel free to be creative and change the shape to whatever you desire! For some inspiration, try experimenting with drawing different shapes or conduct a Google search to look up the various shapes of shields.









The shapes of shields generally represent different eras. For example, the 11th and 12th centuries used a triangle with curved corners and the early 13th century shaped their shields similar to a guitar pick.;
, “Divisions” refers to how the shield is segmented or what shapes go on the shield. For example, you may want to section the shield into three parts. Perhaps you want to add three diamonds horizontally across the shield. There are numerous ways to divide the shield. When designing your own, you can reference classic heraldry or choose your own design., In some cases, depending on how you want to display your shield, you may use different colors in the various divisions of your shield. You can also choose to not divide the shield at all and simply use one color or no colors at all.








If you choose to use color, you could use colors such as bright red, royal or sky blue, emerald green, royal purple, black.
If you choose to go for a metallic shield, gold or silver are your best bets.

Start by trying to make basic recipes from a cookbook, or browse online for authentic recipes. If possible, asks relatives for recipes, advice, or help in the kitchen to cook a meal., Bring your family together to prepare and share meals from your heritage. Children and adults alike can contribute to the cooking and preparation, allowing everyone to learn a bit more about the cultural traditions of your people. Make this kind of supper a regular event for your family, or invite your extended family for a more elaborate celebration on a larger scale., Make an event out of going for supper at a restaurant that serves food from your heritage. Find a local restaurant that makes authentic dishes and that represents the art, music, and language of the country or region. Read restaurant reviews online to get a sense of where you will find bona fide, homemade fare.For instance, visit an Italian trattoria that serves homemade pasta and wood-fired pizza.

, Use crafts to celebrate your family's heritage by making a scrapbook. Decorate the pages with accessories like stickers, ribbons, and glitter and choose customized fonts for the text. Add documents like photos, birth certificates, marriage certificates, and any other important, historical items.You can also pay to have a scrapbook made for you on websites like MyPublisher and MixBook.

, Look into crafts or decorations from your heritage and try to make your own. In today's digital age, may traditional skills are being left behind instead of being passed down from generation to generation.Ask an older relative to teach you a craft from your heritage, or find a book or website to instruct you through the process., Celebrate your heritage by adorning your home or work space with traditional items. Artwork from your culture, or traditional decorative items will brighten up a room and accentuate your cultural background. Ask relatives for ideas, or look online for items that will add to your decor.For instance, if you are of Irish or Scottish descent, you can decorate your space with traditional knot work designs.

, If you don't already speak the language from your cultural background, learning it is a great way to celebrate your family heritage. Sign up for languages courses at your school, cultural centre, or local community college. You can also look for free courses online and download helpful language apps for your phone (e.g. Duolingo).Ask for help from friends or family members that already speak the language.

, Wearing a traditional outfit from your heritage is an excellent way to show off your cultural pride and identity. Begin by asking your family if they already have a traditional outfit or costume that you can use, or research online where you might buy or rent one. If you are adept at sewing, you can look online for sewing patterns to make your own garments to wear.For example, you can rent or buy a kilt to wear if you’re from a Scottish background, particularly for an important event like a wedding, If your family has history near where you live, ask them to take you to spots where they grew up and hung out. Seek out locations that reflect your cultural heritage if your family does not have personal heritage near where you live. If it is financial possible, plan a trip to the region where your ancestors are from to fully experience the roots of your heritage.It can cost a fair amount of money to visit your ancestral hometown, especially if it is far away. Plan months or even a year in advance to make the trip.

, After all of your hard work and research, the ultimate way to celebrate your family heritage is to throw a party. You should begin to plan the part at least a month in advance and send out invitations accordingly. Invite friends and family to share in the music, cuisine, dress, and spirit of your family heritage.

, If your family already has a family tree, take time to review it. Ask your family about people on the tree that you don't recognize, and about important life events like marriage and childbirth which shaped the tree. If you don’t have a family tree, work on a family tree (alone or with your family members) by gathering information and photos. Trace your ancestry by joining a genealogy project, visiting websites like ancestry.com, or getting DNA test to learn your exact ancestry.To make a family tree, you can draw a tree and extend a branch for each family member. Put their name and photo on that branch.

, Once you have learned what cultures are represented in your family tree, learn more about them. You may begin your research with a fair amount of prior knowledge, or you might know very little about what culture(s) you come from. Look online or at your local library for information about history, religion, dress, etiquette, and holidays., Talk to your family about ancestors that they remember. Ask them to share memories about your family members. If you have family that emigrated to the country you’re living in now, ask for them to share memories and details of their home country.Ask family about where they grew up, what kind of foods they made or make, holidays they celebrate, and what traditions they practice(d).

, Bring out photos that you have of family members. Ask your family to bring out old photos as well. Share them and talk about them. Ask about the people in the photos that you don’t recognize. If the photos aren’t organized, put them in a photo album to be reviewed in the future.You can also scan the photos to create a digital album.

, Visiting the gravestones of deceased family members may seem morbid, but it is a good way to see part of your family's history firsthand. If you know where your ancestors’ gravestones are located, visit them with family. Take photos of them, transcribe them, and document them for future generations., Genealogy societies consist of people that have an interest in researching and learning about their family background. Locate one in your area and become a member. A genealogy society is a great place to learn more about your family history and share it with others., If you don’t know people outside of your family that share your heritage, try reaching out to individuals at school or work with the same cultural background. Look for clubs, associations, or groups in your area that celebrate your culture. You can also reach out to people in your community by asking if they’d like to share some of their family history.

, Social media, if used correctly, is a great tool to share things that matter with you and connect with the world. It is also a good tool for celebrating your family heritage. Reach out to family members on social media that you may not talk to often. Upload photos of your family on social media accounts with your contacts and family members. You can also create photo albums on social media about your family heritage.If the family members that you are sharing photos of are alive, make sure you have their permission before posting photos of them.

Select the charges for your shield.,
Choose the colors for your charges.,
Decide the posture for your charges.",How to Create Your Own Coat of Arms2," The designs on the shield are known as charges. You can use animals, flowers, stars, crescent moons, sunbursts, or mythological creatures. Most animals are shown to be two-dimensional, meaning that they look flat and only the characteristics that distinguish them as an animal, like tails, are obvious.









The most common animals used on shields include lions, bears, boars, eagles, horses, dragons, and griffins.

, Traditionally speaking, if you chose a metallic color for your shield, then you should use a color for your charges and vice versa. In classic heraldry, different colors symbolize different traits. However, feel free to use the colors that you would like to use, since this is your own design.









Gold or yellow symbolize generosity.
Silver or white represent peace and serenity.
Blue represents truth and loyalty.
Red represents a warrior or military strength.
Green represents hope and joy.
Black represents grief or constancy.
Purple represents royalty or justice.
Orange represents ambition.
Maroon represents patience in battle yet achieving victory., The charges on a coat of arm can appear in different postures, depending on how you want to represent yourself. If your charges are animals or creatures, they will appear on your shield as they would naturally, standing on their hind legs, standing on hind legs face turned toward you, walking, lying down, or sitting.









Charges that are standing are generally regarded as more alert, fierce, and prepared for battle, whereas seated charges generally symbolize peacefulness and serenity.

Choose accessories to add to the outside of your shield.,
Decide on the helm.,
Pick a helmet.,
Pick out your mantling.",How to Create Your Own Coat of Arms3," Lay out the rest of your coat of arms by choosing from the different parts and accessories. This could be a crown symbol, plants or flowers, weaponry, or something that you believe symbolizes yourself or your family.








If you love flowers, you could incorporate flower, vines, or plant designs all around your shield.
You could incorporate flames for a more powerful vibe.

, The item that sits on top of the shield is the helm. For example, some people use a coronet, which is similar to the pillow that the king's helmet sits on. The coronet would rest on the shield.









You could draw a soft bed of vines or plants or not even draw a helm at all.

, If you choose to use a coronet as part of your crest, the helmet will sit on the coronet. The can be of almost any style. Feel free to be creative! Depending on the style of helmet, there may be a crest atop the helmet. This crest often includes something like the head of a rooster or stag. It varied from family to family, and whether the family was of higher peerage.

There are various styles of helmets that you can draw, such as the Ancient helmet, the Ancient Roman helmet, or the Barrel helmet.If you are unsure what to draw for a helmet, conduct a Google search of helmets used in coats of arms and browse through the thousands of websites and images for inspiration.

, Mantling refers to the leaves that usually attach to the top of the helmet or the bottom of the crest. These leaves can be from any plant that you choose. For example, you could choose the leaves of an oak tree to symbolize strength and growth.







"

Choose your supporters.,
Decide if you would like to include a compartment under the shield.,
Design your banner.,
Finish the banner.",How to Create Your Own Coat of Arms4," Supporters can be animals, birds, or persons that appear to be supporting or holding up the shield. This is an important aspect of the coat of arms, as it takes up as much space as the shield itself! Think about what symbolizes you.





If you feel like you are a bold, strong, fiery person, you could choose dragons to support your shield.
If you feel you are quiet and wise, you could choose sparrows or another type of bird to support the shield.
Your supporters do not have to be two of the same kind of animal or person. For example, you could use a lion and a griffin.

, The compartment usually consists of simple leaves or branches that take up the space between the shield and the banner below. You could also try ribbons or bows.







, The banner is a pretty simple ribbon that displays your motto. For the motto, you can use an inspirational saying, such as “Believe in yourself and you will be unstoppable” or it could have your full name on it. Remember that the coat of arms represents you, so put something on the banner that is meaningful to you.









You could also use a saying in another language or use a quote. You could consult with your family to come up with a statement or saying.

, Once you have added these last finishing touches, look it over to see if there is anything else you would like to add. If not, sit back and enjoy your new coat of arms!

Begin by learning what to expect when weaning takes place.,
Learn what to expect from your body during the weaning process.,
Understand that emotional shifts are very likely to occur.,
Recognize that your baby will be affected by the weaning process as well.,
Let your child ""run the show"".",How to Stop Breastfeeding a Toddler1," You will be better prepared to handle any bumps in the road that may occur if you are not surprised by the events that can potentially accompany the weaning process.;
, Natural changes will take place and a good comprehension of those changes will help you to perceive them when they do occur as a normal reaction to cessation of breastfeeding.

, Hormonal changes are not just presented as physical symptoms, but often affect emotions and moods as well. Expect a roller coaster of emotions for a bit as your body adjusts to the change.

, It can be very difficult to deal with your toddler at the time of weaning. Understand that your baby is going through a forced transition that is not understood by him.

, To avoid a cranky response or violent temper-tantrum from your child, it's best to let them decide when to stop. It may be necessary to help break them of the habit, but recognize their willingness to stop, if they decide first. You'll notice your breasts still being engorged in milk, after they ""finish"" suckling at them.

Put the child first.,
Consider professional help.,
Decide how to split time.,
Decide how to divide other responsibilities.,
Get a judge to approve the agreement.",How to Make Shared Custody Work1," In a shared custody arrangement, a legal plan is created to determine parental rights and responsibilities.When creating the plan, write down all of the child’s activities. Then, figure out which parent is best prepared to stick to the routine. Specifically, focus on what would work best for:Your children's ages, temperaments, and emotional needs
The career and social commitments of each parent (work schedules and social commitments, for example)
The academic and extracurricular activities your children are involved in (who will find it easiest to get the kids to soccer practice or piano lessons, fore example?)
Child-care arrangements and the distance between the parents' homes;
, When creating this plan, it may be helpful to have a third party facilitate the discussion. Consider hiring a mediator or attorneys to make this process smoother.During a divorce, both parents may be too emotional to craft a plan like this on their own.
In some cases, the court may offer mediation services for this purpose.

, After thinking about your children's needs, the next step is generally to determine how to divide up custody time. In other words, you have to decide who gets the kids when. There are any number of possible arrangements.


One common choice is the ""2-2-3 plan."" In this arrangement, kids spend Monday and Tuesday with Mom, Wednesday and Thursday with Dad, Friday through Sunday with Mom. Then, the schedule flips: Monday and Tuesday with Dad, and so on.Another arrangement is a simple Monday through Thursday/Friday through Sunday plan, in which the week is simply divided into two chunks. This isn't a completely even split, but works well for school aged children, who get to leave for school from the same home every day.Some people find that longer periods with each parent help create a better sense of stability for the children, and choose to alternate full weeks, months, or even years..

, Shared custody isn't just about scheduling where the children spend their days and nights. Other agreements should be reached about major parenting responsibilities.


If a child needs to visit the doctor, for instance, does the responsibility for that simply fall with the parent he or she is staying with at the time? Or, are both parents always involved? What about parent-teacher conferences?
Who gets the final say over major decisions in a child's life, such as when a child can start dating, or how to deal with major disciplinary matters? Are these responsibilities delegated, or will they be discussed by both parents?
Ultimately, being able to make major decisions like this as a team is what will make shared custody work. If you don't think you'll be able to have these types of conversations moving forward, until the children are grown, shared custody may not be the right arrangement for your children., A shared custody appointment must be formally approved by a judge to be legal. In most cases, if both parents agree to the terms of the agreement, a judge will sign off on it.In cases in which parents cannot agree, a judge may offer input or otherwise intervene in the creation of a custody plan.
If either parent believes the other is not living up to the agreement, he or she may ask the judge to intervene to compel him or her to do so, or to alter the agreement."

Begin weaning in a slow, calculated manner.,
Gradually reduce the nursing sessions over the course of time.",How to Stop Breastfeeding a Toddler2," A slow and gradual cessation is better for both the baby and mom. Abruptly ceasing all nursing sessions can be traumatic for both the baby and moms body, and can even make the mom more susceptible to developing a clogged breast duct, inflammation or the painful breast infection Mastitis.

, If your baby has become accustomed to a nursing session after lunch everyday, eliminate all after lunch sessions for one week. The following week, remove the early evening sessions or any other session that occurs routinely. Now, two routine feeding sessions have been taken from your baby. Continue to reduce all nursing sessions until you have effectively weaned your baby completely.

"
"
Stop allowing your baby to see your naked breasts.,
Hold your baby differently.,
Stay away from environmental triggers.",How to Stop Breastfeeding a Toddler3," Do not get dressed or undressed in front of your baby. Avoid bathing with your baby. If your baby sees your breast, he will be reminded of what they offer and will likely make an attempt to nurse.

, Refrain from holding your baby in the position that was generally used to nurse him. Positioning differently can be useful in distracting your baby from his desire to nurse.

, Avoid sitting in the usual chair that you nursed your baby in and avoid taking your baby into the room that was routinely used to nurse in. Switch up as many routines as you can that may trigger your baby to desire a nursing session.

"
"
Distract your baby.,
Keep your baby busy.,
Find alternate ways for your baby to fall asleep.",How to Stop Breastfeeding a Toddler4," Babies are easily distracted. Step outside with your baby and go for a walk. Sing a favorite song or try using food as a distraction. Be creative ad do whatever it takes to change his focus.

, A busy baby will be less likely to think about stopping what he is doing to nurse. As children age, they naturally want to avoid naps. They prefer to continue exploring the magnificent world of wonders around them until they pass out or become so cranky that they eventually pass out.

, A ride in the car or walk in the carriage may work well in place of being nursed to sleep. Even some sleepy time with dad in the hammock can do the trick.

Replace breastfeeding sessions with sippy cups that offer yummy treats.,
Swap out the breast for a bottle.,
Use solid food as a replacement for breast milk.,
Offer healthy snacks to your baby.",How to Stop Breastfeeding a Toddler5," Keep in mind that healthy can still be yummy, so avoid unhealthy substitutes. Remember that your baby received his nutrition and immunity from your breast milk and weaning requires added nutrients to keep your baby healthy.

, Often, breastfed babies refuse to drink from a bottle. Offer the bottle at times other than nap times. Your baby is accustomed to falling asleep in his mom’s arms while sucking on the breast and he will not be receptive to replacing mom and the breast with a bottle. Instead, offer the bottle when your baby is preoccupied, such as when he is going for a stroll in the carriage. This will allow your baby to adjust to the bottle with out giving it much thought on his part or expecting mom to cuddle with him.

, A baby with a full belly is less likely to want to nurse. Keep food substitutes on the healthy side and refrain from bribing him with unhealthy treats.

, Yummy snacks are a distraction to your baby, and he may easily forget his desire to nurse at the moment if he sees his favorite snack get pulled out of the cabinet.

Be ready for mom's discomfort.,
Prevent milk ducts from being clogged.,
Apply cold compresses to the breasts if they become sore.,
Wear a bra that fits properly.,
Avoid feeling guilty for weaning your baby.,
Expect to feel saddened by the weaning process at times.",How to Stop Breastfeeding a Toddler6," Know that the breast may become swollen and painful as milk is not released as frequently as it has been accustomed to. Relieve the pressure by expressing a small amount of milk from the breast. Do not remove too much as this will only make the body thinks it needs to produce more milk. The body needs to slowly reduce the amount of milk it thinks the baby needs.

, Massage your breasts in a gentle fashion to prevent milk ducts from becoming clogged and forming tender lumps in the breast. Massaging while in the shower is generally easier and painless, even if the breasts are swollen.

, Alternatively, try placing a few cabbage leaves on the breasts. Cabbage leaves are helpful with pain relief and the milk cessation process.

, You want to wear a firm-fitting bra that has no underwire sewn in. Ill-fitting bras may cause unnecessary discomfort to tender breasts.

, When your baby pleads with you to offer the breast, it can leave you feeling heartbroken, selfish and frustrated. Keep in mind that your baby will adjust to his new feeding schedule soon.

, Nursing has been a special bond between baby and mother that is now coming to an end. It is normal to have feelings of sadness associated with these endings, but these feelings will subside in time.

"
"
Be consistent.,
Speak respectfully about the other parent.,
Keep lines of communication open.,
Drop your kids off at your ex's home rather than waiting for them to be picked up from your home.,
Listen to your child.,
Re-evaluate and modify the custody plan if necessary.",How to Make Shared Custody Work2," For shared custody parenting to be effective, there must be a certain amount of consistency between parents with regard to rules and discipline. Whatever you and the other parent have agreed to, stick to it.


Children need consistency and routine in their lives. Children in shared-custody parenting situations already have less of it than many children raised in a single household, by virtue of the fact that they are moving from house to house. To the extent it is possible, create consistency between the households.For example, if you've agreed on a 10pm bedtime for your child, don't push it to 10:30 to try to be the ""cool"" parent. Your child may enjoy this in the moment, but it isn't good for his or her mental well-being over the long term.

, When the other parent comes up, as will inevitably occur, speak respectfully about him or her. Never speak badly about the other parent in front of the child, no matter how angry or upset you might be.Remember that your child still loves your ex, and your ex loves the child. Just because he or she may have been a bad husband or wife, it doesn't mean that your ex is also a bad parent. Don't demean or undercut the other parent in front of the child.Keep in mind that, especially in the early days of the separation, your child may be harboring anger toward both you and the other parent. Badmouthing your ex in front of your child may worsen this situation.
For example, if your child asks ""Why don't you love dad anymore?"" you could reply with something like ""Well, your father and I just disagree about what's most important in life."" Don't say, ""Your dad is a jerk and he doesn't understand what's important in life.""

, When your child is staying with you, he or she may at times wish to speak to the other parent. This may happen even if he or she only staying with you a short time. You should almost always allow this.


Your children should be allowed to call, text, or email the other parent at any reasonable hour. Children often experience anxiety from being separated from a beloved parent. Being allowed to contact the other parent at any time can help lessen this anxiety.If this occurs, try not take it personally. Just because your children want to talk to their other parent doesn't mean they don't love your or want to be around you also.
At holidays, if your children are staying with you, they should be encouraged to call the other parent.For example, you might say ""Hey kids, I'm sure your mom would really like to hear from you, since it's Christmas day. Let's give her a call.""

, When it's time for your children to go visit the other parent, always drop them off instead of waiting for your ex to come get them. Encourage your ex to do the same when the children come to visit you.


Dropping the kids off, rather than waiting for a pickup, helps avoid the sensation of the children being ""taken away"" by one parent or the other.This can make the transition between households easier for both the children and the parent they are leaving for a while.
This also reduces the risk of interrupting a special moment between your children and your ex.

, Make sure that, whatever your child's age, he or she gets express feelings about and have some input on the custody arrangements. This will help the child feel more secure and loved, regardless of which home he or she is at.For young children, give them some control over small matters, such as which toys they want to take when changing households. For example, you could say, ""Time to go see your dad! Is there anything you want to take with you this weekend?""
For teens, you might give them the opportunity to make suggestions about which home they would prefer to be at on given days of the week. Based on their calendar of activities and social events, they may know better than you which is the more convenient home for them to live at on any given night. For example, you might say, ""It seems like your social calendar is pretty full these days. Does the schedule we have make sense these days, or is there anyway your father and I could make things easier for you?""
Ultimately, you and the other parent are in control and have the final say on these matters, but giving the child an opportunity to be heard will make this situation more agreeable to him or her.

, As your children get older, life will change, both for them and for you. Be willing to revisit the custody plan and make adjustments to reflect these changes.Particularly during adolescence, children may push against the routine as they become more interested in spending time with friends and less with parents. Be flexible about such changes.Your own life and needs may change as well, for example, when and if you develop a new romantic relationship or even marry another partner. While you should try to put your child first, you should also recognize that these kinds of life changes may require changes to your agreement."
"
Coordinate often.,
Find ways to communicate agreeably.,
Pick your battles, and keep them private.,
Be flexible.",How to Make Shared Custody Work3," As difficult and painful as it may be, especially early on, talk to your ex often about what is going on with your child.Any major events or life changes should be discussed regularly, but so too should more day-to-day happenings. This might include:


Problems (or major successes) in school
Disciplinary problems
Weekend plans
Any issues that you, as parents need to make a decision about , However you may feel about your ex, the regular conversations you need to have with him or her will be easier if you can find ways to communicate in a civil and adult way.If there's a problem in the child's life that you think the other parent is responsible for, try to avoid accusations. Instead, discuss the problem.
For example, you might say: ""I notice the kids always challenge me about bedtimes after returning to your house. Any ideas about how we can handle this?"" Even if you think the other parent may be failing to enforce the agreed upon bedtime, don't make this accusation.
If disagreements become common and you believe the other parent isn't living up to his or her end of the agreement, keep records of the content of your conversations, in case they are needed in court.

, Inevitably, conflicts will arise about parenting. If you and your ex we perfectly harmonious, you probably wouldn't have broken up. Choose what you think is really worth having contentious discussion about, and try to let things go that aren't that important.For example, if the other parent wants to change you children's school, or is feeding them food that they are allergic to, these might be issues worth having a fight over.
On the the other hand, if your ex lets your teen-aged children listen to music you don't approve of, think about whether you think that's really harming them before starting a fight. It may be best to save your energy and preserve goodwill rather than fighting about minor issues.
When you do have to have heated or contentious discussions about parenting, don't ever do it in front of your children. This can cause them unnecessary stress and emotional harm., While consistency is important, so too is some degree of flexibility.Be aware that life circumstances may require some changes to the custody plan to be made ""on the fly."" Things happen that are not anticipated and therefore not in the agreement.


Be fair and realistic about your own life and commitments, as well as your ex's. If you can have reasonable conversations about how to handle unforeseen changes, your shared custody arrangement is much more likely to survive and succeed.
For example, you or your ex may suddenly need to go out of town to deal with a personal or work related issue during a time you were supposed to care for your children. Try to be flexible and reasonably accommodating to such circumstances.

"
"
Get your own emotions in check.,
Plan to do it together, if possible.,
Select an age-appropriate explanation.,
Provide need-to-know information only.,
Avoid using phrases that include the words ""fault"" or ""blame."",
Have a follow-up with each individual child.",How to Tell Your Kids You're Getting a Divorce1," Your children will likely be angry and upset once you tell them about the divorce, so try not to react similarly. Wait to break the news when you can discuss the subject effectively and still be in control of your emotions. Remember, the point of the discussion is to be there for the kids—they shouldn’t have to comfort you., It is best to tell the children when both parents are present, so you can present a united front. You and your spouse should decide how much you will share and who will do most of the talking. Agree about everything in advance.If your marriage is ending due to abuse or your spouse simply will not cooperate, just plan to tell the children on your own.
Your words can show a united front, too. Try to use “we” as much as possible instead of he, she, or I.

, The age of your kids should help guide you in what you share about the divorce. You may also want to consider the maturity and development of each of your children.For example, to a preschooler, you might say, “Sweetie, we will be moving into separate houses. You will stay here with Mommy, but you’ll still see Daddy on weekends.”
Slightly older children to adolescents care more about how the divorce will impact their lives. Therefore, you might want to say something like, “Mom and Dad are separating. We won’t live together anymore, but you will still be able to go to your same school. You will spend half your time with Mom and half with Dad.”
Meanwhile, teenagers may have a much better understanding of relationships and may play a role in some of the decision-making. You might say, “We are getting a divorce. We both will continue to live in the same town, so you have a choice of who you’d like to stay with.”

, Tell them as much as you know about how their lives will change, such as where they will live, where they will go to school, and where the dog will be. Do this without going into the messy details of why the divorce is happening. Skip any information that places blame on either parent.If you’d like to offer a brief explanation of why you are divorcing to older kids, you might say, “Mom and Dad aren’t happy together anymore.”
If they have questions, answer them as fully and candidly as possible without straying from your plan.

, Tell them that it was a mutual decision made by the adults. If you've been arguing a lot, acknowledge that and explain that the two of you are trying to determine what is best for the family. Resist the urge to point fingers or pull the kids into the middle of adult affairs.For instance, say, “Mom and Dad have grown apart. We are fighting a lot. It will be best if we live apart.”

, It’s best to break the news as a group with all your children present. After you break the news with everyone, follow up with each child on their own.


However, if you believe an older child’s reaction may upset any younger children, you might choose to break the news separately and tailor each response to the specific child."

Make up a list of shared rules on how to run the family home.",How to Implement a Bird's Nest Custody Arrangement," A bird's nest arrangement will only work if you're remaining close, or you're able to be in town when it's your turn for custody of the kids.;
, A bird's nest arrangement is about ensuring that the kids are the least disrupted, while the adults, who are theoretically more able to cope with the disruption, bear the brunt of the changes.


Consider the value of the bird's nest arrangement with respect to the custody arrangement. If you have custody of the kids most of the time and your spouse only gets an occasional weekend or week here and there, the bird's nest arrangement isn't worthwhile. If, however, you both have joint or fairly equal custody, the bird's nest arrangement makes good sense.
The bird's nest arrangement should be accounted for as part of the custody agreement.

, You'll need to be able to afford a separate residence away from the family home, and so will your spouse. This means that three residences are being maintained. While the external residences don't need to be anything large, they will need to be somewhere you can keep your belongings and personal needs that sustain you when you're away from the family home. An one-bedroom apartment, studio or even a shared condo or house might work fine.

, The bird's nest arrangement will work only where the two of you are still amicable and able to confer easily about continuing household arrangements and the kids' needs.


Both of you will need to be prepared to maintain consistency of purpose, discipline, and child-raising techniques to make it work well; this means being able to discuss things clearly rather than taking each discussion as an opportunity to argue.

, Be frank and honest, while at the same time reassuring them that they'll keep the routine, continuity, and permanency that they're used to, while they'll also continue to have a new type of continuity with the parenting.

, This includes parenting rules and also the usual routine of home maintenance, etc.


Work out payments of rates, electricity, and other utilities, etc. Develop a house account, and have limits on spending.

You’ll want to be able to emotionally support your kids, depending on their reaction. Doing so will be a challenge if you’re still a wreck yourself.Ask for some time and/or space before having the talk. You might say, “Is it okay if you give me a week before we tell the kids? I need to wrap my head around this first.”
In the meantime, lean on friends and family. Be gentle with yourself as you come to terms with the separation.;
, Both parents should present as a united front. Therefore, you need to be clear about what you’re telling the kids. Have a discussion beforehand about the details. Once the two of you have agreed on what you’ll say, stick to the script.

For instance, you might say, ""Your father and I are going to separate."" Your spouse can follow up by saying, ""We aren't getting along anymore."" Then, echo one another by both letting the child know, ""We love you.""

, It will be confusing if you break the news to the children on your own. They need to see you and your spouse working together as a reminder that you are both still their parents. That much, at least, hasn’t changed. Coordinate with your spouse on a time and place to schedule the talk.Pick a time when you’re both free and relatively relaxed. Clear the remainder of your day or evening, so you can offer reassurance or support to the children as needed.
Also, if the separation isn’t happening for some time, you might choose to delay the discussion until closer to the planned date. Otherwise, the children might become confused and think it’s no longer happening.If one of the parents is unable or unwilling to participate in this conversation, try to remain as objective as possible. Do not badmouth the other parent. Just stick to the facts.

, Talking about separation is not a fun subject, but get to the point rather than trying to dress up the discussion. You might say something like “Mom and Dad aren’t getting along very well anymore. We’ll be taking some time apart and living separately.”Offer a soft and empathetic tone as you deliver the news. Don’t be defensive or accusatory about your spouse, either.

, Even if there has been obvious tension in your marriage, your kids don’t need to know all the ugly details. Simply say what you need to say and keep the focus on them, not on you.For instance, it would be entirely inappropriate to mention cheating, abuse, or financial troubles. It will only complicate matters if you introduce your children to adult problems.
Instead of going into complex details, keep it short and simple. Say, ""Mom and Dad will both feel happier by living apart.""

, Kids may react to the news of divorce in many different ways. Your role should be to reassure them that, although things are changing in your marriage and household, your parenting role stays the same. Both parents should convey that you love your children and will be there for them as best you can.For instance, remind them “This is happening because we can’t get along. You did nothing wrong. We love you and we always will. We won’t be living together, but we will both be taking care of you.”

, Most children will immediately wonder about how a separation impacts their lives, so address this as soon as possible. Give them some basic information about how their lives will change due to this new reality.For example, you might say, “Dad will continue to stay here with you guys, and Mom will be leaving. I’ll be getting an apartment nearby and you will spend weekends with me.”

, Your child may suggest reasons they think you are splitting. To enhance their trust, don’t lie. Don’t go into details either. Agree that the suggested behavior is a part of the problem, but that there are other issues as well. Make sure you keep any explanations appropriate for your child’s age.For instance, younger children of preschool age may think, because one parent is leaving, that they are leaving them, not the other parent. Correct these misconceptions and reassure them it’s not their fault.
Older children may have fantasies of getting their parents back together. You might validate their intentions, but let them know that these decisions are out of their control.
Your child may have ideas of who they want to live with, but you should explain that there are other factors in this decision. Try to stick to the custody plan that both parents have developed together.

, Invite a discussion (both during and after the initial talk) about what your children are thinking and feeling in response to the news. Keep in mind that this will not be one single conversation, but rather an ongoing discussion.You might say to one child, “You’ve been very quiet over the past few days. I can imagine that this is all very confusing. I want you to know that you can talk about what you’re feeling. I’m here to listen.”

, Although you might approach the initial conversation as a unified front, it’s easy to drop your guard and start pulling the children into conflict. Avoid this by setting clear boundaries with your spouse. Agree to not discuss one another with the children, or question what’s happening in the other’s household.Keep contact to a minimal when dropping off and picking up. Resist the urge to send messages through the kids. Communicate through written messages like an email or a text message.

, The reality of a separation can be a lot to handle as a child. Try your best to maintain some semblance of normalcy by keeping to the kid’s usual routines as much as possible. Try to follow the same homework and bedtime schedule across households. And, set the same (or similar) limits and guidelines., Coping with a separation can be hard for all involved. It may be wise to seek the support and guidance of a marriage and family therapist during this time. Such a professional can offer emotional support to the parents and the children. They can also offer direction about how to navigate your new reality.Don't be afraid to ask your therapist any questions you may have. They can also give you feedback on your plans for custody, visitation, and life after separation.

Consider the lifestyle of your other parent.,
Talk it out with someone you trust.,
Ask your parent if they have time to talk about something important.,

Tell them the reasons you would like to live with your other parent.,
Give them time to think about what you have said.,
Keep calm.,
Bring it up again later.",How to Tell Your Parent You Want to Live With Your Other Parent," As a child of divorced parents, you probably already know the tug-of-war that goes on for custody, and it may be painful for you to watch and deal with. Try to remember, though, that, in most cases, your parents are trying to do what is best for you, and if you tell them you don’t want to live with them anymore, they may feel like they have failed you, or that you don’t love them.


On the other hand, you don’t need to think that you are supposed to live with a parent if you are unhappy just because you don’t want to hurt them. In the end, it’s not up to you to keep your parent’s happy. Just try to keep in mind that it may hurt them to hear that you want to move out, so it's important to try and be gentle.;
, Sure, your other parent may let you do whatever you want, so it will be way more fun, but is that the only reason? Take some time to think about all the reasons you want to move out, and if they are good ones or not. It is very easy for the parent you don’t live with full time to look like the “fun parent,” However, remember that they don’t bear the brunt of responsibility for you, so it’s easy to give you whatever you want one or two days a week.Remember that the parent you live with is responsible for making sure you are happy and healthy most of the time. This means that they have to make lots of tough decisions about what is best for you.
Will you have to change schools? Changing schools may be the biggest reason you want to move with your other parent, but if you are very happy at your current school, and living with the other parent requires changing schools, then you may have to go somewhere you don’t like.

, Has the parent you live with done something that made you angry? If so, it can be very tempting to tell them you want to live with your other parent in the heat of the moment. It’s important to remember that you should not use your other parent as a weapon to hurt the other when they make you angry.If you really do want to live with the other parent, then you should have a conversation with the parent you live with when you are calm, and have thought out the reasons why you want to do so.

, There may be many reasons why you want to live with your other parent. Many of those reasons may have nothing to do with the parent you live with, but some might. Before you have the conversation, take time to make a list of the reasons you want to live with your other parent.


You don’t need to give this list to the parent you live with, and it may be hurtful for them to simply read a list of all the reasons you don’t want to live with them without hearing you explain these reasons. Instead, make the list so that it is clear for you why you want to leave, and so that you can talk about these reasons clearly with your parent.
For example, maybe you want to live with the other parent because they live much closer to your school, or maybe it’s a different reason altogether. Maybe the parent you live with is dating a lot of different people, and you don’t like being around all their boyfriends/girlfriends.

, Do you want to live with your other parent and never see the one you live with now? Do you want to see them on the weekends? Do you want to continue living with the same parent, but spend more time with the other parent? There are lots of ways that custody can be split between parents. Before you tell them you want to live the other parent, know exactly what kind of custody arrangement you would like.This way, during the conversation, you can show your parent that you’ve really thought about it.
Be ready to talk with your parent about when you want to see them, too.

, It may be the case that your other parent does not want you to live with them, maybe because they have a very busy work schedule, and won’t have time to give you the support you need. Before having a potentially difficult conversation, think about whether or not your other parent will allow you to live with them.


Maybe your other parent has some problems they have to deal with. These problems may mean that they can’t take care of you as a parent should. Maybe they travel all week, and are never at home.

, Find someone you trust, and tell them how you’re feeling. This may be the parent you wish to live with, or it may be a grandparent, or someone at school, such as a guidance counselor. Talk to them about your wish to live with the other parent, and the reasons why. Talking to someone may help you understand your reasons for wanting to move.The person you talk to could also be able to give you advice on how to start this conversation with your parent.
Be aware though, that if your parent’s don’t get along very well, talking with the parent you wish to live with may not be the best idea if you are looking for an unbiased ear.

, Don’t just say you want to live with your other parent out of nowhere, this will make them feel angry and/or very sad. If they are shocked by what you say, they probably aren’t going to be able to really listen because they will be dealing with the emotions they are feeling.Tell them you need some time to talk about something that is important to you. They may be able to talk right away, but if they’re busy with something it may have to wait.
They may get mad, even if you try to ease into the conversation without shocking them.
Don’t ask them to have this talk when you’ve just had a fight, or if you can tell that they are in a bad mood.

, Depending on the reasons you want to move out, you may be afraid that you will hurt your parents. While it might be hard to hear that you want to leave, reassuring them that you love them very much, and that you don’t want to move out to hurt them will help them understand that you want to stay close with them.


For example, you can say, “Before I tell you what’s going on, I want you to know that I love you very much. It might be hard to hear what I am about to say, but please don’t think I don’t care.”

, Start by saying, “I would like to live with Dad” (or Mom, if that’s the situation). The reasons that I would like to live with them are….” Try to explain each reason calmly and clearly.


If the reasons you don’t want to live with the current parent anymore are because of how they treat you or because they have problems that are affecting you, then bringing up these reasons may make your parent mad or embarrassed. Try to remember that it’s important to be honest.

, It’s hard to predict how your parent will react. They may get angry, they may cry, or they may not seem upset. Either way, give them a chance to think about what you have said. If they want to talk, then listen to what they are saying.

They may ask for some time to think things through. Give them that time.
They may say “no” outright. In this case, there may not be much you can do. You can try talking about the matter with your other parent to see what they think. It may be possible for them to convince the parent you live with to reconsider.

, If your parent reacts in a way that you don’t like, do your best to stay calm. Don’t start yelling at them. Instead, try to keep talking in a mature way. If they have simply said, “no,” ask them if they can explain why it’s not a good idea. If they have given you many reasons, then try to think through those reasons to see if they make sense.If your parent is the type who believes that you should do as they say without ever asking why, they may say that they don’t need to explain the reasons for their decision to you. If this happens, you may be wasting your time, but try to remember that the best thing you can do is to try to keep talking to them so that they see they can’t just blow you off.

, If your parent has said “no”, tell them again in a month or two. This way, they will see that you really do want to live with the other parent, and that you weren’t just trying to cause problems.


If you do have to try again, try to approach the conversation in the same way. If you always bring up the conversation as maturely as you can, it will show them that you are growing up, and that you can make some decisions on your own.

"
"
Tell them you love them.,
Reassure them that they had nothing to do with the decision.,
Encourage them to express their feelings.,
Validate their feelings.,
Don’t turn your child into a confidant or pull them into the middle.,
Don’t use the kids as informants or spies against the other parent.",How to Tell Your Kids You're Getting a Divorce2," Perhaps the most important message you want to get across when discussing your divorce is that you still love and care for your children, even if you are the one who is leaving or moving away. Keep repeating that you love them and nothing that happens between Mom and Dad will change that., Children may unintentionally try to shoulder the blame of their parent’s divorce, even if they don’t come out and say it. Let them know that the reason for the divorce has nothing to do with them. Reinforce the fact that they are not the problem and that the decision is made because Mom and Dad aren’t getting along., Even though the decision to get a divorce is up to the parents, you should be willing to listen as your kids share their frustrations. They may cry, shout, or run away to their rooms. Anticipate a variety of reactions.Encourage them to express how they feel by gently saying things like, ""It's okay to cry, but we want you to talk to us about how you are feeling inside - what you are thinking about.""

, When your child shares their feelings, try your best to listen to what they are saying and acknowledge their feelings. Supporting them in this way reinforces the parent-child bond and lets them know that, although things are changing, you are still there for them.You might say things like, “I know you’re upset, sweetheart. I’m here for you.”

, Involving the child in an adult disagreement only adds confusion and distress, which may end up backfiring on you later. Both parents should agree to keep the kids out of the nasty aspects of the divorce, such as arguing or name-calling.No matter how upset you may be about the divorce, you are there as a source of comfort for your child—not the other way around. Don’t confide in them or try to “win” them over by assassinating your ex’s character.

, If you are caught in the middle of a vicious custody battle, parents may search for ammunition against the other. It puts children in a difficult position to be told to lie for, spy on, or tell one parent what the other is doing. Leave your children out of it."

Expect to revisit the discussion in the coming days and weeks.,
Don't promise things you can't deliver.,
Alert their teachers and school administrators.,
Take them to see a counselor.,
Continue to have loving interactions with your kids.",How to Tell Your Kids You're Getting a Divorce3," Once the news is out, you may need to continue the conversation with your children as new decisions are made or as they slowly process the changes. Let them know that your door is open and that you will try your best to listen and answer any questions they may have., If you don't know the facts yet on your future living situation, tell them only what you know for sure. Then, say that you are still working out some of the details. Let them know that you will tell them as soon as you know.Never make assurances that you can’t stand behind, such as that they won’t have to change schools or that they will still see their friends every day.

, Tell your children's teachers, counselors, babysitters and other caregivers, the parents of their close friends, and any other adults they see regularly about your divorce plans. Your heads up will help them to understand that any significant changes in your child's behavior may be linked to your divorce.Ask these adults to keep you informed of any changes in your child’s behavior or mood.

, If your child is having trouble opening up about their feelings or struggling to deal with the changes, offer to enlist the help of a counselor. This may be the counselor at their school or a mental health professional in your community.A counselor can be a great source of comfort and advice for children who have trouble discussing their feelings with their parents—who very well may be the cause of these feelings.

, Your children are more likely to bounce back well after your split if you maintain a strong, nurturing bond with them. Despite the many adjustments you may be dealing with yourself, try to spend quality time with each child.Try to maintain certain traditions or create new traditions that help all of you spend time together, such as a Sunday evening movie night or Saturday morning pancakes.
Even if your child acts like they don’t want to spend time with you, make an attempt anyway. They may just be testing you to see how much you care.

Let her know that you are there for her.,

Practice active listening.,
Leave out the ""I told you so's"".,
Suggest other sources of support without feeling any sense of depletion of your own worth.,
Find out the names and details of local support groups for people experiencing divorce or single parenthood.,
Feed her well.,
Be a voice of positivity.",How to Help Your Daughter Survive Divorce," Make it clear that no matter what the time of day or night, she has a place to come to if she needs respite, or an ear to talk to if she is in need. When you live far away from her, the phone connection is even more crucial.;
, Think about the sorts of things that might help her through this hard time. Does she need personal space and time to sort through her feelings/papers/household effects, etc. but the kids are underfoot and upset by all the changes? Can you offer to take the kids in for a bit, or at least care for them during periods of time to give your daughter the needed break? Maybe she needs a place to stay, and you can offer that respite. Does she need a loan of money/car/items to get back on her feet or to get out of a difficult situation? Can you offer such a loan? All these practical helps make an enormous difference.

, She will be upset, angry, sad, depressed, irritable, relieved, forgiving, and many other emotions at varied times. Be available for her with a compassionate ear and a supportive love that she can rely upon at all times. Even if you're not in a position to physically help her out, you can be there for her emotionally.

, Nobody needs a relationship choice thrown back in their face; we love whom we love when do for reasons that are much broader than common sense will ever justify. We make mistakes to learn from them. Your daughter will be experiencing a range of self-talk that will be, for the most part, very negative, such as feeling victimized, angry with herself and at her husband, deeply saddened at the loss, grieving, terrified, feeling stupid and unlovable, etc. None of these are good feelings but with loving support, they will remain temporary. The last thing she ever needs is confirmation of poor choices with the ""I told you so's"".

, Being her parent, you are a very important person in her life (or two persons!). All the same, she will need sounding boards beyond you to help her form fully rounded conclusions as to her future movements and needs. If you believe that a counselor or psychologist might be a suitable outlet for her, suggest it. Offer to make arrangements and even pay for it (if you can), just to help her get started. Consider other helpful services too, such as financial consultants, lawyers (for the divorce proceedings/property division), career consultant (if she plans on returning to the workforce), priest or other faith healer, real estate agents, etc. Offer to help with any arrangements and interaction where possible, especially if she seems to lack confidence or is becoming increasingly disorganized as a result of the stress.

, Don't force the issue but do recommend any you believe might help, and simply give her the contact details. Allow her the space to make up her own mind, in her own time. And don't use this as an alternative to your help; rather, such groups become a supporting act to your support.

, She may be neglecting eating and drinking properly. Check on her eating and help out by making meals, or arranging them to be delivered during the first weeks of her divorce. This is also especially important where children are involved, even more so if she is depressed and finds it hard, if not impossible, to take care of them in her usual way.

, Although she is going through a terrible time, keep telling her that things will be better and that she has many wonderful opportunities ahead of her. Remind her of her beautiful children, her own incredible skills, her friendliness, her loving heart, etc. Simply because this relationship hasn't worked out does not mean that her future relationships will end the same; remind her that she has learned lessons that will guide her well in the future. Be gentle, always.

Be patient.A very stubborn refusal that includes rebelliousness and anger won't be resolved overnight.",How to Help Your Child Accept a Second Marriage," Your spouse doesn’t have to be parental right off the bat. Try having your spouse relate to the child as more of a camp counselor than a parent.Focus on creating a bond first before moving into a disciplinarian role. Ask your spouse to develop a relationship together, just the two of them, that doesn’t involve you.


You can discuss with your spouse to remain responsible for your child’s control and discipline until your spouse and child develop a solid bond.Your spouse may monitor your child’s behavior and report back to you instead of intervening.;
, Discuss what roles who will play. Will your spouse co-parent your child, or will parenting remain your responsibility? Discuss your desires, the desires of your spouse, and what you believe will be best for your child. Inevitably there will be difficulties in adjusting to a new family structure.Be clear in your spouse’s role with your child. Is your spouse allowed to mediate fights? Can your spouse punish your child? What consequences and rules can your spouse enforce?
You may need to think in terms of a timeline. Perhaps you may parent one way now, then slowly transition to different roles over time once the family feels more cohesive.

, Know that it will take time for your children to adjust to new living arrangements. This is especially true if you are combining your children with your partner’s children.Don’t try to set up different rules right away; instead, keep many similar family rules and ask your partner to follow them as well. Slowly, start to adjust things as they suit your family.

, Positive spousal relations and low conflict in the marriage helps children adjust better.While fighting is a normal and often healthy part of a marriage, avoid involving your child in the fight or fighting in front of the child. Reassure your child that fighting sometimes happens, but that it doesn’t change things or mean that you will get divorced or that the child is causing the fights.


Try to find time to disagree when your child is not home.

, A remarriage is harder for an adolescent child than it is for a younger child.As adolescents are trying to reach independence, they make attempts to separate from the family and forge their own paths.When you ask an adolescent to join a blended family, you are asking your child to tie more closely to a family that he or she may not want to connect. A teenager may act disinterested or distant. Younger children may display behavioral changes such as acting out or throwing tantrums as a way to express their stress,


Younger children may be more apt to connect and develop a relationship with your new spouse. It really depends on your child, though.

, Your child may hold on to the fantasy that you and your ex-spouse may get back together, or that there will always be space for a deceased spouse in the home. Once someone new comes in, it threatens that fantasy.A remarriage can be a trauma and responded to as a loss.


Be sensitive to your child’s feelings and bring this up in discussion. Ask how he or she feels about the remarriage, and if it’s sad for your child to see you and your ex or deceased spouse apart. Have a genuine and heartfelt discussion, letting your child voice all of his or her concerns.

, Divorce and remarriage can be really confusing to a child. Your child may feel like he or she has to choose between you and your ex-spouse. Your child may feel like enjoying your new spouse may be a betrayal to the other parent, and may struggle to find ways to accept your new marriage while still feeling loyal to the other parent.Give your child permission to love the new people in your ex’s home, and allow for time for your child to warm up to your new spouse.Don’t bad talk your previous spouse or his or her partner, especially in front of your child. That can be very confusing for a child.

, Sit down with your child and have a talk about feelings. You can share your feelings, but you want to focus mostly on allowing your child to express his or her own feelings in a safe space. When talking with your child, say:It’s okay to feel confused about the new people in your life.
It’s okay to feel sad about my divorce (or death of a parent).
You don’t have to love my new spouse, but you do need to be respectful, the way you would be with a teacher or coach.
If you ever feel caught in the middle of my home and your other parent’s home, please tell me. We’ll do our best to stop.
It’s okay to talk to someone about how hard things are, like a counselor or coach.

, Your child may be afraid that perhaps she'll have to move or have to share her room with a stepsibling. Your child may be worried about what will happen to her daily play routine, vacation plans and general activities. Be Honest and explain how change is always hard for everyone but that there will be some very good changes that come out of the new family situation. Tell your child what positive changes may occur, like going on more family vacations or getting a bigger room.


Point out how there will be easier ways to do things with more people on board to help out.

, Even if your child gets along well with your new spouse, remarriage often revives the pain of divorce or death. Also, through loyalty or fear of betraying your child’s father or mother, your child might want to refuse to participate or help in your new marriage. It is important to reassure your child that you understand and respect his or her decision, and that you love your child at all times.


When your child appears fearful or anxious, remind your child that no matter what changes happen and how stressful it feels, you will always love him or her.The love you have for your child won’t change, no matter what.
Allow for choices when your child has a strong opinion, but also have a discussion about why your child feels this way.
Whatever happens, your marriage will occur because it's a matter for the grown-ups to make decisions about their own lives.

, Gently help your child to understand that whilst he can manage his toys, homework and choice of clothes, he cannot influence his parent's love life, whether it be divorce or remarriage. In discussing this, never use negative words about him; a child all too easily assumes responsibility for the single parent and can feel a sense of personal blame. Ensure that he does not have any such negative feelings.


Tell your child that the joy of one person does not equate with the sadness of another: there is room for all the family to feel joy at the coming marriage.
Reassure him that when it comes to affairs of the heart, feelings and love, much cannot be explained and that things just ""are"".

, Talk to your ex-spouse to get support for helping your child through this transition. Show openly to your child that you and your ex-spouse still have your child's concerns at heart first and foremost in your discussions; this isn't the time for dragging through old hurts but it is a time for putting your child's concerns first.

Try to see things from your child’s point of view.,
Appreciate how adolescents and teens may view your divorce.,
Be a good listener.,
Recognise how much your kids learn from you.,
Set an example for your child.",How to Stop Your Kids from Using Your Divorce to Their Advantage1," If you are getting divorced, you will be going through a difficult and emotional period. It is important, however, that you pay attention to how your children are experiencing the divorce. Your kids will have their own perspective on what is happening and it’s helpful if you can try to see things from their perspective.


Children, especially young children, will have a hard time understanding the situation and the complicated reasons behind your divorce.
Children will try to figure out an explanation, and this often lead to them blaming themselves.
Try to understand how strange the situation is for your kids and always shield them from any animosity you feel towards your ex.;
, For older children, the experience of parents getting divorced can be quite different. Teens and adolescents will have a better understanding of the emotional complexities of the situation, and they might situate this major change within the context of their own changes as they grow up.


Teens are more likely to hold their parents accountable for the divorce than younger children.
They might require more a thorough explanation of what has gone wrong, and they may seek to apportion blame to one party over the other.
You should understand that anger is a natural reaction to someone’s parent’s getting divorced, but the cause of this anger is pain about the perceived breaking up of the family.
Teens may also interpret your divorce as an indicator that they will struggle to build lasting relationships in their lives., To help you get a clearer view of how your children are experiencing the divorce, it’s important that you encourage them to explain their feelings to you.If your kid is struggling to explain his feelings, help him by asking questions and legitimizing his emotions. You might say something like “I know you’re sad. Can you tell me what’s making you feel sad?”


Let him know his feelings are valid by saying “I know it’s lonely without Dad here”.
Pay attention to what he says and ask him what will help him to feel better.
This can be a very difficult experience, but the more you can talk about it, the better you will understand each other., To try avoid any behaviour or reactions from your kids in which they seek to take advantage of your divorce, or play one parent off against the other, it’s crucial that you recognise how much of an impact your behaviour has on their responses. Children learn by watching and interacting with their parents and others around them, and young children in particular will find it hard to separate themselves from their parents.If you start to blame your ex for the divorce, or criticise him in front of your kids, they might start doing this too.
Don’t fight or argue with your ex in front of your children. This can be very distressing for them, and will foster a negative atmosphere.Talking with a divorce counsellor or mediator is one way to air your grievances without involving the kids., It can help to think of your actions as setting a positive example for your children. If you show patience and flexibility, as well as being polite and friendly, your kids will see you and your ex respecting each other. Having clear examples of good behaviour can influence how your kids respond to the situation. You’re the adults so it’s up to you to create a positive and cooperative atmosphere.


If you can make it clear that you and your ex are not competing over the kids, you will help create a more cooperative and less conflictual environment.
If your child sees you and your ex challenging each other and competing for his affection, he is more likely to adopt these behaviours and take advantage of the situation.

Pick the right time to talk to your children.,
Pick the right place to tell your children.,
Choose your words wisely.,
Consider including your partner in the discussion.,
Be honest.,
Keep your children’s age in mind.,
Do not overwhelm your children with all of the other issues of divorce.",How to Make Divorce Less Traumatic for Your Kids1," Do not simply announce your divorce to your children at any time; this can scar your child and make trusting you a challenge. Instead, take the time to sit down with your children at a time when you do not have any other commitments, so that you can take as much time as needed to explain the situation.


Do not rush through the conversation; make sure to ask your children how they are feeling and what they are thinking about everything you have told them. Be prepared for intense emotions; your children may feel sad, overwhelmed, confused, or even angry. If you rush through your conversation, you are likely to heighten these emotions.;
, Do not tell your children about your decision in a public setting where they will have to deal with their emotions in front of other people. Instead, make sure to sit your children down in a quiet, private place where you can answer their questions.


Make sure to pick a spot that does not have many distractions in it, such as a TV playing in the background, or a spot where music is blasting. Choose a place where your children feel comfortable, such as the family room or living room in your house.

, Try to use a gentle and calm tone when telling your children about your decision. If you are having trouble, ask the advice of friends or family members who have had to have similar conversations.


Consider rehearsing what you are going to say before you actually broach the subject with your children.

, Depending on your situation, it may be a good idea to include your partner in the conversation with your children so that they can see that you are both united in the belief that you should get divorced.


Show them that you have both come to the same decision, and that you will still work together to make sure that their lives are happy and filled with love.

, Rather than trying to downplay the situation, or make it more dramatic than it is, simply tell your children the truth; after all, your children will most likely be able to pick up on any false notes in your voice. Do not mislead your children; instead speak from the heart.


You could say something like “Your daddy and mommy are not happy in our relationship anymore. We are not getting along well and we think that everyone will be happier if we live in different houses.”

, The way that you discuss this decision with your child will also depend on how old your children are. Younger children are more likely to react to the news with feels of shock or sadness, while older children are more likely to express their feelings, which may include anger.


Older children will most likely ask more questions and will need more information from you. Older children may ask you questions about where everyone will live, or how the family’s finances will be affected.

, Unless your children ask, you do not need to go into the details of your divorce during the first conversation that you have with them. Topics like moving, changing schools, or having a potentially new person living in the house with them can be saved for a conversation after they have had time to process the news about the divorce.


Remember that this discussion will not be limited to one conversation; it is important to have multiple conversations about your decision, as well as how it will affect your family.

Maintain communication with your ex.,
Don’t use your child as a go between.,
Show some flexibility.,
Have a consistent approach.,
Allow your children time to adjust.",How to Stop Your Kids from Using Your Divorce to Their Advantage2," It’s very important that you can maintain a civil and cordial relationship with your ex. If you never speak, it will be easier for your child to take advantage of the situation and play you off against each other. It can be difficult, especially immediately after an acrimonious divorce, but you have to put your children first. It may be easiest to keep things professional, with open lines of communication, but clear limits on your interactions.


Just being polite to each other can make a difference and will affect how your child experiences the divorce.
Try to take the emotion out of your encounters and keep it business-like.
If you find talking face-to-face or over the phone difficult, email and text messages can be good ways to keep the lines of communication open.
If you are respectful, you will encourage your ex to treat you in the same way.
Try to think more in terms of making requests than making demands., It’s important that you don’t end up using your child as go between, messenger, or even a peacemaker, between you and your ex. If there is a disagreement between you, or communication breaks downs, remember it is your responsibility to sort it out. You should keep your issues away from your kids, or else you will be putting your children into the centre of their parent’s conflict.Using your child as a go between, puts him in a difficult and pressurised situation.
It also enables him to more easily play you off against one another.

Maybe you have an arrangement in place that falls through with very little notice, or your ex is late to pick up your child and you miss an appointment.Keep your calm, and don’t criticise your ex in front of your child. This will encourage them to think that it’s okay to get between you.Try to understand these things will happen to both of you at different times, so take it on the chin.

Things such as homework, curfews, and chores should be consistent across both houses.
If rules are broken, you need to similar responses from each parent. You can connect the two houses in certain instances.
For example, if your child has TV lost his privileges at his father’s house, you can follow through with this when he returns to your house.
You should try to have consistency in daily schedules, such as mealtimes and bedtimes. Having regular daily patterns can help your child adjust to the upheaval more easily., When you are splitting custody your child will find himself suddenly torn between two homes, so it’s important that you give him time and space to adjust to the new arrangements. There may be times when he wants to spend more time with one parent than the other, but you should try not to take this personally.Keep to the schedule that you and your ex have developed, but consider involving your child in the discussions.
Try to be flexible and adapt to your child’s needs. It might simply be more convenient for them to spend more time in one place due to school, work, friends or sports commitments.

Behavior.
Eating or sleeping habits.
Social interactions.
Talk to people that know your children well and ask them if they have noticed any changes in your child’s behaviors or lifestyle. These people could include your child’s coaches, relatives, or neighbors.

, Show your children that you are there for them during this difficult time by suggesting doing things together. While some children may be resistant because they are upset by the divorce, other children may simply want to spend time with you.


When you do spend time with your children, make sure that they know that they can talk to you about anything, including the divorce and how it makes them feel.

, Some children may wrongfully think of the divorce as their fault. Make sure to remind your children that this is not the case; talk about how the conflict only lies with you and your spouse.Give your children lots of assurances that you love them in order to promote their feelings of self-worth and to keep them from blaming themselves.

, Your spouse may have hurt you and you may be very angry with him or her, but it is important to not voice these thoughts in front of your children, as it could be very upsetting to hear their other parent talked about in that way. Remember that your children love you both, even if you do not love your spouse anymore.


Badmouthing your spouse can also teach your children that it is ok to say mean things about other people, which is not what you want to be teaching them at this critical juncture in their lives.

, You should still allow your children to see your spouse, as he or she is their parent too. Allow your spouse to continue to be a parent to the children in order to make this difficult time a little more challenging. Being told that they cannot see the other parent could make them feel negatively towards you.


If your spouse wants to take them out, and it is a reasonable time to do so (such as after they have finished their homework) do not restrict them. When you send your children off, remember to say something to the effect of “Have fun!” so that they know you are happy to see them spend time with their other parent.

, While the relationship you and your spouse have with your children may be altered a bit because of the divorce, it is important to try to maintain the same parenting style. Let your spouse show his or her care for the children in his or her own special way.


This will remind your children that even though you are getting divorced, they still have their mommy and daddy, just as they have always had you both.

, This is a challenging time for you too, which your children will most likely pick up on. When they give you hugs or kisses, make sure that they know you are grateful for their support.


Say things like, “Thank you for asking me how I am doing, I really appreciate it”.
Remember to express your feelings about the situation truthfully, but in a way that won’t upset your children. If you are feeling sad, just say that you are feeling sad because of all the changes that are happening. However, after expressing yourself, remind your children that no matter what happens, or how you feel, you will always be there for them.

, When you start looking for a new place, or begin the move, let your children help make some of the decisions. Listen to their suggestions about how the new home should be decorated, and allow them to pick out things like their own bedsheets.


Including them in the decision making process may make this new home feel more welcoming to them, even though their other parent is not a part of it.

, Try to avoid rushing into something new, both for yourself and for your children’s well being. When you do decide that you are ready to get into a relationship, make sure that you are open with your children about what you are doing.


Keep in mind that while they might like your new partner, they will always hold their other parent in higher esteem than the new partner.

, If your children are having a lot of trouble with the divorce, or you are having a hard time communicating with them, consider seeking the advice of a psychologist or counsellor. They should be able to give you strategies for how to talk to your children and address any negative feelings they may have.


You should also consider talking to friends, family, and support groups that may be able to give you advice.

It is important to clarify early on that this is not the case and that the decision is one that the adults have reached. You cannot say this enough times––ask your child or children how they are doing often.


Help your children understand that it is for the best.;
, This will help to ensure that they are comfortable talking to you and to your spouse. Explain to them that it is for the better, you and your spouse will get along better and there will be no more fighting between you two (in most cases). It also makes it clear to them that no feeling or question is wrong to have.


Let your child express his/her feelings (by crying, yelling, etc.) before talking to him/her.

, Whether it is every other weekend, or every other week, or whatever else, the children are entitled to know as soon as you do, in order to help them come to terms to with it. It will take a time for the new arrangements to make sense and even start to halfway feel normal.

, It makes things worse when parents fight in front of children––it increases tension, causes fear and produces an atmosphere that is not conducive to caring for the children.

However, you will have to interact with your former spouse sometimes and it is important to communicate respectfully with him or her for the sake of your children.Be direct and assertive with your former spouse, but do not berate, belittle, or accuse him/her of things in front of your children. Just discuss what you need to discuss in an objective way.
For example, if your spouse turns up early to pick up your children, you might be quite upset about this. Instead of reacting with anger, try saying something like, “Thanks for coming to pick up the kids. You’re a bit early though, so it will just be a few more minutes. Do you want to wait in the car while I finish getting their things together?”;
, You may be tempted to vent your feelings about your spouse to your kids, but this can be quite upsetting for children. A good rule of thumb to follow is to keep quiet if you can’t say anything nice.For example, if you are angry with your spouse because he/she was late dropping off your kids, then you might feel like expressing that in front of your kids. However, it is better to keep quiet about your feelings and find another way to express them. Write about your feelings in a journal or go for a walk with your kids to feel better. Some other things to avoid include:Trying to make your kids choose a side. Don’t try to make your kids admit to preferring time with you over the other parent or encourage them to say bad things about the other parent.
Trying to get your kids to reveal information about your spouse. Don’t pry into your ex’s personal life by probing your kids for information.
Using your children to hurt their mom/dad. Don’t encourage your kids to say or do things that might hurt the other parent.
Discussing problems with child support in front of your kids. Don’t bring up late child support payments around your kids.

, Talking about legal proceedings in front of your kids may seem like it is not a big deal, but it can be quite upsetting to kids as well.The legal proceedings make the divorce final and this can be an emotional thing for your kids to consider.


Do not bring your kids to meetings with your lawyer or talk about meetings with your lawyer in front of your kids.
If you get a phone call from your lawyer, try having your kids go outside to play or go into another room before you talk.

, You will need to vent you feelings and get support from time to time as you go through your divorce. However, avoid discussing your feelings with or in front of your kids. Instead, talk with trusted friends or family members.Try meeting up with a friend for coffee once per week while your kids are with the other parent or in school.
You might also consider seeing a counselor to help you work through your feelings. This is a great way to develop some healthy coping mechanisms and take care of yourself so that you can be at your best for your kids.

, Consistency is crucial for the health and well-being of your kids, so try not to alter their routines too much as a result of the divorce.Having a change in their home environment and your relationship with their other parent will be enough of a change, so do your best to keep your kids’ lives the same as they were before the divorce.


If possible, keep your kids in the same school so they do not have to worry about making new friends. This will also allow them to maintain enjoyable activities, such as participating in a sport or other extracurricular activity.

, Don’t try to block your kids’ access to the other parent. It is important for your kids to be able to maintain a relationship with both of you. Be supportive of your kids desire to see the other parent.Encourage your kids to call the other parent to tell them about school or to talk about a problem.

Stay in touch with the parent you see less often.",How to Deal With Your Divorced Parents Fighting," Sometimes parents will try to drag their children into the fight in the midst of an argument. They may not realize it, but this is incredibly unfair and can actually be damaging to the children. If your parents try to involve you in their fight, let them know that you love them both and want to remain neutral.You can say something like, ""I love you both, and this fight is between you two. I don't feel comfortable choosing sides.""
Don't let your parents drag you into their conflicts or force you to get involved.
If your parents want you to relay messages between them, for example, let them know that you're not comfortable doing this and tell them to talk to each other.;
, If you're old enough to leave the house unsupervised, going for a walk when your parents start to fight can be a good way to escape from the stress and frustration that follows. If you're too young to leave the house unsupervised, you can retreat to your bedroom or go out into the yard to be alone for a while until your parents are finished arguing.Going for a walk around the block, walking to the park, or even going into your room are all healthy ways of staying away from your parents when they fight.
If you leave the house, let your parents know where you're going. You may also want to give a short explanation of why you're going for a walk, such as, ""I just can't be here when you two fight.""
Once you're away from the fight, take slow, deep breaths to help you calm down.

, If you have any siblings younger than you, the sound of your parents fighting may be even more traumatic or frightening for them. Any time your parents start to argue or yell, try to get your sibling(s) out of the house. Go for a walk together, or take your siblings to a movie or to a friend's house.


Talk to your siblings about how you feel when your parents fight, and ask them how the fighting affects them.Let your siblings know that you are there for them, and that you will help keep them safe as best you can.

, Some types of fighting that stem from simple disagreements are considered ""healthy"" fighting. These are usually minor in nature and can easily be resolved. Concerning fighting, which usually involves yelling, name calling, or being disrespectful or demeaning to the other person, can potentially lead to physical arguments.If your parents threaten to hurt one another, destroy property (dishes, furniture, etc), or engage in any kind of physical acts of violence, call the police immediately.
If you do not feel safe calling the police, call a trusted adult (ideally a close relative or friend of the family) right away and tell him or her what happened.

, If your parents have been fighting on and off every time they see or talk to each other, it can create a tense or even scary environment at home. This may cause you to feel unsafe or insecure. If this happens, staying at a friend or family member's home for a brief period can help make things easier on you and/or your siblings until things calm down at home.


Wait until your parents are calm and/or in a neutral space outside the house.Let your parents know how their fighting has been affecting you. Do so calmly and without placing any blame.
Ask if you (and your siblings, if you have any) can stay with a close relative or a good friend for a few days until things are more stable at home. If your parents agree, make sure it's okay with that relative or that friend's parents before you go to stay with them.
Encourage your parents to try and work through some of their issues while you're gone. Seeing you need to leave the house might make them realize how bad their fighting has gotten.

, If your parents' fighting is causing you a lot of anxiety and grief, you may want to urge your parents to seek counseling. This should not be your first course of action; rather, you should try urging your parents to see a counselor if they've proven unwilling or unable to stop fighting in front of you. A counselor or therapist can help your parents work through their problems behind closed doors and in a safe, neutral space that won't expose you to their problems.Even though your parents are divorced, they may still be able to come together for therapy sessions if they know how much their fighting is affecting you.
A couples counselor or therapist can help your parents address their problems and work through those issues in a time and place that won't affect you.
If your parents aren't willing to consider seeing a therapist together, you should urge them both to individually see therapists so that they can work through their problems and find healthier ways of communicating.
Let your parents know that they can find information about couples or individual therapy online or in your local phone book.

, Some children may feel like they're not ""allowed"" to show emotion or get upset when their parents are getting divorced or have recently separated. This may come from feeling like it's your job to keep your parents happy. However, you need to remember that it isn't your job to take care of your parents; they should be taking care of you. If you feel like you need to express your emotions, you should do so in a safe, productive way.Crying, feeling sad or angry, or even yelling are all safe ways of expressing how you feel.
Being destructive is never okay. You can express your emotions, but that doesn't mean you can hurt others or destroy their property.
If you're having a hard time coping with your emotions, try seeing a school therapist. You can also let your parents know how you feel and ask if you can talk things through with them.

, Journaling is a great way to work through difficult emotions. Your journal should be a private notebook that no one else will read. Because it's private, you should feel safe writing or drawing out whatever you're thinking and feeling as you work through this difficult situation with your parents., If your parents have gone through a really difficult divorce, you may feel intimidated talking to them about your feelings about the situation. However, if their fighting is affecting you, you have every right to politely voice your concerns to your parents.Be respectful when you bring it up. Try saying something like, ""I know things have been difficult for everyone, but it makes things a lot harder for me when you two fight.""
Ask your parents to avoid fighting in front of you. At the very least, you can ask that they avoid saying negative things about each other to you or in front of you.Remind your parents that you love them both, and that you need to feel loved and supported by both of them as well.

, If things are really difficult at home, you may have a hard time talking to your parents about their fighting. If this is the case, you should feel safe talking to a trusted adult. Many schools have therapists and counselors available for these situations. Even if your school doesn't offer counselors, you should be able to talk to a trusted aunt or uncle, grandparent, or even a teacher about what you're going through.Whichever adult you choose to talk to about your parents' fighting, let that individual know that you care about both parents and just want them to stop fighting.
If either parent or both parents have physically hurt you in any way, let the adult you talk to know about it. However, if your parents have not physically harmed you, let the adult know that you feel safe, just sad about your parents fighting all the time.

, If you aren't comfortable talking to an adult or don't have anyone you can confide in, you might want to try calling a help hotline. There are special hotlines just for kids whose parents create scary or sad living situations with their constant fighting. For example, you can call the National Runaway Safeline any time, 24 hours a day. Their phone number is 1-800-RUNAWAY., Even if your parents divorced a while ago, it can still be difficult to adjust to splitting your time between them. That adjustment can be even more difficult if your parents fight a lot whenever you're around. One parent may even live out of town, which may require you to travel some distance in order to visit. Just remember that the stress and confusion that happens when your regular routine is interrupted is usually a short-term problem. Your parents will find ways of making the transition easier for you, and eventually you'll adjust to your new schedule.There's a chance that your parents may not be able to afford the same things they could afford when they were both living together. However, your parents will still do everything they can to care for and provide for you.
Traveling to see one of your parents can be stressful. However, if you use that car time to talk, it can become quality time spent with either or both parents.
Your daily and weekly routines will likely be a bit shaken up for a while, at least until things settle down. Try to be patient and know that these disturbances are often temporary.

, Even though there's no way your parents' divorce won't affect you, it's important to keep living your own life and doing the things you love. This can help you maintain some normalcy and a sense of identity as your parents' relationship fluctuates. You may not be able to control where you are all the time, but you can make choices regarding how you spend your free time when you're not in school or doing homework.If you're really having a hard time coping with things, try taking up a new hobby. Learning something new and exciting may be just what you need to stay focused on something outside of your parents' problems.
You can even get your parents involved in your hobbies and activities. That way you'll be able to enjoy some quality time with each parent, no matter whom you're visiting with at the time.

, One of the hardest parts of having divorced parents is seeing one parent less often. If your parents are fighting, or if they try to force you to choose sides in their fight, not seeing both parents every day can be even more stressful. If at all possible, try letting the parent you're not with know that you love and miss him or her from time to time.Ask your parents' permission first, as some parents may have rules about using the phone or computer unsupervised. Depending on the terms of your parents' divorce, there may also be restrictions on how and when one parent can communicate with you.
A short phone call, text, or email every once in a while can help ease both of your feelings of sadness and loneliness.
You don't have to say much if you're not sure what to say. A simple, ""Hi, just wanted you to know I'm thinking of you"" would suffice.

Things the children wrote.
Drawings the children made.
A list of favorite things to do.
A list of goals for the future.
Expectations for the future, such as where the children might be living or what the children might be doing when they reopen the capsule.

You might also encourage them by reminding them that things will get better.


Try telling your kids something like, “I can see that you are struggling with these changes, but I want you to know that I love you very much and so does your mother/father. It might not seem like things will get better right now, but they will. I am always here for you if you need to talk.”

, Sometimes despite your best efforts to help your kids, they may not be able to overcome some of the emotional challenges of a divorce without professional help.

Be direct about what is happening.,
Be honest about the reason for the divorce.,
Explain to your kids that the divorce has nothing to do with them.,
Ask your kids what questions they have about how things will change.,
Discuss plans for changes in living arrangements ahead of time.",How to Help Children Through Divorce3," Before you even start to tell your kids that you and your spouse are getting a divorce, it is important to assure your kids that you and your spouse love them very much. This is important because some kids can confuse the lack of love between their parents with a lack of love for them.Say something like, “Your mother/father and I love you very much.”

, It is important to tell your kids what the situation is up front. While it is important to keep the conversation age appropriate, try not to beat around the bush or sugar coat things too much. Just explain to your kids in a simple, direct way that you and the other parent are getting a divorce.Try saying something like, “We have tried to work things out, but we have decided that the best solution is to get a divorce.”

, The reason for your divorce might be complicated, but it is important to give your kids some sense of what it is. Otherwise, they will wonder and they may start to blame themselves. To avoid this, provide a summary of the reason for the divorce.For example, you might say something like, “We have not been getting along well, and we both want to be happy. Getting a divorce is the best way for us to improve our situation.”

, Even after providing a reason for the divorce that has nothing to do with your kids, they may still consider whether they played a role in it happening. To head off these worries, make sure that you you’re your children directly that they had nothing to do with the divorce.For example, you might say something like, “Our decision to get a divorce has nothing to do with you kids. It is just between your mom/dad and I.”

Express your feelings however you need to.,
Avoid unhealthy coping.,
Confide in someone you trust.,
Talk to kids with divorced parents.,
Express your feelings in a constructive way.,
Don’t blame yourself.",How to Cope with Divorce As a Child1," Coping with your parent’s divorce brings up many feelings. It is perfectly normal to feel hurt, upset, angry, sad, or confused. Plus, these emotions may change from day to day. Everyone goes through a wide range of emotions during this time. Don’t judge yourself or think that something is wrong with you. There is no right or wrong way to feel.


You can cry, shout, holler, go silent, etc., as you see fit. Your feelings are real and you need to express them in your own way. If anyone tells you to ""man up"" or to ""grow up"", realize such advice is wrong, even if meant well. It is perfectly okay for you to cry, scream into a pillow, or punch your bed if it is your way of letting out your emotions and frustrations.;
, Make sure to choose healthy coping strategies. You may be tempted to act out in inappropriate ways, such as stealing, fighting, or using drugs and alcohol. But this will not change the reality--these behaviors will only make things worse for you. Be sure to call a friend, go for a walk, or write in your journal instead of engaging in unhealthy activities., Talking to someone else can be a great way to express how you feel about the divorce. You may go to a best friend, a sibling, another adult family member, a teacher, or a school counselor. Choose someone who is a good listener and is supportive of your needs.You might start the conversation off by saying, “My parents are getting a divorce and I don’t know what to think.”

, What better way to get your feelings out and be heard by someone who understands what you’re going through? If you have a friend or classmate whose parents have gone through a divorce, seek them out. They were new to this thing once, just like you are now. They may have some advice on how to cope with all the new changes.


Say something along the lines of, “Hey, Craig, I know your parents broke up last year. Mine are going through a divorce now. How did you deal with all this?”

, You might write poetry, songs, stories, or entries in your journal as an outlet for your feelings. You can also use other creative activities to deal you’re your emotions, like painting, drawing, dancing, listening to music, playing with your dog or playing sports.Dedicate at least 30 minutes each day to a constructive activity.

, For whatever reason, your parents made this decision, not you. It is not your fault! It was an issue between your parents that caused the divorce, not you or your siblings. The decision is about their own relationship with each other and a belief that they can no longer get along as a couple.Remember, they will always be your parents, no matter if they are married or not.

Ask your parents questions.,
Share your feelings with your parents.,
Tell your parents you want to stay out of the bickering.,
Remember that your parents still love you.,
Focus on the positives.,
Anticipate even more changes in the future.",How to Cope with Divorce As a Child2," The aftermath of a divorce involves many changes. Your family may move to a new home or a new city. You may have to divide your time between households, or even go to a new school. Once you have gotten control of your emotions, try to sit down with your parents and ask them about the details.For example, you might say, “Where will I live?” or “Who will I live with?” to bring up the topic.

, Although the final decision is ultimately up to your parents, feel free to respectfully voice your concerns if you are worried about changing schools, leaving behind your friends, or any other changes. Don’t feel like you are adding to the burden by venting to your parents. They will likely be happy you spoke up.Express your worries by saying, “I’m unhappy about having to change schools. I will miss my team, my teachers, and my friends. Can I come back on weekends to see my friends?”
Don't bottle up your emotions. Doing this can lead to emotional outbursts, and even make you sick. If you don’t feel comfortable talking to your parents, you can still share your feelings by writing them a letter.

, Don’t take sides during your parent's divorce. Your parents may have bitter feelings about one another, but that shouldn’t rub off on you. Even if you happen to hear about one parent’s wrongdoing, try to withhold any judgment. There are a lot of issues between your parents that caused the divorce. It won’t do you any good to throw the blame on one parent.If your parents try to pit you against one another, tell them “I won’t be taking sides.” Keep saying this until they get the message.

, A divorce can bring out a lot of ugly actions and words between your parents. If they are distant or upset, recognize that this is happening between they are trying to deal with their own feelings and cope with the marriage ending. Keep in mind that just because they may not love one another anymore doesn’t mean they don’t love you., It may seem illogical, but sometimes there is a silver lining in a divorce. Some kids may actually feel relieved that the marriage is ending, especially if your parents fought a lot. You might also like the idea of having two homes, establishing new traditions, or being able to have separate time with each of your parents.Looking for the positives in the situation can help you maintain perspective and not get lost in your grief.

, In the weeks and months after the initial breakup, many other changes may happen. Your parents may have to go to court to determine who you will live with. You may also notice financial strain in which your parents don’t have as much extra money for you to go to the movies or for pizza with friends. Another possible change is the introduction of new people in your family, such as a stepmom, stepdad, or even a new baby.


Try to be understanding of these changes. Things may be very tense now, but they probably won’t always be this way.
Resist the urge to automatically dislike your parents’ new partners. You don’t have to view this person as a parent, and they won’t replace your other parent. But, you can be open-minded and try to get to know them."

Try to balance your time with both parents.,
Stay involved in extracurricular activities.,
Make time for hobbies.,
Spend time with good friends.,
See a therapist.",How to Cope with Divorce As a Child3," If you’re an older child, your parents may give you some say in how you divide your time between them, particularly if they each live nearby. Do your best to be fair about the amount of time you spend with each parent.

For instance, if you’re away on vacation with one parent, be sure to call and check in with the other. This helps each of your parents feel loved and maintains your connection with them both.
It’s also a great idea to keep both parents in the loop about what’s happening in your life. One parent may be in the dark about academic or extracurricular achievements. Be sure to call them up and tell them when something happens, good or bad., The stress of your parent’s divorce may have caused you to rethink your extracurriculars, but you shouldn’t. Playing sports, participating in clubs, and being involved at your school is an important part of your identity. Sticking with these activities can help you cope with other changes and give you something constructive to do.

You should also keep participating in any birthday parties or sleepovers you are invited to., Having something fun to do in your free time will keep your mind occupied and fight stress. Pick up an old hobby or explore a new one. A hobby can be anything that is positive and constructive. Try doing puzzles, gardening, riding horses, swimming, or volunteering with shelter animals., Even if you had to move, it’s important for you to stay connected with your peer group. Ask your parents if you can meet up with your friends after school or on weekends. You might even schedule video calls via Skype or Hangouts to see your old friends more often., Coping with your feelings after a divorce is a major hurdle. You may find yourself still struggling months or years afterwards. If you continue to have trouble getting used to the new arrangements, ask your parents if you can see a counselor.

You might talk to the counselor at your school or ask a peer who has dealt with divorce for a recommendation."

Keep the rules relatively stable.,
Be flexible when developing rules with your ex.,
Apply consistent discipline between households.,
Follow through with discipline between households.,
Be consistent within your household.,
Maintain a positive relationship with your ex.",How to Discipline Your Kids As Divorced Parents1," A divorce can upend children’s lives. If you introduce a bunch of new, extremely restrictive (or extremely lax) rules following a divorce, you’ll only add to their stress, confusion, and unhappiness. Once your divorce is finalized, carry over as many of the rules as possible from the time before you and your spouse divorced.If you do decide to change a rule, then make sure that you evaluate your reasons for the rule change. For example, if you decide to change your child's bedtime, then consider whether you are changing the bedtime because your child is getting older, or if you are changing the bedtime to be the “cool” parent.;
, You and your ex might not agree on all the rules. Even many parents who are not divorced often disagree on the rules for their kids. But think about each rule carefully and recognize the difference between an important rule (like “No playing near the street by yourself”) and a trivial rule (like “No television after 8:00”). Let your ex know that you expect consistency with these more serious rules. Learn to compromise on rules that don’t directly affect your child’s health and well-being., If you allow your kids to do something that your ex doesn’t allow (or vice versa), they will come to resent the parent who restricts their freedom. Being consistent between households is also important to avoid confusion for your kids.Talk to your ex about specific rules for your kids that you believe you should both share between households. Ask your ex if they have any suggestions for rules, too. Listen to their ideas and implement the rules in your own household if you agree.

, Not only should expectations and privileges be the same for your kids no matter where they are, but they should also get rewarded the same way. So if your ex brings your kids back in the evening and says he or she promised them they could stay up a bit late tonight because they helped clean up the house, you should honor that. Likewise, if your ex informs you that your child has been naughty and therefore is not permitted television for the rest of the day, let your child know that their behavior has consequences in your house, too., It’s easy to give in to a child’s complaints. But if you do, your kids will only push you for more and more leeway on the rules. Soon enough, they’ll be in control, and that’s a situation you don’t want to be in. Be firm, clear, and consistent when applying the rules and administering discipline.Whether you want to make them happy or just want them to stop nagging, you’ll probably have moments of weakness and give in to their child. But you should try to limit these occasions as much as possible, and let your kids know that you’re making a special exception. This way, they will understand that they should not expect you to agree to, for instance, staying up late or watching an extra hour of TV every time they ask for it.
Make sure that the things you give in to are acceptable. For example, if you have a “no soda” rule, then allowing your child to have a cola on the weekend might be acceptable. However, allowing your child to skip doing their homework would not be an acceptable thing to give in to your child about.

, If you and your ex are not on good terms, or are tense around each other, your kids will notice. And if you criticize your ex directly to your kids, they will definitely notice. They might repeat these criticisms to your ex, causing the relationship between you to deteriorate. When you and your ex aren’t getting along, it can be difficult to coordinate child care, including disciplinary issues.If you find your ex really repulsive, spend as little time around them as possible. Call them if you need to talk, and wait until your kids are out of earshot.
Always be polite to your ex, even if they aren’t polite to you.

"
"
Have regular family meetings.,
Don’t let your kids guilt you into flexing the rules.,
Investigate what your kids say.,
Avoid making your ex the bad guy.",How to Discipline Your Kids As Divorced Parents2," Even if, after a divorce, your “family” consists of just you and your child, it’s important to have regular conversations with your kids. During these meetings, share your point of view about their performance both at school and at home. If your child has been undisciplined in either category, use the meeting to reiterate your rules and expectations.If they have not met your expectations in either category, remind them of the consequences and implement the necessary form of discipline.
For instance, if your child hasn’t been completing homework, you could revoke their phone privileges for a few days.
If you have remarried, you should, of course, include your partner in the conversation as well.
Family meetings shouldn’t take too long. Depending on how much you want to communicate with your child, and how much they want to share with you, five to ten minutes is usually enough time.
A good way to integrate regular meetings into your family schedule is to have them at the same time once each week, then get a pizza, go bowling, or do something equally fun after the conversation.

, If you and your ex don’t agree on certain rules, your kids will surely let you know. If they come back from a weekend with your ex and challenge a certain house rule on the grounds that “But Dad/Mom lets me!” don’t rise to the bait. Instead, reaffirm your rules by saying, “Well this is not their house. In this house, the rules are different.”Your child might ask, “Why?” Explain that you and your ex have different views about what is acceptable and what is not.
Use these opportunities to remind your child of why there are certain rules and what the consequences of disobedience are.

, Kids can be sneaky. If they try to convince you to change a rule based on something that your ex supposedly does – especially something that causes real concern -- be sure to follow up with your ex. Let your kids know you intend to do so by announcing, for instance, “At your dad’s house you’re allowed to eat all the candy you want? I’ll have to talk to them about that tomorrow!”You should also follow up when your kids report that their friends’ parents allow them to do something that you don’t approve of, too. If your kids aren’t behaving appropriately at their friends’ houses, you might want to reconsider allowing them over there.

, If your ex has a reasonable rule that they feel very strongly about and they want you to implement it too, you should include it in your household’s rules. Don’t purposely neglect to enforce rules that your ex wants in order to gain points with your kids or snub your ex. This might make them do the same thing to you, leading to unhappiness for you and your kids.Doing this will hurt your kids, because they will end up with less guidance and authority in their lives, and feel frustrated by their parents’ immaturity.

"
"
Provide visual reminders.,
Discover why your children are misbehaving.,
Use age-appropriate punishments.,
Be honest about your feelings.,
Compare your ex’s parenting style to that of others.",How to Discipline Your Kids As Divorced Parents3," Use a calendar, erasable marker chart, or apps and other digital reminders to help your kids stay disciplined. Place the calendar or board in a highly visible area like, for instance, the front of the fridge where your kids will always see it. Use these reminders to remind your kids of their responsibilities.For example, you might write a few chores on the calendar each day so that when your child comes home, they’ll be able to check it and know what is expected of them.
You could also send an email or text message to your child directly in order to help them maintain proper discipline.

, After a divorce, children may lash out at their siblings, peers, or caretakers because they feel betrayed or saddened by the divorce. In order to respond appropriately to the child’s behavior, you need to first understand why they are acting the way they are.Of course, children who are not divorced might engage in these behaviors, too. But it’s important to factor in the divorce as a possible underlying cause for bad behavior when disciplining your child as a divorced parent.
If a previously good child starts engaging in negative behavior following the divorce, it’s probably due to the trauma of the divorce.
If your child is hesitant to open up with you (as children often are) you might need to enlist help. Have your child see a child therapist. Armed with their special training in psychology, child therapists can help your child explore his or her feelings and discover the causes underlying their behavior.

, As children grow, their understanding about what kinds of behavior are right and wrong becomes more complex. Therefore, kids of different ages should have different sets of punishments. For toddlers and kindergarteners, calmly saying “No” followed by timeout for a few minutes is usually effective. For older kids


As your kids age, allow them new privileges, but also let them know that with their new privileges come new responsibilities and consequences. For instance, let your child know that if they’re cyberbullying, they will lose phone privileges for a time.
Don’t dish out unrealistic disciplinary action when you’re angry. For instance, if you say, “You’ll never play that videogame again!” and then later allow your child to play videogames, they will come to take what you say about disciplinary action less seriously.
Never use physical violence – including spanking or slapping –against your child. This will only lead them to develop anger and doing so teaches your child that physical violence is an ok way to work through conflict, which can cause problems for your child later in life. Using physical violence against your child can also reduce the strength of the trust and bond between you.

, Divorcees often project their feelings onto their kids, or take the stress of a divorce out on them. For instance, you might discipline your child for doing or saying something similar to what their other parent often says, or for saying something in a way that their other parent may have said it. You might unconsciously express any lingering resentment toward your ex by being hard on your child. For instance, if you discipline your child for vague violations like their “tone of voice” or “attitude,” step back and examine exactly what you mean by that.
One big red flag should be if your child does not understand why they’re being punished. Good discipline should be based on clear, understandable rules and expectations.
If you’re having trouble confronting your emotions about the divorce, seek professional help. Visit a reputable therapist to work through your issues.

, When you’re weighing the validity of a disciplinary action that your ex is proposing, try to separate the proposal (or punishment) from the person (your ex). Imagine that your mother or a neighbor was watching your children and had the same rule, and reacted the same way your ex did. How would you feel? What would you say to them?If you can imagine someone else enforcing a certain rule and think it would be reasonable in their case, you should also accept when your ex does it.
If you and your ex ended things on a particularly bad note, mentally substituting another person for your ex in this way can help you stay objective about whether they are being a good parent or not.

Recognize that it isn't your fault that your parents are having problems.,
Your parents feelings are not your responsibility.,

Also, you may notice that your parents will be busy....especially with what is going on.",How to Cope with Your Parents' Custody Battle (For Kids)," You are not the cause. They may not love each other anymore, but they love you, and that's why they are in this custody battle. Your friends could provide you a little moral support and that could be helpful.;
, Allow them to deal with their own emotions without getting involved.

, Answer the judge honestly; no one is going to be angry or upset with you. The judge simply wants to make sure you are going somewhere you'll feel safe and comfortable.

, Know that they love you very much, and love them back.

, For example, if you wanted to stay with your mom, but you really need to stay with your dad, try not to be sad. He is your daddy and he loves you. There will still be time for you to visit your mom.

, Tell your parents that you want to stay, for example, with your dad. Tell them that you are facing major changes in your life because of their decision and that you'd appreciate having your opinions considered as they try to work out where and with whom you'll live.

, If you're supposed to go to your dad, but you'd rather be with your mom, tell your dad yourself, instead of making your mom tell him. Also, if you don't want to do something your parent has planned, be honest about it and say what you'd rather do. That parent would like to know what would make you happy.

, Go to your best friend, a teacher you can trust, or your church pastor, and tell them what is on your mind. It will help you greatly to get some of your own thoughts and anxieties off of your chest!

, Just remember, they are having a difficult time just like you. When you need to talk to them, speak up, help them keep you a top priority.

Define the parties to your agreement.,
Include a provision about the child or children at issue.,
Detail both physical and legal rights.,
Go through mediation if necessary.,
Fill out required court documents.,
Get the judge's signature.,
File everything with the clerk of courts.",How to Get Visitation Rights1," The first step in making a visitation agreement is to set out who will have visitation rights. While this will most often be the parent not having custody of the child, there are situations where other individuals may get visitation rights. For example, in Washington State, a person other than a parent can have visitation rights if it is in the best interest of the child.Regardless, provide a detailed description of all parties to the agreement, which should include names, addresses, contact information, and their relationships to the child.


Such a provision may look like this: ""I, Jane Doe, am the parent of Kevin Doe and I have full custody of that child. I agree to allow John Doe, the father of Kevin Doe, visitation rights as set forth and agreed upon below. Jane Doe lives at and can be contacted in the following manner . John Doe lives at and can be contacted in the following manner ."";
, Once you have defined the parties to the agreement, you will want to include a detailed discussion about the child. Such a clause should include information about the child's basic needs, which will include their need for love, support, guidance, and health.A good example of this type of provision may take the following form: ""Kevin Doe is the child of John and Jane Doe. John and Jane Doe are creating this agreement to allow Kevin's father, John, certain visitation rights. Kevin wants and needs the love and support of both parents and therefore John should have certain visitation rights in order to provide certain basic needs. Kevin is currently nine years old as of the date this agreement is executed, and having his father involved in his life is in the child's best interests. Kevin and John have always been close and have had a good relationship. This agreement will help maintain and further the relationship they already have. Kevin is currently in good health and allowing John visitation rights will help maintain and promote this good health.""

, This section will be the body of your agreement and will set forth all of the rights and obligations of the parent or other person receiving visitation rights. When creating this section, consider the child's age, personality, experiences, and abilities.

You should also try to give the child a regular and consistent schedule that can easily be followed.Use enough detail so that the agreement is easily understandable and enforceable.Also, the agreement should give the child a sense of security and a reliable routine.Physical custody includes information about where the children live and how they spend their time.When writing this section you should think about where the children should be during the week and on the weekends; where the children should be for holidays and other special occasions; which party will be in charge of what activities (sports, music events, homework); which party is in charge at what times; and how the children will get from one place to the other.Legal custody includes information about which party to the agreement will make important decisions regarding the child.When you write this section be sure to include information about decisions regarding school, daycare, religion, medical and dental care, emergency care, jobs, and driving., If at any time during the drafting process you and the other party do not agree to certain terms, you may want to consider trying mediation. During mediation, both parties will have the help of an expert (mediator) to try and resolve their differences.The mediator will talk with both parties about their concern, disagreement, resentment, and anger.The mediator will then try and come up with an amicable solution that makes you and the other party happy. If successful, the mediator may even help you draft language into your agreement that reflects the progress you made during your time with that mediator., Once you have completed your agreement, you will need to attach other required documents to your agreement in order to have a judge review your plan.In general, the following document will be required along with your written agreement:



Stipulation and Order for Visitation of Children, which will require you to sign a document stating that the court has jurisdiction over the children at issue and that you are agreeing to the terms of the agreement attached to this document., Once you have filled out the required documentation and attached it to your written agreement, you will go to your local courthouse and have the documents signed by a judge.The judge will look over your agreement and ensure everything included is in the best interest of the child. If the judge approves of your agreement, they will sign it and give it back to you. If the judge denies your agreement, you will have to start over or go to court.

, Once the judge has signed your agreement, you will file all of the signed documentation with the clerk of courts at your local courthouse.Once filed, you and the other party to your agreement will get copies and the agreement will then be binding on everyone involved."
"
Consider hiring an attorney.,
Fill out the required forms.,
File your documents.,
Serve the other party.,
Wait for a response.,
Attend your hearing.,
Comply with any of the judge's requests.,
Receive the judge's final order.",How to Get Visitation Rights2," If you can afford a family law attorney, you should consider hiring one to help you navigate the legal pathway to gaining visitation rights. See this article for directions on how to find a good family law attorney. Even if you cannot afford a full-service attorney, many attorneys provide limited services at a reasonable cost. This means you may be able to hire an attorney to prepare your documents, give you limited legal advice, or potentially even teach you about this area of the law, without having to pay the attorney to take on the entire visitation process.

, In order to start the process, you will need to fill out the forms necessary to bring a legal action to ask the court for visitation rights. Each state will have their own forms and own requirements. In general, you will have to fill out a petition or visitation rights, sometimes called a petition for custody and support.In addition, you will have to attach a summons and a response form to your petition.The petition for visitation rights will ask you about your relationship with the child at issue and will ask you to clarify the types of visitation rights you are seeking.If you are in California, a copy of this petition can be found here.
The attached summons is a document notifying the other party that they have been sued and that they must respond to the lawsuit within a certain period of time or they risk losing some or all of their parental rights.In California, the summons states that the party is being sued and that they have 30 days to file a response.A copy of the California summons can be found here.
In order to allow the other party you are suing to respond, you must attach a blank response form for them to fill out and return. In California, a blank response form can be found here.

, Once you have filled out your petition for visitation and you have attached a summons and blank response form, you will take those documents to your local courthouse and file them with the clerk of courts. They will enter the case into the court's docket and you will be given a hearing date. Once you complete this process, you have officially started a lawsuit in an attempt to get visitation rights.

, When you serve the other party, you will hire someone (the sheriff or another competent adult) to give a copy of your filed documents to the other party to look over and respond to. To serve the other party, the person you hire must provide the required documents to them, either in person or through the mail.If you are serving someone through the mail, it must be sent by certified mail. This process must be completed within 30 days of filing your documents with the court., Once you have had the other party served, they will have a set amount of time with which to respond to your petition. In California, the other party will have 30 days to respond to your petition by filling out the blank response form you provided. The other party can respond in a number of ways, and how they respond will dictate how your lawsuit proceeds.


If the other party does not contest your request for visitation, the court may simply enter its final order without having to go through a hearing.
If the other party is contesting your request for visitation, you will have to go to your hearing and tell the judge why you deserve the visitation rights you are asking for.

, When you go to your hearing, the judge will make a decision about visitation rights based on the law of the state you are in. In California, the judge must hand out visitation rights according to what is in the ""best interests of the child.""In making this decision, a judge will look at the child's age and health, the emotional ties between the parent and the child, the ability of the parent to care for the child, any history of family violence, and the child's ties to the community (e.g., schools and friends).If the other party is contesting your fitness as a parent, and is therefore claiming you should not get visitation rights, try using the following evidence to help your argument that visitation rights would be in the best interest of your child.


Provide evidence of your financial stability. This information will show the judge that you can care for the child and take care of their basic needs. Some helpful documents might include bank statements, pay stubs, and investment account information.
Show your ability to provide a safe and secure home for the child. This information will help the judge understand what safeguards you have in place to ensure you are looking out for the best interests of the child. You might provide the judge with pictures of your home, bills for home security payments, and written or verbal testimony of neighbors, friends, and family about the safety of your neighborhood and your home.
Offer evidence of your ability to provide healthcare for the child. Try and have documentation proving you are insured and that your coverage includes your child.
Demonstrate the strength of your relationship with your child. Let the judge know how close you are with your child. Tell the judge about the past and how your relationship was when you had custody of the child. You might even provide the judge with home videos, trophies, and ticket stubs.
Indicate how you will spend time with your child. Give the judge a mock schedule or calendar showing how well you can plan your time with the child. Include possible activities and trips you could go on with your child. Be as detailed as possible as this will let the judge know how much you care and how serious you are taking the matter.
Confirm your intentions to live in one place and provide your child with a stable school environment. An important aspect of gaining visitation rights is your ability to provide your child with a stable home environment. Prove to the judge that you have a good job, that you have no plans to move, and that you will do everything in your power to give your child a steady environment. If you are looking for visitation rights during the week, this will include showing the judge that you live within a reasonable distance of where your child goes to school.

, Before a judge issues their final order, they may ask you to do certain things to prove that having visitation rights is in the best interest of the child. One of the most common requests is for a child custody evaluation. If a judge requires it, there will be an evaluation and analysis, by an expert, who will come to your home and make a determination about your fitness to have visitation rights.The expert's evaluation will then be passed on to the judge for them to analyze.

, Once a judge has all the information they need to make a decision, they will enter a final order, which will include a decision about what visitation rights you will get, if any. If a judge allows visitation, it may take one of many forms. The most common forms of visitation include:



Visitation According to a Schedule. If your visitation rights have been limited to a schedule, the schedule will lay out what days of the week you can visit, what holidays you will be responsible for, and the time constraints on those visits.Reasonable Visitation. If you have been awarded reasonable visitation rights, there generally will not be any details as to when each parent will be with the child.Instead, these orders are open-ended and allow the parents to work out the details among themselves.Supervised Visitation. If the judge has ordered supervised visitation rights, you will only be allowed to see the child while under the supervision of another person.This type of visitation is usually only ordered when the health or safety of the child is at issue."

Be aware of possible changes.,
Keep in touch.,
Compromise.,
Plan for the future.",How to Deal With Divorced Parents1," Divorce impacts every family differently. But almost all families go through significant changes during the process. If your parents are divorcing, it's important to know that your life might change in big ways. It's likely that one of your parents will not longer live with you.It is possible that you might have to move to a different house, and maybe even a different town. Often, when parents split up, one or both choose to move to a new location.
You might have to switch schools. Depending on whether or not you move, be prepared to attend a different school than you are used to.
These changes can be intense. Remember that it is normal to feel scared and frustrated about your new situation.
Remember that things will get better. You will get used to your new home, your new school, or your new routine. You will have to be flexible for awhile while you get used to these changes.
Keep doing the things you enjoy. For example, if you've also enjoyed soccer, you can join the team at your new school.;
, Living with only one parent can be a tough situation. One of the best ways to cope is to make an effort to keep in touch with the parent that you don't see every day. Depending on your parents custody arrangement, you might not get to choose how often you see your mom or dad. But there are other ways to keep in touch.If your dad has moved out, set up a communication schedule with him. Make it a point to connect with one another every day. This will help you feel more in touch.
Use technology. In addition to talking on the phone, you can text, e-mail, Skype or Facetime.
Remind your parents that you are not divorcing either of them. Make sure they understand that you still love them both, and that it is important to you to spend time with each of them.

, Your parents divorce is an emotional experience for you. Try to remember that it is a really tough situation for your parents, too. While it is not your job to solve their problems, there are some things you can do to facilitate compromise. This can make the transition easier for all of you.Sometimes parents going through a divorce are uncomfortable being around each other. This can make it difficult for you, since you want both of them to be part of your life. Offer suggestions that work for everyone.
Maybe you have a big soccer game coming up. If your mom and dad can't handle being in the same place at the same time, ask one of them to come to the first half and the other can come to the second half. Remember, they're both on your side.
Ask your parents to help you facilitate the compromises. Tell them that you need both of them to remain active in your life, and ask them to come up with suggestions on how to do that.

, Part of what makes a divorce scary is that it can make things seem more uncertain. Maybe you're worried about how this will affect your annual vacation in the summer. Or maybe you wonder who is going to help you pay for college. Sit down with your parents and make a plan.It is perfectly normal to wonder about how the divorce is going to affect your life. Make a list of future events you are concerned about and share the list with your parents.
Ask your parents to help you figure out how to plan for each event on your list.

Tell your children as soon as possible.,
Allow specific circumstances to dictate some decisions.,
Be honest and straightforward.,
Tell your kids you love them.,
Be prepared to answer their questions.,
Give your children any information regarding immediate changes.,
Present a united front with your children’s other parent.",How to Deal With Children in a Divorce Situation1," Once it has become certain that you and your spouse will be separating, you need to let your kids know. Make sure you’re calm and composed when you decide to tell your children, and have them sit down with you somewhere private. If your children immediately has a lot of questions, tell them that things will be different, but that you all will address each issue as they come up., If you and your spouse have decided to separate amicably, you should tell your children about the divorce together. This will convey that you and your spouse still respect one another, and that you both will still be actively involved in your children's lives. If the separation is hostile, it will likely be better to tell your children on your own, in a calm environment.


If you have multiple children, especially if they are of similar ages, you should sit them down and give them the news at the same time.
If you have children of significantly different ages, you may want to tell older children first. If they have specific questions, you'll be able to respond to them more directly.

, Being honest does not mean including all of the details. While there may be some specific, significant reasons that the divorce is happening, it’s best to explain the reasons why you are getting divorced in a somewhat general way.However, you should still be honest and explain this situation in a way that will soften the blow.


For example, if both parents are present during the conversation, then you can start by saying, ""We love you,"" or say ""I love you,"" if only one parent is present. Then, you can say something like, ""We've tried everything we could, but our marriage isn't working, so we are going to live apart now. We are getting a divorce.""
Keep it very simple with grade-school age children or younger.
Older children may demand more information, but you should still choose your responses carefully.

, This basic step is of absolute importance. Children can easily become confused and frightened by a divorce. Remind them how much you care about them, and that you are still their parent. Be explicit by saying something like, “I want you to know that this doesn’t change how I feel about you at all. I still love you and I am so happy that I’m your parent.""After you tell your kids that you love them, it is also important to tell your kids that they did not do anything at all to cause the divorce. Try saying something like, ""This has absolutely nothing to do with you or anything you did. You did nothing at all to cause this situation. It is just a problem between your father/mother and I."" Make sure that you repeat this to your kids multiple times to help them understand that they are not at fault..

, Your kids may be shocked by the news, and will potentially become emotionally distraught. Very young children may not know what divorce is and will need an explanation that you will not be married and will not be living together. Allow young children to vent their sadness or anger, and focus on the fact that you love them. In addition to anger or sadness, many children will have a torrent of questions. Be prepared to answer questions you can anticipate beforehand, and be willing to admit you’re still figuring things out yourself.If you aren’t sure about how to answer certain questions, it’s perfectly alright to admit this. Say something along the lines of “I don’t know right now, but we’ll figure that out and we’ll all be okay.”

, Include any information you’ve agreed upon with your spouse about who will be living where and other logistical considerations such as where they’ll go to school. The idea is to provide as much information as you can about the upcoming changes in your children’s lives, as well as reaffirmation of the things that will remain the same.Among the specific things they’ll be curious about, you’ll likely want to address the following:


Whether or not they will move, and where they will be living.
Where each of their parents will be living.
A few additional specifics, such as how they will spend summer vacations and holidays.

, In particular, don’t blame your spouse for the divorce. Even if your spouse is prompting the separation, it can be hurtful to your children to be critical of your spouse. If possible, talk to your spouse about what you’ll tell your children, and come to agreement about what you’ll say.More generally, do not speak poorly of your spouse to your children. This will not contribute positively to any of your lives.
Keep in mind that your children will likely still have a relationship with their other parent, and it is in their interest if that relationship is healthy.

Tell your parents that you would like to set some clear boundaries and guidelines.

Your extended family might become more involved in your life now that your parents will need some extra support. Will you get to see your favorite aunt more often? Write it down.

, There is no doubt that dealing with divorced parents is stressful. That's completely normal. But stress can have negative effects on your physical and mental health. There are several things you can do to lower your stress level.Get enough rest. It's tough to deal with a divorce when you're well-rested, but it's even harder if you are tired.

Give yourself a chance to label the problem simply as a tactic by the other partner, usually to gain some control or influence over the situation.,
Write down a list of ways in which you are being provoked, or are likely to be provoked so you know the warning signs when you are being affected by the other persons actions.,
Clear your head about whatever real justifications the other person might have for their actions, and write down for yourself an acknowledgement of what these may be.,
Take some time out with a friend you really can trust.,
Set aside some time and money to give attention to something interesting to take your mind of the other problem.,
If you have children involved, write letters to them that you can send one day in the distant future.,
Start systematically remembering the good things that happened, and separate them from the bad.,
If there is a dispute about children's custody, or access be very clear in what is a reasonable and balanced solution.,
Consider taking the step of changing the way your mind dwells on the problem.,
Try to get involved in other things that visibly show that the other person no longer has an influence over you based on what they remember.,
Be a good friend to people who are embarking on similar family tragedy.,
At all costs, avoid violence.,
Apart from everything else, take off your shoes sometime and walk on fresh grass, or go for a swim at a beach, or river.",How to Cope with Parental Alienation of Children," State the problem as simply as possible, and write down this sentence as a ""label"" for that behavior. Now realize how obvious the motivation for it might be, and clearly determine not to act that way in response.;
, List simple alternative actions you can take which involve less response.

, Decide clearly to avoid repeating those faults in the future, and the clear opposite actions that you could take to mark a change in your own behavior. This might involve seeking help with problems such as anger, alcohol, drugs, gambling, morals or all typical human faults. Just work out how to be a better human being that can't be accused of anything with justification.

, Maybe this could be a relative, but it must be someone sensible who knows you well, and who is likely to be trustworthy and discreet. Someone who won't spill the beans to the opposition. Find something enjoyable and diverting to do with someone else. Ideally this should involve a ""change in context"", so you are not immersed in the problems you are trying to address.

, Find ways of making your familiar environment a bit different now that things are different. See yourself in some new clothes, doing things differently. Take the trouble to organize better food, some physical exercise, new thoughts, fresh ideas, and information about human psychology.

, This will establish the consistency of your feelings for them when they inevitably want to make decisions for themselves. Keep all legal papers in one folder, and a diary and folder of all correspondence from the other person, for the future. Have a computer file for emails. Log all phone calls with time and a brief code of the stuff that was said, it will often be the same so a simple code helps avoid having to dwell on the power of the assertions.

, Systematically put all these good things together so they are like a time capsule that you can choose to look at one day in the future. Now realize that you need a completely new ""capsule"" of information about your new life. Start filling it with notes and diaries about the things you can do that help move your mindset away from actions responsive to the problem.

, Make sure this is recorded somewhere appropriately either by filing a statement with the Court or with the people who may have some influence over the other person. Make sure it is carefully typed/or written, and well presented so it shows that you are being fair and rational. Make it a statement of fact that any reasonable person would respect.

, In my case, at one stage, I wondered whether I would feel less despair if I knew that my children would never be able to return. Such as if they had died from natural causes etc. Whatever you do, keep it firmly in mind that they can be as much victims of the actions of the other person, as you are, except they have less self defense against the insinuations and discredit that might be being propagated against you. Accept that for a time, they may have to believe what they are told just to keep their relationship with the other parent manageable. Have faith that human beings are all so much the same that time will eventually show that you are not the monster that you might have been depicted to be. Hard to say it, but perhaps its true: Try to move on from this problem. Once you have done all that you can reasonably do, stop hammering away at a lost cause. To do so might in fact be quite counterproductive, so known when to give up... for the time being.

, Project the attitude that their stuff is something from the past and you just no longer have time to dwell in that sort of rubbish. Don't validate anything by giving it attention or response, put those matters below your dignity.

, Most of us wonder how anyone else could possibly understand as our life is falling apart. Be supportive, but also realize that their decisions must be their own decisions, not your advice.

, The problem with violence is that it affects you more than you can realize and is most unlikely to give any long term satisfaction. Don't do things that can't be undone, and realize that even thinking that way takes a toll on your own mental health and recovery.

, Find somewhere silent and practice completing one thought after another until you only have one thing to think about at a time. Reduce your personal turmoil, watch the things in nature that just go on time after time, unaffected by these human problems. I watch clouds, small birds, and inconsequential insects that just keep doing all the things they normally do. Get things into perspective, the world is a very big place, and our affairs are of very little real significance in the course of time.

Maintain stability and structure in your children’s daily routine.,
Agree upon some basic guidelines about rules.,
Avoid fighting in front of your children.,
Be tactful, polite, and positive.,
Encourage your kids to get along with one another.,
Introduce new partners slowly and thoughtfully.",How to Deal With Children in a Divorce Situation2," If you will be cooperatively raising your children along with their other parent while separated, it’s important to get on the same page about the children’s day to day lives. Children find structure to be comforting, and uncertainty about basic aspects of their everyday lives will add to the stress and frustration they may be going through.Organize and keep a regular schedule regarding who brings the kids to school or picks them up. These aspects of a child’s life matter more than you think.

, You and your spouse should come to some agreement about the rules that will be maintained in both households, as well as discipline for breaking these rules. While some rules may vary, any agreement about when and how you discipline your children will benefit everyone involved.For instance, agree on a curfew for children that are old enough to go out with friends on the weekends. Agreeing and enforcing even basic criteria will present a unified disciplinary approach.
Additionally, talk about the things your children are allowed to possess. If possible, prevent scenarios in which certain things - such as violent video games, for instance - are allowed in one household and not the other. Imbalanced disciplinary approaches will become divisive and detrimental for everyone.

, Either in person or on the phone, avoid allowing your children to witness emotional disagreements between you and their other parent. These disagreements will likely occur, but you should both take care not to risk further traumatizing your children by continuing to fight in front of them.When you have something to speak about with your children's other parent, set up a time to meet when your children are not present or simply call them on the phone.
If they are unavailable when you call, ask them to agree to a time to talk, and specify what it is you're hoping to speak about.

, This may admittedly prove to be challenging. Remind yourself that it in the best interest of your children to treat their other parent with respect. In particular, do not say anything disparaging about their other parent. Focus on the positives of their other parent, and remember that your children will have a strong attachment to them.Set a good example for your children about how to act with maturity and kindness.
Do not, under any circumstances, make an effort to undermine your children’s relationship with their other parent. This can be hurtful to both your child and your relationship with them.

, Children of any age will likely develop a stronger bond with one another while going through a divorce together. Never be envious of the strength of a relationship your child has with another member of their family, and encourage these relationships if at all possible.If your know one of your children has been having a rough time, ask them if they’ve talked to their siblings about it.
This applies to kids of similar ages, who may understand how each other are feelings, or of different ages, who may be able to offer advice or comfort to one another.

, You should wait a while before introducing your children to new romantic partners following a divorce. This is especially important if infidelity had been one of the reasons for your divorce. Your children's comfort and access to you should take immediate precedence to any romantic relationships following your divorce.Don't expect your children to immediately be fond of a romantic partner - particularly if you had been having an affair during your marriage.
Whatever the circumstances, know that your children will likely come to respect any new relationship you develop, though it will take time.

Make sure they know the divorce was not their fault.,
Listen carefully to what your kids are saying.,
Respond with compassion and support.,
Know that your child will heal with your support.,
Get your child professional help.",How to Deal With Children in a Divorce Situation3," This is a point that may need to be reiterated to your children, as it is vital that they understand they are not the reason you and your spouse are separating. Help them express themselves by encouraging them to talk about how they’re feeling with you.Understand that you may need to specifically remind them that the divorce is not their fault, by saying things like, “We decided to get a divorce so we won’t fight as often, but we’re still your parents and we will still both always be here for you.”

, Your children will experience several different strong emotions in response to the news of your separation. However, they may internalize their feelings, or struggle to express them. Help them find words for how they’re feeling by asking if they’re sad or frustrated when you notice they’re mood change.Know that your children’s feelings may fluctuate. They may seem to be okay with everything one day, but become very upset the next.
Let them know that whatever they’re feeling is entirely okay, and that they should feel free to be entirely honest with you.

, Show them that you trust them, and that they can trust you, by verbally acknowledging the legitimacy of the feelings they share with you. Don’t ever say they shouldn’t feel a certain way, or ignore any emotions they’re experiencing. Say things like “I understand why you feel that way, and I’m sorry that this is so hard for all of us.”, If you provide consistent love and support for your children, they will be able to deal with the reality of your divorce. Do not hesitate to express your love and reassurance; remind them often that you love them and that you will always be there for them.Most importantly, be there for them. This means spending time with your kids and allowing them the space and opportunity to speak with you about how they’re feeling when they feel comfortable doing so.

, Watch out for signs that your child is having trouble handling the emotions they're feeling after your divorce. This includes children of all ages, from infancy to adulthood. Aside from counselors and therapists, some of whom specialize with working with children, there are support groups online and in-person for children going through their parents' divorce.


Recognize that even your adults children may suffer from troubling emotions following your divorce, and watch out for signs that they may need additional support."
"
Know that even babies will be affected by divorce.,
Reassure young children frequently.,
Be patient with school-aged children.,
Know that teenagers may act out significantly following a divorce.",How to Deal With Children in a Divorce Situation4," Though they may not understand what is happening, babies will often feel and reflect their parent’s stress, sadness, and discomfort. If your baby shows higher irritability than normal, begins to cry more frequently, or even has trouble with sleeping or digestion, recognize that this may reflect unease related to your divorce.Try to convey a sense of calmness around your baby.
In particular, avoid having emotionally fraught discussions when your baby is present.

, Preschool and kindergarten children are particularly likely to blame themselves for your separation, as they are likely to interpret their parents unhappiness as their own fault. If your child begins to act out more frequently, becomes more clingy, or is easily frightened or upset, make an active effort to reassure them more frequently by telling them that you love them and hugging and cuddling them whenever they are upset., Children in their pre-teen years may become especially frustrated by the emotions they’re feeling as a result of your divorce. Look for signs of fluctuating moodiness, increased aggression, discomfort with gender identities, and feelings of being deceived or rejected. Performance in school may also drop, and kids of this age may even seek punishment.Respond to these developments by being more available to your child, and responding to their emotional extremes with patience.
Encourage them to share how they’re feeling and make sure they know they can speak with you whenever they want.

, Teenagers may go through all sorts of emotional turmoil, including diminished self-esteem. They may even attempt to develop their autonomy before they may otherwise do so, in order to try to deal with negative feelings they associate with your divorce.


Watch out for signs of relationship problems with friends, substance abuse, disinterest in school, depression, and even inappropriate sexual behavior.Tell your teenage children that you remember how hard it can be to be young and deal with parents who are struggling to get along.
If any of their behaviors risk getting out of control, ask your child to speak with a counselor or therapist.

Consider child custody mediation.,

Consider going to court.,
Don't say bad things about your ex.,
Encourage your child to learn and grow.,
Help your child learn emotional intelligence.",How to Co Parent with an Uncooperative Ex Spouse," If the court has not mandated your time arrangements, you need to have a discussion about them. You can't just leave the arrangement vague and expect it to work well. If you don't think you can decide on one alone, consider talking with a counselor to help work it out.You need to discuss what nights the child will be spending with which parent, who's responsible for what activities, and who's responsible for which care-taking activities.
Don't forget to discuss holidays and school breaks, as you need to decide where the child will be during those times.;
, If you don't plan on making decisions together going forward, you need to discuss who will make what decisions. For instance, who decides what activities the child gets to do? Who's responsible for the bulk of the child's healthcare? These are important decisions in the life of your child, and you need to make them together or decide who is responsible for the decision.While true co-parenting would be to make all of the decisions together, it may not be feasible if you can't work together. That's why it's important to decide who's going to make what decisions from the get-go.
You should also consider religious upbringing, as well. Which religion will the child follow?
Another consideration is schooling. Will your child go to a public school or a private school going forward? Who will be responsible for making that decision?

, When you've divorced from someone, it can, and usually does, get messy. You've broken up with someone you once vowed to love, and that hurts. It's hard to move on, and it's even tougher not to let those feelings interfere with how you are raising your child. However, if you can keep those feelings out, you can work towards a much healthier relationship, even if your ex remains uncooperative.Try thinking of your ex as a colleague rather than an ex. You probably don't like everyone you work with, but you still must get along with them in a professional manner. In many ways, this step is more parallel parenting, though you are still working together to make decisions.
Once you start thinking of the relationship this way, it can help to calm the waters. Would you pick a fight over something small with a colleague? Not if you're acting professionally.

, That is, when your child is at your ex's house, try not to text or call your child too much. You should expect the same when your child is at your house. The point of this step is to avoid creating a situation where you're trying to mediate between the other parent and the child.That doesn't mean you can't talk to your child, just that you shouldn't spend hours a day on the phone with your child, nor should you get in the middle of arguments between your child and your ex.

, As often as possible, try not to engage with your ex. Often, you will be doing so in front of your kid, since that will be the only time you see your ex. Therefore, it's best not to get in verbal fights, as that only hurts your kid more. Plus, that keeps you entrenched in a negative relationship, which you don't need in your life.This step means you won't rise to the bait. You won't respond with sarcasm, even though you may feel like it.
It means that you have a responsibility to stay calm and not engage, even if your ex is trying to engage you. For instance, say your ex says, ""I noticed you forgot to pack a shirt for him this weekend. Big surprise, you forgot something."" While you may be tempted to snap back at your ex, instead say, in a sincere tone, ""I'm sorry I forgot. I'll remember next time. Thanks for taking the time to tell me."" Being sincere and straightforward can start to disarm some of the nastiness.

, If you're still angry with your ex, the last thing you'll want to do is give a little when it comes to the time arrangement, especially if your ex is being uncooperative. However, giving a little can open up space for a better relationship in the future because it shows you're willing to compromise a bit.Think of it this way. If you're mad at someone and they give you a cookie, you're less likely to be as mad at them because they've been generous to you. It's a silly analogy, but it shows how we think of relationships. When one person gives a little, the other person may be more willing to give a little, too.
In addition, your ex may be willing to be more flexible with the time arrangement in the future when you want to keep your kid for a special day.

, Of course, you can't control your ex's behavior. However, you can control what you do. One way you can help the situation is stop trying to fix your ex, especially if they keep trying to change you. By stepping back, you are signalling you are done with that type of relationship, and in turn, your ex may come to realize that they need to be done with that part of the relationship, too., Making a statement to your ex about what he or she must do can be off-putting. Instead, try re-framing your statements into requests. That way, your ex will at least feel like you are trying to work with them, rather than dictate to them.For instance, you may be tempted to say, ""You should stop taking our kid out for ice cream late at night.""
Instead, try saying, ""Can we talk about Charlie's bedtime? I feel like he does better when we're both on the same page.""

, Even when you'd rather avoid speaking to your ex, it's important to be direct with your ex. Using your child as a mediator only puts stress on the kid. Plus, messages can get mixed up when you send them through a kid. Whatever conflict you have, face it directly.In addition, talking to your ex yourself shows your child how to deal with difficult situations with grace. You're modeling a behavior that your child can rely on later.
It also leaves the burden of parenting on you and your ex, not your kid.

, Bring up the issue you need to discuss. Say why it's important, and what you want to happen. Once you've brought up the issue, give your ex a chance to react. Then discuss possible solutions until you come up with one you can both live with.Don't place blame. Rather, discuss what problem is happening. For instance, instead of saying, ""You give our kid too much sugar,"" you could say, ""I've noticed Charlie has behavioral problems after eating sugar.""
Move on to why you think it's important. ""At his age, I think too much sugar is detrimental. I'd like to reduce the sugar in his diet.""
Ask your ex for a reaction. ""What do you think?"" Whether your ex agrees or disagrees, discuss solutions.
You could say, ""I understand you disagree, but can we come up with a solution we both can live with? What if we limit his sugar intake to one sugary snack a day?""
Go back and forth until you can come up with a compromise. If you can't come up with a compromise, you may need decide to disagree. That is, as long as your ex isn't being abusive, he or she gets to make the decisions when your kid is with him or her.

, This type of mediation is done by a professional. The professional acts as a go-between for you and your ex when you can't work things out. In fact, the mediator can even work without having you both in the same room at the same time, so you won't have to bicker with your ex. The agreements you come to are not binding by the law, so you can change them later in court if you need to do so, though some judges may take the agreements you made into consideration.Mediation can happen before or after you go to court to try to prevent you from going to court a first or second time.
Generally, you will hire one person you can both agree on as a mediator. Most of the time, that person will be a lawyer, though some people do work as professional mediators.

, In severe situations, you may need to call the police. For instance, if your spouse isn't letting you have your kids when they are supposed to, that is an appropriate time to call the police. The police can then come out and make a documentation of it, called a ""visitation interference.""That way, if you do need to go to court, you have documentation to back you up. However, the police will not remove the child from the home. You'll need to go back to court.
In addition, this step may only help you if you already have a court-ordered custody arrangement in place.

, If you haven't been to court or even if you have, you may need to go back to court if you can't work out your arrangements. In that case, you'll both need to hire lawyers to represent your side.Court can get messy, so make it a last resort if possible.
If you feel like your ex spouse is an unfit parent, you may want to fight for full custody. In that case, you'll need to be able to provide examples of how and why the other parent is unfit. Your lawyer can help you come up with ways to prove your point. If you already have a court order for your custody arrangement, you generally must prove that something substantial has changed to get a different arrangement.
This option is also important to consider if your ex spouse is delinquent on child support., At least, don't do so where your child can hear it. If your child hears you saying bad things, they will start questioning their relationship with your ex. Also, it can cause your child stress to hear bad things about someone they love. Therefore, try to save those conversations for your friends, not your kids., In an environment where they are shuffled back and forth, the child can feel a little lost, especially if your spouse isn't as encouraging of your child and their independence. Therefore, it's important that you take the time to nurture your child, and encourage them to explore their strengths and skills.One way to encourage independence is to let your children tackle projects by themselves, or at least, mostly by themselves. Giving them a chance to try new things without hovering helps them learn how to solve problems and grow.
Another thing you can do is praise the child's accomplishments. When your child has worked hard on something, let them know that you noticed their hard work, even if the result wasn't quite what they wanted. For instance, say your child got a B on a spelling test, but they worked very hard through the whole week to get that B. You could say, ""I know you wanted a higher grade, but I'm proud of you for working so hard. Sometimes, we don't get the result we want, but if you do your best and work hard, you can still be proud of yourself.""

, Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify emotions in yourself and others. It also involves being able to deal with those emotions positively. Helping your child to develop emotional intelligence will help them deal with the other parent if your ex isn't being as emotionally nurturing. In addition, it will teach your child coping skills they need later in life.Start by helping your child identifying what they're feeling. For instance, when your child throws a toy, don't just react. Instead, sit the child down and say, ""I think you're feeling frustrated because you couldn't figure out the toy. Frustration is when you are annoyed because you can't get something to go how you want.""
Show empathy. When your child is upset, show you understand how it feels. For instance, you could say, ""I know how upsetting frustration can feel. I feel frustrated sometimes, too.""
Help the child see how to deal with the emotion better. ""I understand that you were frustrated, but throwing the toy isn't an appropriate way to deal with that emotion. If you're frustrated, you can ask for help or choose to play with something else.""

Motherhood is often seen as a game of sacrifice. Mothers are expected to give up certain luxuries and comforts in order to meet their child's needs. Such an approach can actually backfire. Kids will learn to let their own needs go unmet to meet the demands of others. The best way to teach your child to take care of himself is to show him how to do so.Model a healthy lifestyle. Take regular breaks from work and chores. Stop to eat lunch at midday. Get enough sleep at night. Splurge on a babysitter once in awhile to go see your friends. Many mothers feel guilt at indulging, but you do not need to worry. Your children will not feel neglected or overlooked but will instead come to recognize what a positive, healthy lifestyle resembles.Obviously, self care is easier said than done. This is especially true if you have very young children and are the primary caregiver in your household. It's okay to ask for help. If you have family in the area, see if your brother or mother can take the kids on an afternoon outing so you can catch up on sleep. If you're co-parenting, ask your partner or spouse to watch the kids for a weekend afternoon.;
, If you're feeling high stress during your busy routine, a regimen of deep breathing can help keep you calm. Practice the following technique if you're having a high stress day.


Breathe in slowly. Try to take air into your stomach rather than your chest. Count to four, holding in the air.
Purse your lips and exhale slowly while counting to four.
Rest for four counts without taking any breaths.
Take two normal breaths and then start the activity over., Many mothers believe admitting to stress is a sign of weakness. This is not the case. It's actually healthier to admit when you're stressed than to try holding it in.Avoid stress during the Christmas season


Many mothers feel guilt if they do not find motherhood to be an entirely blissful endeavor. However, keep in mind all mothers get stressed, and all aspects of life, even positive ones, come with stress attached. Remind yourself that it's okay to admit to being overwhelmed on occasion. Recognizing that these feelings are normal and okay makes experiencing them easier.If you're having trouble managing your stress, never hesitate to seek professional help. A therapist or counselor can help you better manage anxiety and regulate your moods. You can find a therapist by asking for a referral from your doctor, seeing what's covered by your insurance, or going through your school or employer.

, There are small tricks you can engage in to reduce your anxiety. Throughout the day, keep the following techniques in mind if you need a quick and simple stress reliever.


Close your eyes. If you feel overwhelmed by a situation, and you do not need to be vigilant in the moment, close your eyes for about 30 seconds. Shutting out the world gives you a chance to relax and regroup.
Drink water. Having a glass of cold water can help quell anxiety. The act of drinking and the calm, clear nature of water help many people relax during high stress situations.
Listen to music. Have a few soothing songs ready to go on your iPod or laptop. Making a playlist of relaxing music to have on hand during stressful days can be a great way to relax quickly.
Try to spend time outside. People tend to feel more relaxed if they're not cooped up in a house all day. Just a quick 10 minute walk around the block can help you unwind., Motherhood is difficult and many mothers struggle from time to time. Seeking out support can help you know you're not alone, which can be comforting. There are many online forums where people discuss mothering and parenthood. You might also find a group of moms in your community who meet to talk about their experiences with childcare. Seeking out support and advice from others can help you become the best mom you can be.

, School and extracurricular activities have become an increasingly competitive arena. Children often have high expectations of themselves. As a mother, reminding your kids it's okay to be imperfect and make mistakes is important.


Understand kids need to be kids. While it's fine to encourage your child to explore his interests in things like sports and arts, remind him it's okay to take a break and relax as well. Tell him his work at school and extracurriculars should be driven by a love of learning and a particular hobby instead of perfection, achievement, and grades.Allow your child to make mistakes. If your daughter misses a shot at her hockey game, remind her even great athletes play less than perfect games. If your son doesn't end up first chair saxophone, remind him he should play because he loves music and not to be the best., You can model a positive attitude for your child by focusing on the good things in life. Teach your child to adopt a ""glass half full"" mentality to increase his sense of happiness and security. Focus on your kid's positive attributes and try to look on the bright side of any situation. This will help both you and your kids relax., Parenthood can be a surprisingly competitive endeavor. Many parents boast about their children and are constantly holding them to the standards of others their age. Remember, your child is a unique person in his own right. Do not compare him to other kids.


Children move and develop at their own pace and have their own strengths and weaknesses. Your son might still be struggling with basic subtraction but be reading at a high grade level. Your daughter might not remember dates in history class but excel at biology. Remember the old saying, ""Everyone is a genius in their own way. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it'll spend its whole life believing that it's stupid.""Discourage your kids from comparing themselves to others. As they move on in school or get more involved in extracurriculars, they might be tempted to compare themselves to other students who they feel are more successful or advanced. When you catch your kid doing this, remind him that he's special and unique in his own way. Tell him to focus on himself and his own work rather than holding himself to the standards of those around him.
Don't compare yourself to others, either. Children learn by example. If you frequently compare yourself to other mothers and talk about your shortcomings, your kids will learn to compare themselves to others too.

, Life is full of setbacks and problems. As a mother, you might be tempted to try and fix issues for your child. However, as your kids get older it's more effective to teach guide them through problem-solving techniques so they learn to be more independent. This will reduce both your stress levels.


Listen to your child when he or she explains a problem. Then, slowly try to show him or her how to work through the problem calmly. For example, say your daughter is frustrated that her friend Eve constantly hogs the role of teacher when they play school. Understand why your daughter wants to be the teacher and why she's wary of expressing this to Eve. Then, the two of you can discuss effective communication strategies she could use to talk to Eve about the issue. For example, you could say, ""Why don't you ask Eve if you two can take turns playing teacher? Eve might not realize it's important to you if you haven't expressed this to her. Maybe she thinks you prefer to be the student.""By going through problem-solving techniques with your child, and guiding them to the solution rather than outright explaining it, your kids will learn to be more independent. They'll be less reliant on your to help them with small problems throughout the week. They'll also feel more adept at addressing stressors in their lives. This results in less stress for you and your kids.Remember that your kid may not always want your help. Sometimes he/she may just want someone to listen. This is especially true for teenagers.

, One way to keep your household calm is to work on prioritizing sleep. Poor sleep habits can lead to higher stress levels, resulting in tantrums and other outbursts.


Have a regular bedtime. The body runs on a circadian rhythm that adjusts to the sleep cycle we provide. If your kids always go to bed at 9 o'clock, they'll naturally feel tired around that time.
Engage in relaxing bedtime rituals. A story or bath before bed can help your kids wind down and fall asleep easier.
Relaxation techniques before bed can also help. Teach your child about deep breathing. Ask your child to imagine himself somewhere peaceful and calm. Encourage him to imagine the smells, sounds, and sights of a pleasant memory until he nods off and falls asleep., You should teach your kids to be healthy and eat right. However, do so in a way that encourages them to be healthy for their own benefits and not to impress anyone else. Teach your kids about what constitutes a balanced diet and how to have fun while being physically active. Discourage them from comparing themselves to others. If you have body image issues yourself, try to work through them with a counselor or therapist. Oftentimes, kids pick up on unhealthy eating and exercising habits from their parents.

, Part of having a solid perspective is to learn to forgive small imperfections. No one can be the perfect mother all the time. Accept that some things will not turn out exactly as imagined.


Sometimes, chores fall to the wayside. You might not get laundry, dishes, and vacuuming done on the exact schedule you desire. Try to let it go. You can always wash dinner dishes in the morning or put in a load of laundry at night.You might not make it to every event. You might end up missing a family dinner night now and then or skipping out on a meeting for church or PTA. Try not to stress and remind yourself you're doing the best you can., Oftentimes, motherhood is stressful because of skewed priorities. Mothers sometimes get caught up in small matters rather than focusing on what's really important.


Finances can be a stressful part of parenting, but try to remember time over money is what matters. You may not be able to afford the same toys a child across the street has, but what really matters is quality one-on-one time with your kids.
Think about how you spend money. Many parents invest in their kids by spending extra money on expensive sports equipment, art supplies, or other things to fuel a child's passions. While it's important to encourage your kids to explore their interests, remember again that time is what matters most of all. Instead of buying a new, better piano for your daughter to practice on, consider paying someone to help out with cleaning. Use the time you would spend on dishes and laundry listening to your daughter play., While it can be hard to feel grateful when you're stressed, striving for gratitude can help put things in perspective. Try to be thankful for your family and your children, even when things are hard. This can reduce your stressful level and make for a more harmonious home.

, Many mothers see asking for help as a sign of defeat. Understand this is not the case. It's okay to ask the sitter to stay extra hours or ask your parents if they can take the kids for the afternoon. Being a mom is hard and it's normal and healthy to occasionally reach out to others if you need help.

Find a support system.",How to Break up when Children Are Involved," You should also prepare for the conversation with your children by creating a plan moving forward with your partner beforehand. You both should sit down and discuss who will be living where, who will be responsible for certain daily needs and activities for the children, and when the official divorce process will begin. Being clear about these details will allow you to better reassure your children and show a united front.For example, you may come to an agreement where your partner moves out and lives in an apartment nearby or another home. You may also agree to allow your partner to visit the children at the family home or have the children over to their apartment.;
, You should tell your children about the break up with your partner. Having the talk together, with all the members of the family, will ensure your children all hear the same message and show your children that you are both in agreement about the break up. This will make the whole process less confusing and overwhelming for your children.You may decide to tell your children in your family home, seated in an comfortable room in the house. Having the talk in a familiar setting can help your children to better process the break up. It will also give your family the privacy needed for such an important conversation.
You may start the conversation by saying, ""We have something we need to talk to you all about. This is important and will affect everyone. But you should know that no matter what, we are still a family.""

, Focus on telling your children only the minimum amount of information and avoid going into the messy details of the break up. You may say, “Your mother (or father) and I have been finding it difficult to get along. After a lot of thought, we have decided it would be best for us to separate.” Maintain eye contact with your children and speak calmly.You should also consider the ages and level of understanding of each child. Younger children may need more simplistic information to understand what is going on. Older children may be aware of what you are saying and process the information faster.

, It is important that your children know that divorce occurs between adults only and that the divorce or separation is not their fault. You and your partner should both reassure your children of this fact so they understand the divorce has nothing to do with their behavior or actions.You should also let your children know that you love them both very much. You may say, “We want you to understand that the break up is not your fault and that we both love you, no matter what. We will continue to be your parents, regardless of the separation.”, Your children may react by asking questions about practical things, like where they are going to live now or if your partner is going to move out. Allow your children to ask these questions and answer them as best as you can. It is natural for your children to react with questions and you should answer honestly to help them process the news.Questions your children might have include, “Who will live in the house?” “Will I have to move or change schools?” “Can I still see my friends?” and “Can I decide who I live with?” Try to answer your children’s questions with honesty and sensitivity. Be reassuring and clear with your answers so your children can get a better handle on the break up.
You may say to your children, “For now, Mom will live in the house. You will all stay with her and Dad will visit on weekends or you will go visit him on weekends. We will share a lot of the day to day needs until the divorce is finalized.”
You may also comment on a specific event coming up that involves your children, like a birthday party or a tournament. You may say, “We have also decided that Dad will drop you off at Stephanie’s party on Sunday and Mom will pick you up” or “We will both still be at your tournament on Friday to support you.”

, Your children may have a range of reactions to the break up, from shock to anger, to confusion to guilt. Be prepared for your children to have a strong emotional reaction and try to be accommodating to their needs. You may be experiencing intense emotions as well, and being there for your children may help you cope with the break up.If you have younger children, they may react to the break up by regressing to behavior they had previously outgrown, such as wetting the bed or sucking their thumb. Older children can react with a mix of anger, anxiety, and grief. They may also become depressed and withdrawn.

, You can help your children weather the difficulties of the break up by being a good listener and a good parent. Your children may need you to be there to listen to their concerns and anxieties about the break up. Be willing to sit down with them and hear them out.Avoid interrupting your children when they are speaking and display open body language when you are listening. This means maintaining eye contact, keeping your arms relaxed at your sides, and turning your body towards your children as they speak.
You can ask your children questions and reassure them when necessary. Avoid trying to have all the answers to their questions and concerns. If you are not sure how to answer, you can say, “I’m not sure how to answer your question but I do know that I will always be here for you and that I love you. The break up does not change my love for you.”

, You should reach out to other authority figures in your children’s lives and let them know about the separation. These authority figures can then keep an eye on your children when they are in school or not around you. You can get updates about how your children are doing and be notified if there are any concerns about your children’s behavior due to the break up.You may tell these authority figures, “My partner and I recently separated. I’m worried about how it might affect the children. I know this will be a difficult time for them. Do you think you could let me know if there are any issues with the children in the coming weeks or months?”

, Establishing consistent routines and habits with your children will help them to cope with the break up and find comfort in the familiar. Most children feel more secure and safe when they know what to expect, especially during a time of upheaval.You and your partner should agree to a daily routine or schedule and then share this schedule with the children. This way, the children know what to expect day to day and can feel that you are both still reliable.
You should also maintain the same disciplining habits with your children, even if they are going to be in different households due to the separation. You and your partner should maintain the same rules, rewards, and expectations of your children to maintain a sense of stability and consistency. You and your partner should avoid bending or adjusting the established rules for your children, as this could confuse or anger your children.

, Avoid speaking badly about your former partner in front of your children, as this can create more tension and conflict. If you find it difficult to be around your former partner, you should focus on at least being civil and respectful for the sake of the children.Avoid arguing or fighting with your former partner in front of the children, as this will only upset them more. You want to show your children that you and your former partner can still be supportive, functional parents, even if you do not get along with each other.
You should also avoid using your children as messengers or pawns between you and your former partner. This can lead to further emotional issues for your children and create greater tension between everyone in the family.

, If you feel your children are struggling with the break up and you do not have the tools to best support them, you may consider bringing them to a therapist or a counselor. Some children need professional help and support to ensure they can cope well with the break up and develop into healthy adults.You may look for a therapist that specializes in children or a counselor who has experience with children dealing with a separation and divorce.
You may also need counseling or therapy for yourself as you deal with the break up. Getting professional help can allow you to better support your children and be there for them during this difficult time.

, Though you and your former partner have broken up, this does not mean your children will disengage right away from all the former family and friends in their lives. You should try to encourage your children to stay connected to your ex’s family and close friends, as this will give them a sense of stability and comfort.You should allow your children to spend time with old family members and old friends. You should also try to use the same babysitters or child-care that you did before the break up.
Allowing your children to stay connected to the people in their lives before the separation will ensure they have a stable network around them. This can help your children to develop into healthy adults and weather the difficulties of the break up successfully.

, You and your partner will likely come to an agreement on child support during the divorce. Make sure you follow through on your end of the finances and that your partner does as well. This will lead to less conflict between you and ensure your children do not get wrapped up in disputes about money.If you and your partner are having issues with child support payments and/or other financial agreements, you should discuss them alone and in private. Do not bring your children into the discussion or use your children as pawns in the conflict. This will only foster more tension and high emotion.

, You and your former partner should do your best to be good parents to your children, even though you are no longer together. Try to maintain a home environment that is stable and healthy for your children. You should make sure you take care of your own needs and stay healthy so you can be there for your children and offer support.You should maintain a healthy diet and exercise on a consistent basis. You should also take some time to do self care and ensure your needs are being met.
You should also be social and see close friends and family. They can offer you support when you need it and in turn, ensure you are able to support your children.

, You should take your children into consideration if and when you decide to date again. Take it slow and take your time, as you do not want to freak out your children by jumping into a new relationship quickly. If you begin to date seriously, you should talk to your children about where you are at. Let them know that you think you are ready to move on and keep them updated so they feel like they are included.You should also let your children know if and when you decide to live with someone new. These kinds of decisions can upset your children, especially if it is soon after the break up. Discuss them and listen to their thoughts before you move forward.

, You should also look for support systems for you and your children so you all have help you can turn to in times of need. A break up can be challenging for everyone involved and having support systems can help to relieve any stress or anxiety.


You should lean on professional support systems like counselors and therapists. Perhaps you decide to see a therapist one on one and offer therapy to your children as an option.
You can also lean on personal support systems like a close circle of friends or relatives. You may decide to have dinner on your own with friends once a week or set up a family dinner with relatives so your children can feel supported.

Handle the arrival of a new baby carefully.",How to Build a Healthy Relationship with a Stepchild," One of the biggest mistakes that a stepparent can make is to rush in and try to create a family out of all of the moving parts in this puzzle. That whirlwind from dating couple to married couple to family may work in the movies but in real life there are a lot of things to consider.


After all, these are some very serious changes for a child and they can be a little much to take. By letting the child set the pace you honor his emotions which may change from day to day and can be difficult for him to sort out.
Remember, you are not “replacing” a parent. Whether there was a divorce or a death, that child has two parents- and a stepparent. Respect that.;
, The child may still be working through issues related to the end of the marriage- there are all of the stages of grief for him to get through no matter how that marriage ended.


You are a new person- the child is still evaluating how he feels about you. These feelings may change from day to day so there will be good and bad days ahead.
You must be the adult here and accept that it will not always be a perfectly smooth process. By pushing the child, you are telling him that the focus is on you, that his feelings or his real parents do not really matter. Is this really the message you intend to send?

, A young child may be more open to a relationship with you but is also more likely to be confused by the entire situation.


For a young child, remember to minimize upheavals in schedules and routines as much as possible. Again, look to the child for cuing here- ask the child what he likes to do or what he would like to do. maybe he would like to stay with traditions and maybe he would like to try something new. Let him guide you.
Do not put too much thought into being called “mommy” or “daddy” on one day and then something else the next. Young children have been known to call their teachers mommy so, it is a matter of title confusion and not an accurate assessment of their feelings.

, An older child may be more hesitant to connect out of a sense of loyalty to the “other” parent. There may be anger and animosity from the child toward the parent that “left” because in his mind, the family was abandoned. All of these possibilities can hinder the relationship and can make some situations needlessly tense.


For an older child, be aware that you may not know how much or how little real information the child has been given. You also do not know what information the spouse has been letting slip in front of that child.
Do not feel like it is your job to “set things straight” because the truth is, you may not know the whole story about the end of the marriage. Even if you do know the full story you still do not need to “correct” the child’s narrative about it.

, While a divorce can be hard to understand and accept for a child, the death of a parent is even more devastating. It can be hard for a child of any age to allow themselves to have feelings for someone without feeling like they are betraying the memories of the parent they have lost.


There are conflicting emotions at play here and grief counseling may be needed so that the child can process the situation and then start working toward healing.
The need for understanding and reassurance is vitally important here. It is equally important to understand that the child may lash out at their parent because he or she is moving on “too quickly”.
Family counseling may also be beneficial so that a counselor can help the child understand that you are not the enemy or that you did not cause the parent to die.

, As you slowly start building a relationship with the child it might be natural to want to give him affection. Again, look for cues and signs that your child is ready for this or is comfortable in your attempts.


The child may be withholding signs of affection in an attempt to remain loyal to his parent or he may be a less physically demonstrative child. Respect these boundaries.
It is also important to remember that in the case of some divorces parents may still be battling behind the scenes so any affection could be used against you or the parent as a way to discredit you or make you out to be a “bad guy”.

, What a child calls you will depend on preferences and customs as well as what the child is comfortable with.


Do not expect the child to be okay with calling you mommy or daddy right off the bat. You may need to find some type of compromise.
One family used a pet name that the child came up with. Upon being introduced to his stepmother the small boy asked if he could call her “Mimsie”.

, Only the parents are to discipline the child, especially in the early days, according to the experts at the Stepfamily Foundation of Alberta (which provides information about easing the transition with stepchildren).


This is one of the cardinal rules and is without a doubt the one that should be heeded most stringently The goal that you have is to build a relationship with the child and then parental duties can be assigned to you more and more as the relationship builds.
But until that happens, stay out of the punishment business.

, One of the most important things to remember here is that you are all part of a team - part of a family unit. This includes the other spouse so if you cannot work together, there is always going to be a problem.


If you cannot be civil during custody exchanges then excuse yourself from the room or do not go with your spouse when the children are retrieved or returned.
Being an adult means the ability to get past insecurities and jealousies and being able to act like a decent, mature person.

, Do not speak ill of the other spouse when the child is in the house. Even if you think you are speaking privately you may be louder than you think or the child could be snooping.


It may seem unreal to you, but the other parent could ask the child to listen and see what is being said about them. If you have to speak about the other spouse then remain civil and wait for the child to be completely out of the home.
This applies for when you need to speak to your spouse about the child. Do not assume that just because you are behind a closed door that they cannot hear you. They will listen and then go back to report what has been said.

, If you are moving in to the home that the family once occupied you are likely going to hear plenty of comments, especially if you start changing anything around.


This is especially true if you are going to be living in a house where the spouse has passed away and the child will be a full time resident. In this case you might be better off asking the child for input on changes to the home- and expecting less than enthusiastic responses.
Do not underestimate the need for privacy especially for a teenager. If the teen will have a room or space in your home part time, they need to feel confident that no one is touching or looking through their things while they are not there.

, When a couple gets a divorce there is often a question about the family home. The kids may be afraid they will have to move far away from friends and a school they are used to. Staying in the family home is a relief until the parent who is living there finds someone new and that person moves into the space.


Now for the kids there is not only a “stepparent” to deal with, it is a stepparent in the family home. Everything that you do in this home could be seen as critical to the spouse that no longer lives there. You want to paint and that may cause a battle. Taking down a picture or putting up a new one could be seen as a full act of war.
But, being the stepparent in a new home is not necessarily any easier. The child does not have an established space in the new home and may feel like they are not being welcomed into this new home. It is important to help ease the child into the home first and then work on bridging the gap between you second.

, Blending households is never an easy thing- you have your things and they have their things and when you add children into the mix it can get even more confusing and frustrating.


To make space for everything consider having the kids help you to consolidate things and then help you decide what to do with the things that no one needs any longer. Perhaps a family yard sale would be something that you could all do as a group?
You could also take the extra things to be donated to groups that help the needy. Let the child see that you are basically a good person and maybe they will start to believe it for themselves.

, If you are going to be increasing your family it is important that you are open and upfront about this with your stepchildren. It is important for them to know that they are not being pushed out or replaced.


This added stress can change the dynamics of the growing family and may even set you back to square one. All of the ground you had gained with the stepchild may be undone because they have new worries and concerns to deal with.
Try to minimize the disruption that the new baby might cause. Avoid just sticking the baby into the child’s room and do not assume that you can just give him the child’s clothes or toys. This may also cause animosity between your spouse and the former spouse for a number of reasons.
Again, family counseling may be a viable suggestion and should include all members of this extended family including the former spouse.

Honor court orders regarding visitation rights.,
Stay in your child’s life.,
Offer to help out with activities.,
Go to events.,
Avoid making promises you can’t keep.,
Send mail.,
Maintain a routine.,
Discipline your child.",How to Connect to Your Kids when You Don't Have Custody1," If you have been granted visitation rights and have regularly scheduled visits with your children, then make sure that you honor these arrangements. Cooperating and maintaining your visitation rights with your children will help you to stay connected with your kids and it may help you to get increased visitation rights or even custody later on.


If you do not have visitation rights or if you wish to modify the arrangement that you have, then you will need to file a petition with the court.This is especially important if you are not on good terms with the person or persons who have custody of your children.;
, Spend as much time with your child as you can. This may mean a few hours on the weekend, one weekend a month, or weekly visits to their home. It may not always be convenient to you, but that is not important. Your child is important. Make the time to spend time with them when you are able.If you skip planned meetings or don’t spend time with your child, they may feel abandoned.

, One way you can connect with your child is to offer to help with activities and responsibilities. Offer to drive your child to soccer practice, to pick them up from school, or to take them to the dentist. This will help out the guardian and give you some quality time with your child.If you are taking your child to an activity, like sports practice, ask them questions about it. Introduce yourself to the coach and the other parents, stick around to watch the practice, and help out afterwards.

, One great way to connect with your child is to go to all of their school and recreational events. Even if you only see them for a few minutes because they are busy, your child will know you were there for an important moment. This will mean a lot to your child, and it’s a way to show them you care and love them.


For example, go to dance or music recitals, school plays, sports games, awards ceremonies, school family lunches, or school carnivals.

, One of the worst things you can do to your child is to promise something and then not follow through. This makes you seem unreliable and untrustworthy to your child. If you can’t do something, tell them and explain why. Being honest with your child is better than lying and not doing what you said you would.For example, if you can’t come to their dance recital because of work, don’t say you will and then not show up. Instead, say, “I would love to be there, but I have to go out of town on business. Why don’t you ask someone to film it so we can watch it together later?”

, Connect with your children by sending letters or cards in the mail. Even if you can’t see them often, you can let them know you are thinking about them. Plus, everyone loves getting something in the mail, and a surprise card from you will make your child’s day.Send funny cards with pictures of things your child likes, such as monkeys, dogs, or cats.
Keep the letters short. Tell them a quick story and end with a message, such as “I miss you and I love you.”

, You may feel like you can only connect to your child if you do special things. While it’s important to surprise your child with fun activities, trips, and gifts, don’t do this every time you are together. This may seem like you are trying to buy their love instead of connecting. One of the best ways to connect with your child and build a relationship is just to spend time together. Adopt a normal routine that is similar to their routine at home. Make their time with you feel as normal as possible.For example, get your child’s help cooking their favorite meal, then eat it on the couch as you ask your child about their week at school.
Help your child with their homework, and get them into bed at their usual bedtime.
Spend a Saturday playing your child’s favorite board games or go to the park and play sports together.
Talking is a great, easy way to connect with your child. Ask them about their life, and share with them details of your life.

, If your child is spending weekends or extended periods of time with you, you should have a discipline structure in place. If possible, it should be similar to the one followed by their guardian. Coming to your house shouldn’t be the time they can get away with anything.You may think no discipline will help you connect with your child. However, discipline helps gives your child structure. Be firm, fair, and loving when you discipline.

Plan.,
Break tasks down.,
Keep on top of the small things.,
Have a cleaning schedule.,
Clean the kitchen.,
Clean the living room.,
Clean the bathroom.",How to Organize Your Home as a Working Mom," It's best to keep lists of what needs to get done. That way, you'll be sure to remember it. It also gives you a sense of satisfaction to see the number of things-to-do go down as they get crossed out.;
, ""Clean the bathroom"" might seem overwhelming, but the task seems much more manageable when it's presented as ""clean the toilet, wipe the mirror, clean the tub, wash the floor."", After you get home, try to get some simple things done, such as picking up clothes, washing dishes, and putting things in their places. That way, things won't pile up until they seem like impossible tasks., Maybe Monday nights you'll vacuum, Tuesday nights you'll mop the floor, Wednesday nights you'll do the laundry, Thursday nights you'll dust, and Friday nights you'll finish what's left., Everything around the house can be postponed, but a dirty kitchen can really get on your nerves, and makes you feel guilty every time you see the sink full of dirty dishes. So you do the dishes, then clean the counters, then mop the floor if you have time. If not, just put a wet rag on the floor and clean any stains, that way you will cheat your way to a clean kitchen.

, Bring a box and put all the stuff that does not belong in the living room (such as your kids' toys) into that box. Place the cushions of the couch in a tidy way and if you have the time or energy you can vacuum your carpet. You will get yourself a clean living room.

, Nothing feels better like waking up in the morning and going to a clean bathroom, make this your last task for the day. That way you will feel great about yourself giving your house and kids such a shiny clean bathroom, and cheating your way to a clean bathroom is really easy. Start by cleaning the toilet by the brush and toilet cleaner (any kind), then clean the edges of the bathtub and apply some cleanser to the sink while cleaning the bathtub and the toilet. That way, by the time you finish them you do not need to scrub the sink. Put a wet rag under your feet and move it around the floor of the bathroom and that shall make it shine.

"
"
Wake up earlier than usual.,
Shower first thing.,
Set out breakfast cereals and bowls etc.,
Get the children to make their own lunches as soon as they are able.,
Take time out.,
Arrange to get out of the house minus the kids.,
Enforce bedtimes with the kids.,
Try something new.,
Get the kids enthused in your enjoyable activities.",How to Make Time for You (for Moms)," Take 15 minutes to half an hour extra waking time that will be ""you"" time. Naturally, this needs to be before the kids wake up. Take a quick walk outdoors and start the day taking in the early morning sights, smells and sounds. Or, do some yoga or floor stretches. If you like to write, maybe this is the time to pen a few words before the day begins. Or just enjoy your coffee and the morning paper before the noise and chaos descends.;
, Without fail, have that shower, no matter what the kids are doing. If you have very young children and you have nobody else to watch over them, bring them into the bathroom with some toys to occupy them and take a quick shower. The important thing is to be dressed, fresh and ready at the start of the day to ensure that you have a confident beginning. There is nothing more demoralizing than taking a shower at noon or 6pm...

, the night before. Once the kids are old enough to feed themselves, expect this of them. And also expect them to put all the dirty dishes in the sink. The time that you save here will be time you can spend attending to your makeup, to following up a phone call, to getting rid of some other chore that can then free you up later.

, Children are naturally curious - capitalize on this to teach them food preparation as early as possible. Even a four year old can slap a piece of pre-cut cheese between two pieces of bread and call it a sandwich. Do not fall into the trap of always doing things for your children that they can learn to do themselves. A great idea for school mornings is to start a production line for lunches that includes the kids. Vary their tasks dependent on their ages but always make sure that each one is participating to some extent. It does speed up the process and it creates a sense of personal responsibility in the children for what they eat. Children under school age can still participate by helping their older siblings or you.

, We give kids time-outs a lot. We should also give ourselves time-outs, only for us this is a blessing, not a form of chastisement! And the earlier that you teach your kids that a 20 minute nap or book read for mommy is sacrosanct time, the better. Younger children will not understand this at first but as the children age, they will learn that mommy has boundaries, as do most people in life. It isn't a harsh lesson - it's a realistic one.

, Not every outing in your life needs to be one accompanied by the kids, no matter how young or old they are. At least once a month you should arrange with your partner, a friend or a trusted neighbor for a block of time of at least 3 hours duration to babysit the children. Sadly yes, some husbands do have to be asked to ""babysit"" but just accept that with grace - you can retrain his thinking in the process once he gets used to the reality. Use this special time wisely and not for bill-paying or grocery shopping. Have a spa treatment, a hairdressing visit, a museum or art gallery tour or just lie under the sun in the local park with a book. The point is to do something that pampers you - heart and soul and for you to do it without guilt.

, Kids are very good at wheedling their way around bedtimes. Be strict on this because the more time they stay up, the more of this time is your time that they are eating into. As a compromise, let them have more leeway on some nights, such as a Friday or a Saturday, when there are no pressing commitments to meet the next day, such as school or sports practice.

, When life feels like it is getting into a rut, it is merely an indication that you are ready to move into a new phase. To do this, you will need to explore new options for hobbies and maybe even studying. Start small - attend a local lecture or exhibition on subjects you've never considered before

, The sooner that your kids enjoy hobbies and activities with you, the sooner it will feel like ""time for you"". Sometimes it is all about re-imagining ""me time"" and including the kids in activities you enjoy so that you do not lose the activity but you can still involve the kids. Get out into the garden with them - give them the hose while you plant the flowers. Give the kids a pile of coloring books while you lie back and read for 20 minutes. Give the kids a pull-along in a wagon while you take your daily walk.

Learn about your child.,
Ask open-ended questions.,
Keep in touch.,
Share memories.,
Be interested in what they like.",How to Connect to Your Kids when You Don't Have Custody2," Your child is constantly growing and changing. Make it a priority to learn about them. Ask them the name of their teacher, coaches, babysitters, and other people in their lives. Find out the names of their friends and crushes. Listen when they talk, remember details, and bring them up again later.Listening to your child can help you determine their likes and what interests have changed.
Find out what they like about school and what they struggle with.
Keep up with extracurricular activities your child is involved in.

, Children don’t always have the same conversation skills as adults. They may not feel comfortable elaborating when asked a question. When talking to your child, try to ask open-ended questions that will encourage your child to talk instead of ones that can be answered in one or two words.For example, ask, “What did you do at school today?,” “What did you enjoy about dance class today?,” or “Why do you like that movie the best?”
Ask follow-up questions when your child answers briefly.

, Just because you are not seeing your child in person doesn’t mean you can’t connect to them. Technology has made it easy to stay in touch with people. You can call your child, text them throughout the week, send pictures to each other, Skype, or even e-mail.Sending a text midway through the week letting your child know you’re thinking about them and love them is an easy way to connect them.
Call them in the evening to ask how they did on the test they mentioned over the weekend, or ask them how the project they told you about turned out.

, Letting your children know about your past can help you two connect. Tell them about interests you had when you were younger, things you did in school, or successes and failures you had. Tell them stories about their grandparents, great-grandparents, and aunts and uncles. This gives them a piece of their past and family they never had, and helps you two connect.Share good memories of their other parent, even if you two are no longer together or don’t get along.
Show them pictures, yearbooks, and mementos from your past.

, Show your child that you are interested in them by sharing that interest. It doesn’t matter if you like it or not. Your child may be young and love a kid’s television show or be obsessed with dolls. The goal is to connect to your child by showing interest in things they are interested in.If they like a television show, watch it with them. If they like a sports team, watch the games with them. Listen to their favorite band with them in the car, or read their favorite book and discuss it afterwards.

Put your child first.,
Avoid fighting with the guardian.,
Accept the guardian’s terms.,
Explain your desire to see your child.,
Go to counseling.,
Realize the child may miss their guardian.,
Avoid getting jealous of the guardian.,
Don’t give up.",How to Connect to Your Kids when You Don't Have Custody3," You should have a conversation with the child’s guardian where you tell them that you want a relationship with your child. Explain why you should be a part of your child’s life. Tell the guardian that your child should be the top priority for both of you, and a child needs their parent in their life.If you have had problems in the past, such as substance abuse, criminal troubles, or other problems, let the guardian know how you have stopped these destructive behaviors or the steps you have taken to get help.

, One way to make sure you connect to your child when you don’t have custody is to stay on good terms with their guardian. Try not to fight with the guardian, or talk badly about them in front of your child. Remember, your first goal is always your child. Try to put away your hard feelings for the sake of your child.Your ex might have custody of your child, or it might be a family member or someone else. No matter how you feel or how angry you get, try to keep that anger in check. Getting angry, yelling, and putting your frustration towards the guardian may make it so you can’t see your child.
Depending on your past behavior, you may have to prove yourself to the guardian or demonstrate that you are responsible. Don’t get angry if this happens. Remember, they have your child’s best interest in mind.

, Your child’s guardian may place certain restrictions on the time you can spend with your child. Though this may upset you, there is nothing you can do about it. The child’s guardian has custody, so they get to dictate what happens to the child. Try to accept the terms the guardian puts on the time you spend with your child.


Remember, the important thing is not to fight with the guardian, but to spend time with your child.
By accepting the guardian’s terms gracefully, you may show them that you are trustworthy enough to eventually spend more time with the child.

, Let the guardian know how much you want to see your child. If they have severely limited the amount of time, ask for more time. Offer to come to their house. Tell the guardian that you want to connect to your child and be a part of their life.Make sure that you request instead of demand. By saying things like, “What if I…” or “Could we…”, you can avoid unnecessary conflicts.
Remind the guardian how important it is for the child to have their parents in their life. Your child needs you, even if you don’t have custody.
Make sure your actions reflect your words. Don’t give the guardian any reason not to let you see your child, like not showing up for scheduled time or participating in destructive behavior.

, If you and your child’s guardian cannot resolve your differences and come to any acceptable terms, you should suggest going to counseling. A professional might be able to help you with conflict resolution and figure out a solution that is good for everyone involved.You can try to find a family counselor or ask your lawyer for suggestions about mediation help.

, When you are spending time with your child, they may miss or have a hard time being away from their guardian. If they miss their other parent, or have trouble going to sleep without saying goodnight to their guardian, don’t get upset or offended. Instead, support your child and empathize with them. This can help a stronger bond grow between the two of you.Children sometimes have trouble adjusting to change or a disruption of their routine. If they are spending the weekend at your house once a month, they may love spending time with you but still miss their home.
Telling your child you understand their feelings and that it’s okay to feel that way can help you connect to your child. Getting jealous or angry may push them away.

, Often, one parent may feel jealous or threatened if the child loves or enjoys being with their guardian. This may be the other parent, a stepparent, or someone else. Be happy that your child has good relationships with their guardians and you. Encourage them to talk about their experiences with their guardian. This will help you connect with your child because they will feel like they can share things with you.Your child will also find comfort in the fact that you are happy about things they are happy about.
Getting mad because they like their guardian can make your child feel confused or guilty. It may damage your relationship with them.

, If you are having trouble getting access to see your child, don’t give up. Keep the goal of being part of your child’s life in your mind. Continue trying to talk to the guardians and proving why you should be part of your child’s life. It may take years, but staying committed to your child can pay off at the end."

Prepare the formula or milk in advance.,
Avoid pouring the milk from high above the bottle.,
Avoid shaking the bottle.,
Allow the bottle time to stand before you give in to your baby.,
Consider using drops that will reduce the amount of air bubbles that form in your formula.,
Use bottles that can only contain enough milk for one whole feeding.",How to Keep Air Out of Your Baby's Bottle1," Mix the milk or formula in a separate bowl or cup. When you prepare the formula in the bottle, there is an increased chance that air bubbles will form.


Make sure to stir the formula slowly so that you minimize the number of air bubbles that form.;
, Instead, get the bowl or cup as close to the lip of the bottle as possible, and slowly pour the formula into the bottle. If you pour the formula out of the cup and into the bottle from a great height, the formula will hit the bottom of the bottle and form bubbles.


Pouring the formula slowly also helps to make sure that the liquid does not trap air as it gets poured into the bottle.

, If you must prepare the formula in the bottle, stir the formula rather than shaking the bottle. When you shake the bottle, or handle the bottle roughly, air bubbles are more likely to form.


Stir the formula with a wooden stick or knife to make sure that it is mixed in well.

, Try to prepare the formula at least five to ten minutes before your baby’s normal feeding time. Letting the bottle sit once you have poured the formula into it will help any lingering bubbles to settle and disperse.Preparing your baby’s formula ahead of time will keep you from rushing through the preparation process. When you rush, you are more likely to stir the formula quickly, which causes bubbles to form.

, Talk to your pediatrician about what products you should use and how many drops you should add to the bottle. In addition to this, it is always important to read the instructions that come with the drops.


“Mylicon” drops are commonly used for this purpose.These drops contain simethicone, an ingredient that helps the breakdown of gases and air bubbles, and is not harmful for babies.
“Tummy calm” is a homeopathic medicine that prevents gases with the help of natural ingredients like chamomile, thuja, and silicea., If you are able to fill the bottle up all the way, there will be less room for air bubbles to form.

Talk to your doctor or midwife.,
Educate yourself on baby milestones.,
Take classes at the hospital.,
Weigh the pros and cons of breastfeeding.,
Find a lactation consultant.",How to Learn About Babies2," Your obstetrician, pediatrician, or midwife can offer valuable insight into the first months of your baby’s life. During the second or third trimester, you may want to have a serious talk with them regarding the care of your baby during their first months. Some questions you can ask include:


What should I expect in the first hour after the baby is born? First week? First month?
When should I feed the baby? How do I know when the baby has had enough to eat?
How long do babies sleep for?
How will I know if there is a problem with my baby?
What if my baby has colic? What do I do?
Is co-sleeping safe?

, While every baby develops at their own pace, there are some general guidelines for what the baby should be doing at certain ages. These are called milestones. Knowing the milestones can help you understand how the baby is developing as well as what kind of behavior is normal for their age.Three months: Lifting head, making eye contact, opening and closing their hand, smiling.

Four to six months: reaching for and holding objects, babbling, beginning to sit upright.

Seven to twelve months: crawling, picking up objects with the thumb and forefinger, pointing, communicating with hand signals.

Nine to Sixteen months: walking, talking.

, Most hospitals with a maternity ward offer classes to teach parents the basics of caring for a baby. These skills can include how to stop a baby from crying, how to breastfeed properly, how to swaddle your baby, and how to check their temperature.When you are registering with the hospital for your birth, ask them what classes are available. They will be able to give you more information about registering and taking classes.


It is best to take these classes before you have your baby. After your baby is born, you will be very busy caring for your baby, so it is important to learn about how to care for your baby before your baby is born.

, When learning about your baby-to-be, one decision you will have to make is whether or not you will breastfeed. There are many reasons why people decide to both breastfeed and bottle feed, and you will want to make the best decision for your baby and lifestyle.



Breastfeeding offers a free form of food to your baby. Breastmilk has important vitamins for your baby as well as antibodies that ward off disease. Breastfeeding can reduce the risk of SIDS and improve eye and brain development in babies.There is also a reduced risk for ovarian and breast cancers in women who breastfeed. Breastfeeding is also better for the environment, since it reduces or eliminates the need for packaging.Bottle feeding allows your baby to be fed without having to pump milk. It may be convenient for some working mothers as a family member or friend can feed the baby while they are at work. Bottle feeding is also a good option for babies who have trouble latching onto the breast or for mothers on certain types of medication., If you choose to breastfeed, you may want to seek the advice of a lactation consultant. A lactation consultant can help teach you how to feed your baby, encourage baby weight gain, and store breastmilk. They can also help you any breastfeeding problems, such as painful nursing or latching issues.You can find a lactation consultant at hospitals, or you can find one through the International Lactation Consultant Association.Your doctor may also be able to refer you to one.
La Leche League is a good resource for up to date articles and other information about breastfeeding."

Spend time with friends or relatives with babies.,
Look up strategies to stop babies from crying.,
Practice swaddling and changing diapers.,
Learn when to call the doctor.,
Reduce the risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).",How to Learn About Babies3," A good way to learn about babies is to spend some time with one. If you know someone who has a baby, you can ask them to teach you how to care for them. This supervised visit will show you how to treat babies while letting you play with one at the same time. You might ask your friend or relative to teach you:


How to properly hold a baby.
How to give a baby a bottle.
How to play with babies.

, Babies cry for a number of reasons. They might have a wet diaper, or they may be hungry. While you should always try to satisfy the baby’s needs, sometimes it may seem as though the baby is crying for no reason. There are a few tricks you can try:


Swaddle the baby.
Hold the baby.
Give the baby a pacifier.
Make a shushing noise or use a white noise machine.You can ask other parents for their favorite tips or consult a baby care guide.

, Diapers are an essential part of baby care. If the baby is a newborn, you may even have to swaddle the baby. You can practice both skills on a doll before you have to change a real baby.


To swaddle, form a blanket in a diamond shape. Fold the top corner down to form a triangle, and lay the doll so that its shoulders are lined with the flat edge. Take one top corner, and bring it across the doll’s body to tuck under it. Take the bottom corner, and tuck it into the first tuck. With the last corner, bring it across the body, and tuck it in near the neck. Do not ever cover the baby’s face while swaddling.To change a diaper, remove the old diaper. Wipe off the doll with a baby wipe. Slide the diaper through the baby’s legs. Pull the diaper’s tape over the front of the diaper to secure it., While infants can become sick quickly, not every sniffle is an emergency. Knowing when to call the doctor is an important skill to develop. It can also help give you peace of mind when you are caring for the baby. Some things you might want to look out for include:


Red or bleeding umbilical cord area.
Change in appetite, such as refusing to eat for several feedings in a row.
Diarrhea.
Rash.
Eye discharge.
Instead of dribbling spit-up from their mouth, the baby may project vomit.
For babies younger than three months, call the doctor for any fever. For babies older than three months, call the doctor for a fever above 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius)., SIDS is a rare occurrence when a baby passes away with no explainable reason. While the causes are uncertain, there are certain things you can do to reduce the risk of SIDS. These include:


Place the baby on their back to sleep.
Do not smoke or let others smoke around the baby.
Check the baby to make sure they are not too hot or too cold while sleeping. If they are sweating or hot to the touch, remove some blankets.
Tuck in the blanket below their body. Make sure that the blanket is no higher than their shoulders. There should be no bedding or bedclothes on the baby’s head while they sleep."
"
Keep your baby’s head elevated.,
Position the bottle correctly.,
Check to see how well the milk is flowing.,
Check to make sure that the ring at the neck of the bottle is properly tightened.",How to Keep Air Out of Your Baby's Bottle2," Hold your baby so that she is in a half lying position, with her head slightly elevated. This position will help your baby to swallow and breathe, while gravity will help to bring the milk or formula down into your baby’s tummy., Hold the bottle so that it is in a horizontal position, parallel to the floor. Tilt the bottle when you feed your baby, so that the milk fills the entire nipple, and there is no room left for air.Generally, you want to aim for a 45 degree angle, but this will change depending on how much milk is in the bottle.

, If the milk flows continuously, your baby will be less likely to swallow air. To check to see how the milk is flowing:


Fill the bottle up with milk or water. Turn the bottle upside down. The flow should be approximately one drop of liquid every second.
You should get a new bottle if the liquid stops and starts flowing constantly. This will cause your baby to struggle to suck out the liquid.
If the liquid flows without stop out of the bottle, there is a chance that your baby will not be able to catch her breath. This is also a problem.

, The ring will allow air circulation into the bottle, to make it easier for your child to suck out the milk or formula. If your child is having a hard time getting milk, but the nipple appears to be working well, check to see that the ring is tightened on to the bottle properly.The ring may need to be loosened a little bit in order to allow your baby to suck out the milk.
The ring is tight enough when you can see a large bubble forming every time your baby takes a drink. If it is not on properly, you will see a bunch of bubbles form as soon as your baby stops trying to suck the milk out of the bottle.

"
"
Use angled bottles.,
Try a bottle with a one-way valve.,
Try a bottle that has a straw vent.",How to Keep Air Out of Your Baby's Bottle3," An angled or sloped bottle helps to keep the milk at the top of the bottle, where the nipple is, even when your baby moves the bottle around. This keeps the nipple full at all times.

, These bottles are specially designed so that air cannot reach the milk. The nipple is separated from the bottle by a one-way valve.


Use a bottle with a valve at the top. This valve allows just enough air to enter the bottle so that your baby can drink easily, without consuming any air bubbles.

, In this case, the straw is not actually used for drinking. Instead, the straw acts like a vent, so it makes it easier for your baby to drink out of the bottle without drinking any air bubbles.

Take initiative.,
Ask open-ended questions to find common ground.,
Go where moms are.,
Hang later after practice and events.,
Join an organization or volunteer.",How to Make Mom Friends1," Introduce yourself. You can’t expect to fill your social calendar with gatherings if you’re being a wallflower. Keep in mind that other moms are just as busy juggling a million tasks as you. If you don’t put in the effort, she may not think you’re interested in forming a bond.


As hard as it is sometimes, making new friends requires stepping out of your comfort zone. When you notice someone with mutual interests, take the chance and get acquainted. You can say, “Hi! I noticed you were reading Gillian Flynn…I love Gone Girl! I’m Crystal, by the way. What’s your name?”Many mothers also want to make friends with other moms. Remember that others are in the same position as you, and they may appreciate having someone reach out to them.;
, Once introductions have been made it, it can seem challenging to keep the conversation going. The trick to doing this is in the type of questions you ask. People enjoy talking about themselves. Moms, in particular, like talking about their children. So, ask an open-ended question that stimulates conversation.Open-ended questions are those that require more than one- or two-word answers. They force the responder to provide more detail and clarifying information.For example, you could ask, “You’re not from here, are you?” and receive a one-word reply of “no.” Or, you could ask, “I haven’t see you in this area before. What brings you to Pleasant Springs?” The other mom has to share more information, which gives you more possible paths to keep the conversation going.

, Being frustrated with not having any other mom friends is one thing, but you can’t really expect to connect with local moms if you’re hanging out with child-free singles or couples. Find out where the moms in your area congregate and become a familiar face in the crowd. When you see the same face more frequently, you’re more likely to build up the confidence to strike up a conversation.


Join a pottery or spin class. Visit the park. Get a membership at the gym that offers “Mommy and Me” classes. Just put yourself out there.Then, take the opportunity to introduce yourself to some of the faces you see there often.

, Rushing off after your child’s ballet class to deal with laundry or pick up groceries may help you get through your to-do list faster, but it could also block your friendship-making abilities. When you pick your kid up from soccer practice, linger for a bit to chat with the coach, kids, and other moms.


For instance, you might ask the coach “Can I help put away the supplies?” This simple 10-minute task might position you to overhear a group of other moms planning a play-date or organizing a fundraiser. Initiate conversation with a polite “Oh, a play-date sounds fun!” and you’ll likely be welcomed into the fold. , You can expose yourself to more potential mom friends by getting more involved at your children's schools or in community youth organizations. Becoming a member of the local PTA, offering to be room mom at your daughter's preschool, or helping your son's softball team on weekends are all great ways to meet other moms.


If you work full-time, choose one activity that appeals to you the most instead of trying out multiple groups. If it doesn't work out, you can try something else later.

Have more fun.",How to Ease the Stress of Motherhood," Modern mothers are told they can have everything and can often feel bad about themselves if they begin to feel stressed or overwhelmed.


Remember that stress is a natural alarm system built into your body. Feeling stressed as a mother does not mean you are failing. It is normal. According to MSN, 70 percent of American moms report finding motherhood stressful.;
,


Ask for help when you need it. Call family members, friends and others who might be willing to help out with childcare, errands or other duties when you need a break.
Talk out your feelings with the people closest to you. Explaining how you feel will invite compassion and help. Discussing your stress is a good way to manage it.

, Find reliable caregivers who can take care of your kids while you engage in activities that you find relaxing.


Go on dates with your spouse or partner. A little romantic alone time will help ease the stress you feel as a mother. It will allow you to focus on your relationship.
Do something that you enjoy. Take a class, do a little shopping or relax in a cafe with a cup of coffee and a good book.

, Having too much on your plate will continue to motherhood stress.


Let your kids choose 1 activity that is important to them. When your kids are over scheduled, it means you are doing a lot of driving, volunteering and other things that can contribute to stress.
Look for flexibility if you work outside of the home. Adjust your schedule to keep yourself from getting stressed. Explore flex time, work from home options and other opportunities your employer might offer to provide a little more work/life balance.

,


Take every parenting ""study"" or piece of advice with appreciation for the knowledge and a little bit of skepticism. Mothers are constantly being told that they are over protective, not protective enough, too involved in their kids' lives or not involved enough.
Develop your own style of parenting. Different processes work for different families. Find what works and stick with it regardless of what the latest parenting trend reveals or recommends.

,


Exercise regularly and eat a well-balanced diet. Keeping yourself physically healthy will allow you to better manage the symptoms of stress.

, When you are doing what you can to manage your stress but it still seems overwhelming, get help from a professional or other moms.


Develop and nurture relationships with other moms who are also feeling stressed. Support groups are available in most local communities and online.

, Make time for family outings, laughter and anything else that makes you feel good.

Then, select a bedtime that allows your child to get an adequate amount of sleep each night.Toddlers need 9.5 to 11.5 hours of sleep each night. They also need about 1.5 to 3.5 hours of sleep during the day.Children between the ages of three and five need about 13 hours of sleep each night. A child will also begin to nap less during this age.
Children between the ages of five and 12 should not sleep during the day. You should make sure they get 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Teenagers should also not nap during the day. A teenager should get between 8.5 and 9.5 hours of sleep a night.;
, Bright lights can disrupt the natural circadian rhythm. This rhythm acts as your internal clock. It regulates your physiological process that tells your body when to sleep, eat, and awake. Instead of adapting to regular day/night schedules, our brains end up stimulated all the time in the presence of artificial light. To encourage a child to begin winding down, dim the lights as bedtime approaches.After sunset, dim the lights in your home. This may help children begin to feel sleepy as their bedtime approaches.
Avoid turning on bright lights in your child's room. If you do a bedtime ritual in your child's room, like reading them a book, do so with the lights dimmed.

, Children, like adults, feel stress throughout the day. School and a social life can leave a child feeling wound up by bedtime. Find a relaxing bedtime ritual that will help your child settle down in preparation for sleep.Pick a ritual that encourages relaxation. Watching television or doing something physical will only stimulate your child.
Instead, focus on low key activities. Play soothing music. Read your child a book. Have your child take a warm bath.

, If your child is hungry, they may struggle to sleep. Providing them with a snack can help, but make sure it's something healthy. Something sugary or high in fat can leave a child jittery or not feeling well. A healthy snack will prevent hunger without disrupting sleep.Healthy proteins and carbs tend to help a child sleep. Try giving your child a bowl of oatmeal with milk or a piece of whole wheat toast with peanut butter.
Bananas, poultry, eggs, cheese, and tuna can also help with sleep.

, A cozy bedroom is important for sleep. If your child is uncomfortable in their bedroom, they're unlikely to nod off easily. Make any adjustments necessary to provide your child with a good sleeping environment.Make sure all sleeping materials are comfortable. If a child finds their pajamas or sheets itchy, too soft, or too rough, they may struggle to sleep. Replace any materials a child dislikes.
Make sure no noises, lights, or sounds can disrupt a child's sleep. Keep the door closed to keep out outside sounds. Make sure the blinds block any lights from the street. Avoid cooking anything with strong smells after a child is put to bed, as this could wake them up.

, You want to make sure your child understands they need to sleep. Be firm about your bedtime rules. Each night, remind a child when bedtime is getting close. If a child wanders out of bed after bedtime, calmly redirect them to their room.Routine can help sleep. A child's natural circadian rhythm will adjust to a regular sleep/wake cycle. Make sure your child goes to sleep and wakes up at roughly the same times each day., Monitoring daytime foods can also help with sleep disturbances. Caffeinated beverages and caffeine-rich foods should be avoided at least four hours prior to bedtime.Stimulating food and drinks before bed can make a child jittery and interfere with sleep. During the evening hours, avoid foods with sugar and caffeine.If a child is thirsty before bed, give them water instead of juice or soda.
Read nutritional labels. A lot of unexpected foods have added sugar. You may find there is a lot of sugar in things like canned pasta sauce and bread.

, A child's bed should only be used for sleeping. This way, a child's brain will associated the bed with rest. This can help your child fall asleep faster; therefore, keep toys out of the bed.Make sure your child does not play in their bed. When they play in their room, have them do so outside of their bed.
If your child gets anxious sleeping alone, it's okay to provide a transitional object. Your child can, say, take one toy or blanket to bed with them. Make sure the child only cuddles this object and does not try to play with it.

, The light from electronic screens, like a TV, phone, or tablet screen, can stimulate brain activity. Make sure to power down these devices before bed.You should also keep devices such as alarm clocks and baby monitors at least three feet from your child's bed.

, After the age of five, your child should not be napping during the day. Discourage naps after this age; however, if your child still needs a nap, make sure to plan nap time in a way that won't interfere with sleep. If your child needs a daytime nap, make sure they take it before 4 pm. Napping later than this can cause difficulty falling asleep., Hours awake are equally important as hours of sleep. Maintaining a consistent awake time helps to establish a good awake and sleep schedule.

, You want your child to associate sleep with relaxation. If you use sleep as a way to punish a child, they will develop feelings of stress associated with bedtime. This can easily interfere with sleep.When your child is misbehaving, refrain from threatening to send them to bed.
Bedtime should be something a child comes to look forward to. Instead of threatening bedtime as a punishment, teach your child to associate pleasant, relaxing activities with going to sleep.

, Many children are nervous about going to sleep alone. You want your child to develop independence when sleeping, but you have to ease your child into this gradually. A child who is afraid of the dark or generally anxious will benefit from a night light.Make sure the night light is dim. Get a night light specifically designed to encourage sleep instead of doing something like leaving the closet light on.
It can also help to let your child sleep with a favorite toy or blanket.

, Many children cannot sleep due to stress. Make sure to talk to your child each day and encourage them to open up about the stress in their lives. Allowing your child to talk, and then providing reassurance, can reduce stress and then help with sleep.Always ask your child about their life. Ask how things are going at school, with their friends, and about other aspects of their life.

, If your child seems to have a lot of anxiety that prevents sleep, therapy may help. If you're struggling to fix sleep problems on your own, make an appointment with a child therapist to address the issue.Look for a therapist that specializes in sleep issues.
Cognitive behavioral therapy, which teaches children to adjust negative thought and behavioral patterns, may be particularly beneficial for sleep problems.

, A variety of medical conditions can inhibit sleep. Things like allergies, a stuffy nose, skin problems, and other aches and pains can interfere with sleep. If your child chronically complains about physical ailments that affect their sleep, make an appointment with their pediatrician to address the issue.Go over any medications your child is taking with your doctor. Some medications may affect sleep.

Follow up.",How to Interact With Your New In Laws," Take some time to identify your personal limits to help you better engage with your in-laws. Think about types of situations tend to stress you out and what makes you feel uncomfortable.For example, do you get stressed when you have been around people for too long? Do you feel uncomfortable in large group settings? Are there certain topics you prefer to avoid?
Make a list of your social limitations and boundaries so that you can express these needs to your in-laws.;
, If you know what your boundaries are, then you can set boundaries by expressing your needs to others in an assertive way. Tell your in-laws about your boundaries in an assertive way and reinforce those boundaries as needed.For example, you might say, “I prefer to spend time in small groups. Being in a large group of people overwhelms me.” Or, “I am not a fan of camping.”
If your in-laws press you on your boundaries, then you can give a firm reminder by saying something like, “Remember when I mentioned that I don’t like large groups? This is the type of situation I was talking about.” Or, “No, I would prefer not to go camping for our family vacation.”
When setting boundaries, be sure to set them together with your spouse. Setting boundaries in this manner will help emphasize clearly what your needs are, which is further enhanced when your spouse is helping to back up these requests.

, Politeness is paramount when interacting with your future in-laws. Let them see what a nice person you are by behaving politely when you are around them. If you don’t demonstrate manners from the beginning, your relationship with your in-laws could be off to a rocky start.Generally, whatever you learned in kindergarten is a good rule to follow: share the speaking floor, say “please” and “thank you,” and be respectful.

, Compliments automatically make people feel more comfortable and can often be an excellent launching pad for conversation. Show your respect for your in-laws by letting them know that you appreciate them.Tell your fiancé’s mom how much you like her shoes or her home. Or better yet, compliment her on the amazing child she raised, the person with whom you can’t wait to spend your life.
But be careful not to overdo it. You don’t want to look like you are trying to suck up to them.
Focus on your in-law’s strengths. Remember that no-one is perfect, even you, and it is always in your best interest not to focus on the negatives. Accept your in-laws for who they are and any differences that may exist. They have accepted you into their family, and you should just as well accept them into yours. Always do your best to look for positive attributes.

, Drinking is a common bonding activity, especially when meeting new people, because it helps take the edge off of your nerves. But overdoing it can have disastrous effects. Don’t let your drinking get out of hand when initially meeting your in-laws (or throughout the entire wedding process). If everyone is having a cocktail, slowly sip one graciously, and leave it at that.Overconsumption of alcohol can lead to bad behavior, inappropriate remarks, and embarrassing conduct that you can’t take back. You want to be married forever, not leave a bad impression forever.

, This is a great opportunity to ask questions about your in-law's family history, traditions, or specific values. Not only will you seem considerate for caring, but you’ll gain some interesting insight into the person you’re marrying and be able to incorporate your fiancé’s family legacy into the wedding.Ask about how your in-laws met and where they grew up. Ask about what your fiancé was like as a child.
Try saying something like, “I’d really enjoy hearing about how the two of you met. Would you mind telling me the story?”
Or you could ask, “What kinds of things did Julie enjoy doing as a child?”

, In your first meeting with your new family, don’t ramble on about your deep connection to some ancient and eccentric spiritual belief. By avoiding hot topics like religion and politics, the conversation will keep the mood light. That’s not to say you should hide who you are, but reserve those more comprehensive conversation topics for a more appropriate time later on down the road.If possible, avoid talking about religious beliefs, political stances, or any other possibly controversial subject.
Try bringing up a safe topic of conversation by saying something like, “I really enjoyed this movie I saw last weekend. Have you guys seen it yet?”
Or you could try talking about shared interests by saying something like, “We went camping at in the mountains last week. Do you have any favorite places to go camping nearby?”

, Fill your family in on some interesting facts about your future family. Things such as occupation, favorite hobbies, and general likes and dislikes are a good place to start. If you provide your family with some specific insights, they will be more equipped with conversation clues.Try talking about favorite sports teams or television shows.
Make sure to introduce everyone as well so there are no awkward moments.

, Part of building a lasting relationship with any person hinges on actually spending time with one another and engaging in a meaningful way. In order to create a positive relationship with your new in-laws, you should try to spend some quality time with them.Invite your in laws over for dinner or go away for a weekend vacation with them. Try any activities that force you together with your in-laws in situations where you can talk and get to know each other better.
Identify social and/or recreational activities that both you, your spouse, and in-laws will enjoy. Partaking in an activity that one person may not enjoy may lead to a stressful gathering. Try to be creative and coordinate activities that will encourage you all to get to know one another, especially if this is a new relationship.

, When you engage with your new in-laws, it’s important to try to establish your own relationship with each of them. Don’t just rely on your partner’s closeness with them to be sufficient for the both of you.Take some time to get to know your in-laws on a personal, individual level. Invite your father-in-law out for a drink or a friendly game of golf. Offer to help your mother-in-law with some yard work or take her out for coffee.
Ask your in-laws how they would prefer to be addressed by you. Depending on their cultural family norms, some may prefer that you address them as “mom” and “dad,” while others may be more formal. Identifying what they prefer, will help everyone feel more comfortable with one another. Realize that even if your in-laws prefer a more formal approach, this may change over time.

, Now that you’ve aced meeting your in-laws, it’s time for both families to get acquainted. If that means introducing your liberal, outspoken New York parents to your fiancé’s conservative, reserved Nebraska parents, so be it. Ensuring that the meeting is effortless means following all of the above rules, which continue to apply throughout your entire wedding process.Try to pick a comfortable setting for the meeting like dinner at casual restaurant or lunch at your place. Make sure the location is quiet enough for everyone to be able to converse easily.

, Try to find things that you share in common with your new in-laws – like favorite activities or travel destinations. And help your families discover commonalities, too. It’s part of your job to facilitate conversations and to make sure that everyone is communicating.If you know both your dad and your fiancé’s dad love to fish, say something like: “Hey, Dad, Mr. Johnson just got back from a deep-sea fishing trip in the Gulf of Mexico.”
Or tell your sister who is interested in attending Yale that your fiancé’s brother just graduated from there and go ahead and introduce them.

, After the initial meeting, send a thank you email to everyone and attach a picture or two. By doing this, you will open up new lines of communication, giving everyone a chance to say anything they may not have had a chance to say. This will help to keep the conversation flowing and ensure the next meeting goes just as smoothly. By tying up loose ends, you’ll feel more comfortable tying the knot.You want your in-laws to be happy to see you again and that you’re joining their family.

Letting your spouse know in advance that you want to have a serious talk will keep them from feeling blindsided when you do sit down to talk.Don't avoid the talk for too long, as doing so builds resentment.
In addition, if you want too long, your stress could come out as you snapping at your spouse because they're the person you can take it out on.;
, You want your mother-in-law to move out, and you need to be upfront about that. Remember, though, your spouse may not want to hear it, especially if they enjoy having their mother around.You could say, ""I love your mother, I do. I think it's time that we have our own space, though. I think it's time to ask your mother to move out.""
Don't forget to give your partner some breathing room before launching into why.

, Make a list of everything extra you do because your mother-in-law is in the house. This step isn't to be petty. It's to show your spouse that it really is taxing for his or her mother to be there. Your spouse may not even realize how much of a burden it is putting on you.You don't want to blame your spouse for the extra work. Rather, you just want to bring his or her attention to it.
For example, you don't want to say, ""Your mother is so much work!""
Rather, you might say, ""I'm working longer hours with her in the house. I love her, and I like doing things for her. However, there's only so much of me to go around. You may not realize how much extra I do because she's here, so here are some of the things I do for her.""

, You also need to discuss what stress she brings to the household. It could be intentional stress, such as her criticizing your choices, or could be non-intentional, such as her constant presence putting a damper on your sex life.Once again, try to bring it up in such a way that you're not blaming your spouse for it. Try using ""I"" statements instead of ""You"" statements.
As an example, you could say, ""I enjoy spending time with your mother. Sometimes, though, it puts stress on us as a family. It makes me upset when she criticizes the children, and we don't get to be intimate as often as we used to.""

, Another important topic to bring up is how your mother-in-law is affecting your finances. If this point is your main point of contention, then maybe you can discuss ways it can be alleviated.


If finances are the only reason you want your mother-in-law to move out and you can afford the extra expense of having her there, you might not get very far with this argument.

, The point of this discussion is to make sure you're on the same page. Discussing your mother-in-law moving out is a sensitive topic, but if having her around is hurting your family and your marriage, it's a discussion you need to have. As you have the discussion, you need to agree on what some common goals could be.Of course, when agreeing on common goals, you may need to compromise. For instance, one compromise could be buying a house that has an apartment in the back.
Try to set up dates for your goals. If your goal is to have your mother-in-law move out, by what date will she need to move out?
Discuss how you can help her to move out. Maybe you can help her find a place or assist with finances if you are able.

, When it comes to having parents in your house, emotional baggage is involved. Your spouse may feel like they aren't doing their duty to their parent if they ask them to move out. The best you can do is come up with a compromise you can both live with, which may include assisted living if you can't continue to care for an elderly mother-in-law by yourself., This conversation isn't one you can have alone with your mother-in-law. In fact, it's probably better if your spouse leads the conversation, as she may take it better coming from him or her.If your spouse isn't on the same page as you, this conversation isn't going to work. You're going to need to work together.

, Now is the time to discuss the goals you've come up with together. You need to lay them out in as polite a way as you can, but there's no way you can hide the fact that you're asking her to move out. It's best to give her more than one option if you can, and try to end on good news, if possible.For example, you could say, ""We've decided that we've liked you to move out. We've really loved having you here, and we still want you in our lives. However, we need space to figure out our own family.""
Include a time frame and the help you're willing to offer. ""We'll help you find a place, but we'd like you to choose one by the end of the summer. We want you to stay close by, though, because we like having you around.""

, Just because you're at your wit's end doesn't give you permission to be mean. Your mother-in-law deserves your respect and kindness, even when you're asking her to do something difficult like move out.Reassure your mother-in-law of your love. Let her know that just because you're asking her to move out doesn't mean you don't care for her and want her to be a part of your family. You just want space to make your own family.

, You don't want to push your mother-in-law out the door in a month. Give her an ample amount of time to find an new living arrangement, especially if money is an issue. Three months is a good amount of time, but a half a year may be better., One way to help make the transition easier is to find options that are within budget for her if she will have trouble doing this herself. Go and view them yourself before you take her to see if they're her taste.Make it close to you. That way, she won't feel like you want her out of your life completely.
Don't decide for her. Even if she needs some help with care, it should still be her decision where she lives, unless she can't decide at all.

, Many families are in mult-generational housing, which can take on many forms.One option is having a separate apartment for your mother-in-law, so she has her own space. If that's the option you choose, you'll need to find a new house that has this option.


In this instance, she'll still be close by, but you can have more separate lives.
It can also help alleviate the guilt your spouse may feel about abandoning his parent.

, If you are being the caregiver for your mother-in-law, the next option may be independent or assisted living. These options allow your mother-in-law to have some independence, while still getting the care she needs.The problem is these options can be very expensive. Nonetheless, if your mother-in-law has exhausted other options, Medicaid will often pay for some form of assisted living.

, One option for a mother-in-law who has declining health is to use home health aids. You can hire home health aids to simply be with your mother-in-law to give you a break, or you can use them for more hands-on care that you can't handle.However, this option can be costly to use on a regular basis, so you need to consider your financial situation before deciding on a home health aid.
It may be possible that your mother-in-law can pay for the aid, but many elderly people are not keen on outside help, even when they need it.

, Another option for older adults is adult day care. Adult day care is much like day care for kids. Your mother-in-law goes to a center during the day, where she'll be provided with meals, activities, and sometimes, physical therapy.Once again, though, it can be expensive, and your mother-in-law might not be very amenable to the idea.
The plus side is it frees up your days to do things outside the home, if you've been staying home caring for your mother-in-law.

, If your spouse has other siblings, they may be able to provide some help, even if they can't invite your mother-in-law to live with them. Asking for help can be difficult, but it can take some of the burden off of you and your family.For instance, your family may be able to stay with your mother-in-law once in a while to help spot you. They may also be able to invite your mother-in-law for short stays, such as a week or two, to give you a break.
Church friends and other close friends may also be willing to offer some relief by giving you an afternoon off.
Family may be willing to chip in a bit financially. If $100 would make a difference in how you feel about having her there, maybe some family members would be able to help out, since they can't take her themselves.

, If your mother-in-law is independent, ask her if you can have some alone time with your spouse so that you can grow your marriage. Suggest that she give you an alone night once a week by letting you go out with your spouse or by having her go out.


Another option is simply taking a break yourself. That is, when you feel yourself getting stressed, get out of the house. Go take some time for yourself away from your mother-in-law.

Make conversation with the mothers of your kids’ best pals.,
Plan play-dates that double as mom dates.,
Express curiosity like kids.",How to Make Mom Friends2," In comparison to other adults trying to make friends, moms have one connection working in your favor: your kids. Even if you share almost nothing else in common, you are both mothers. Use your kids’ relationships to help you forge bonds with other mothers.


While chaperoning your child’s field trip, for example, you might catch the attention of another mom and say, “It seems our kids are getting on quite well. I’m glad Asher has a close pal in his class.”, Don’t stop at using your kids to spark conversation. You can also take advantage of their inherent need to socialize to fulfill your own friendship needs. If you see your child taking an interest in another mom’s kid, take action to solidify a way for everyone to get to know each other better.


You might say, “Looks like we have two princesses-in-training. Tiffany loves tea parties. Do you think Sandy would like to join her for one?”Use this play-date as an opportunity to forge a bond with the other mom. You might have an adult tea party, too.

, One thing adults lose over time—or, at least, compartmentalize—is a sense of wonder for their environments and the people around them.Follow your kid’s lead and take a step back from the hustle and bustle to truly take in life as it’s happening around you. This can bring awareness to all the opportunities you have to connect with other moms.


Since people enjoy talking about themselves, use this characteristic in your favor. For instance, you might notice that one mom always wear the same pin on her lapel. Ask out of curiosity, “I don’t know if I’ve ever seen you without that pin. Could you tell me about it?”

Be patient.,
Adjust your expectations.,
Celebrate small wins.",How to Make Mom Friends3," Friendship-making is a game for the courageous and persistent. Every now and then, you may strike gold and connect with someone who has many of the same interests as you. Other times, your attempts may fall short because the other mom is too busy or isn’t in the market for new friends. Recognize that you won’t hit it off with everyone you meet. Nurse your wounds of rejection and keep trying.Go into every situation looking for something to learn rather than thinking you'll come away with a new pal. For instance, attending a larger play-date might help you learn that you prefer more intimate, one-on-one gatherings. Next time, you can arrange meetings that suit your style to help you feel more comfortable and increase your odds of meetings someone with mutual interests.

, Setting realistic expectations is central to making mom friends. Unlike other times in life such as high school or college, mom friendships may not include liberties like answering late-night phone calls to vent. Moms have tons of obligations, and, sometimes, friendships can’t be at the forefront. Be understanding of the friendships you have with other moms and try not to set the bar so high that your pals are destined to fail.


For instance, it would be unrealistic to expect that each time you were free to get together your other mom friends are, too. Minimize disappointment by either setting a regular date to get together or planning well in advance. Even then, a sick child or a last-minute school project can throw off plans. Be forgiving and don’t expect too much from your mom pals. Even if other people are frequently busy or unavailable, continue reaching out, especially if you need help. The other moms may even start reaching out to you.

, If before, you had very few connections with other moms in your area, give yourself a pat on the back when you start taking initiative. Perhaps you won’t make a new friend on your first try, but applaud yourself for taking the risk.


Making friends as an adult is a tricky process. So, celebrate any attempts you make to plan play-dates, stimulate conversations, or get involved with other moms.

Work through your own feelings about your mother-in-law before all else.,
Act like you like her.,
Stay polite.,
Use humor.,
Look for the good she does and praise it.,
Be kind and get to know her.,
Give gifts.,
Clarify misunderstandings.,
Give her space.,
Talk it through with your spouse.,
Be inclusive regardless of your personal feelings.",How to Get Along with Your Mother in Law," Are you able to put yourself in her shoes occasionally and see just where some of her so-called interfering or judgmental behavior comes from? She values the person you're married to, so there must be something good inside her!


Keep in mind that whatever your feelings, your mother-in-law remains one of the most important people in your spouse's life. Be sure it's not your own untamed jealousy causing problems.;
, Even if she is so difficult or different, you have to show to your spouse that you two can be good friends. That would make him/her feel comfortable and in case she dislikes you, he/she would never think it's because of something you have done or because you haven't tried to have a nice relationship with her.

, One of the hardest parts of a negative relationship with your mother-in-law is keeping your mouth shut when she brings out the nitpicking, critical comments. Being polite is not the same as putting up with what is being done; you're still perfectly entitled to stand up for yourself, but it is about not stooping to the same level.

Even if she says nasty things about you, don't repeat them.
Don't criticize her in front of your spouse. Your spouse will be stuck between a rock and a hard place, and even if he or she starts to see your side of things, it will be hurtful to have to join in any undermining.
Always speak well about her to your spouse. If he/she is talking about something she will do or did, you have to have always a nice thing to say about it. Try to compliment her every-time you see her, using phrases such as ""You look great today"" or ""Your hair looks so nice today"" doesn't matter if she is a mess or a really ugly mother in law. This way your spouse will feel like you really make an effort to have a nice relationship with her/his mother.
Do not let her see you in a bad mood. If you are upset or angry about something, do not ever let her notice it. She might try to use it against you talking about it with other members of the family or even to your partner, trying to make you look bad cause of the things you said in an anger moment . Always try to show a nice smile and speak nicely to her.
Equally, never criticize your spouse in front of her; this will simply make her defensive and cause her to see you in a bad light.

, Deflecting criticism with humor can deflate the barbs intended and put everyone at ease again. When it seems that all she's interested in doing is complaining, try to find witty means for replying.

For example, your mother-in-law is complaining about the weather again. Reply with ""Well, at least it means we don't have to sit indoors complaining about how cold it is. C'mon, we're all going to the beach now!""

, Always do this in her presence and be genuine. Praising the behavior you want from another person is an often successful technique for ensuring that the desired behavior is repeated. Ignore the undermining behavior completely; just focus on what her good points are.


Thank her for raising such a wonderful spouse!

Flatter her by passing on a compliment about her that someone else you know made about her (for example, ""Your mother-in-law is amazing!"").

, Just like you, your mother-in-law has experienced life's problems, joys, and losses. And just like you, she cares about the person you've married. Take some time to ask her questions about her life, to try to get to know her better. Perhaps some of her complaints stem directly from experiences she's had in the past of things that didn't work out for her and she's really worried that the two of you will repeat the wheel. If you understand her fears and concerns better, you'll be in a better position to reassure her.

Ask her for things that show you respect her knowledge. Ask for the recipe of a cake that she bakes that you love. Ask her how she manages to keep her hair in such great shape. Ask her how she found balancing work and child-raising. Ask her why she loves motorcycling so much. Ask her all sorts of things under the sun that allow her to talk about herself. You will learn a lot and it's a good opportunity to reassure her of the things that she does best.
Next time you're at her house, try to spend a few moments with her in the kitchen or sit near her and chat. If the conversation doesn't go that well, you can always get up to use the bathroom and sit back down in another chair!
Ask her to do things for you if you don't think she'll take this as an imposition. Ask her to make lunch (if you're brave). Ask her to proofread your report before submitting it. Ask for her professional opinion about something if she's qualified in a particular field. Ask her to prune your roses. Ask for whatever you think she has expertise in and will enjoy helping you with or offering advice about.

, Give your mother-in-law a gift from just you for no other reason than to let her know she counts in your life. A gift can show you care provided you've taken the time to put effort into it. Make something by hand, or personally select something in her favorite colors or style. If you have to, get your spouse to choose the present, then say it's from you. Make sure it's something she will enjoy. If she sees that you are thinking about her and know her tastes, it will help win her over.
, Don't allow your relationship with your mother-in-law to be directed by her assumptions about you and your needs. This is at least one area where you can set her straight, even if she doesn't want to listen. Be assertive and use the broken record technique to keep reminding her whenever she gets things mixed up that things are not as she says they are. Do it politely, firmly, and repeatedly. She'll get the message that there are some things which you will continue to insist on regardless of her assumptions.

For example, if your mother-in-law keeps comparing her challenging life with your lucky and wealthy one, look her in the eye and tell her straight: ""Barbara, I am not sure why you think we have the lifestyle you're depicting but it's the wrong picture. We're paying a mortgage just like you, we're still paying off our college fees, and we're trying hard to save up for a special vacation so that the kids can have a good time. It's not about luck for us; it's about good financial management and we stretch our earnings the best we can to ensure our kids have good experiences."" Keep repeating the ""It's good management, not luck"" message every time she brings up the subject; soon enough, it'll start to bore her.
If your mother-in-law criticizes your appearance or weight, or that of your children, don't let this one go. It's too personal and invasive. For example, you might respond: ""I appreciate that you're concerned about my weight but I'm within a healthy weight range and I'm eating well. My doctor is happy with my health."" Or, ""I understand that you worry about Kaila's weight and appearance but I prefer to concentrate on the children's personality and intellectual development rather than making them feel uncomfortable about their physical appearance. Kaila's eating healthily and her doctor's happy with her health.""
Responding in a direct manner and addressing your mother-in-law's complaints will disarm her to an extent but it also lets her know that you will stand up for yourself and family when you believe that a line has been crossed.

, Let her spend time alone with her child. Don't always expect to be hovering around your spouse and knowing everything that's happening right then.

Don't compete with her. If she makes the best sponge cake this side of Texas or has the wittiest comebacks you've ever heard, stop trying to outdo her. Rely on letting your own unique strengths that attracted your spouse to you to shine forth instead. There is plenty of room for both of you!

, Telling your spouse is vital; if your spouse has no idea how you're feeling, he or she may put you in situations you'd rather not be in, like taking care of dear old mom while she's sick. Find an opportune time to sit down together and talk through the issues in a calm and kind way.

Tell your spouse kindly (remember, this is his or her mother) how you feel. State the facts, not your opinions. For example, if your mother-in-law tried to run you over with her SUV, say so. Don't say, ""She's horrible and she wants to kill me!"" Explain very clearly, without being rude and hurtful: ""Ah Bruce, I'm worried your mom might be having sight problems because last week she back the SUV right into me even though it was the middle of the day and I was wearing a bright red dress.""
Discuss calmly. Ask your spouse how he or she feels about your mother's behavior (present the facts, not your perception). If the both of you are sharing opinions, it may allow you to be more honest.
If it's good enough for you, it's good enough for your spouse. Don't freak out if your spouse hates your own mother with a passion! Remember, if you're just finding out now, then obviously they've done a good job at hiding it. So expect them to continue hiding it around your family.
Don't be surprised if your spouse refuses to ""take sides"". He or she loves both of you equally, so taking sides can seem petty and pointless in such a case.

, Okay, so you know she doesn't like you and you're pretty sure she knows that you don't like her. This doesn't mean you can just stop visiting. This is your spouse's mother, remember, and a mother is very important in life. Don't be rude when your wife or husband wants to visit his or her parents on a Saturday afternoon. You still need to let their child-parent relationship breathe. Visit with your spouse – don't make yourself scarce. Your in-laws will think you're a wuss and this will only make them dislike you more. Remember, the goal is to ""get along"" with your mother-in-law...

Equally, you can set limitations on the visits. Don't put yourself into the situation of out-staying your ability to cope. If you're obliged to stay in the same house, keep it short and sweet.

"
"
Respect your child's choice.,
Stay cordial at all times.,
Set your boundaries as you are comfortable.,
Remember that she may be the mother of your grandchildren.,
Talk to your son or daughter.,
Accept the reality of the situation.,
Make nice, if all else fails.,
Go with the flow.",How to Deal With a Difficult Daughter in Law," Your son/daughter loves this woman, no matter that you can't understand what he sees in her. Remember the old song, ""When a man/woman loves a woman...If she is bad, he can't see it, She can do no wrong, Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down."" This is absolutely truth so in dealing with her, no matter what your true feelings are, you must never say a word against her to your son.;
, She may be a clueless, crude boor. She may be vulgar and crass. She may swear like a sailor while your family is a church-going, proper group. She may actually be unkind, cruel, or a manipulative, controlling narcissist, not caring about imposing on others as long as she gets whatever she wants. There is nothing you can do about this. Just be polite, as you would be to a stranger.


The only real exception to this is if you have little kids (your son has siblings who have children, perhaps) around and she's cursing like crazy - then you might say, mildly, ""Ooh - can we watch the language while the kids are here? They get into trouble for saying that word and I don't want them to pick it up here. Thanks."" No matter how creepy she is, stay calm, cool, poised, and polite.

, Perhaps you don't wish to support this union any more than is absolutely necessary to maintain some relationship with your son. That's your choice, absolutely. So simply set things up so that they are clear from the beginning.


If your daughter-in-law makes snide or nasty remarks about another family member (perhaps your other daughter-in-law), say, ""Well, she may not have much fashion sense, but she is one of the sweetest people I know, and I love her very much."" This lets her know, in a calm, non-critical way, that you will not be interested in hearing her snipe at this person.
If she drops over unannounced, don't lie but stop her at the door with a regretful but firm, ""I'm sorry, Allison - and think of something that you need to do like I'm just about to go and run my errands, so I need to fly. And you know what - it really is best to give a call ahead, just so I'm not in the shower, or doing my nude dancing or whatever."" Then grin and go back inside. If she tells you she'd like to tag along, let her know you're picking up a friend and this was time you had set aside to visit with that friend. Tell her you only get time with your friend so often, and you would not appreciate it if your friend brought someone else along at the last minute, and that you will respect that little propriety this time, ""...but if you let me know ahead of time that you'll be coming by, I can either reschedule my running around with Bernice, or ask if she'd mind if you joined us - that'd be fine for next time!""
Keep it positive.

, She will control access to any offspring of your son's that result from the marriage. Your best bet to retain visitation is to maintain a cordial, amicable relationship - bite your tongue if you must to remain civil. Don't criticize her parenting, don't get angry if she changes plans at the last minute, leaving you out in the cold when you had planned to have the kids over for the weekend. This is one of the ways that certain people control situations and others (see How to Recognize a Manipulative or Controlling Relationship) - the best you can do is to understand that she has the ultimate say over what happens with her children. Don't kid yourself that you have a lot of rights: courts do not tend to side with grandparents unless the mother and/or father are declared unfit or have been arrested for a felony. Just try as best you can to keep your relationship workable, no matter how bloody your tongue gets.

, Careful, though. Don't just unload a litany of your daughter-in-law's hateful traits. Instead, try to take an approach that is diplomatic and not critical. State the problem, and then request your preferred solution:



Example 1: Your daughter-in-law was supposed to drop your grandkids off for a sleepover on Friday night, but didn't show. You wait an hour and a half before finally calling your son, worried and upset, to find that their plans changed and they have called off the visit. Wisely, you wait a day, then call your son or daughter again to discuss a more suitable way to handle such an issue.

You: ""Josh, you asked us if we'd like to take the kids last weekend. Allison was supposed to drop them off around 5pm on Friday night and pick them up at noon on Sunday. Instead, Allison was a no-show on Friday, and when they hadn't arrived by 6:30, we were worried. I had to call you to find out that your plans had changed - and you both knew this since Thursday.""
Joshua (your son) responds: ""Mom, I'm sorry. I thought Allie was calling you, and she thought I was calling you, and it just got lost in the shuffle - we're so busy, and when the plans changed, it was kind of last-minute, so I'm sorry for that.""
You: ""I get that this time was a mix up, but it's happened before, and the thing is, it seems Allison never really ends up calling us when plans change - what ends up happening is that I call you to find out what is going on. This is very inconsiderate, Josh, and you know that. Dad and I have our lives, too, and we're busy, too. We cleared our schedule last weekend so that the kids could come and stay, and Dad turned down an invitation to go fishing with friends. In the future, I would like you to call at least a day ahead if plans change - but definitely, I would like you to be the one to handle it, rather than trusting that Allison will call. I don't want to be the nasty Mother-in-law, causing problems with your wife. But I also don't want to be left hanging, and whether it's intentional or not - that makes me feel like a doormat. So can we agree that in the future, if plans change and you are backing out, you will call, not Allison?""



Example 2: You have the opposite problem - Allison drops over and wants to leave the kids with you constantly, leaving you little to no time to yourself, and treating you like the hired help and her personal babysitting service - at her beck and call.

You: ""Allison, I'm sorry - I can't take the kids just now.""
Allison: ""Oh, I know it's short notice (really, it's no notice) but please, please, please - I have this thing..."" (as she shoves the kid toward the door)
You: (standing resolutely in the doorway) Honey, I'm sorry, I can't do it this time. I would love to, but I really do need some notice. I have plans that I cannot cancel, and I can't take the kids with me.""
Do not weaken to ""keep peace."" It won't work. She will continue to do this, and you will continue to seethe with anger - and in the end, you may blow up and say something unfortunate which will cause a huge rift in your family. Instead, hold your ground kindly, but firmly, and set this boundary clearly. Later, call your son:
You: ""I guess Allison told you I was ""mean"" today, and couldn't babysit.""
Josh: ""Yeah."" (He probably understands and is not mad at you, but is exasperated that his wife is having a cow about it and doesn't know how to get her off your case)
You: ""I do feel bad about it, but honey, I have a life, too, and lately it really feels like Allison just assumes I will be able to take the kids whenever she feels like going shopping with friends or whatever it is she does. I don't appreciate being taken for granted. I don't want to cause World War III here, and I don't want to hurt her feelings - I love the kids, and I always want to spend time with them, but, Josh, I need a little notice. A little appreciation for the fact that it's not easy for me taking care of little kids - as much as I love them, I'm getting older. I raised my kids and I think I deserve at least the respect of being asked first whether I might be available to babysit, rather than just having them dumped on me. Can you speak to her, please? I think she'd take this better coming from you - but in the future, I really would like for her to call. Even if it's just a couple of hours ahead, at least having the option to say yes or no would make me feel a lot better.""
Again, no matter how clueless and rude you believe Allison has been, it's better to simply deal with your feelings about it rather than criticizing her. Josh will understand, certainly, and if you can get him to talk to his wife rather than leaving it up to you to keep on saying no to her, it will smooth things between you. However - if Josh does try, and it is to no avail because his wife is just one of those people who feels entitled to do whatever she wants no matter how much it inconveniences others, then you will simply have to set your boundary hard and not deviate from it. One suggestion: Never babysit unless you receive 24 hours notice first - but make sure both Josh and Allison are aware of this. State that you have a life of your own and if you are asked a day ahead, you very well may be available to babysit, but past that, you will not be able to. In other words, if she calls and asks for you to babysit an hour from now, you simply say you've already made other plans. If you stand firm on this and don't just allow her to steamroll you, but rather, patiently and calmly just inform her without explaining excessively, she will soon learn that she can't expect this of you.



, If your son has children with this woman, no matter what you think of her, the children need their mother. Trying to drive a wedge between them and their mom will only drive a wedge between you and your son - and his kids. Instead, just come to terms with this: she may not be the daughter-in-law you dreamed of, but she is the daughter-in-law that you have. Choose to have whatever relationship is possible with her, for the sake of keeping contact with your son and grandchildren.

, If you know this girl to be vain, flatter her. If you know she gossips, just find some other place to be so that you don't have to get involved in it. If she swears and this offends you, never call her on it in her home - but you may ask her to tone it down in yours. If she is overly critical of your cooking, your decorating sense, your clothes, just blow it off. Learn how to Deal With Impossible People. Listen politely and very carefully to what she says, and then go and do exactly as you please. If she's just difficult, this may be the best you can hope for. If she's dangerous - that's another story (example: the reason she's difficult at times is that she's a drunk, drug addict, etc.) and you really should contact Child Protective Services (or its equivalent) in a case like that.

, Learn How to Be Laid Back. There's no payoff in constantly complaining to your son about her. If you've expressed your feelings, made your boundaries clear, and asked your son to intervene, all with little to no positive outcome, then just go with the flow. All you can do is not allow her to run over you constantly with unreasonable expectations for babysitting services, etc., and if she's a nasty little sniper that makes critical or snide comments, just blow them off. And never say anything critical or nasty about her to your grandchildren - she is their mother, and no matter how much you may wish it were otherwise, Mom always trumps Grandma, at least until the kids are mature enough to see their mother for the difficult, confusing, narcissistic person she is. Just try to get along for the sake of the kids, so that you can be an influence for stability and compassion in their lives, and hopefully thereby mitigate some of the damage she is doing to them.

Don't call her ""Mother"" or ""Mom."" She isn't your parent; you are on equal terms. Call her by her first name, unless you are living in (or your spouse is from) a country in which it's considered rude to call your mother-in-law only by name. In that case, follow the custom properly as to how to respectfully address her and establish a name, with your spouse, you feel comfortable calling her..;
, There are often many reasons why a mother-in-law may be difficult towards her child's new lover. She may feel less important to her child (or still see them as a child rather than someone's spouse). She may have difficulty standing behind someone else in their child's life. She simply may be a completely different person from you. Understanding the reasoning behind her behavior instead of taking it personally will make it easier to deal with..

, You don't need to move cross-country, but you also don't need to show up at every event. It's acceptable for your spouse to attend some family events without you. This should not be a common occurrence, however. You should not try to drive a wedge between your spouse and his family. It could also be a victory of sorts for that mother of his/hers - she gets to spend time with her child and avoid you completely. Even if it's easier, this will cause discord in your marriage eventually..

, If your mother-in-law has criticized you, stabbed you in the back to other family members and has been dismissive of things you've said, she could be making a very clear statement about your relationship. If she's done this, remember to keep your distance even when she's being nice. Look to other women for mentoring, advice, kindness and role modeling. You may have to write her off as being a positive factor in your life..

, Before coming in contact with the in-law, visualize the scenarios which always manage to get under your skin. What is it that is said or done that makes your blood boil? Once you determine those triggers (which tend to be the same emotionally, manifested in various ways), think about ways in which you can avoid them..

, If conflict is impossible to avoid, go ahead and respond honestly. Don't be rude, but be firm and don't sugar-coat. Remember that despite your efforts to avoid direct conflict, this person has shown little regard for your feelings on whatever the issue is. Don't let the fear of hurting the feelings of your relative or in-law stop you from responding appropriately--it clearly hasn't stopped them..

, If the mother-in-law attempts to use guilt as a tool of manipulation, it’s fairly easy to overcome. Whenever you perceive her attempting to manipulate your emotions by making you feel guilty, bring the whole matter to conscious awareness by asking, “You’re not trying to make me feel guilty, are you?” She will probably deny it, but soon the pattern will re-emerge. Keep interrupting the pattern of falling into a state of guilt by bringing attention to her emotionally manipulative tactics. You don't want to be rude, but put a stop to the use of guilt as a weapon..


If you refuse to enter the emotional state of guilt, it will allow you to be more objective and compassionate in seeing that she is probably using guilt because she feels powerless. If you can address that sense of powerlessness, you have the opportunity to transform the relationship for good. For example, say something in front of the family to flatter her such as, ""We usually reserve Friday nights for dinner with Mom and Dad. We need family time with them."" This gives her a sense of importance in front of everyone and helps her feel needed and wanted.

, You don't want to say or do anything to harm your relationship with them. Do you need to try to break the tension? Bite your tongue? Sometimes you have to suck it up and behave nicely for the sake of someone else's happiness..

, You set the boundaries in your relationships, both with your spouse and with your mother-in-law. If those boundaries are crossed and your mother-in-law can’t seem to take the hint, and if your spouse is unwilling to address the situation and stand up for you, then you have to assert yourself to restore balance. Define boundaries which you consider to be bottom lines that may not be crossed and make you feel violated when they are, and make them clearly known..


For example, if you value your privacy and a relative insists on frequent unannounced drop-in visits, that may be a bottom line for you. The first thing to realize is that it’s perfectly OK to satisfy your own needs. A relationship that makes you feel violated isn’t healthy..
If your mother-in-law drops over unannounced just before you and your spouse are headed out for dinner, you can say, ""Gee, it's nice to see you. I just wish you'd called ahead. Josh and I are on our way out to dinner. If we'd known you were coming, we'd have made plans to eat at home."" This will make it clear to your mother-in-law that she needs to call first next time.

, If you don't say something, she will not stop. And if you aren't clear with your spouse about how you would like the matter handled, your spouse may continue to appease his parent at your expense. Speak to your spouse first. If he/she is unsuccessful in putting a stop to the overstepping, then go to the mother-in-law..


If you’ve been going years without clearly verbalizing and enforcing your boundaries like a mature adult and let your mother-in-law treat you like a child for too long, she most likely won’t take you seriously at first. There may be a ""shock"" reaction, which is usually feigned, at the mere suggestion that you dare attempt to put restrictions on this behavior. Just let her have her reaction and stand your ground anyway.

, Do this compassionately but firmly. After all, there's a good chance you've allowed this behavior to go on for years and that makes you partly to blame for the fact that your mother-in-law has not learned the behavior you want from her. But if she doesn't respond to gentle reminders, adopt a no-nonsense approach to enforcing your boundaries..


Let her know that for the next 10 days (start with 10, expand to 30 if she doesn't get the message the first time), you intend to strictly enforce the boundaries you’ve described. Make it clear that if she violates your boundaries even once during those 10 days, you will then begin a 10-day communications blackout. If you have to go to Blackout, have your spouse present and let the mother-in-law know she cannot have contact for 10 days. This includes drop-in visits, phone calls and e-mails — unless it’s absolutely necessary. After the 10-day ""fasting"" period, you can restart the original 10-day boundary-enforcement trial and repeat the process.
Let your mother-in-law know that both you and your spouse are equally committed to doing this (and it's best if your spouse is the one to inform his/her mother, not you). Be totally transparent about what you’re doing. Also, let her know that you’re resorting to this process because she's left you no choice. Remind her that you've made many attempts to let her know how serious you were and those attempts were ignored.

, Write down what she says or does. By doing this, you're making sure that the situation doesn't grow bigger in your head after a few days of anger towards her. And after a few times, it'll give you a clearer view of her actions and make you aware of moments that you were alone and she insulted you or trespassed on your personal space or belongings. You will be prepared for the next time and not feel so scared or victimized anymore.


Use writing to get back at her without speaking. For example, say she goes through your bag. Just put a note in your bag that says; 'This is not your property. Do not search through my bag unless you've been asked to by me.' Or, put a lock on it. Think of solutions to sabotage her spying/stealing.

, Let your husband (or wife) know that the way their mother treats you is hurtful. You are entitled to share these feelings with your spouse. Do not criticize her - remember this is his/her mother - but don't protect her either. You can say something like, ""Honey, your mom may not mean to be hurtful, but she was tonight. In the future, if she says something like (give the example that hurt you), I would appreciate it if you would speak up for me."".

, Does your spouse support you? It's very important and will determine your success in dealing with your mother-in-law. Sometimes you need to tell your spouse there's a problem, since s/he will not want to ruffle any feathers. Be clear and offer specific solutions that will be acceptable to both of you. Each of you should take responsibility for putting your marriage/spouse first, and your childhood family second, which sometimes requires you to protect your marriage from your birth family. If your husband/wife will not step up and protect you from his/her mother, then you have a problem that will plague you for your entire marriage..

, If your spouse will not handle his/her family, you will never solve this problem. Your spouse's mother has already demonstrated that she doesn't respect or recognize you. Nothing you say or do will change that. Unless your spouse is willing to take charge, outline clear boundaries over which the mother must not step, and be willing to follow up these statements with action and definitive consequences, you will have to face the fact that you will not be able to ever change this relationship. That may be a deal breaker for you and for your marriage. If it is, let your spouse know before it's too late so that they have time to remedy the situation..

, There are many ways to send the message across gently rather than in a calculative or manipulative manner. This world is mostly made of good people and good intentions. She is mostly a good person, who is likely suffering from not being able to have the special relationship with her son that she once had. Regardless of why she feels put out or threatened, seek the good in her.

, To this, try the following:


Observe her as a person. See why she behaves a certain way.
Understand her needs as a mother
Understand her needs as a mother-in-law.

, For the needs that you cannot, or do not want to, politely decline with a reason bolstered by good logic.


For example: Let's say that your daughter has reached school-going age and your mother-in-law feels that school A is best for your daughter. However, you much prefer School B. Respond to her like this: ""I would love to send my daughter to school A. But school B has more values which I think you appreciate, such as kindness, organic living, healthy activities, etc.This is why I have gone with School B."" In this way, you have given respect to what she attaches importance to but have still managed to stand your ground.

, For example, say, ""We are still thinking about that, what is your opinion?"". Listen to her uninterrupted but you don't have to take her route, the choice is always yours. Remember that you are your own master. No one can interfere if you don't let them.

, If your mother-in-law talks too much on the phone, keep a timer for 10 minutes. When the timer is at 02 secs, stop the timer and say, ""I love talking to you but I have to finish-ironing, cleaning the toilet, feeding the cats, walking the dogs, cooking pasta for Adam, and make rice crispies for the boys' school project in the shape of a train. I feel awful but can please can I speak with you on Friday at 10am? Is this a good time?"". Then keep your appointment but again, make the call short and sweet.

, For example, you could have an every third time rule; namely, every third visit, let her be alone with her son. Go for a jog, finish an errand, or better still, offer to do her groceries. This way you have visited but you have also shown her that you are not a threat to her. She can always be alone with her darling son when needed.

Recognize the problem.,
Recognize and avoid the triggers.,
Ignore what you can.,
Don't raise the emotional temperature.,
Let the response fit the offense.,
Accept your in-law as s/he is.,
Work on being friendly.",How to Cope With an Overbearing In‐Law," Are you dealing with a loud, obnoxious sister-in-law who enjoys her own jokes more than anyone else does? Or are you dealing with a domineering, controlling brother-in-law who tries his hardest to outdo every feat from every anecdote, tries to out-macho your brother and dad, or seems to get off on loudly criticizing your sister or their children in front of the entire family?;
, Before coming in contact with the in-law, visualize the scenarios which always manage to get under your skin. What is it that is said or done that makes your blood boil? Once you determine those triggers (which tend to be the same emotionally, manifested in various ways), think about ways in which you can avoid them. Does someone always make an ignorant remark whenever politics, religion, or animal rights are mentioned on TV? Leave the room once the channel hits that kind of program or commercial. Make a quick escape. If you can't avoid the trigger, proceed to the next step.

, Choose your battles. There's no point in picking a fight over every little thing your in-law does which gets your goat. When his or her irritating habits or remarks are not directed right at you, try to let them roll off your back. Do allow for simple differences between people.

, If conflict is impossible to avoid, go ahead and respond honestly - not rudely, but don't sugar-coat either. Remember that despite your efforts to avoid direct conflict, this person has shown little regard for your feelings on whatever subject the issue is. Don't let the fear of hurting the feelings of your relative or in-law stop you from responding appropriately. For example, let's say it's well-known in your family that your in-law is of one political party and you are aligned with another political party. The in-law might make some politically charged subject in direct opposition to your beliefs on that subject. When s/he says, ""What kind of idiot would vote for him?"" stand up and say, ""Excuse me, I'm right here and I can hear you, you know."" This does require a light touch - you want to be a good sport, while at the same time letting him or her know a nerve has been touched. If s/he responds with, ""So?"" you can respond with, ""So let's avoid an argument. Can we talk about football, or something less charged?"" This is a fair suggestion - but if s/he continues his or her rant, step in again and interrupt, saying, ""I'm not even kidding - that's a sensitive subject and I don't think it's appropriate at this gathering. Let's move on."" Look around, once again, for support. It's an almost sure bet that, out of deference if nothing else, someone will agree with you.

, By sitting on or stuffing down your feelings, you're not helping it get better. You don't need to make a huge deal of it, but simply responding authentically can make a positive difference. Here are some common examples:


The Loud Laughter: When she brays over her every joke, just lean over and say, ""Man it does my heart good to see someone enjoy their own jokes so much. But this is kind of a tough crowd, huh? I don't know if they're getting it."" Usually, simply pointing out that she's trying too hard or is simply too loud will cue her to try to keep it down. If she doesn't care, your attempt at shushing her won't help, but then you can just go to her and say, ""Hey, Grandma's trying to take a nap, I'll need you to help me get everyone to remember to keep our voices down."" Say it firmly but without anger or hostility. Try to enlist her aid rather than merely suppressing her natural loudness.
The Over-Sharer: When the new in-law feels compelled to share intimate details of the couple's sex life over cocktails or dinner, spluttering as if scandalized won't help - it often feeds the somewhat exhibitionist tendencies at play. Instead, say clearly, ""Too much information, please don't tell me any more."" If s/he persists, say it again. Often, it takes us so much effort to muster up our courage that we're shy about repeating ourselves. We make one pass at trying to contain a situation, and then give up when we're ignored. Don't surrender to this boorish behavior. Repeat your objection, and look around the table for backup (hopefully from a man or woman the offender likes, or at least respects). If you can't get backup, leave. Hopefully it will shame those left into supporting you.
The Topper: No matter how hard your week was, his was harder. No matter how much pain you're in, his pain is much, much worse. No matter how many push-ups you did, he can do more. Whatever it is, this guy has an answer, and his answer is always that he is superior. It can actually be amusing once you've recognized it. Don't allow yourself to become frustrated, just back off with a grin and find a different cluster of friends or relatives to share your story with - he won't stop, and you will never top him, so it's best to simply accept that no matter what you say, he will have to have the last word. Acknowledge and move on.
Control Freak: You're meeting at your sister's home before heading out to dinner at a restaurant. You need to leave there by 7 to make your 8 pm reservation and you're starving. But at 6:50, her husband is just getting into the shower, and you end up not getting on your way until close to 8 pm, with everyone waiting on him. This is a classic controlling behavior - it's about making everyone's evening dependent on him. Instead of waiting for this to happen a second time, tell your sister (it's important she understands where you will draw the line) you will meet them at the restaurant at the agreed-upon time, and that if they haven't arrived by 20 minutes after your reservation time, you'll just go ahead and order without them, and they can arrive whenever they wish. It's about you controlling your own circumstances, and not allowing him to make you (as well as your sister) his victim - she chose to accept his behaviors, but you did not, and you shouldn't put up with it. If you're finished with your dinner by the time they arrive, don't feel bad about saying, ""Well, sorry we missed you, but dinner was delicious -, I know you're going to enjoy it. But we're wiped out, and we're heading home - you guys have a nice time.""
Domineering Parent: This is a parent who humiliates his or her child with constant assertions of authority in a public setting. The parent is asserting his or her authority - and by extension, proving it to you - through the child. In this case, a challenge is not useful. Indeed, any challenge to the parent's authority may put the child at risk of even worse treatment, so it's best not to do this unless things are really spinning out of control and the parent is becoming legally abusive. Instead, maintain a decent relationship with the parents, affirming them where you can and reassuring them that they do not need to prove their parental authority to you. Spend time with the child and cultivate a loving relationship of trust, but don't try to get between the child and parent -- any parent will resist that, and this type of parent will probably overreact in exactly the way you've been trying to avoid. Just having a warm and supportive relationship with that child may make all the difference, as you may be viewed as a safe place to fall when times are tough.
Geographic/Ethnic Excuse: How many of us have heard, ""You have to understand, she's Italian/from New Jersey/from Philadelphia/clannish"" - or one of a thousand other excuses that have to do with cultural, geographical or ethnic background? Consider asking your relative why it is that all of you in your entire family have to understand their beloved spouse, but the spouse isn't required to understand that the rest of you aren't comfortable with that type of behavior. In certain situations, there's a component of challenge to this behavior. For example, the person may see ""pushing"" you as a test (perhaps because they come from a neighborhood where you have to earn acceptance by being tough). If you don't push back, you fail - and so does the in-law. If you do push back, in this person's mind, rather than creating conflict, it equates to acceptance. For example, your sister-in-law loudly exclaims that ""That's just stupid - who would do that?"" and you stand up and say, ""I would. So now what do you want to say about it?"" She might chuckle and say, ""That figures."" And after that, you're treated better than the others in your family. Don't fear stepping up, just don't get hostile about it.

, Don't try to change this person; s/he isn't likely to change to accommodate you. All you can really hope for is a draw - and pray that time will mellow the ruder behaviors. Just understand that you're dealing with a difficult person and will need to be prepared to disengage at times and walk away. A battle may not be worth fighting if it means losing your child, parent, or sibling over it. Try to take the good along with the bad. That's hard to do sometimes, because it's so easy to get caught up in just gritting your teeth whenever you're together. But your relative found something lovable in this person, so make the effort, particularly if there are kids involved, to see the good qualities in your in-law.

, Taking a moment to say or do something pleasant and kind is greatly rewarding both for you and for the recipient. Instead of just going through routine motions, try to greet your family members amiably with sincere warmth and affection. No matter how small or insignificant a gesture may seem, it still goes a long way toward creating a relaxed and cheerful atmosphere for all. Furthermore, you can combine a good-natured smile with a thoughtful compliment to help achieve a sense of civility.

Acknowledge that you are human.,
Consider your childhood.,
Practice self-compassion.,
Shift your focus outside of yourself.",How to Fight Feelings of Failure As a Mother1," If you tend to criticize yourself often for mistakes you have made, then it may help you to consider that everyone makes mistakes. It is just part of being human.Try telling yourself something like, “I am human and sometimes I make mistakes, but that is okay. I can make some mistakes and still be a good mother.”
You might also consider whether you are setting impossibly high standards for yourself as a mother. For example, if you beat yourself up because you didn’t have time to pack lunch for your child and had to give them some money to buy lunch instead, then you may be setting unreasonable standards for yourself.;
, Being self-critical is often something that develops in childhood, especially if you grew up in a dysfunctional environment. Take some time to reflect on your childhood. Was there any dysfunction in your household growing up? If so, how might this have affected your perception of yourself?Try writing about how some of your childhood experiences may have shaped the way that you treat yourself. For example, if you grew up with an alcoholic parent or with a parent who never approved of anything you did, then this lack of positive reinforcement may have caused you to be highly self-critical.
By acknowledging some of the sources of your self-critical nature, you may be able to begin to let go of this attitude towards yourself.

, Being kind to yourself is an important part of becoming less self-critical. To begin practicing self-compassion, try to watch out for unhelpful and unrealistic thoughts and counter them with more realistic ones. You can also look for ways to praise yourself and acknowledge your successes.For example, if you find yourself thinking, “I am a terrible mother,” then you might acknowledge that this is unhelpful and untrue. Instead, you might say to yourself, “I have many good qualities. I am kind, loving, and patient. These are the qualities of a good mother.”
You can also acknowledge what you do well on a daily basis. For example, you might say to yourself, “My kids ate all of the healthy dinner I made them. That was really great!” Or, “I read a bedtime story to my kids, which is a great way for us to bond. Yay me!”

, If you are caught up in thoughts of your inadequacy, then shifting your focus outside of yourself may also help. Try calling up a friend and ask about her day, or ask your significant other to tell you about their day at work.Even reading a book or article may help you to stop focusing on yourself and stop the cycle of self-criticism.

Make a list of things you are good at.,
Reframe your weaknesses as strengths.,
Recognize that you are a good role model.,
Do not compare yourself to other parents.",How to Fight Feelings of Failure As a Mother2," You can banish thoughts of failure as a mother by focusing on the things you are good at as a parent. You may write down a detailed list of all the things you are good at doing, from the very small to the very big. Refer to this list whenever you have a weak moment or feel you are not doing your best. It can serve as a good reminder of how many things you can do well, even on days when you don’t feel like the greatest mother in the world.


For example, you may write down on your list, “good at cooking my kid’s favorite meal,"" “good listener,"" “good at attending my kid’s soccer games,"" and “always there to pick up my kids after school.” Try to focus on specific things you do well, ranging from the everyday to the major life events.

, It’s important to remember that no mother is perfect and that we all have flaws as individuals. You may struggle with certain aspects of being a mother and feel you are failing in some aspects. Rather than feel bad about your weaknesses, you should try to view them as strengths. Think about how your weaknesses actually contribute to your strengths as a parent and a mother.


For example, you may acknowledge that you struggle with being stricter with your children, but you realize it is because you love and want them to have what makes them happy. You may realize you are too strict with your children, but only because you care about them and want to protect them.

, As a mother, you should also recognize that you are doing your best to be a good role model to your children. Recognize that you are someone your children can emulate and respect. If you are a decent, kind person, you are likely acting as a good role model for your children.


You may think about how you set a good example for your children every day, from encouraging them to be responsible and polite to showing them the value of hard work and perseverance. You may show them how to be strong and independent through simply going to your job every day and being the best employee or boss you can be.

, Though the temptation is strong to compare yourself to other seemingly superstar parents around you, try to focus on you and your children. Avoid comparing yourself to other parents and using other parents as a barometer for your own success as a mother. Doing this will only lead to feelings of guilt and inadequacy. Instead, think about your strengths as a mother and be proud of your actions.


Rather than compare yourself to other parents, you should try to appreciate the parenting styles of others. You may try to compliment other parents on how well their children are raised and take compliments about your children from other parents. Try to see parenting less as a competition and be appreciative of other parents.

Notice your children’s gifts and talents.,
Look at how your children carry themselves and treat others.,
Appreciate your children as individuals.",How to Fight Feelings of Failure As a Mother3," You can fight off feelings of failure as a mother by paying attention to the strengths in your children. Your children are a product of your love and attention. Their strengths often develop due to your nurturing and attention to them. Notice how strong they are as individuals and appreciate their gifts and talents, as you had a direct hand in helping them flourish. You should give yourself some credit for producing children who are gifted in some way.


For example, you may notice that your child has a talent for working with their hands. They may be good at building electronics or putting together puzzles. You may credit yourself with giving them games and problem solving toys when they were younger so their talents could flourish.

, You should also consider your child’s character and moral values. Think about how they carry themselves and treat others around them. If they have been brought up well, they will have a kind heart and treat others with respect. As their mother, you should feel proud of how well you have raised your children.For example, you may pay attention to how your child plays with other children or gets along with other adults. If they tend to share well and be considerate of others around them, this is a testament to your great parenting skills.

, Avoid comparing your children to other kids and focus instead on what makes them great as individuals. Consider how they are unique from other children and how this benefits them. You may have raised them in a certain way or in a certain style, and this will affect how they act as adults. Try to appreciate your children’s uniqueness and embrace their perspective on the world.You may feel that you are not able to always provide for your children in the ways you would like and feel guilty about how your children turned out. But you should take the time to appreciate your child’s good qualities and uniqueness. Only then can you let go of your guilt and appreciate them as part of you.

"
Accept that no one is perfect.,
Learn to let go of past mistakes.,
Communicate effectively with your children.,
Accept help and support from others.,
Maintain a life outside of being a mother.",How to Fight Feelings of Failure As a Mother4," If you strive for perfection in everything you do, then you may be setting yourself up for disappointment. Being a perfectionist can make it harder for you to feel accomplished. Try to accept that perfection is not possible and mistakes are okay.Try to look at your mistakes as learning opportunities. For example, if you are late picking up your kids from school because you got stuck in a long line at the grocery store, then you may use this experience as a learning opportunity by deciding that you need to shop a bit earlier in the day to avoid the rush.

, Though you may hold yourself to a high standard as a mother, you should be willing to let go of mistakes you may have made as a parent in the past. Try not to hold on to your past mistakes and feel shame about your actions. Once you have made amends for your mistakes, let them go and learn to forgive yourself. Holding on to them can lead to feelings of failure, which will not help you move forward and be successful as a parent.


For example, maybe you regret a time that you yelled harshly at your child when you were angry or upset. Once you apologize and make amends to your child for your mistake, you should let it go.

, You can also be the best mother you can be by communicating with your children on a day to day basis. Make sure you set boundaries by telling your children “no” and explain why they cannot do something. Be open and transparent with your children so they learn the value of communication and respect you as a parent.You should teach your children how to use “I” statements to express themselves by using “I” statements when you talk to them. For example, you may say, “I have to leave for work now. I want you to be good to the babysitter and be on your best behavior.”

, Though you may think you have to do everything yourself to be the perfect mother, you may find yourself frazzled or exhausted from time to time. Reach out to others for support and accept help when it is offered. Be willing to let others help you with your role so you do not burn out or snap. Part of embracing your role as a mother and doing it well is allowing others to help you when you need it.For example, you may accept a family member’s offer to babysit for a night so you and your partner can go out on a date, just the two of you. Or you may accept another mother’s offer to host a get together at their house with the children so you can enjoy time alone at home.

, Having a life of your own outside of being a mother can help you deal with the stress and anxiety of being a parent. Maintaining your own life separate of being a mother can also ensure you are good in your role as a parent. Though you may feel you are neglecting your children by having your own life, doing this will ensure you maintain your own sense of self. You may try doing little things to maintain a role separate of your role as a mother, such as making time to do hobbies or activities that you enjoy doing.


You may also try to commit regular time to doing something that has nothing to do with your children, such as taking a dance class once a week or setting aside an hour of time to paint at home. Maintaining even a little bit of your own life outside of being a mother can help you stay balanced and fulfilled as a parent.

Do some soul-searching.,
Consider your career.,
Find support.,
Expect a little jealousy.,
Take parenting classes.,
Take pride in your work.",How to Be a Stay at Home Dad," Make sure you’re okay with your wife being the breadwinner, and discuss what you will be expected to do. Are you signing on to do all the housework, cooking, and childcare? Or are you just agreeing to take care of the kids?;
, Think about how you might balance being a stay-at-home dad with your career goals. Consider asking your employer if you could work part-time and/or from home. Or beef up your resume during your hiatus by squeezing in a few business courses or working toward an advanced degree.

, Join a support group to avoid becoming isolated. Stay-at-home dads often find that they are not welcomed into the female-only coffee klatches. There are websites that will match you with dads in your area.

, If your wife exhibits a little jealousy when the children begin running to you with their problems, be sensitive. The arrangement may take some getting used to for everyone.

, If you are feeling unsure of your abilities, take some parenting classes. One study found that the happiest stay-at-home dads were the ones who had confidence in their childcare skills.

, Don’t worry about what other people may think about your staying home to take care of the kids. Remind yourself that the work you are doing is important, and that doing it well is something to be proud of.

Respect her body autonomy.",How to Develop Your Daughter's Self Esteem," If you try to save your child from mistakes, she will feel incapable. When she is struggling with something, let her struggle. When she creates an imperfect product, let her experience the triumph of creation. Don't dive in every time you see her about to spill something or mess up a math problem. Let her work through it on her own—and when she messes up, let her clean up.Supervising doesn't mean controlling. You can watch your child experiment without trying to fix her course.
Praise effort as well as accomplishment. You can praise your daughter for taking a risk, trying something new, or doing something she finds difficult.;
, When your daughter shows interest in something, treat her interest seriously. Offer her further opportunities to explore it. Allow her to talk about it, and ask her questions as she learns.


For instance, if your daughter likes lizards, take her to the library to check out books on lizards. Bring her to a nearby zoo to see lizards in person.
Even if she has interests that seem worrisome or unachievable to you, help her redirect them into active channels. For instance, if she wants to be a famous actress, let her sign up for acting classes and participate in community theater. When she develops a love for the art, she'll be less hung up on the payoff.

, Provide opportunities for your daughter to develop her various competencies by offering age-appropriate activities. If she has never done something, that's a reason for her to try it.You can build her sense of independence by helping her learn to take care of her own needs. For instance, you can teach her to cook and let her plan some of the family meals.

, You can help your daughter build up her self-esteem by showing her how many things she is good at. Try sitting down with your daughter and having her help you make a list of everything your daughter can do well. Then, look at the list to see how she could use these skills to help others.


For example, you might include on the list that she is good at reading. If she's willing, sign her up to tutor and help other kids practice their reading. Get her to volunteer alongside you at nearby charity or activist events.Ask for her help. When she's really little, you can get her to help in tiny ways, like handing you tools or mixing ingredients during cooking.
When she's older, ask her to take care of things and leave them in her charge. Ask for her advice and opinions as well, as listen seriously.

, Praise is an important building block for your daughter's self esteem, so make sure that you praise your daughter often. Give your daughter genuine praise on a daily basis.


Give specific recognition of her actions. Say ""You kept working on that drawing until the whole page was colored in!"" or ""It looks like you almost got mad at your brother and then you calmed yourself down by making a joke! I'm proud of you for finding a way to calm down.""
Treat her actions as choices, not as accidents of temperament or talent. Like anyone, your daughter is constantly regulating and revising her behavior. Instead of talking about how bad her temper is, talk about how many methods she is learning to recognize and moderate her temper.
Praise her effort as well as her success.
Don't put too much focus on appraising your daughter's physical appearance. Instead of praising your daughter for being popular or for having lots of admirers, praise her for her good social skills and ability to read people.
Don't make promises that aren't true. For instance, don't promise she'll succeed at something she wants. If she auditions for a musical, instead of saying ""You'll definitely get that part,"" say ""you've practiced, and your voice is strong for your age, so you have a good chance at getting that part."", Avoid self-deprecation. Don't speak to yourself in a way you don't want your child to imitate. If you make a mistake, own up to it without putting yourself down. If you're feeling pessimistic about your prospects, talk yourself through it until you're at a more realistic place.For example, if you are feeling angry with yourself because you forgot to pay an important bill, then you can say something like, ""I forgot to do that and I feel angry about it. But it's not the end of the world. I will just take care of it tomorrow.""

Develop self esteem if yours is low.

, Keep an eye out for beliefs your child may be developing that are irrational or self-defeating. If your daughter starts saying that she just ""isn't fun and nobody likes her"" or that she is ""bad"" at something, respond positively but firmly to redirect this belief.


If she says ""I'm not fun, nobody likes me"" try saying something like ""You're very fun. You make us laugh, and you have fun with your cousins all the time. Remember how much fun you and your friends had playing dress-up? At school you are just settling in to a new classroom. But you have made friends before, so you can do it again.""
Encourage your daughter to think of her competencies as skills she can develop, not abilities she does or does not have.

, If your daughter has low self-esteem, get her to a child or adolescent therapist. Let her meet one and decide if she likes that one or wants to try another. Explain that you're worried about her unrealistic low self-esteem, and say why you think therapy will help., Do not ignore your child as a way to punish her or get her to quiet down. Instead, respond lovingly but firmly. To build her self esteem, you must recognize her as an important presence and treat her opinions, her feelings, her struggles and her accomplishments with respect.Responsiveness has an effect as soon as your baby is born. Come to your baby when she cries. Make faces at her and laugh when she laughs. The more you respond to your child's actions and bids for attention, the more she will understand that she matters.

, It can be tempting to dismiss a child's questions, especially when they are repetitive or when the answer is complicated. It can be equally tempting to give her an answer immediately and show off your own knowledge. However, you will help her develop a greater sense of curiosity and self-esteem if you help her think through questions.


If she asks ""why are books always square or rectangular?,"" say that’s a good question, and ask her why she thinks so. She can think of some reasons, and you can think of some reasons, and if you're really interested you can follow that up by reading about it together.

, Instead of saying ""because I said so,"" explain why you make the rules you make. You don't want to teach her to blindly trust in your authority—you want her to seek to understand your reason so that she trusts your authority while developing her own sense of authority.


If she asks ""but why do I have to go to bed and you get to stay up?"" you can explain that children's bodies need more rest than adult bodies.

, Teach lessons in consent early on by teaching your daughter that her body is her own. Ask for permission before you pick her up. Ask her if she would like to hug her relatives and friends, instead of telling her to. If she says no, respect that. Never touch her in a way she does not want to be touched.


Similarly, teach her to ask before she hugs or touches other people. Say ""your body is yours, and their body is theirs.""
Teach her alternative ways of expressing affection, like blowing kisses, waving, and saying positive things.
Do not engage in corporal punishment. Spanking and other forms of physical force are no different from other child abuse—they are traumatic to children, and they destroy self esteem.Let her make her own decisions about hair and clothing. If she wants to cut off all her beautiful curls? It's up to her! If she wants to wear three prints at once? You can teach her about color coordination over time, but don't pressure her—let it be her decision.Have open conversations with her about consent as she grows."

Congratulate yourself, you just made it through a day of parenting.",How to Be a Good Stay at Home Parent," While this may seem contradictory, it will be better for you and your children in the long run. Remember that phrase ""If Mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy""? Well, this goes for Dads as well. Do this by getting plenty of rest (or as much as you can if your children are still young), eating right and giving yourself a treat once in a while.;
, Consider subscribing to regular e-mails from Flylady to help you out.

, Take a shower, drink a cup of coffee or review your routine for the day.

, Five to fifteen minutes or so can make all the difference in how the day begins.

, At least once a day. A simple thank you or a ""great job"" can do wonders for your child and your relationship with them.

, Think of ways you can turn ""noes"" into ""yeses."" For example, instead of saying ""Not today,"" try saying ""Hmmm...maybe we can do that next week.""

, Even if they can't do it ""right"", remember they are trying to help and appreciate the effort.

, You may have a ""favorite"" but don't let them know that. Treat them as equally as possible in accordance to their divergent ages and personalities.

, This will give you enough time to end the day with bath-times, cuddles and a smile.

,, Now, get some rest, you'll need it for tomorrow.

Listen to them.,
Act as a role model.,
Be available to your niece and nephew.,
Spend time cultivating your relationship with them through phone calls, text messages, and emails.This is especially important if you can't visit with your niece or nephew or if you live far away.,
Share stories with your nieces and nephews.,
Remain on good terms with your siblings.,
Choose activities that your niece or nephew enjoys.,
Teach them how to do something that you enjoy.,
Take your nieces and nephews to interesting places.,
Make staying in fun.,
Buy them gifts.,
Take them out for dessert.,
Take them to do something special.,
Maintain boundaries.",How to Be a Great Auntie," Sometimes parents are too busy to listen to their children, especially if they have multiple children and busy careers. In situations such as these, as an auntie you can give more time to all the stories and news that your nieces and nephews want to share. In this way, you are almost acting as a supplemental parent by offering your niece or nephew your attention when they need it.Practice active listening with your nieces and nephews. Listen to closely to what they are saying to you, and then repeat it back to them in their own words to make sure that you understood what they told you.Now, your niece or nephew will either confirm that you understood what they said, or they will correct you and explain what they meant. This helps to avoid misunderstandings.;
, In addition to listening to your niece or nephew, you can offer them advice, teach them how to do things, and set a good example for them.This will allow you to help mold your niece or nephew’s behaviors through your own example or counsel. For example, you might offer advice on how your niece or nephew should treat their siblings or how they should maintain a relationship with their parents.

Or you might offer relationship advice or counsel your niece or nephew on school or career paths as they get older.If you do not believe that you would be a good role model for your nieces and nephews, ask yourself why not. Is this something that you can change about yourself? If so, consider making the change. If not, consider the impact this will have on the children. Ask yourself if this is something that you could hide from your nieces and nephews, if you cannot change it. If so, consider hiding it.
For example, perhaps you are a young adult and you like to drink alcohol with your friends in the evening. You know that drinking alcohol in excess in front of your nieces and nephews could have a lasting negative impact upon them and that it wouldn’t make you a good role model. You might decide to stop drinking so much in order to be a better role model for the children. Or you might decide to continue drinking with your friends, but choose to remain sober when you are around your nieces and nephews. If you feel like you need to get drunk around your nieces and nephews, return them to their parents immediately. Getting drunk in front of them is irresponsible, and sets a bad example for them.

, Babysit your nieces and nephews when they are young. As they get older, let them know that they can drop by to see you whenever they wish. Take them on outings with you or arrange scheduled visits with them.The more time that you spend together, the stronger your bond will become. You will also show them that you are dependable and that they can trust you by making time for them.

, By incorporating mediated communication into your relationship with your niece or nephew, you are teaching them that you are always available to them and that you can be reached in a multitude of ways., If you know that your niece or nephew is going through something that you experienced as a child, share the story of your experience with your niece or nephew.

Children like hearing stories, especially when they are relatable or if they contain stories that include people they know such as their parents, grandparents, or other aunts and uncles. These stories inform your nieces and nephews of their family history, while also letting them know that they are not alone in their experiences., Your brother or sister is likely the parent of your nieces and nephews, and you want to make sure that you don’t go against their wishes when you are spending time with your nieces and nephews. Your relationship with your nieces and nephews depends upon the strength of your relationship with their parents. The closer you are with their parents, the more likely that you will be close with your nieces and nephews.As an aunt, you also want to make sure that you back up your siblings in the values, lessons, and rules that they are imposing upon their children.Respecting your siblings, shows your nieces and nephews that they should respect their parents and the family unit as a whole.

, When in doubt, ask them what they like to do. By undertaking an activity that they like, you will be able to hold their interest and demonstrate a common bond with them.

, If you have a talent or a special skill, go out of your way to teach your niece or nephew how to do what you do.This will create a stronger bond between you and your niece or nephew and this activity may become something that they only do with you. For example:


If you are good at baking cookies, perhaps you can teach them how to make your recipes and you can bake cookies together.
If you are a musician, perhaps you can teach them to play music with you.
If you play a soccer, you might teach your niece or nephew how to kick the soccer ball around the field with you, or instruct them on the rules of the game.

, By taking them to a place that you find fun or interesting, you’ll impart your interests on them. These places might include planetariums, museums, parks, zoos, aquariums, beaches, etc. These trips can be educational, informative, and fun.

, Sometimes staying in can be more fun than going out with your niece or nephew. You can giggle and dance in the living room.You can build a blanket fort and watch movies or read books together all afternoon. Doing an activity together doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to leave the house or spend a lot of money. Below are a list of other activities that can make staying in fun:


Bring along something from work and do a show-and-tell.
Work on a science experiment together.
Bake a dessert together.
Go through an old photo album filled with images of you and their parents.
Do an art project together.

, While it makes sense to buy gifts for the child’s birthdays and winter holidays, sometimes it is fun to surprise your niece or nephew with a gift at random. Sometimes these gifts will be impractical items that are adorable or funny, and other times your gift may be a toy that you know the child has been yearning for.Regardless of what you gift the child, the look of excitement and happiness on their face is always worth the expense.

, As an auntie, you can spoil your niece and nephew with desserts when they spend time with you. This is a particular treat for the child if your visits are infrequent or if their parents do not often give them desserts. Taking a child out for ice cream with rainbow sprinkles is a great way to spoil them and bond with them at the same time., An easy way to spoil your niece or nephew is to take them to do something significant once or twice a year. For example, you might take them to a baseball game if your niece or nephew is a sports fan, to a dinner theatre musical if they are a fan of theatre, or to see The Nutcracker if they are a fan of dance. While these events may range in price from free to pricey, this is a special treat and time spent with you that they will treasure.

, While spoiling your nieces and nephews is fun, you want to make sure that you aren’t doing anything that will have negative consequences for you or for them. For example, you might let your five year old niece stay up an hour beyond her bedtime to finish watching a movie with you, but you don’t want to let her stay up until midnight. Likewise, you might like to take your teenage nephew out for dinner and a ball game, but you shouldn’t be giving him beers while he is in your care.

See a therapist.,
Volunteer or become an activist.",How to Be a Good Parent with a Chronic Illness," Know that having a home that isn’t 100% clean isn’t a big deal. If the chores have to wait a day so that you have the energy to spend quality time with your family, that is more than acceptable.Your kids won’t remember that your rugs weren’t vacuumed or the clothes weren’t always put away, but they will remember that you tried your best to spend as much time with them as possible.
If you can afford it, invest in a housekeeper to help you preserve your energy.
Give your children age-appropriate chores so that they can help take on some of the housework responsibilities.;
, Accept your new reality that you will have some good days, and you will also have some bad days. One way to combat the bad days is to celebrate when they are good.


Go for a walk, catch a movie, or participate in an activity in which you can’t normally.
Keep a diary of how you felt during the good days. This will help you identify factors that contribute to having good days and will also help you stay positive during the tough times.For example, in your diary, you could write a detailed description of a wonderful day you had out with your children at the park. Include how you felt physically and emotionally, what you did, and how your children acted. When you are not feeling so well, you can reflect back on good days like this as a reminder of special times you've shared.

, Do your best to avoid setting limitations for your children because of your disease. If you live with chronic pain and are hesitant to participate in certain activities, do what you can to not let your children see your fear or anxiety, as it may cause them to feel the same way.


Instead, emphasize healthy living by doing as much as a healthy person would, when you can. Doing so can help your children and those around you enjoy their lives as much as possible.Try to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet, exercise according to your physical abilities, and encourage everyone in your household to get enough sleep. Leading a healthy lifestyle will not only support your physical well-being with a chronic illness, but it will also lift your mood and make you feel more positive about your condition.
Be compliant with treatment recommendations, which might include medication, physical therapy, specific exercises at home, psychotherapy, or other interventions.

, Know that you don’t always have to say “yes” to everything you are asked to do. Although you likely don’t want others to think that you are using your illness as an excuse to not participate in everything, you do need to take your health and well-being into consideration.


Be especially cautious of committing to recurring obligations. You never know how you'll feel when that day rolls around, and you may end up resentful of having to participate.
For your children, create a special word or phrase that lets them know that Mom or Dad isn’t feeling up to it. You can simply say this word to signal to them that today just isn’t a good day for you. Consider words like “Out of commission” or “Temporarily down for upgrades.” Such phrases offer a light way to discuss a difficult subject.

, Devise a plan that allows you to count on others for child care. Healthy parents find taking care of their children all of the time difficult, so attempting to do everything by yourself as someone with a chronic illness can be quite challenging, if not impossible.


Ask friends, family, and other loved ones to take your child sometimes so that you can rest or have some time to yourself. Doing so is especially important when you’re not feeling well.For instance, simply say ""Mom, I haven't been feeling well the past few days. Can you take the kids over the weekend so that I can recuperate a bit?"" More than likely, your loved ones will be thrilled to help out--they just may not know how they can.
You can even arrange for recurring ""time off"" to ensure that you get your rest regularly. This can be as rigid or flexible of a schedule as you want, and it keeps you from having to ask each time and feel guilt.

, Chronically ill people who seek out social support feel a greater sense of peace and life satisfaction.You probably cannot do much to change the condition of your health, but you don't have to manage it alone.


Say to a friend or family member, ""I've been feeling really down on myself lately. Why don't we go see a movie over the weekend?"" Or, you could simply say ""I'm in a bad place. Can we talk?""

, Enlist the help of others when it comes to holding your children accountable for their actions. Since discipline is all about being hands-on, parents with chronic illness may have difficulty catching up with little ones and putting them in time out or instilling whatever type of discipline they deem appropriate.Therefore, they may need the help of a spouse, partner, or other close friend or relative. If the parents don’t have help, they risk the chance of letting the child get away with too much, which can lead to serious behavioral problems.
Have regular discussions about house rules, what is acceptable and not, and how consequences will be administered with anyone who is disciplining your children. It's important for all parties to present a united front.

, Plan playdates with friends’ kids to keep your kids occupied and allow them to have some fun, so that you can sit back and rest. When other kids are around, they can “entertain” your child so you don’t have to.


When you feel up to it, call your friends and pick up their kids for a play date so that you can return the favor.You can also sign up your child for an extracurricular activity of their choosing to help keep them socially engaged and give you a break.

, Join a support group so that you can talk with others who are experiencing the same difficulties and joys that you are, too. Support groups can offer emotional support, as well as ideas on how to maneuver through obstacles and challenges your illness can bring.


Online support groups are also available for those who don’t want to leave their home or who can’t find support groups in their area., Know that you are not your illness. You are capable of having a good life, but you’ll need to first try and stop focusing on your illness. Excessively ruminating or worrying about the future will only lead to depression or anxiety.


Try to stop asking yourself, “Why me?” and “What if it gets worse?” Although easier said than done, focusing on the positive aspects of your life instead of the negative can make your situation more manageable.Try designating a short time every few days to allow yourself to process negative emotions and ""feel sorry for yourself."" When this starts to pop up at other times, redirect yourself to save it for that designated time so that you can grieve properly and also find a positive balance.

, Take care of yourself before you care for others. As a parent, putting your needs before your child’s or even your spouse’s is probably foreign, but your health is paramount.


If you are feeling worse because you aren’t able to care for yourself, everyone else suffers, too. Make sure you go to the doctor’s, get the rest you need, and take time for yourself to make everyone’s lives better., Gain a greater sense of control by working with your health care providers to develop a treatment plan for your illness.


Research doctors in other branches of medicine who may be able to provide you with insight. Consider alternative treatments like acupuncture or herbal supplements. Feeling like you are doing something to get better can help ease your anxiety about having a chronic condition.

, Visit a counselor or therapist to talk about what you are experiencing. Finding a therapist who specializes in chronic illness can make all the difference in the world, as not all counselors are helpful in this area.


A therapy session can help to get things off of your chest and help you devise a plan as to how to make your life more manageable and acceptable.It’s an especially good idea to talk with a therapist if you’re experiencing symptoms of depression such as: fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of hopelessness.

, Consider helping others who struggle with the chronic illness you have. This puts a positive spin on something that can often feel like a negative aspect of your life. Contact local support groups and become involved in whatever way you can."

When you go shopping and your son sees that new video game that everyone has, there's no doubt he's gonna ask: "" Dad/mom, can I have it?"" Don't yell No! and leave. If its too much money just say maybe next time or for your birthday/Christmas/Easter. If it's not that much money just buy it for him but make him clean his room, set the table, wash the dishes,etc. This way he will learn to do his chores and get the toy/ game that he's been wanting;
, Boys don't like buying clothes,but people judge you on how much money you have by the way you dress. If he wears a baggy stained shirt and super tight athletic shorts people aren't going to think of you as someone with much money. Just buy him some Nike shorts and a t-shirt from Target for the summer and some jeans and a jacket for the winter.

, If he calls his sister stupid don't yell at him. It's not q big deal. He. was just mad and let it slip out. Just tell him to apologize. Don't spank him or ground him for a week. If he punches his brother, same thing. If they don't look hurt just let one kid get back at the other. Example: if Nate punches Mike in the arm just tell Mike to give Nate a little punch. Most boys believe in revenge so this will seem normal to them.

, Boys are into things like Pokémon, Bakugan, video games, etc. If your son loves Pokémon buy a deck or use some of his cards and battle. If he likes Bakugan, get a starter pack ($10) and battle with him or use some of his Bakugan and battle with him. Let him teach you how to play these games. It will make him feel smart. Also let him make up his own rules.

, If he wants to be a knight and save the princess, let him! You can buy him a foam sword and pretend to be a dragon. It's always fun to play pretend. If he wants to be a ninja or a pirate, let him do what ever he desires, as long as its safe.

, Let him have a nice big room with his toys and a bed. If you have an extra room turn it into the playroom. This way your son will have a nice place to play. Get a dog, a cat, a guinea pig, or a hamster. These are great pets to have. It also teaches kids about having children of there own. Buy a trampoline or a pool. This helps him exercise and have fun at the same time.

, A long trip in the car is never fun but especially for the driver. Not only do they need to operate the vehicle, but they have to listen to a kid in the back ask ""Are we there yet?"" Every five seconds.Get him a portable game system like a 3DS or make a box filled with toys that he can play with in the car. You could also just get a car with a T.V.

, When your kids are in a fight don't say things like ""I thought you were better than this"" or "" When I was a kid I never fought with my siblings"". Just ask them what happened and take them to see a movie or something afterwards.

, You don't think you are embarrassing but to kids, you can be sometimes. When you drop them off at school don't give them a big hug and say I love you! Give them a small hug and a light punch on the arm and say ""Bye *Name*, see you later!""

, All kids want to know that they are loved no matter what age they are.

, It is equally important to be able to actually love her for being all that she is unto you. You, her husband, are no more of an individual (nor no less, as well) than her. This means that you cannot give either more or less importance to your own individuality than you would give to hers. If you have been doing so without realizing it, now is always the time to stop. If she is given to servility, it becomes your duty automatically to point it out to her and ask her to stop being servile.

, When you happen to doubt her integrity, as will happen between any two persons staying together in any given environment for a time, it is most important that you have a heart-to-heart talk with her on the matter and sort things out at the earliest.

, While she might make sacrifices, in an effort to 'adjust,' it is up to you to ensure that she makes none that you do not share in or know of. If you only know of any sacrifices she has made, it is up to you to reciprocate and make it worth her effort. How you do it is entirely up to you, but do it you must.

, If you are the provider in the family, you must, naturally, 'provide'. It is your primary duty and is no obligation to those for whom you provide.

,
Have them take the sacraments including Holy Communion (called the Lord's Supper) regularly, as Jesus said, ""as often as you do this, do it in remembrance of me"", as well as to get baptized as Christ was.,
Be filled with the Holy Spirit who according to the Bible -- is not to make you perfect or complacent -- but as Jesus promised, this ""comforter"" will join you in your difficulties and be your ""guide"" through troubles to stay with you forever, and will help bring the Gospel to ""memory"" when you speak of it.

,
Make a tradition of giving thanks at meals -- and appreciating all your blessings, expect blessings for following the beatitudes, from Jesus' ""Sermon on the Mount"".

,
Attend church with them every Saturday or Sunday.,
Teach them about various types of Christian music, such as traditional hymns, Gospel, chants, etc.,
Remind them that Jesus has taught us many things such as:


Repent -- change your mind and turn around in the direction to follow Jesus.,
Recall what Jesus said including, It is needed that I go away to my Father so that He shall send you a comforter and guide that shall be with you forever -- called The Spirit of Christ, God's Holy Spirit (The Holy Ghost), The Breath of God -- to inspire and encourage you and you shall receive power to be witnesses (giving clear, accurate testimonies)...

,
Choose reasonable Biblical discipline.,

Make a good, proactive example for your children in your own life together of how to live well. Be faithful to Christ, not just on Sunday nor only at special times.;
,,



Don't just tell them about serving, but show them how to love others such as their neighbors.

Jesus also said ""love your enemies""; so be kind and thoughtful, to all people though you must not give in to or assist their wrong or harmful ways.



, So, show the children love, being gracious and loving to their mother and protecting, working and giving your best.

,, Don't make harsh threats, but good, joyful promises. Do what you say, and say what you actually do...

, Eventually, after teaching them, they can come to know Him as an extreme friend who sticks closer than a brother or sister, and as the ultimate Lord and Savior.

, Start with a simplified version for children. Find children's Biblical, story videos that are engaging, good and accurate about God, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.

, Teach them to pray, along with reading about Jesus. Have a ""family altar time"" such as evening prayer, explain and teach the Lord's Prayer, and to worship by singing to lift up Jesus Christ. Glorify God by your and their everyday lives, not just by rare or special occasions.

, Get them to explain what it means to receive Jesus and to be baptized while kids. Do this process again when children are young teenagers to help them to remember and mature in Christ.

,, Have them do so when they are adolescents or pre-adolescent but only when they understand that they are ""accountable"" for their own conduct and lives (what they say, or don't say -- and do, or don't do as they should).

,,, This will help them to understand to realize he's the Messianic Savior that God promised. The only way he fulfilled the promise of Messiah was being nailed to a cross and dying for your sins -- but in 3 days, He was raised from the dead by the Heavenly Father, and allow no doubt or wavering to be entertained or given any part in that understanding!

Forgive others their wrongs -- knowing then you will be forgiven;
Be a peacemaker -- not being a troublemaker, not high tempered, but ""be at peace as much as it is up to you.""
Judge not/condemn not -- remembering ""there is no condemnation in Christ Jesus"";

,, Bring each child in line with justifiable consequences and rules. Time out, grounding, seating in a corner are chooses. Moderate spanking is a choice, but severe beating is not necessary nor good.


Do not spoil the child by pampering and catering to every wish, and not lying or covering up for him or her when guilty of crime or such.
Let them know that, if they disappoint you repeatedly, then consequences will increase in a kind but firm manner.

, Be kind and loving by reasoning, not in anger, rage and spitefulness.

"
Make yourself responsible for all present and future well-being of your child from the day he/she is born and do it with a glad heart.,
You do not necessarily have to fulfill each and every whim of the child.,
Be consistently and constantly committed to the present and future well-being of your child.,
Show and receive trust.,
Be a guide not a best friend.,
Feel free to make positive inferences from all of the above.",How to Be a Good Husband and Father2," A father should not bear any grudges or misgivings as to the sex, the colour of the skin, or any other trait of his child - whether own or adopted. If a father has any such doubts in his mind, he is immediately and naturally deprived of the capacity to be a good father.

, Instead, select the best of everything that will genuinely benefit the child while not burning your pockets.

, A good father must be willing to make sacrifices for his child's sake. If the child will benefit from staying away from home for educational or other purposes, the father has a natural capacity to bear separation. And he must employ it to good use. When not separated, his time, his ear, his patience, and his advice are some of the most valuable expendables that he can spend for his child. He must not ever be unwilling to spend these.

, The best measure of being a good father is reflected in the trust invested naturally in him by his child. Therefore, it is of critical importance that a father never betrays his child's trust in him.

, The child is not your partner. Your child needs you to provide not only food, toys, medicines, and so on. Your child needs you to pass on your accumulated wisdom, your strengths, and your goodwill. These will pass on naturally, you only need to intend them to.

, Remember, you can be whatever you want to be if you only intend genuinely.

"
Treat each child according to their individual needs.,
Involve yourself with each child individually.,
Talk to your children about their needs.,
Forgive blunders.",How to Avoid Showing Favoritism As a Parent1," In most cases, being fair to multiple children (or people in general) does not mean doing exactly the same thing for each. Instead, focus on meeting each child’s needs to the best of your abilities, and spread your energy and resources as best you can between your children. You will help each child develop a healthy relationship with you and their siblings and grow into a happy adult.For example, if you have one child that excels in math and one that doesn’t, you wouldn’t hire both of them a math tutor. Instead, you would hire one a math tutor to help out and provide the other with resources needed specifically for them.;
, Being involved with each child has a range of benefits for parents. It allows you to pinpoint the needs of each child and deliver them. It also makes each child feel special and loved equally. In addition, having regular time with each child will help you grow closer to your children.For example, you could choose one activity each week that you do with each child. For example, you could play catch, watch a movie, go bike riding, take a walk, etc. depending on what each individual child likes to do.
Also try rotating between an activity one child prefers each week and get their siblings to participate with the condition that they will get to do an activity they prefer in the future. This will show siblings that they are equally valued and help them to value each other as well.

, Parents often know intuitively what their children need. Even so, giving them the opportunity to tell you can help them feel valued and loved. Allow each child to tell you what their needs are, and do your best to discuss those needs and deliver on ones that are reasonable.Start getting into this habit by inquiring each day about how each child’s day went equally while genuinely listening to what they have to say.


For example, if your child says that they need your support to get to and from an extracurricular, you can give them a ride or provide them public transportation. However, if your child requests their own sports car to drive back and forth to the same event, you might be less inclined to oblige.

, Children are in the process of learning who they are and how they fit into the world. This inevitably leads to mistakes. Even when you have to address inappropriate behaviors in your children, forgive the incident after it has been handled. This lets you start each day equally with each child instead of harboring resentment from past missteps.For example, if one child is notorious for being rude, you should address the situation each time it comes up, but then let it go. If you hold onto the frustration, it can cause you to distance yourself from that child or to be harsher than you are with your other children.

"
"
Keep punishments equal.,
Settle disputes fairly.,
Avoid judging competitions.,
Leave them to their individual opinions.",How to Avoid Showing Favoritism As a Parent2," Make sure to keep punishments as equal as possible and avoid constantly singling out a child who engages in more inappropriate behavior in front of their siblings. This may cause them to act out more to get attention and may lead siblings to see them as a ""problem child.""

, It is easy to victimize one child and villainize the other when they aren’t getting along. After all, it’s human nature to see an aggressor and a victim, but this is not usually the case. Most of the time, your children need to work their issues out among themselves because they are both (or all) guilty of something. Taking a side will leave one child feeling unfairly judged.In cases that you do need to intervene (such as physical violence) you should give all children involved the same consequences.
For example, if your children are fighting because one child is trying to take a toy from the other, you can stay neutral by staying out of the squabble, or taking the toy from both children.

, When it comes to your children, there is no such thing as an objective observer. If you make the determination on which child “wins” something and which child “loses,” you are stepping into a trap. Even if one child clearly crossed the finish line first, the other(s) will feel that you are siding with their sibling.Instead, your role should be to praise each child for what they did well in the competition without taking sides.


For example, if you are asked to determine the winner of a drawing contest, choosing one child over the other(s) will make your children feel like you are choosing a favorite child. Instead, abstain from being the judge of this competition.

, Your children will have differing opinions on a range of things. While you may actually agree with one point of view and not the other, encourage unique thinking and communicate that it’s okay to have different opinions, likes, and dislikes. Allow them to each form their own opinions without supporting or undermining them. To side with one child leaves the other(s) feeling as though they are not favored equally.For example, if one child prefers comedy movies to suspenseful movies, do not dismiss or uphold either opinion. Even if you sway one way or the other, avoid undermining the child who thinks differently.

Act as the role model.,
Stop yourself from comparing.,
Analyze your behaviors periodically.",How to Avoid Showing Favoritism As a Parent3," When you act as the role model, you relieve that duty from your children. Never pressure an older child to taper their behaviors on behalf of setting a good example. This makes them feel as though you value the younger child more than you value them, which can build resentment over time. Instead, simply explain that their current behavior is not acceptable.For example, you might be tempted to say, “Set a good example for your sister by wearing a helmet anytime you ride your bike.” Instead, you should say something like, “It isn’t safe to ride your bike without a helmet. Always wear one.”

, Comparing your children to one another gives the illusion that you favor one child and can encourage a toxic sibling rivalry. Avoid this by focusing on each child and their needs. If you want one child to do something that another child is doing, encourage that behavior without using their sibling as leverage.For example, instead of saying something like, “You should lay down and go to sleep like your brother,” you should say something more like, “It is time for bed. What do you need to be able to go to sleep?”

, Accidentally favoring one child over another can happen. Observe how you are treating and talking to each of your children over time. If there are any discrepancies, fix them. Sibling rivalry can also point to one or more children feeling like you are showing favoritism. If it seems to be high, you might need to examine how you are treating each child.Make sure to be on the same page as your spouse. Each of you should provide treatment that is as equal, united, and consistent as possible.

Hire an occasional sitter for special occasions.

,, It does not have to be expensive, but try to vary the activities instead of doing the same thing every week. It will give you both something to look forward to and will relieve stress.

, If you don't have childcare planned well in advance it will be much more difficult to find someone to watch the baby.

,, If the child, especially younger children and babies become to used to another person, instead of their parent, they could become more attached to the other caretaker.

Take it slowly.",How to Avoid Being a Toxic Parent," If you get into an argument with your child, don’t let your ego get in the way of your relationship regardless of whether you are wrong or right. Try to remind yourself that you are the parent, and letting a fight drag on simply because you want to win is not good for your child or your relationship with them.Develop your conflict resolution skills. If you struggle with what to do when a problem arises between you and your child, then work on your conflict resolution skills. Developing ways to calm down, analyze the situation, and communicate effectively with your child will help to ensure that you do not behave like a toxic parent.
Your child will likely forget about who won or lost a certain fight, but they will probably remember how your actions during that fight made them feel about you and themselves. Thus, it is important to be as mature as possible. Don’t ignore your child or make them feel stupid.
If you’re not sure how to end a fight, try calmly telling your child you need a few minutes to yourself. Take this time to calm down if you need. When you’ve calmed down, return to your child, and apologize for fighting. You don’t even need to bring up what the fight was about or who was right/wrong. If you can’t bring yourself to apologize, you can at least say, “I don’t like it when we fight. Let’s go do something fun together instead.” Give them a hug, and remind them how much you love them.;
, For many parents, this can be difficult to do, especially if you tend to be overcritical of yourself. Many parents criticize their children because they simply want them to be the best they can be without realizing how this makes the child feel about themselves. Thus, it’s important to think before you speak when you talk with your child, especially when it comes to talking to them about their performance on something. Instead, act as a guide for your child. Remind yourself that your child is learning how to do things every day, and they need your help, not your judgments.


If you have a hard time grasping this, think about how you feel when someone you love criticizes you. It probably doesn’t make you feel good about yourself, even if you know it’s not true. Even the most secure people don’t enjoy being criticized.
If your child is doing something that you think should be done differently, avoid saying something like, “That’s such a dumb way to do that. Why would you think that’s a good idea?” Instead, say something more positive such as, “You’re doing great, can I show you how I normally do it? Then you can do it whichever way you prefer.” Remember that just because you do something a certain way doesn’t mean it is the best way. Even if it is the best way, it’s good to let your child have autonomy and figure some things out for themselves.

, One habit of many toxic parents is that they demand the attention of their children, especially when they are upset about something. Remind yourself, that, in your relationship with your child, you are not the center of attention, and your child probably doesn’t have the maturity or coping skills to make you the center of their attention. Even if they do, it is not fair to expect your child to act as your caretaker.This doesn’t mean that you can’t be honest with your child about emotions you might be having. For example, if you are feeling sad and your child asks you what’s wrong, you can tell them that you’re feeling sad because something happened that you didn’t want to happen. If it is appropriate, you can also tell them the reason you’re sad. However, you should also remind your child that you’ll be OK, you just need a bit of time to feel sad. You can do this rather than expect them to comfort you.

, Parenting is tough, so it is important to remember that making mistakes does not make you a toxic parent. Raising children can be very difficult, and occasionally, you might lose your cool. It is important to tell your child that you’re sorry, remind them that you love them very much, and explain to them why you lost your temper, but make it clear that it wasn’t because you think they are a bad kid.Forgive yourself. When you make a mistake, don’t beat yourself up over it. You can reflect on what happened and why you think it happened in order to do better in the future, but it won’t help you or your children to let yourself feel like a failure.

, Abuse is perhaps the worst thing that can happen to a child. The obvious forms of abuse are physical and sexual abuse. Both of these forms of abuse constitute completely unacceptable forms of behavior for a parent. However, a perhaps more common form of abuse is verbal abuse, which toxic parents are often guilty of using. This occurs whenever you say something to your child that harms their sense of self-worth or playing mind games aimed at putting you in control of your child’s emotions.Verbal abuse may not leave physical signs that the abuse happened, but it certainly leaves emotional scars that may afflict your child for the rest of your life.
Many parents aren’t aware of the research, which makes it clear that spanking is just as harmful to a child’s emotional well-being as other forms of physical abuse, such as slapping, punching, pinching, etc.If you have been spanking your child as a means of punishment, look for other, healthier ways to discipline your child for bad behavior. For example, take away a privilege and explain to them the reason that they have lost that privilege and when they can have it back.
When it comes to child sexual abuse, any form of sexual touching between a child and an adult is considered sexual abuse., If you realize that you have been abusing your child either physically, sexually, or verbally, you should recognize that you have a problem and stop immediately. Seeking professional help for your issues is perhaps the best way to deal with anger and control issues.The first thing you need to do is understand what abuse is. Stop trying to rationalize your behavior. Yes, parenting is tough, but abusing is never a good (or acceptable) way to deal with your frustration no matter how mad you might be.
In many cases, abusers often abuse because that’s how they were raised. Getting professional help to learn how to better deal with your anger and emotions is often the best way to stop the cycle.
One way to avoid abusing a child is to walk away from the situation when you feel that you are too frustrated or angry to deal with the situation rationally. Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it.

, It’s true what they say about kids being like sponges. During childhood, children are busy absorbing everything that goes on around them. As they become older, these experiences affect how they see the world and themselves.A child of a toxic parent often grows up feeling shameful and guilty about their choices, has low self-esteem, and a poor self-image.

, Unfortunately, children of toxic parents often grow up to become toxic parents themselves. This is because they often feel bad about themselves, and don’t have the sense of security needed to be any different. The only example they’ve had of parenting is your example, so they go off of what they know.It’s true that there are some children who grow up into adults that realize that they were raised by toxic parents, and who are able to break out of this cycle. Unfortunately, this is an exception rather than a rule. It takes tremendous self-discipline to re-train your brain to react differently, especially when it comes to behaviors we were taught as children.

, Though it may not happen right away, many children who grow up with toxic parents eventually realize that they cannot continue their relationship with their parents. There might be a huge fight that causes the break, or your child may simply explain to you that they cannot have you in their lives because you make them feel bad about themselves.Realize that if your child says this to you, it is as painful for you as it is for them. However, if you can’t or are unwilling to change your behavior, it is the best thing your child can do for themselves.
If this happens, you will have to spend a lot of time working on your own behavior in order to rebuild the relationship. This can be very difficult. You may find it useful to seek the help of a trained mental health professional who can help you identify your toxic behaviors, where they come from, and what you can do about them.
Respect your child’s wishes. If they say the need to cut off contact with, try to be respectful of that wish even though it may be painful for you. If you constantly badger them you are only proving their point. Once you have taken the time to deal with your issues, you might reach out gently. For example, you could write them a letter explaining that you know you were wrong and that you’ve sought help with your issues. Ask them respectfully if there is any chance that you two could start again. However, try to respect their wishes if they don’t respond positively.

, In order to begin healing, the first thing you will need to do is apologize. This apology shouldn’t be a simple, “I’m sorry.” Rather, you need to sit down with your child and explain to them exactly what you’re sorry for. Don’t expect this to be an easy conversation, because it won’t be. It’s important that you set your ego aside for this conversation. Remember that, if you have been a toxic parent, it is your fault. Yes, your child might have done a lot of things to push you to the edge, but that doesn’t excuse your behavior. Thus, you should avoid saying things like, “I’m really sorry for the things I said to you, but you just made it impossible for me to stay sane.” Even if you feel like your behavior was justified in some cases, you won’t heal your relationship with your child by placing the blame on them.
Don’t expect your child to just forgive you. This might happen, but if it doesn’t happen right away then you have to respect that they need time to process what you’ve said. Be prepared for the fact that they might never be able to forgive you, especially if you don’t take steps to work on your behavior.

, If your child is willing to talk with you, they may have a lot to say, and a lot of it may be very painful for you to hear. However, it is important that you allow them to get it all off their chest, and to show them that you are listening.When they are talking, do your best not to interrupt. It will be tempting to justify your behavior or disagree with something they are saying, but if you want to repair your relationship, you have to try and understand where they are coming from, even if it is painful for you.

, Tell your child what you are doing to change. For example, if you are working with a counselor to learn how to react differently, tell them this. Your child needs to understand exactly how and why things will be different. For example, you can say, “I know that I’ve made a lot of mistakes, and I don’t always know why I did those things. I decided to go to a counselor to learn how to be better for you.”Now that your child knows what to expect, it’s extremely important that you stick to what you said. If you do something that deviates from what you said, immediately change your behavior and acknowledge that you messed up. It is difficult to change, but when you learn to catch your behavior, you are on the right path.

, If you and your child are really struggling to get back on track, but you both are willing to work at it, it may be helpful to go to counseling together. Having a trained and objective person to help guide both of you down the path to rebuilding your relationship together can be really helpful. Especially if you are struggling to understand why you do the things you do.If there have been really traumatic experiences in your past relationship with your child, it will likely be very difficult to deal with those issues without the help of a therapist.
Don’t force your child to go to counseling if they say they aren’t interested or don’t want to. Effective therapy often requires a willingness to engage in the process. If one person is not interested, it’s unlikely that it will be helpful.

, If you are trying to repair your relationship with your child after years of toxic parenting, remember that it won’t be easy at all. It will be painful for both of you, and at times, one or both of you might feel like giving up.


When you are struggling, remind yourself that it takes a lot of courage to admit you were wrong. It also takes a tremendous amount of self-awareness to reflect on your own bad behavior and become aware of the sources of your toxic parenting.
If your child is willing, try to take small steps towards having a more positive relationship with each other. For example, don’t spend all your time together re-hashing the past. Instead, try to do something fun together. For example, take them to a movie of their choice, make them their favorite meal, or go mini-golfing.

Use replacement words.",How to Avoid Using Harmful Language with Kids," You might be thinking, “You’re so annoying” or, “How could you be so stupid?” Yet, do not say these things to your kid. This can hurt your child’s feelings and affect their self-esteem.Remember that there are times you feel overwhelmed and encounter things that you do not understand well.


If you’re feeling impatient with your child, take a deep breath before saying anything. Instead of saying, “Why can’t you understand this?” say, “What part is confusing to you?” or, “Should we take a break and come back to this later?”;
, If you find yourself saying, “You’re just like your father” or, “Why can’t you behave more like your sister?” Statements like this can cause your child to feel ashamed of their similarities with their father or feel pangs of rejection whenever their father is criticized. When you compare your children, it can increase feelings of sibling rivalry or that one sibling is preferred over the other.If you’re tempted to say this, it’s best to say nothing at all. Recognize that you’re frustrated but don’t take it out on your kid.

, Some parents are quick to say, “You’re okay” or, “Stop crying. You’re fine.” While children need to learn how to handle stress and pain, it’s important for them to feel heard, especially when hurt. Even if you think your child is overreacting, acknowledge the way they feel.Saying “you’re okay” or, “don’t cry” does not comfort your child.


Offer a hug and say, “You hurt your knee! That must feel painful” or, “You didn’t like it when grandma went away and it made you feel sad.”

, If your child tends to take their time getting ready in the morning or in finishing tasks, avoid telling your child to do it faster. You might catch yourself saying, “Hurry up!” or, “We’re going to be late if you don’t get done.” Telling your child to hurry creates stress, which can overwhelm your child and not encourage them to get moving. Instead, wake your child up earlier to allow for the slow start.If your child struggles to do simple activities, make a game out of it. Say, “Wanna race to put on our shoes?”

, If your child constantly gets the message that “Mommy is busy” or, “Daddy needs to work,” they will begin to think you don’t have time for them. They may stop asking for your attention with the assumption that you will say “no.” If you need some alone time, let your kids know in advance.Say, “I need to finish something important, so I need you to play quietly until I’m done. Once I’m done, we can go to the park.”

, If you’re losing weight, keep it to yourself. Don’t talk to your child about dieting, food restriction, or weighing yourself. This can create a negative self-image or create a desire to do these things, too. If your child asks about your eating habits or exercise habits, say, “I like the way eating healthy and exercising feels.”If your child asks about you losing weight, say, “Sometimes our bodies make changes based on what we eat or how we treat them.”

, Instead of telling what behaviors you don’t want to see, ask them for the behaviors you do want. For example, instead of saying, “No, don’t run,” say, “Please walk when you’re indoors.” Correct your child’s behavior by saying what you’d like to see and praising the positive behaviors.Instead of saying, “Don’t touch!” say, “This is fragile and we don’t want it to break. Please look with your eyes and not with your hands.”

, If you’re feeling frustrated or annoyed with your child and are ready to let them know that they’re being annoying or obnoxious, listen to what they are saying and ask them to rephrase it. Offer a feeling word to help your child identify what they may feel. Finally, listen to your child and validate their experience. Let them finish telling their story without cutting them off.If your child won’t stop complaining, say, “I can see this is making you upset. What’s upsetting about it?”
You can also say, “Oh, that sounds like something sad. Were you feeling sad?”

, A child can be scared if they hear their parents arguing or fighting. If you fight when your child is home or asleep, close the door and fight away from the child. Avoid name-calling, excessive yelling, screaming, or breaking things. This can make a child feel unsafe and anxious.Even if your child is asleep, they can wake up and hear you fighting and become scared. Keep your language as civil as possible to avoid any potential harm to your child.

, If you use hurtful or harmful language in front of or at a child, let the child know that you were wrong and apologize. This helps to communicate that sometimes people make mistakes and that you can be accountable for your own errors. It can also help the child feel less scared or affected.


Say to your child, “I lost my temper. I know that it scared you, and I’m sorry.”

, Whether the sentiment is directed at your child, partner, or your ex, avoid saying intentionally hurtful words to other family members, especially in front of your children. Especially if you’re using a word to hurt or insult somebody, think twice before saying it.Let all family members know that it’s not okay to insult someone by calling them a name and correct it every time if it does happen. Say, “That’s not okay to say about her.”

, Cuss words can be used in a variety of contexts, and with kids, context matters. You may feel okay with using a swear word in reference to events or situations, but not toward people. Sometimes, swear words can denote pleasure or happiness and other times, they can be hugely insulting and hurtful. If you’re helping your child to know the difference, correct any missteps in your family.Teach children the nuances of language. Some parents feel okay swearing in front of their children, but forbid their children from using those words, as they are “adult speech.”
If a family member crosses a line, say something. For example, say, “We don’t allow that kind of talk in the house.”

, If you’re worried about your child hearing you swear, use other words to help curb the habit. For example, many people say the words, “dang it” or “shoot” instead of swear words. If you’re trying to kick the habit but need a little help, try making up your own words. This can help you express the emotion you feel while also avoiding cussing in front of a child.


Especially if using these words in front of children (whether on purpose or by accident), the sillier the better.

Discuss ways to respond to prejudice.",How to Avoid Teaching Your Kids Prejudices," Before you even begin to talk with your kids about prejudice and judgmental attitudes, you need to be aware of your own biases. Even if you don't consider yourself to be prejudiced against others, you might realize that you're uncomfortable around some people. Think about why you might feel this way.


For example, you might realize that you're uncomfortable around people of other religions. Maybe this is because you were never exposed to people outside of your own faith as you were growing up.;
, Don't be shocked or surprised if your young kids make comments that are obvious or insensitive. Young kids pay attention to differences among people and they're curious about why others aren't like them. Your kids may simply state the differences or they may make a hurtful joke if they're a little older. This does not mean that your kids are prejudiced. It just means you need to talk with them about being sensitive to others.Avoid reacting with anger or shaming your kids when they say something prejudiced. This will make them less likely to want to talk with you about it.

, Talk honestly with your kids about how people are unique. While you might think you're being impartial by saying that there aren't differences between people, this won't teach your kids how to interact with others. It also minimizes aspects that often define people. If your child says something obvious, acknowledge the observation and talk about it.For example, if one of your kids says, ""Look at his brown skin!"" respond to the statement. You could say, ""Yes, he has brown skin. Do you know anyone else with brown skin?""

, Once you've started a conversation with your kids, ask them if there's anything they want to know about what they've seen or experienced. Be honest and specific when answering their questions to avoid misunderstanding. Avoiding the question or changing the subject will make your kids feel like they're asking about something shameful.You can explain to your kids that it's fine to notice differences in other people, but that you shouldn't think better or worse about them because of these differences.

, Kids of any age can be curious about others so talk with them as soon as they begin pointing out differences. Tailor your answers and discussion so they're age appropriate. When talking with young kids (under 7), talk about the differences and remind them of the similarities that all people have.If your kids are older (over 10), you can have similar talks, but ask people of different religions, genders, ethnic groups, and learning abilities to talk with your kids.

, Find out what prompted your kids' interest in differences. One of the best ways to learn about what your kids are exposed to is to be involved in their school. Talk with their teachers and try to find out if your kids are being excluded from activities because of prejudiced classmates. Find out what their classmates are like and their backgrounds.


If your kids are asking prejudiced questions or statements, but not because of things they're seeing at school, consider what they're watching on television. Or think about what they're experiencing in your neighborhood.

, Once you're aware of your own biases, you can make an effort to be more inclusive and understanding of others. Your kids will watch you and learn what is acceptable behavior. This also means that you need to stand up to prejudice and discrimination when you see it.For example, if you hear someone making offensive jokes, tell them that you don't want to hear it around you or your kids. Let them know that what they're saying is hurtful.

, Part of raising kids who aren't prejudiced is raising them to have good opinions of themselves and others. Kids who are sympathetic to the feelings of those around them won't be as judgmental or critical. Let your kids know that you care for them and are proud of them.When you notice your kids doing a good job of treating people well or being kind, tell them how proud you are.

, If your kids are surrounded by people who are of a similar background, they may be surprised when they learn of people's differences. Try to expose your kids to people with backgrounds and experiences that are different than their own. This will make your kids feel more comfortable and accepting.For example, you could sign your kids up for team sports in an integrated community or get books and toys that show people of different ethnic backgrounds or genders.

, While it may seem helpful to devote a day or holiday to talk about a specific culture, that's actually not the best way to involve your kids. Instead of isolating a different culture, religion, or figure to a holiday, involve these people and experiences in everyday life.You could take your kids to museums that teach them about the history of oppressed groups. You could also take your kids to several places of worship or cultural events to expose them to as many diverse people as possible.

, If your kids are older, talk with them about how they can react when they see discrimination. Help them come up with a good way to respond to classmates they may see discriminating against other classmates. If something in particular bothers your kids, find a way to reach out and address the prejudice.For example, if your kids like a certain television show, but don't like the way a character is stereotyped or discriminated against, write a letter with your kids to the television producer. Let the producer know that those attitudes are harmful and you want them to stop.

Teach your child simple self-control methods.",How to Avoid Arguments with Gifted Kids," It is important for parents and caregivers to understand and differentiate between the two parenting styles of authoritarian and authoritative, as the two terms are often misunderstood.

An authoritarian parent is one who is concerned with strict order and control over everything. Authoritarian parents are typically black and white thinkers, and believe in one way of doing things, which is their way, without much (if any) variation for the child to express their freedom and individuality.
Children who are raised in households where authoritarian parenting was used may grow to rebel against authority later on in life, or they may become indecisive often relying on others to make decisions for them.
An authoritative parent or caregiver will have set rules and guidelines for their children and follow through with the consequences if the rules and guidelines are not adhered to. An authoritarian parent is typically consistent with their expectations and feedback for their children. There is an allowance for the child to express their individuality, and freedom as long as it is expressed responsibly and safely.
Studies have shown that the authoritative parenting style is the best approach to take for all children, gifted or not, as it allows all children to grow to be independent and responsible creative thinkers. Children raised in authoritative households typically will grow up to be reasonable responsible risk takers, and are confident with themselves and the life that they live.;
, Arguing back will only fuel your gifted child’s debate, elongate the argument, and reinforce argumentation as an effective communication strategy. A gifted child may present a logical argument such as, “Why should I have to go to sleep when it’s still light out?” You can respond by saying, “Bedtime is at eight o’clock. We can revisit your summer bedtime tomorrow, but you will not be allowed to watch television tomorrow since you did not go to be on time tonight.”, Gifted children are talented at attempting to argue their way out of abiding by the rules. If a child knows that arguing will eventually result in you changing the rules or allowing them to get their way, they will continue to push you. Be firm and consistent with rules, and do not deviate or your child will think that rules can be broken, and that arguing is a way to achieve their goals.If the consequence for not completing homework on time is the removal of television privileges for three days, be consistent. Stick to the three day consequence rather than giving in after only one day.

, As with any relationship, a parent must choose their battles with a gifted child. Rules should be consistent, fair, and appropriate to the child’s age and developmental stage. For example, it is appropriate that a four-year-old does not play in the street and that your sixteen-year-old does not stay out until two o’clock in the morning. It might, however, be unreasonable to demand that your teenager dress the way you want them to. This might not be a battle worth fighting., Arguments with gifted children often arise out of the child’s perception that others’ rules make no sense and desire to feel in control. While you need to maintain control and set rules in general, letting your child make some rules in a controlled setting will allow them to feel a sense of control. This, in turn, can curb conflict and argument.Allow your child to make a rule about cleaning their room. For example, allow them to choose the day or days each week that the room must be cleaned.
Try negotiating a curfew with your teenager. For example, start with a low offer of 8:30pm and allow the teen to negotiate a 10:00pm policy.

, When the parent or caregiver praises the child’s accomplishments, rather than their efforts, they minimize the work that the child put forth into their endeavor. Empower your child and build their resiliency by praising their efforts and the process they have undergone.

This will teach your gifted child that accomplishments and success are not measured by a final product. They will learn to have more appreciation for the steps that were taken throughout their process of completing a goal or accomplishing a task, as well as the end result.

, Arguments with gifted children often arise from problems that include the child and the family as a whole. Recognizing the problem is the first step in creatively and effectively addressing solving problems and avoiding arguments. Sit down with your family members and ask everyone to talk about the problem. Conflicts over using communal space and objects, respecting the property of other family members, and taking turns are all common conflicts that should be recognized as family, rather than individual problems.Trying saying, ""Kids, it seems like we have a problem sharing television time. There have been multiple arguments about it this week. Let's each take a turn and talk about what we think the problem is.""

, Finding out what the “real” problem is will help your family address the issue and avoid arguments. For example, your family might identify shoes being left on the stairs as a problem. Ask family members why shoes are being left on the stairs. Refrain from judgment until everyone has responded. Next ask, “How can we work together as a family to solve this problem?” This strategy will avoid arguments with a gifted child who might say, “Dad leaves his shoes on the stairs, so I’m not picking up mine!”Try saying, ""Let's each take a turn and talk about what we think is the cause of this problem. We will all listen to each other talk, and will not speak until it is our turn.""

, Refrain from criticism, welcome off-the-wall ideas, and encourage combining ideas as your family works together to come up with a solution. It’s important that your gifted child and all members of the family feel their ideas are being recognized. Suggest combining ideas from different family members as you work toward a resolution.Try saying, ""Let's come up with some solutions to the problem. I'm going to write them all down, even if they seem wacky. Once we all have a chance to talk about our ideas for solutions, we will put our heads together and come up with a strategy that works for everyone.""
Once you come up with alternative solutions, evaluate the ideas based on criteria like feasibility, usefulness, and how much time it might take to institute the solution.

, Once your family has come up with solutions, evaluated them, and decided on the best one, it’s time to turn the idea into an action. Include your gifted child and all members of the family in developing a plan to implement the solution. During this phase, come up with possible obstacles you might face in the implementation and how you can address them as families and as individuals.Try saying, ""It looks like we can avoid the mess on the stairs if we place a basket there for everyone to put their shoes in. Are there any obstacles you think we might run into with this solution? How can we solve them?""

, Empathy, or the ability to understand or share another person’s feelings and experiences, is at the core of our experience as humans. Being able to understand another person’s perspective and valuing perspectives other than our own is key to cultivating meaningful, compassionate relationships with others. Empathy can help your child take someone else’s perspective into account, which, in turn, can help the child avoid arguments with others.Tell your child about a time you felt sad about something. Ask them to think about a time when they also felt sad about something similar.

, Empathizing with your child will help them develop a secure attachment to you, facilitating their adoption of your values and modeling of your behavior. This will help your child build empathy for others, taking the needs and emotions of others into consideration.When your child is upset or happy about something, ask them to share their feelings with you. Then think about a time when you had similar emotions. Talk to your child about how you felt at that time, and explain how that past experience helps you understand how your child might feel in the present.

, It’s important that your child has opportunities to nurture their capacity for empathy and regularly consider the feelings, needs, and perspectives of others. Providing these opportunities can help you avoid arguments with a gifted child as they will cultivate their capacity to understand why, for example, you need help with chores after a long day of work.Try holding regular family meetings where you discuss conflicts and challenges. Ask family members to talk about their perspective and feelings on a particular matter.

, When your child is angry, sad, or frustrated about something, encourage them to talk you about these feelings and why, exactly, they might be feeling a particular way. While you may not accept the bad behavior or argumentative tactics that accompany a child’s emotions, they need to know that all feelings are okay – even the bad ones!When your child is sad, try saying, ""Anna, you seem upset. What are you feeling today? Do you want to talk about it?""

, Gifted children will often argue with parents or other authority figures when they feel their emotions, thoughts, and perspectives are not being recognized. Never ignore your child’s emotions or assess them as being overly dramatic. Instead, recognize their feelings as valid at all times, and especially during conflicts that could quickly turn into an argument.For example, if your child is angry because you asked them to clean their room, do not dismiss their feelings. Try asking, ""John, are you feeling angry about this situation? Let's talk about why you feel this way.""

, Avoiding arguments with gifted children can begin with self-control. Practice a deep breathing approach with your child. First, take a deep breath through the nose. Next, exhale slowly as you count to five. Practice this with your child. When you see them getting upset, or when they begin arguing with you, practice the approach together. This will help both parent and child maintain a sense of calm and avoid explosive arguments."

Inspect the plant for bugs (most plants won't show bugs in the greenhouse but they will show up after about two weeks in the home).,
If you want to keep over that particular plant, several applications of soapy water to the plant and potting soil should rid it of most infestations.,
Place the plant in a cool (not cold) room with curtain filtered sunlight and cut back on the watering.,
Decide what kind of plant you want to end up with for Christmas.,
Do not set the plant in full sun at first.,
Start watering regularly.,
When it is time to bring the plant in for fall, start the processes of turning the top leaves red (or pink or whatever color they were last winter).",How to Keep Poinsettias Growing To Next Christmas1," If the plant is infected, it is best to throw it out and purchase another for keeping over.;
, Mealy bugs are the main concern and can be removed by dabbing them with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol. However, this should be done before the infection spreads or gets too large or you may never kill them all.

, The plant should be allowed to go dry to the touch between watering and be watered only sparingly (over-watering is the leading cause of plant death in the winter months inside, the plant is not actively growing and is not taking up the normal food it would during the growing season, and if watered to much the plant will end up sitting in water and problems like moss, mold, rot and leaf yellow may accrue). When the temperatures at night get above 10 C, the plant can then be moved outside.

, If a small bushy plant is your goal, the entire plant should be trimmed down to about ""inches above the main trunk. If you want a larger plant, simply pinch the tops of each main branch and continue this until about July. If a topiary is your goal, then remove all of the branches except for the tallest, straightest main branch and do not pinch the plant on the top, just remove the side shoots for the remainder of the season.

, Doing this will cause what leaves are left to scorch and fall off and may kill the weakened plant. Place the plant in full shade then move the plant out of the shade in two weeks to part shade then two weeks later to full or part sun for the remainder of the season. This will allow the plant to harden off and get used to the new conditions outside.

, Fertilize every fifth watering or every two weeks (whichever comes last) with a poinsettia fertilizer or house plant fertilizer. Or, if you would like, try a diluted evergreen fertilizer to help promote leaf growth (at this stage all you want is leaf growth, no flowers).

, This process can take up to 2 months and sometimes longer, depending on conditions and the variety of plant you have.


Switch from a nitrogen based fertilizer to an even houseplant fertilizer or one made for poinsettias, and reduce fertilizing by half.
Begin the routine of long nights/short days needed to initiate buds: 13 hours of uninterrupted darkness, 11 hours of bright sunshine each day. Keep temperatures in the low 60's at night. Turn pot regularly for even light. (Note: Darkness must be total - light from a street lamp or even that cast by headlights from passing cars is enough to disrupt bud formation.)
Discontinue darkness routine after about 2 months and place plant in the sunniest window in the house. Reduce fertilizer: don't over water!

Meltdowns in response to minor challenges.
An inability to entertain themselves for even a short time.
Asking for help immediately without even trying to solve a problem.
Expecting rewards or bribes in order to do anything.
Constantly having to repeat yourself to your child.
Feeling pressure to shield your child from failure or disappointment.;
, One mistake parents make is overpraising their children for the most basic accomplishment or task. This can cause your child to develop self-centered tendencies as they may come to believe that every single thing they do is major. While you should certainly recognize your child when they do well, taking care of basic responsibilities should rarely be praised.Don’t brag about your child’s accomplishments to your friends or others. Share in a way that is non-showy.

, Just as you should not overpraise your child, avoid overly criticizing them as well. This will also cause your child to magnify the importance of their actions if you are constantly reminding them of what they are doing wrong. Learn to pick your battles with your child and choose to correct them on the important things. Let the small things go.


For instance, if your child talks back to an adult, this should always be corrected. However, if you are constantly telling them to tuck their shirt in, consider letting that battle go at least temporarily.

, The proverb goes that you can give a man a fish and he will eat for a day, but if you teach a man to fish, he will eat for a lifetime. Adopt this doctrine with your children. Impart wisdom to them daily by talking your way through what you are doing while they are around. After a few times, see if they can do some of these things on their own. Children learn with involved practice, not just through instruction and lectures.For instance, perhaps you might show your child how to make a basic meal like a sandwich if they are age eight or older. This can serve as a gateway to them understanding how to feed themselves and perhaps even learning how to cook a basic meal.
You might also teach them other things like how to do their own hair, how to clean up, or any other task that is useful and age appropriate.

, If your child does mess up, which children tend to do, hold them responsible for their actions. This will prepare your child for the real world where mistakes naturally lead to sometimes serious consequences. Set punishments that are fair, age appropriate, and meaningful.It's also important to be calm and show some empathy when giving a punishment so your anger itself doesn't become the primary thing your kids are trying to avoid.


For instance, if your child has been picking on other kids at school because of their clothing, consider making them volunteer at a homeless shelter or soup kitchen if they are old enough.

, One way you can begin helping your child develop independence is to allow them to dress themselves. This gives your child the space to express themselves and can also relieve you of the burden of having to choose their outfit each day. If your child is too young to choose their own clothing, give them the option of two or three different outfits, and then allow them to choose.Set certain boundaries in regards to the length and tightness of the clothing. You might not allow shorts that you deem too short or clothing that is see-through.

, Give your child some flexibility in their daily schedule, particularly if they are older. Eventually they should have the responsibility to get themselves up in the morning, and by the time they are older you should make sure you are not still waking them up, especially not multiple times. Avoid signing them up for too many after school activities. Allow them to have free time so that they can develop as individuals and determine their own interests.For instance, you might require that your children begin their homework within thirty minutes of arriving home but that any time after than can be used as they deem fit.
Give your child some flexibility with other things like bedtime as well. Consider giving them a general thirty minute period in which they must be in bed.

, Allow your child to begin learning the importance of pitching in and doing their part by assigning them weekly chores to complete. Assign them chores based on their age level.It's also important to decide what happens when they don't do their chores. Generally, privileges should be earned by completing chores rather than giving a punishment when they don't get done.


Do not clean up your children’s messes for them, especially if they are age five or over.
Task them with keeping their room clean in addition to helping with general household chores like the dishes or the trash.

, In addition to their clothing and free time, allow your child to make certain choices for themselves. Perhaps you are hoping that your child does soccer but they prefer to play softball. Allow them to play the sport of their choice. Allow your child flexibility in other areas as well including their diet, choice of toys, or part time job.Protect your kids from dire consequences, but allowing your kids to make less serious mistakes that they should be able to handle can improve their decision making in the future.

, Spoiling your child is a surefire way to overparent them. Though you should always take care of your child and tend to their needs, you do not have to give in to all of their wants. Allow them to earn the things that you give to them. This does not mean that you make your child work for gifts, but that you reward them when they are keeping up with their responsibilities and chores.Do not continuously give gifts to your children if they are not doing well in school or if they are not taking care of the things that you do give them.

, If you drop something, wait to see if your child offers to pick it up for you. Similarly, when you are carrying the groceries into your home, don’t refuse help if your child offers, even if you can carry everything alone. Allow your child to take some burdens off of you, even if they are slight., Though your child may have connected with a friend or two who you do not approve of, do not try to micromanage these friendships. Allow your child to make the choice of who they want to be friends with and who they don’t. Don’t try to force friends on them or take friends away.You can still set parameters, however. Set a curfew for your child. Disallow them from engaging in certain behaviors, even if their friends are doing it.
You can also encourage your child to talk to you about their friends. Offer some advice based on your own experience, but don't try to tell them what to do.

, Your child may be struggling with something, but don’t just solve the problem for them. Help them begin to think of ways that they can solve the problem on their own, even if you already know a solution. For instance, if you are helping them with their homework, and they got the wrong answer, don’t point out their mistake. Encourage them to review the problem instead.If your child is learning to ride a bike without training wheels, help and teach them, but allow them to fall a few times under your supervision. It is often the mistakes that children make that are the greatest teachers and motivators to success.

, You may notice that your child often tries to quit things once they become uncomfortable, but it is often in times of discomfort that growth occurs. Avoid coming to your child’s rescue all of the time and allow them to figure out a way to cope on their own. For instance, if your child wants to switch out of a class because they don’t have any friends, encourage them to make friends instead and avoid helping them to get out of the class., If your child consistently breaks their phone or toys, avoid fixing or replacing them. This will teach your child that you will not save them each time they are careless. Encourage them to fix or replace the things that they break, particularly if this is a regular occurrence.Children tend to care more for things that they had to work hard for. Consider allowing them to complete additional chores for money so that they can eventually replace their item.

, Avoid intervening in arguments that your children might be having or in fights that your child might have with their friends. As long as these disagreements are not physical, your child is not in danger but is instead learning valuable conflict resolution skills.Lead them by your own example. Allow your child to see you resolve conflicts with your partner, family and friends.
Know when to step in. If your child is being bullied by someone, you should intervene.

, Though you love your child very much, avoid making them the entire focus of your life. A child who grows up believing everything centers around themselves will have a lot of difficulty navigating real relationships and dealing with conflicts of any kind. Learn to care about your own life as well. Dedicate yourself to your career, hang out with friends, spend time with your spouse, and explore your other interests., Perhaps much of your worry or anxiety in parenting your children arises from not having a plan if something should go awry. Perhaps one of your worries is leaving your teenagers at home alone while you are at work. In this instance, to assuage your worry, you can install a home alarm system so you know they will be protected while you are away.If you are worried about your child falling while riding their bike, get them a helmet and knee pads.

, Getting in touch with your spirituality is a great way to calm down any internal anxieties that you might be facing. Take some time each day to pray or meditate. Go to a local place of worship. Connect with friends who are connected to their spiritual side., One way to calm your fears is to talk to other parents who can help you keep your worries in check. Often times when we verbalize things to others, we might realize how unrealistic and unfounded our worries really are. Friends will be able to give you advice on how to let up on your children a bit and give them more independence., Seek out some fact-based articles specifically about your particular problem. If you still feel like you are in over your head after trying various approaches to an issue, talk to a mental health professional for guidance. Don't feel like you need to figure everything out all on your own.

, The types of programs that you watch on television may be directly impacting your parenting style. Perhaps you watch the nightly news each day or view other violent programming on the regular. Research shows that the more violence you see on TV, the more violently you will interpret the world. Switch up your worldview by viewing more positive and tranquil programming., In taking care of your child, don’t forget to care for yourself. Eat healthy foods. Exercise regularly. Plan one thing, no matter how small, per day that you can look forward to. Read a book, watch a film, or have a spa day."

Get acquainted in your child’s presence.,
Attend parent-teacher conferences sans child.,
Be prepared for meetings.,
Reach out for updates without waiting on the teacher to make contact.,
Get involved at the school.",How to Avoid Parent Teacher Conflicts1," Many schools host a “Meet the Teacher” event at the start of a new school year to let parents and students introduce themselves to teachers. Attending this event sets the tone for positive interaction with your child’s teacher. It also shows your concern for your child’s educational experience.These events can be busy and aren’t the best environment for extended dialogue. Briefly introduce yourself and have your child do the same. Schedule a separate meeting for discussing other concerns.;
, When your child’s teacher invites you to the school for a face-to-face meeting, leave your child at home unless necessary. Being able to discuss sensitive matters without your child defensively butting in can help you enjoy a more productive exchange., When you attend meetings with your child's teacher, think about any concerns you have in advance. Write down a list of probable questions to help you get the most out of the conversation. You may also jot down any concerns you have about your child's progress that you don't want to forget about discussing.Having another adult there with you may also be helpful as they may think of questions you didn't. It may also help to take notes during the meeting so you can review what you learned afterwards.

, If there’s any reason that you are concerned about your child’s progress or need to update the teacher on personal issues occurring at home, schedule a meeting. You don’t have to wait until the monthly or quarterly scheduled times to sit down with your child’s teacher.


Teachers are often thrilled to catch you up on what’s happening in the classroom. Staying in touch actually strengthens your relationship with the teacher. Just make an appointment first.Reasons you might schedule a meeting include discussing progress after implementing new skills, sharing details about personal issues (e.g. divorce or death in the family), expressing concern about setbacks, or resolving bullying incidents.

, Parents can demonstrate involvement in two ways: by being an active supporter of your child at home and by taking part in school activities. Try to get both parents involved, if at all possible. Studies reveal that having both parents involved results in better educational outcomes. Children with engaged parents also stay motivated about learning throughout life.Get involved by chaperoning field trips, volunteering for school events, working as a teacher’s aide, helping with homework or special projects, or joining the Parent Teacher Association (PTA).
The level of involvement needed often depends on the unique needs of the child in question.

Set up rules for your child.,
Give specific instructions.,
Provide consequences when your child breaks the rules.,
Follow through with what you say.,
Stick with it even when you don’t feel like it.,
Remain strong with your discipline.,
Be patient.",How to Avoid Being a Pushover Parent1," Your child needs rules, limits, and boundaries. They also need consequences for when they break rules. But you must make your child aware of the rules. Your child may get confused because you change the rules often.Consider sitting down and having a family meeting to discuss the rules and consequences. Ask your child if they have any questions. You may want to discuss why those rules are important and how it will keep your child safe.
Make sure to express the rules in a way that your child will understand. For example, a very young child may not be able to understand or remember a set of complex rules, so you will need to explain the rules in words they can understand and give frequent reminders. However, with an older child, you can probably explain the rules once and then post them somewhere visible, such as on the refrigerator.
If there are exceptions to the rules for any reason, make sure to explain to your child why there is an exception.
Make sure that you and your significant other are always on the same page about the rules. This will help to ensure that your child will not get different guidelines and end up being confused.;
, Whether you are setting a rule or asking your child to do something for you, make sure that they have plenty of information to help them follow through. Being specific with your instructions will help to ensure that they do what you are asking and that there are no misunderstandings.

For example, do not simply ask your child to clean the bathroom. Tell them what cleaning the bathroom entails, such as cleaning the bathtub, wiping down the counters and sinks, and taking out the trash. You may even want to show them how to perform certain tasks to ensure that they will know how you want them done.

, Being a pushover parent means you might threaten consequences but never reinforce them. To change this behavior, come up with consequences for any rule breaking. This may be a time out or loss of privilege.Tell your child the consequences so they know what to expect. For example, you may say, “You can’t watch television before dinner. If you do, you will lose your television privileges for today.” If your child watches TV anyway, reinforce the consequences by making sure they don’t watch television anymore that day.
Be firm. This means that you should always be consistent with your rules and make sure that they are clear cut.
Be fair. You should also make sure that you are always enforcing your rules the same way every time for every child. Likewise, reward your child for the same good behaviors every time.
Be friendly. When you discipline your child, make sure that you do not yell at them or act angrily towards them. Be calm and discipline them from a place of love so that they will learn from the experience.

, One sign of being a pushover parent is that you will say something, but if your child whines or throws a fit, you give in. Your child will learn this is how to get things and won’t respect what you say. Instead of giving in, hold strong with what you say. Your child needs to understand that you will follow through with what you’ve said.For example, if you say, “No, you cannot have that candy,” you have to mean it. You may want to follow that by saying, “No matter how much you beg, you will not get it. I mean it.”
Consistently enforce your rules and make sure your significant other does the same. It is important to make sure that both you and your partner are enforcing the rules for your child. Always provide rewards and consequences for the same behaviors every time. This is very important.

, Sometimes, you may be sick, tired, or moody. This may lead you to now wanting to reinforce the behavior and let your children get away with things. This can lead to confusion for your children and undermine your authority.When you feel bad, take a deep breath and focus even more on following through and being consistent. Though it may be difficult, it will be worth it in the long run when you are not a pushover when you aren’t at your best.

, You may feel guilty or bad after you discipline your child. Because of this, you may want to go back on the punishment. If your child reacts negatively by whining or crying that they’re sorry, you also may want to back off. This is inconsistent and teaches your child that these reactions will get them out of trouble. Instead, stick with your consequences.For example, if you take away a privilege, do not give it back before the allotted time just because your child is now behaving. Instead, follow through to ensure future good behavior.
If your child throws a tantrum, just allow your child to get it out of their system. Eventually, they will get tired and stop.

, It may take a while for your child to realize that you are no longer a pushover parent. They may try to use every trick they know to get you to go easier or not follow through. They may not believe you at first when you discipline them. They may act out even more because they’re frustrated. Just be patient, follow through with your actions, and stick with it.

Grow outdoors when possible.,
Be realistic about the plant's appearance.,
Focus on the timing of the flowering.,
Put the plants in a dark room, closet or cabinet.,
Use warm white CFLs or warm white fluorescent tubes.,
Set the timing.,
Check for flowering indicators.,
Avoid letting the plant have more than 10 hours of light a day.",How to Keep Poinsettias Growing To Next Christmas2," Depending on your climate, poinsettias tend to due better outside than in, so grow them outside where they get partial shade in the afternoon. If it gets too hot and dry, their growth might slow.

, You will never get that ""store bought"" look again, as they are literally tree sapping. If you want some ""store bought"" looking plants, take cuttings from your plants (don't worry you can still flower the parent plants too) from late April, up until you bring them inside to flower. You can use rooting hormone, but poinsettias seem to root well in just compost (such as compost made from yard waste like grass clippings).

, Depending on when you want the poinsettia to be fully flowering and how you intend to care for them after flowering, determines on when you start flowering them. If you want them in full bloom by Thanksgiving, start on October 1st and by Halloween for Christmas. You can start earlier, but you need to maintain light timing to keep them flowering throughout the season.

, Choose a spot which is lightproof, for the most part.

, It's necessary to use ""warm white"" as opposed to regular grow lights because the plant needs the extra red light; this, plus the timing, will ensure flowering.


Make sure you have enough light too. One 26watt CFL (100watt equivalent) for two or more plants won't be enough. Use one 26 watt CFL per cutting about 1 and 1/2 feet above them to just 1 foot (0.3 m). Make sure you can adjust the height, as they will grow fast during flowering.
HPS lights can be used too. Be careful with HPS lights though, as local law enforcement might think you are flowering another Mexican plant with the same light cycle! HPS light give off signatures they use to help track unlawful botanists.

, Set the timing to suit. A good one is to use standard banking hours, 9am to 5pm. Do not disturb the plants when the lights are off. While 14 hours of darkness is said to be enough, 16 hours works every time (with warm white).

, The first signs they have begun to flower is what you might call ""rusting out"". This is when the top leaves quite literally ""rust out"" as they think it's fall. Leave the plant under the light until it has fully flowered.


You may want to leave the plant in your makeshift nursery the whole season and bring it out for company and the day of the holiday you want to display it.
Even the plants you buy this year would benefit and be a good plant to make cutting from next year, so put them in the nursery too.

, This will keep it flowering long after the season is over. Take good care of it: keep the plant watered properly, keep it away from whiteflies, and give it plenty of light during its day cycle. Given this care, the plant can flower well past Mother's Day!


If the plant is still flowering for too long, put it under light with 24 hours of on time to get it to vegetate. You may find that some plants will still have flower buds on when you place them outside for the summer.

Encourage your child to problem-solve.,
Be patient.",How to Avoid Parent Teacher Conflicts2," To maintain a progressive relationship with your child’s teacher, it’s important that you’re open-minded. When you enter any discussions with staunch expectations, you can interfere with problem-solving. Flexibility also means not viewing the teacher as the enemy—you are both interested in what’s best for your child.


Be considerate of any comments or suggestions offered by your child’s teacher, even if you don’t exactly like them. Remember that no one in the equation is perfect: you, the teacher, nor your child.
Be willing to acknowledge your child’s limitations. Understand the child’s side and try to view it objectively before approaching the teacher. Know that accepting any limitations will position your child to get the services or accommodations they need., Go into any discussion with a resolution in mind. If you get hung up on the details or technicalities, you’ll walk away feeling less than satisfied. Focus on the common ground between you and move forward towards a mutually agreeable outcome.


Enter the situation by putting on your problem-solving hat. Resist the urge to blame or accuse the teacher of anything. Offer feasible solutions and be willing to compromise.
For example, instead of dwelling on the problem, you might say, ""I researched a list of possible options to help Jimmy with his reading comprehension. Do you mind reviewing the list and giving me your feedback?""
Make a point of comparing your experience with your child to the teacher's. They can be very different because your child may behave differently at home and at school.

, It's sends a good message to the teacher when you use language that shows you're working together for the concern of your child. When you accuse or insult, you shut down the lines of communication. You can reduce any defensiveness or conflict by using “I” statements.


Say, “I’m a bit disappointed in Tommy’s progress” rather than “You’re not helping my child learn to read.”, You can empower your child and limit unnecessary interactions with the teacher by inspiring them to handle certain issues themselves. This should be done using discretion for the age and maturity level of your child. But, it’s a great way to help your child develop assertiveness and problem-solving skills. At home, help your child practice what to say to their teacher. For example, your child was given a poor conduct grade that they feel was unfair. They might role-play at home by saying, “Mrs. Weathers, I am upset about my conduct grade. I think you may have marked me based on the behavior of some of my friends. I am around these kids, but I don’t act out like them.”

, Academic, behavioral, and social progress takes time. Be realistic about the time-constraints you place on your child and their teacher to implement new strategies and produce results. If you rush progress, you could aggravate the teacher and make them less willing to collaborate with you.


Be realistic about the time-frame you set for results. Stay in the loop by maintaining regular contact with your child’s teacher. But do yourself a favor and lose the perception of a firm deadline. Let your child set the pace.

Communicate only after getting a handle on your emotions.,
Acknowledge the teacher’s perspective with active listening.,
Overcome jealousy about your child’s relationship with the teacher.",How to Avoid Parent Teacher Conflicts3," A disappointing grade or a poor report regarding conduct can take a toll on parents. Get control of your feelings before meeting with a teacher. Coming into a discussion with excessive complaints or accusations will only hurt your child in the long run.Take some time for yourself first. Call a friend. Go for a walk around the block. Wait a few days if necessary to gain some perspective.
Also, it can help to separate yourself from your child’s performance. Many parents have a tendency to take a negative remark about their child personally, which raises the tension in parent-teacher discussions. Remember that your child is a unique person with their own strengths and weaknesses., A conversation with your child’s teacher should be a two-way street with you listening and speaking. Respectfully state your opinion and then allow your child’s teacher to reciprocate. Practice active listening during the interchange to get an understanding of what the teacher is saying.Remove distractions like cell phones during the meeting. Turn to face the teacher. Make occasional eye contact.
Hear the teacher out before responding. Avoid interrupting.
Try to summarize what they said to be sure you got the right message.
If it appears that the teacher is not listening to you, politely ask them to repeat or paraphrase your concerns so that you can make sure you are both on the same page.

, Some parents go into parent-teacher meetings with a biased impression because of how fondly their child discusses the teacher. You have no reason to compete for your child’s affections, or be envious of the teacher. Consider it a gift that your child has found a teacher that matches their needs so well.If you feel like this, sort through your feelings without involving your child. Bad-mouthing the teacher or being overtly jealous can minimize your child’s confiding in you about school.

Come up with a list of consequences.,
Work with your partner.,
Determine what rules are worth enforcing.",How to Avoid Being a Pushover Parent2," It may be helpful to come up with a list of punishments and consequences to use when you discipline your child, and involve your child in this process. Giving your child a chance to weigh in on what they think appropriate consequences should be may help to make enforcing those rules much easier. Consequences may include ignoring attention-seeking behavior, time outs, natural consequences, or loss of privileges. Developing a plan helps you know how to follow through with what you say.For example, when your child does something you told them not to, you may take away their privileges or put them in time out. If you told them not to go outside without an adult, you can put them in time out. If you told them to do their homework instead of playing and they ignore you, take away their playing privileges for the evening.
Be sure that your significant other and anyone else who care for your child will know what the consequences are and will agree to enforce them.
Make sure that the consequences are age appropriate. The types of consequences you would have for a young child will not be the same as those for an older child or teenager.

, If you are raising your child with a partner, discipline should be a shared effort. This means both partners should reinforce behavior the same way and avoid being pushovers. If one parent is a pushover and the other is not, it may lead to problems. Instead, discuss how you will discipline your children and follow through so you both know what to do.For example, both of you need to make sure you follow through what what you say, ignore attention-seeking behavior if you choose to, and have the same limits. If the rule is no candy between meals, both parents should reinforce this rule.

, When you are trying to stop being a pushover parent, you may want to decide what is worth being strict about and which rules can be amended. This helps you reinforce the important things, but not end up with a fight every time your child doesn’t do something. You also may want to evaluate the age of your child and determine what rules are appropriate for the age group.For example, you may be adamant about physical violence like hitting and television and snack limits. However, you may decide that chores can be done together as a group and that you can help them make their beds and put away their laundry.

"
"
Ignore attention-seeking behavior.,
Give your children options.,
Come up with positive solutions with your child.,
Establish a daily routine.",How to Avoid Being a Pushover Parent3," If your child starts begging, whining, or crying, ignore it. Don’t give in to these attention-seeking behaviors. By giving in and letting your child have what they want, you reinforce bad behavior and teach them that by throwing a fit, they can get what they want. Instead, ignore behaviors such as tantrums, whining, and begging.To ignore your child, do not respond to them. Don’t look at them, don’t talk to them, and don’t touch them.
The behavior will probably increase when your child realizes you are ignoring them. This is okay. You are having the effect you want. Keep ignoring your child until the behavior stops.
When your child stops doing the unwanted behavior, pay attention to them again. Don’t point out their negative behavior. Instead, say something like, “I’m glad you are quiet. Let’s figure out what we’re going to do this afternoon.”

, One way you can help your children do what you want them to is to give them choices to achieve the goal. This helps your child feel like they are getting what they want, but you are getting what you want to. Make sure both choices are things you will follow through with so as not to make your child distrustful of you.For example, you may ask your child, “Do you want to wear the green shirt or the blue shirt?” or “Which book would you like to read before bed?”
You may also give them choices with natural consequences. If your child decides not to wear gloves or a hat on a cold day, it will help teach them the consequences so they will make a better choice next time. If you tell your child, “You can wash your dirty uniform or wear it dirty to your next game,” they may think twice about not washing it when they have to wear a dirty uniform to their game.

, For pushover parents, positive discipline strategies may be more appealing than negative ones. You may want to try coming up with positive solutions to bad behavior with your child. To do this, wait until you and your child are calm. Do not do this right after they have done something wrong.For example, later the same day or the day after bad behavior, you may tell your child, “I want to talk about what happened. Let’s come up with a solution so that same thing does not happen again.”
If your child’s room is always messy, think of ways to fix that, like buying boxes and storage bins or getting rid of old, unwanted toys.

, Kids respond well to structure and routine. If you are a pushover parent, you may just let your child do whatever they want when they want. This may lead to your child not finishing their homework, eating too much junk food, or adopting bad sleeping habits. Come up with a routine for your child and family that adds structure and consistency.For example, you may want to schedule in time for homework, chores, physical activity, family bonding, play time, or other responsibilities. Try to hold a consistent meal and bedtimes for your child.

Drill a hole in the fireplace brick wall using a screwdriver.,
Screw in a cup hanger.,
Attach the stocking to the hanger.,
Hang the stocking loop around the cup hook.",How to Hang Stockings on Brick1," Aim for the mortar between the bricks, not the brick.;
, Many cup hangers come with a screw end on them, just ask for these at the hardware store. When you finish screwing it in, ensure that hanger is positioned so that the hook is facing upward.

, Most stockings have some sort of a loop on them. If your stocking doesn't, make your own using either ribbon and glue or stitch a loop in place.

, Done. The stocking will now stay firmly on the brick fireplace.

Sort out the buttons.,
Purchase a cone shaped piece of Styrofoam.,
Decide whether or not to paint the Styrofoam cone.,
Attach one button to the top of the Styrofoam cone.,
Attach the next button alongside the first button.,
Work around the tree attaching the buttons in rows.,
Repeat until you reach the base of the tree.,
Decorate if wished.,
Done.",How to Make a Button Christmas Tree," Decide what color theme you'd like; there are various choices, such as red and green buttons for a Christmas feel, two-tone or monotone to match the décor or theme, or multicolor buttons for a fun flair.


If you vary the size of the buttons, you'll need to make adjustments to the pattern as you go, to fit them in; overlapping them makes it easier to keep them all in place without showing the cone underneath. You can try all one size buttons first, then try varying the sizes for a second project, when you feel more confident.;
, The height is up to you, recognizing that the bigger it is, the more buttons you'll need.

, While not essential, painting the Styrofoam cone gold, silver or green before you place on the buttons will give your button Christmas tree a more professional finish. Allow to fully dry before proceeding, if you perform this step.

, Stick a pin into the button hole to keep it firmly in place. Try to match the pinhead color to the button's color, if possible.


Alternative: Use sequins to cover the pin. Use plain silver dressmaking pins and match the sequin color to the button. Slide the sequin onto the pin and push it up to the pinhead. Then, attach the pin to the cone positioned to keep the button in place. The sequin will fan out around the pin, covering any sign of foam and neatening the look of the attachment.

, At this stage, if you are creating a pattern, decide how this pattern will repeat. Examples include:


One red, one green, one red, one green; or two greens, two reds, etc. (or using different colors).
No pattern, all one color.
Random, especially if multi-colored but it's okay with other color variations too.

, Descend after each row is completed, to begin the next row.

, Make any adjustments needed to ensure that the last buttons cover any remaining foam.

, At this stage, you can simply leave the tree as it is, or attach a small ribbon bow or wind a little gold or silver metallic fuzzy elastic length around the tree here and there to look like tinsel. (Don't add too much tinsel, just wind it around with generous gaps between it so that around three to four wraps are made, and no more.)


For the star at the top of the tree, cut two exactly the same paper stars from silver or gold card, and hot glue them in place, aligned with each other.

, The Christmas tree is now complete and ready for display or giving away.

Display the baubles in a clear, wide vase.,
Find a favorite plate and some cupcake cases.,
Use Christmas toys, dolls or other decorative items to make a display with the baubles.,
Use Mason jars.,
Use a flower pot container or an urn.,
Create a barrier around a plate to prevent the baubles from rolling off.",How to Display Vintage Baubles," Place a bed of scrunched up tissue paper, shredded paper pieces or other soft item at the base of the vase. Gently lower the baubles into the vase. Continue until you are satisfied with the amount of baubles on display. Place the vase somewhere safe where it won't be knocked over.;
, Choose cupcake cases in differing sizes if the baubles are of various sizes too. Arrange the cupcake cases on the plate in a pleasing way, then add each bauble to a cupcake case. Keep this simple––a nice approach is to have larger baubles to the back, medium ones in the middle, and smaller ones in front but the end display will be determined by where you place the plate and your own designer's eye. Display somewhere out of harm's way.

, Arrange a favorite old toy or decoration in a bowl on a stand or on a stand. Place the vintage baubles around the toy or other item. If using a toy or doll, consider having the inanimate item ""hold"" the baubles between its legs or in a basket. Place these items on display where they won't be knocked.

, Find varying sizes of Mason jars and place something soft at the base of each jar, such as a round of felt in Christmas colors. Gently lower in the vintage baubles in a pattern you find pleasing. Screw the lids back on top and place the jars on display where they won't be knocked over.

, Fill with scrunched paper to almost the top, then add a pretty layer of something like felt or a fabric skirt. Arrange the vintage baubles so that they're peeking over the top of the container.

, Another plate approach to displaying vintage baubles is to arrange something around the rim of the plate to prevent the baubles from rolling and to give the display a little something extra to look at. For example, choose Christmas figurines, little Santas or reindeer, or perhaps miniature pine cones. Arrange the baubles directly on the plate. Place where the display won't be touched or bumped.


Tinsel can also be used on the inner rim of the display, and the baubles tucked into the tinsel loops.

Select a position for the hanger on the fireplace alcove.,
Hang the hanger in place.,
Pull out the hanging tabs from the center of the brick hanger.,
Done.",How to Hang Stockings on Brick2," These are available at hardware stores. They have a spring steel which clamps onto the wall wherever a bit of brick juts out from the mortar.

, There needs to be a minimum of 1/8"" mortar recess for you to be able to attach the brick hanger.

, Follow the packaging instructions for clamping it firmly in place.

, Hang the stocking on this part, using the loop. If it lacks a loop, add one either by gluing on a ribbon loop or sewing a loop in place.

Find a long, strong and sturdy branch.,
Find a way to attach the middle of the branch to the mantelpiece.,
Check that the branch is well balanced.,
Done.",How to Hang Stockings on Brick3," You might have one in the garden, or perhaps go for a walk in the local woods. Ensure that it is clean; scrub off any dirt and check that little beasts aren't living in it.


The branch should be the length of the mantelpiece for best effect and balance.
The branch needs to be a little curved at each end, as it cannot remain flush with the mantelpiece at the ends, or there will be nowhere for the stockings to be attached.

, The item used can be covered with a large ribbon bow or greenery, so if the attaching object is not so pretty, it won't matter. Suggestions include handheld clamp used for woodworking, large clips (like the sort used to keep tablecloths in place), etc. Or, nail some metallic shelf bars underneath the mantelpiece, having some of the bars hanging out for the branch to sit on. Wrap twine around the branch and the bars to keep in place.


Once attached, cover the attachment item with the bow or greenery, to ensure that it cannot be seen.







, Then hang the stockings on, ensuring that an even number of stockings is hung each end of the branch.

, When items are added to the stockings, check that they do not unbalance the balance on the branch.

Examine your ambivalent or uneasy feelings.,
Talk to your spouse about their ex.,
Decide if you have trust issues.",How to Deal With a Spouse's Previous Marriage1," If you are insecure about yourself or your attachment to your spouse, the problem with the ex may really be an issue about your own insecurities. You should look at why you feel uneasy about your spouse’s ex and figure out the root of the problem.For example, you may be worried that your spouse still holds a flame for their ex, or that the ex still has a chance. If so, look at the situation more realistically so that you can let go of these feelings.
Understand that relationships with an ex in the picture are often complicated. Like it or not, when a person has to interact with someone he or she once had an intimate relationship it is more difficult than one that does not. This is even more so if there are children in the previous relationship, and even more if there are frictions with the upbringing of the children.

Complicated does not necessarily mean unhappy, however. Some people make the mistake of thinking ""true love"" means no complications, but this is an unfortunate myth. You can be happy with a person with complex and even difficult relationships with other, but it will take patience and understanding.
Depending on the situation, you may have to decide on whether or not you can manage such a relationship. There is nothing wrong with thinking a person is great, but you cannot deal with the drama of the person's personal life.

;
, You should have a conversation with your spouse about their ex. You should talk about the ex’s role in your spouse’s and children’s life, and then discuss the spouse’s relationship with the ex. You should also be honest about your discomfort and feelings.This conversation can help both of you find a good way to approach the ex situation.
If you have an ex too, this is a good time to discuss your spouse's feelings about your ex.

, Your feelings about your spouse’s ex may be related to your trust issues. Remind yourself that your spouse married you, and they wouldn’t have done that if they still wanted to be with their ex. Trust your partner. If there are issues of trust, now is the time to sort them out.You may have had a bad experience in the past in which an ex did something to you that hurt you. Tell yourself, “This is not the same situation. This person is not the same person.”
You may be influenced by someone else's loss, such a parent, a TV personality or a celebrity. Keep reminding yourself that other people’s experiences are not your own.

"
"
Accept the situation.,
Avoid dwelling on the past.,
Learn to be happy.",How to Deal With a Spouse's Previous Marriage2," You cannot change that your spouse has an ex-partner. Even if you're in a situation where the ex is being uncooperative, accept that there's nothing you can do. Just try to ignore them and stay pleasant whenever you're with them.The best way to combat immaturity is by ignoring it. If they don't get a reaction, then they are likely to give up.

, It's likely that your spouse wants to move past the choices they made, so dwelling on the past relationship will never help. If you nag about the ex, it might be an unhealthy stumbling block. Leave the past behind you. Focus on forming a more positively-oriented future belonging to both of you.Focus on making your time together meaningful and good, so that your positive memories start to crowd out the ex memories.

, Focus on the present and your marriage. Be grateful that you and your spouse found each other. Be glad that you are both happy. Don't think of yourself as the ""second wife"" or the ""third husband"". You are simply your spouse's husband or wife, and they are yours. It's as simple as that.Keep it simple and sweet and you'll keep your marriage a happy and enduring one.
Remember, it took your spouse’s entire life’s worth of experiences to bring you two together. Be grateful for every single experience in their past because it all led up to you two being together.

Allow time to develop a relationship with the children.,
Try to make things work.,
Avoid resenting your spouse for having to pay child support.,
Talk to a marriage counselor.",How to Deal With a Spouse's Previous Marriage3," If there are children from the previous marriage, you should treat them with love and respect. However, don't try to act like the biological parent. They will develop a relationship with you if given time and space. Let the children set the pace.Remember that the children may be loyal to the ex and feel betrayed at the new marriage at first. Don’t force the children to choose, and let them work through the feelings.
Continue being accepting, kind, and thoughtful, even if their behavior toward you is somewhat otherwise.

, If everyone involved wants to try to get along, make an effort to be cooperative. Realize that your spouse's former partner is a human being. If they are making an effort to treat you with respect, you should do the same., You should understand that when you share your life with your spouse, you accept all of their baggage as well. Try to think of the child support as a bill that one of you acquired, but both of you accept and pay together, like a credit card.If you think that the ex is greedy or getting more than they deserve, be very careful about how you broach the subject with your spouse. It may be better to speak indirectly about the costs and let your spouse reach their own conclusions.

, If you can't stop obsessing about your spouse's ex, it's time to speak to someone who can counsel you about your obsessive thoughts.You may want to go to counseling alone, or you may want to go with your spouse so you can work through the issues related to the ex.

Accept the past.,
Accept that your partner may always love their dead spouse.,
Discuss which old possessions should be kept.,
Set boundaries with compassion.,
Focus on the present.",How to Deal With a Spouse's Previous Marriage4," If your new spouse is widowed, it may be difficult to adjust. You may feel you can’t live up to the previous spouse, and your partner may still be grieving. Instead of ignoring the past, accept it. The previous marriage was part of your partner’s life and they will probably grieve for a long time. Talk to each other about what you are feeling, both good and bad.For example, encourage your partner to share their grief with you. This helps build a deeper and stronger relationship between the two of you.
Talk to your spouse about your feelings. If you feel insecure or worried because of the past, talk to your partner about it.

, Most people who are widowed never stop loving their dead spouse. That doesn’t mean that you and your spouse can’t have a meaningful relationship. Let go of any jealousies or ill-feelings towards your spouse’s previous partner and accept that they will always love them. However, remember that your spouse loves you and that the two of you are now building a life together.Your partner’s previous marriage doesn’t change the way they feel about you. It can take some time to adjust to this idea, but eventually you will learn that your partner loves you while still loving their dead spouse.

, Your partner may want to keep possessions of their dead spouse, and you may not feel comfortable with keeping them. Have a conversation in which you both explore why you want to keep or discard the items. Then, come to a compromise about how to handle the situation.For example, you may agree to keeping all photographs and a box or two of mementos as long as your partner donates other possessions to charity.

, Though you want to be empathetic to your partner’s grief, you also have to think about your own feelings. When your partner says or does something that hurts you, talk to them about it. Set up boundaries about what is appropriate and what isn’t so that both of your needs are being met.For example, if your partner refers to their previous spouse as “my first wife or husband” or simply “my partner,” that can cause you to feel hurt, unappreciated, and insecure. Tell your partner, “I understand that you’re grieving and you still love your dead spouse, but these comments hurt me.”

, Instead of living in the past with the dead spouse, focus on the present and making a future together. Make new memories with your new spouse. Do new things together that neither of you have done in the past. Try new hobbies, visit new places, and eat new foods.Consider redecorating your home or buying a new one. This can help it feel like your home, not a home from the past.

,
Get some Christmas music ready to be played in stereo.",How to Decorate Your House at Christmas1," Many consider the tree to be the most important Christmastime decoration; if you don't do anything else, get a tree! Choose either a real tree or an artificial one. Set it up in the room where you and your family will be opening presents together on Christmas day. Decorate the tree in your personal style. Here are some festive ideas:


String lights on the tree. A tree lit by white or colored lights is a beautiful sight to behold during Christmas season. Small white lights are popular, but you can also buy white, blue, red, or multicolored lights to string on your tree. Start at the bottom, leaving the end of the string of lights long enough so that it reaches the closest electrical outlet. Wind the lights around the tree in a spiral pattern. Tuck the other end of the string of lights into a branch at the top of the tree.
Decorate with ornaments. Consider making your own ornaments using dough, buttons, or crystals to add a personal touch to your tree. You could also buy classic round baubles and ball ornaments from the store. Disperse the ornaments evenly around the tree, taking care not to leave big bare spots.
Decorate the tree with some garland or some popcorn chains.
Add a tree topper. It's traditional to place a star at the top of the tree, symbolizing the Star of David that led the three wise men to find Jesus when he was born. You could also top the tree with an angel, a snowflake, or another festive decoration.
Decorate around the bottom of the tree. You can purchase white fabric to drape around the tree. Sprinkle white glitter on it so it resembles freshly fallen snow. Throughout the Christmas season, place presents you intend to give people under the tree.
If you feel that putting and setting up the tree is a bit too much, try delegating tasks to others to help you. A party can help get the tree decorated quicker and into a more festive looking state.;
, String store-bought or handmade stockings across the fireplace, over the mantle, or in another spot in the same room as the Christmas tree. Use red or green ribbon or twine to hang the stockings. Each member of the family should get his or her own stocking.

, You might be able to find a bit of fresh mistletoe in a nursery - or even in a hardwood tree in your yard or neighborhood - but you can also buy a faux mistletoe plant to hang in a doorway in your house. Hang it from a small hook in a doorway between rooms. Tie a small red ribbon over the hook to make it look more festive. And of course, encourage people to give each other a kiss if they find themselves standing beneath the mistletoe together.

, Hang some lights at the top borders of walls where the ceiling meets the wall. If possible and if you have enough lights to do it, strand up some lights around the room you will be presenting most of the Christmas festivities in.

, These houses have become a symbol of old time and years past and a representation of what Christmases gone by have been like.

, You may want to include baby Jesus before (if you are afraid of losing him to the original box or forgetting to place him in the cradle later), but that can be left up to you to decide.

, Hang more ornaments with paperclips on nails and screws that are only used during Christmas. Make things festive inside the house.

, Some tweens and early teenagers can be trusted to not break the ornaments.

, Use some of supporting banisters and windows to hang the cards.

,,, Prepare some CD's or cassettes, or find stations on the computer that play solely Christmas music. There are a few Christmas stations on Pandora, iHeartRadio and Live365 that play Christmas music all year long. There are others in assorted areas of the Internet that can be found, but these are three of the more popular areas that can be trusted to play all the favorite Christmas tunes all year long.

Hang a traditional Christmas wreath.,
Change your wreath’s placement on the door.,
Hang multiple wreaths, one under the other.,
Decorate your wreath.,
Create your own type of “wreath”.,
Add a poinsettia to your wreath.",How to Decorate Your Door for Winter1," Wreaths are a winter- and Christmas-decoration staple, and will look good on almost any front door. Tie a red ribbon or bow around your wreath to create an appealing visual contrast. You can purchase winter wreaths at any craft store, and during the holidays, local hardware stores should stock wreaths as well.The wreath should come with materials to hang it over your door, such as an over-the-door clip.;
, Wreaths are traditionally hung high on the door. Feel free to depart from this tradition, however; if you have a front-door window or peephole that you do not want the wreath to block, feel free to hang the wreath low on the front door. Aim to center the wreath so its middle is at the same height as your doorknob.


You can also tie a strip of Christmas-themed ribbon around the wreath and use that to hang the wreath.

, This technique will lend a more modern, nontraditional look to your door decorations. Multiple wreaths will grab the eye of visitors and passers-by, and create a larger, more arresting door decoration.You can use strips of winter- or Christmas-colored ribbon to attach the wreaths together.

, Adding ornaments or other small miscellany to an undecorated wreath will save the wreath from looking plain or underwhelming on your front door. It’s common to put colored or silver Christmas ball ornaments in the wreath to give it a metallic sparkle. For a more rustic look, consider theming your wreath with (unlit) candles, a few sprigs of winter flowers (real or fake), and pinecones.To ensure that the Christmas ball ornaments don’t fall out of your wreath, you may need to attach them to the wreath using a hot glue gun.

All of these materials will be available at a craft-supply store such as Hobby Lobby or Michaels.

, Poinsettias are beautiful red flowers and are commonly associated with both winter months and the Christmas holiday. Incorporate the flowers into your winter wreath in order to add a burst of color that doesn’t come from Christmas-specific ornaments or decorations. Poinsettias are available at any plant nursery during the winter; clip off two or three flowers and weave the stems into your front-door wreath.


If you have pets, be aware that poinsettias are mildly poisonous to both dogs and cats. If your animal ingests the leaves of the flower, call your veterinarian immediately, especially if you notice symptoms including vomiting, drooling, and diarrhea."

Decorate the door with a Christmas wreath.,
Put up outdoor lights.,
Create an outdoor Christmas scene.",How to Decorate Your House at Christmas2," Most people display them. A wreath symbolizes eternity or eternal life. Buy or make a wreath made with fresh holly or sweet-smelling evergreen to hang on your front door. A wreath will make your house look welcoming to guests, and indicate to passers-by that your home has the spirit of Christmas.


If you want a wreath that lasts more than one season, make one out of felt or pinecones instead of fresh greens.
You could also buy a wreath made from wire or plastic that you can use season after season.

, If you have small trees or bushes in your hard, consider getting a few strands of outdoor lights to put up. You can buy lights that are shaped like nets, which makes it easy to lay them over bushes, or go for a string of lights to wind around your outdoor vegetation. You could also use lights to frame your door or windows.


Consider buying decorative lights shaped like icicles to hang above your door.
Some lights come with timers so they'll automatically shut off after a certain time of night.

, If you want to go all out, consider getting plastic or inflatable characters to place in your hard. When people drive or walk by your house, they'll stop and gaze at the pretty scene you've created. Consider the following options:


Set up a Nativity scene. You can simply set up statues of Mary, Joseph, and baby Jesus, or make a more elaborate scene that includes the wise men, animals and angels.
Make a Santa and reindeer scene. Buy a plastic or inflatable Santa and set him up in a sleigh. For a striking touch, add eight reindeer plus a Rudolph deer with a bright red nose.
Create a fun winter scene. Buy a plastic or inflatable snowman, Grinch, or another Christmas character to set up in your yard. Inflatable snow globes have also become popular yard decorations in recent years.

Place candles in the windows.,
Make paper snowflakes.,
Use red and green accents.",How to Decorate Your House at Christmas3," If your style is subtle and serene, consider placing an electrical candle in each window of the house. Turn them on at night so that they can be seen from outside. This is a beautiful way to decorate for Christmas without spending too much money or going overboard with big decorations.

, Kids love to cut intricate snowflake patterns out of paper. Make them look even more festive by painting them with a layer of clear glue, then adding glitter. When they dry, tape them to the walls and windows using clear double-sided tape.

, Red and green are the colors of Christmas, so anything that has this color scheme will make your house look more festive. Get creative with red and green items you already have around the house, or involve your kids by asking them to help you color some red and green decorations to hang. Here are some ideas for using red and green to accent your home:


Exchange your normal throw pillows for red and green pillows during the holiday season.
Tie red or green bows around doorknobs around the house. You can attach little Christmas bells to them as well.
Use red and green dishcloths to make your kitchen look Christmassy.
Buy a poinsettia plant to add a natural red and green element to your home.
Set out red and green candles on your tables and bookshelves.

"
"
Use evergreen branches.,
Hang lettering on your door.,
Decorate with ornaments.,
Incorporate natural decorations.",How to Decorate Your Door for Winter2," If you want to decorate without a wreath but don’t want to stray too far from the look of seasonal greenery, you can use evergreen branches to spruce up your door. If you live in an urban area, you can purchase artificial branches; or if you have access to trees, snip off four or five branches that are each around three feet in length.Use ribbons or push pins to fix the evergreen branches to your front door. If you like, tie a red ribbon around the branches to give them the look of a seasonal bouquet.

, If you’d like to spell out a word on your door, you can purchase large, wooden letters at a local craft-supply store. Paint the letters in green and red for Christmas, or in blue and white for a wintery look. Use pieces of seasonal ribbon to attach the letters together.Consider spelling out a seasonal or holiday-related word: “JOY,” or “THANKS.” If you’d like to spell a longer word—e.g. “CHRISTMAS,” “NEW YEAR,” or “GOD BLESS,” purchase smaller letters.

, If you’re angling for a Christmas-specific theme but want to avoid using a wreath, use durable Christmas ornaments to decorate your door. Hang a few candy canes over push pins in the door, or use a ribbon to secure a large Santa doll to the front door (you could also use an over-the-door hanger like you’d use for a wreath to hang the Santa).If you’d like something simpler, hang a bow over your front window.
To complete the look, hang a stocking or a sleigh-bell from the doorknob. A craft-supply or holiday themed store will likely also sell other doorknob-specific decorations, if you prefer to hang your stockings on the mantle inside.
To avoid cluttering your door, use a small number of ornaments, probably three or fewer. You can also add cohesion by theming the decorations: for example, homemade ornaments or snowflakes.

, If you’d like to decorate your front door for winter but not necessarily have a Christmas-specific decoration, plan to shy away from ornaments—which naturally connote the Christmas holiday—and focus on natural winter decorations. Options include snowflakes (including those cut from notebook-sized sheet of paper), pinecones, holly, or mistletoe. Hang these items directly over your door using ribbon, or visit a craft store and look for ways to incorporate multiple natural items into a single cornucopia-like door decoration.


Consider spraying gold paint or a spackle / faux-snow color on the pinecones.
Depending on where you live, natural winter decorations may be appropriate for about five months of the year. Natural winter decorations may be especially helpful if you do not celebrate Christmas, but would still like to decorate your door between November and March.

"
"
Drape garlands or tinsel.,
Add wintery paraphernalia around the doorframe.,
Use white spray paint to create a faux-snow look.",How to Decorate Your Door for Winter3," If you want to expand the door decorations beyond the door itself, consider hanging seasonal garlands (often made from evergreen boughs or artificial pine-needles) or tinsel around the doorframe. You can also drape the seasonal garlands or tinsel around the exterior entryway or porch of your home.Hang the garlands or tinsel using push-pins, to avoid the unsightly holes that nails or screws will leave in your woodwork.

, Make the most of your space by decorating not only the doorframe itself, but also the area in beside the door with larger items that will be easily noticed. Place a large nativity scene, or Santa or nutcracker doll beside the door. If you’d prefer a more woodsy look, stack birch or aspen logs beside your door.If you’ve chosen a decorative theme—which could include snow and snowflakes, Christmas ornaments, woodsy evergreens, or a rustic look—make sure that your decorations around the doorframe are consistent with the theme.

, If you live in an area that’s unlikely to receive snowfall during the winter, but still want your seasonal decorations to look wintery, consider spraying items such as an evergreen wreath or Christmas garlands with a white or silver spray paint. A touch of white will make your decorations look woodsy and wintery.Holiday or craft stores will also sell sprays designed to look like thick snow. If you’d prefer more of a textured look, purchase a can of fake snow and spray this on your wreath or other decorations.
As with any aerosol spray, do not spray towards your face or inhale the vapors. Spray in a well-ventilated area, and never near an open flame.

Gather your supplies.,
Place your hurricane lamps on either side of your mantel.,
Drape your garland over the mantel.,
Hang your stockings and enjoy your mantel.",How to Decorate Your Mantel for Christmas1," Most of these supplies can be found at craft stores or general retailers, with the exception of the hurricane lamps. Any heavy and suitably themed decorative mantle piece can be used in place of the hurricane lamps, which are intended to hold your garland in place. You'll need:


Christmas garland (long enough to drape across your mantel)
Christmas stockings
Evergreen cuttings (optional)
Hurricane lamps (or large, sturdy candles)
Paperweights (equal in number to stockings)
Safety pins;
, If you don't intend to light the candles in your hurricane lamps, you may want to add a pop of color to the lamps. Do this by bending and coiling evergreen cuttings around the bottom of the inside of the lamp.


To prevent potential fires but to add a soft ambiance to your mantel decorations, you might want to put some LED candles in your hurricane lamps.
Remember that you can use similarly heavy Christmas themed decorations, like large Christmas figurines, trains, nutcrackers, and snow globes, in place of hurricane lamps.

, Drape your garland across the mantel so it runs behind your hurricane lamps. Arrange the garland so that its excess length hangs equally on both sides of the mantle. Avoid pulling on the garland after it has been strung behind the lamps. Doing so could knock your lamps on the floor.Some garlands come decorated with red berries and leaves to add color. If yours did not, you can add plastic berries and leaves to your garland with small safety pins.

, Distribute your paperweights equally across the space between your two lamps. Place the paperweights so each is hidden behind the garland. Then, take your Christmas stockings and loop their string around the paperweights to hang the stockings in place.


Be careful not to add too much weight to these stockings. Since they are only held in place by paperweights, they could fall and cause other decorations to fall as well.
If you want to hold your stockings in place more firmly, you could use an adhesive hook hidden behind the garland to hold them.
If your stockings do not have a string to hang from, or if the string is not long enough, attach a safety pin to the back of the stocking and tie a piece of string or twine to the pin."

Don't give up or collapse in a heap.,

Keep the decorating simple but effective.,
Put out all your Christmas cards.,
Stick a wreath on the front door.,
Put on Christmas carols while you work.",How to Decorate Your Home for Christmas at the Very Last Minute," The fact that you haven't had the decorations out as long as the Smiths next door and the Jones over the road just doesn't matter. The intent is to do it now, for Christmas, even if it's Christmas morning. Forgive yourself the hard year or season that you've had and use this last-minute decorating as a cathartic release of tension and a precursor to making a new start for everything from hereon in.
, Here is a list to run through quickly to see what will work in the time you have left:



Fresh tree: You might be able to find a tree at the last minute. Only get one if doing so will not cause major disruptions. They'll often be bargain priced by this time as the sellers realize their last sales rather than losses.

Artificial tree: If getting a fresh tree is too hard, think about hopping into a store that is still open late and grabbing an artificial one for what will likely be a reduced price.

Already have tree: If you already own an artificial tree, use that instead. Get it out!

Tree substitute: If you don't have one and you can't get one, what about substituting the umbrella tree that usually sits in the corner unobtrusively doing nothing? Nothing says you can't use a tropical plant instead of a fir tree! Or find a beautiful branch with twigs and decorate it à la Swedish tradition - red and white is ideal for this.

, Go for bold rather than for quantity. Prefer tinsel, bead chains, paper chains and some large baubles over a lot of finicky stuff that will take ages to unwrap and put up. Little and lots creates stress; big and few makes it simple.

, Put a string across the room and hang or pin them to the string. Instant Christmas decoration!

, If you have one, pin it up. Let the neighbors know that you're home for Christmas after all and you're celebrating it too.

, Decorating and cooking the meal go much more smoothly if you play the music and start the Christmas atmosphere.

Aim to collect wins for the relationship.,
Make a pros and cons list for each of you.,
Conduct a brainstorm session.,
Speak up if something is happening that you don’t agree with.,
Recognize when you’re compromising too little.",How to Compromise With Your Spouse1," Many times, when couples are in disagreement, each partner tries to prove that he or she is right. Doing this increases the distance between the two of you. Remember that trying to be right can make the relationship lose. Think like a team—each player must contribute to the win. If one player loses, everyone loses.


Compromise provides a chance for the relationship (i.e. both of you) to win rather than just one of you. If you keep this in mind during an argument, you are more likely to reach a solution that benefits the well-being of your relationship.
The next time you and your partner are vying to be right, take a breather and consider what being right is doing for the relationship as a whole. Don't allow your pride to weaken your bond with your spouse. Try to reach the resolution that fosters growth and success for the relationship.;
, To reach a mutually beneficial solution, it may be a good idea to take a step back and view the situation more objectively.


Each of you can create a two-column list of pros and cons about the issue, including how the issue aligns with each of your personal beliefs and values. Once you have completed the lists, discuss them aloud to see if the benefits of the decision outweigh the downsides.Consider that issues that go against one of your personal beliefs may require more compromise from one partner than the other. Try to reach a conclusion that does not require either of you to sacrifice your values.

, If you are debating a complex issue, you may want to ponder potential avenues over a span of days or weeks rather than jumping to a conclusion. You can hold a brainstorm session listing out all the possible ways you can handle a given problem. You can then go over the list with family members or friends and consider their opinions. Sleeping on the issue and letting it sit for a while may help you to reach a natural conclusion once the emotions die down.For example, imagine your spouse received a promotion that would require a cross-country move. The two of you might weigh the pros and cons--like more money for the household versus one spouse having to leave his or her current job. Then, you might choose to discuss the matter with your parents or your children. If everyone together can see that the move might be beneficial (even if the initial change is hard), then you might agree to go forward with it.

, If you have become the doormat in your marriage, it is time to start saying how you feel, offering your opinions and giving your take on how you would like to do certain things. Improve your assertiveness by:Taking baby steps. The next time your partner asks your opinion about something seemingly small, such as an outfit or what movie to watch, provide an answer. Do this bit by bit, until you start to feel more comfortable using your voice.
Say “no” if you must. While you want to please your partner, you must expect that you won’t always be able to meet his or her every need or demand. Exercise your right to say “no”. For example, if you are really busy and your spouse asks for a favor, you might say “I’m sorry, I can’t right now, honey. Can we work out something else?”

, Marriage is about give and take. Yes, at some point or another both of you will make sacrifices. But, it’s another matter when you’re always the one taking and never giving. If compromising for the sake of the relationship requires that your partner turn his or her back on core values and beliefs, you may be the one that needs to up your compromising skills.A one-sided relationship that does not allow you or your partner to be who you are or live out your truths is extremely unhealthy. See a counselor if you have trouble compromising to the point that your partner is always bending to meet your needs.

Be a gentleman, if she'll let you.,
Be respectful.,
Never lie.,
Never cheat.,
Minimize laziness.,
Try not to be selfish.,
Never raise your voice, yell at, or physically abuse her.,
Find little ways to make her feel great.,
Be open.,
Show her you love her.,
Be supportive.,
Put the ""man"" back in romance.,
Trust her completely.,
Reveal your personality.,
Remember the golden rule.,
If you're religious, share your religion with your wife.,
Take pride in your appearance.",How to Be a Good Husband," Most, not all, women find the idea of a gentleman sweet and endearing. If your wife is that kind of lass, get ready to bust out your most chivalrous self. Think 17th century manners, or thereabouts:


Kiss her hello and goodbye.
Take her heavy shopping bags for her.
Open doors for her.
Pay for dates.
Of course, there's always the chance that she doesn't want you treating her in a gentlemanly way. If she doesn't, don't take it personally. Continue being sweet to her, even if you don't give her special treatment.



, Respect is an act of understanding. Understand that your wife is an independent, different person, and that she may not want to do the exact same thing as you, even though your interests are usually aligned. Here are four examples of ways you can be respectful of your wife:


Keep your promises. Do what you say you'll do. If you tell her you're going to do the dishes, don't wimp out and then make excuses while she takes over your responsibility.
Be on time. If you say you're going to be somewhere at a certain time — say, pick up your kid at daycare — be there. Your wife's time is just as valuable as yours. Respect it.
Stop assuming. Don't just assume that she'll do something because she's your wife or a woman. Establish good lines of communication instead. Learn how to ask for a favor.
Listen to what she's saying. Don't pretend to listen — actually listen. Sometimes, the only thing we want is a good listener or a shoulder to lean on. Let her talk and be absorbed in what she's saying.

, Get in the habit of telling the truth. Ask yourself how you would feel if you found out your wife was keeping anything but a birthday secret from you. Always tell her where you are going if she wants to know. Tell her who you are with. Tell her what your motivations are, even if you think they're petty. Being open and never lying establishes great verbal communication, which is at the heart of all great relationships.

, It goes without saying, but it must be mentioned. Cheating is a form of lying. You wouldn't be very accepting of your wife having an affair, so why would you? If you're having an affair, take a good, hard look at your life and ask yourself why you're married to the person you're married to.


If you love your wife but lust after someone else, realize how unfair the situation is. You want the comfort of your wife, but you're not willing to be exclusive and honest with her. This is selfish behavior at its most basic. You can't have your cake and eat it, too.
If you no longer love your wife, then why are you still married to her? Both of you would probably be much better off if you were given the opportunity to find someone you truly loved, or someone who loved you back. Think about it.

, Laziness is a major turnoff to women, and a bad habit to boot. Laziness isn't necessarily watching football on Sunday; laziness is not doing something you know you should or want to do, but can't bring yourself to. So take the garbage out, surprise her once a week by cleaning the house, or exercise to show her you have self-worth. It makes a big difference.

, We could debate for hours how selfish humans are, but one thing seems clear: though we are selfish, we have the capacity to be selfless. Love should inspire that selflessness. Instead of always asking what you can do for yourself, start asking what you can do for your wife, or what you can do for the benefit of your marriage.


Minimize jealousy. You may get a little jealous from time to time, and that's okay, as long as you try to not let it affect your wife's happiness. (It's probably a good sign if you're jealous.) That's because jealousy can be very selfish. Never keep your wife from doing something just because you're jealous.
Compromise. Learn how to reach the middle ground. Often, what you want and what your wife wants will be totally different. In these cases, adjust your expectations. Don't expect to always get exactly your share or to ""win"" the argument.

, Your wife trusts you to look after her comfort and safety. Don't set a bad example and let your emotions get the better of you.


Control your tone, if possible, in an argument:
""I'm worried that we're not sticking to our budget. I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm just looking out for our long-term happiness and I wanted to have a discussion with you about ways we could both change our spending habits.""


Resist ad hominem, or personal, attacks. The following is not a healthy way to argue:
""Oh yeah? You really want to make sure our children get into a good school? Well why don't you talk to your ex-boyfriend the principal? You seem to have a smashing relationship with him.""


Never hit, detain, or threaten your wife with violence. Do not try to use your physical size as an advantage over her. Your wife could press charges.

, It's funny because, often, the smallest things find a way to nourish a relationship. Ask yourself, what can I do to make my wife even happier? It doesn't have to be earth-shattering to be effective. It's the thought behind it, and the emotion in it, that's the real gift:


Work on having a better relationship with your in-laws. Few things are more important for her than you having a relationship with her parents. You probably don't see your in-laws every day, but that undersells the importance of the goal: ultimately, she wants you to love them like you love your parents.
Does your wife really care about charity? Invest in a microloan in her name, and give it to her as a present. She is now the proud beneficiary of someone else's opportunity.
Do things around the house that she normally doesn't enjoy. If your wife hates doing the dishes, for example, make her a little ""get out dishes free"" card, good for a week without dish-duty.

, It might seem weird, but being open with your spouse is indeed a sign of affection: it shows them that you trust them and, more importantly, that you enjoy being intimate with them emotionally. Women are especially attuned to their emotions; men are often not. Being open will reassure her that you're taking that step for her.

, Why did you marry her in the first place? Express to her why you love and how she makes you feel everyday. Do this often. It will lead to good habits, promote more love and affection in your marriage, and reduce amounts of stress.


Write her a short handwritten letter. Put it underneath her pillow; as you kiss her goodbye in the morning, tell her to check underneath the pillow. The note could say something like: ""Every day I'm with you, I learn even more about how impossibly lucky I am. I love you.""

Come up behind her when she knows that you're in the same room and give her a heartfelt kiss on her neck while wrapping your arms around her. It'll make her heart melt.
Make your own romantic fortune cookie. Find a way to slip a personalized fortune into a fortune cookie your wife breaks open. Have it read something like: ""Only you can make my heart crumble....""


, Support her in her honest endeavors. Whether it's supporting her when she wants to take Latin dance classes or when she wants go out with the girls, your support makes her feel safe and lets her take calculated risks. When she has nothing else to fall back on, she knows that she can count on you to be her rock, her muse, her lighthouse.


When your wife is feeling down, find a way to cheer her up. Bring her breakfast in bed, massage her feet, or rent her favorite movie. Again, small things can have big meanings.

, It may not be the first thing that you think of when you wake up in the morning, but romance is essential to a healthy marriage. Don't just assume that because you're married, you don't have to try to be romantic with your wife anymore. Not only is that thought misguided — what if your wife decided that she didn't have to watch her weight once married? — it also takes some of the fun out of marriage. So be a man and do the manly thing. Be romantic.


Do date nights at least once a month. Some couples manage to find the time to go on dates every week, but once a month is sufficient. Plan a date that evokes a great date you went on earlier in your courtship, or plan a date that gets the blood pumping again: skydiving, whale watching, or a movie, to name a few.
Celebrate your anniversary. Your anniversary is really important to your spouse, and it should be to you too. It has symbolic meaning in addition to providing an opportunity to renew your love. Forgetting your anniversary is a big no-no. At the very least, have a dinner planned and a bottle of wine chilled.
Keep intimate relations in bed strong. Don't let things dry up in bed, or take things for granted. Seek to please your wife as much as she pleases you, and keep exploring her and your own sexuality through one another.

, A lot of the things mentioned in this tutorial revolve around trust. If you don't trust your partner, you're probably living in a pretty miserable place. Learn to trust your wife in the same way that you want her to trust in you.

, Marriage is an enduring opportunity to get to know somebody better and better over many, many years. If you keep an aspect of your personality secret or just closed off, you're probably not getting all that you want out of your marriage. It really does go to show: you get what you give.


Have long conversations; make her laugh; share interests, hobbies and occupations; take her somewhere that has personal significance to you; encourage her to get to know your extended family (and do the same for hers); engage in debate; share fears, doubts, and vulnerabilities; be who you are, not who you think she wants you to be.

, The golden rule is not only important to our idea of morality, it also helps us navigate the sometimes stormy waters of a marriage. The golden rule is that you do unto others as you would have them do to you. All this means is ""put yourself in their shoes"" before you act.


Of course, you need to have the right sort of perspective if you're going to use the golden rule, and you can't lie to yourself about what other people want. If you're unsure about something, ask yourself ""What would I want to happen if I were in my wife's position?"" This is generally a good exercise for you to engage in.

, Draw on your faith for strength, and actively seek meaning with your partner on your life's journey. Give yourself to your wife as much as you give to your god. Maintain your values throughout.

, Of course, the most important for last: practice good hygiene, look sharp as a tac — inside and outside of the house — and make sure you keep up the same general level of cleanliness that your wife does. If you care about how well your wife dresses and much often she brushes her teeth, she's sure to care about the same things. And that's the way it should be between two people who love each other, shouldn't it?

Express your feelings and needs effectively.,
Pick your battles.,
Be understanding when you discuss an issue with your husband.,
Talk to your husband, not about him.",How to Be a Good Wife1," Your husband doesn't have clairvoyant powers. If you want something, ask. If something is wrong, say so. Don't drop hints or figure he'll ""come around"" or you'll never get anything done. If you want to be able to express how you feel, you should be able to speak with a positive tone and to listen to what your husband says instead of being accusatory. Here are some ways to do it:


Send ""I messages."" Instead of accusing him of not meeting your needs, focus the conversation on yourself. For instance, tell him, ""I feel ignored when I don't see you until 6:30 every night.""
Listen to what he says. When he tells you something, repeat what he said back to him so that he knows you understand. For example, ""I hear you saying that you're worried about finances, and that's why you've been working late.""
Avoid passing judgment. Let him finish what he's saying before you respond. After he's done talking, offer a solution. For instance, say, ""I'm willing to live on a tighter budget if that means that I get to see you more often."";
, Some issues are worth fighting about, and some aren't. If you spend all of your time nitpicking your husband about minor problems that don't really matter, then he's not going to listen to you when major issues come up.


Criticism can destroy a relationship. As long as the dishes are clean and unbroken, for instance, don't nag your husband about how to load the dishwasher ""the right way."" Let him do things his own way. Don't sweat the small stuff.
Avoid criticizing your husband without doing it constructively. Remember to try to be calm and rational, as strong emotions can easily turn a discussion into an argument. If you criticize every little thing he does, then he will quickly tune you out.
You should praise your husband for the things he does right much more than you argue with him about things that he does wrong. This will make him much more likely to listen to you, and much happier to be around you.

, Fight right. Don't let anger take over because it may cause you to say things that you will regret later. Even when you don't agree with your husband, you need to respect his opinion and his viewpoint. To be a good wife, you need to understand that you may never agree on certain issues. No couple has an identical set of morals and beliefs, which means that both of you will need to learn to cope with occasions where you just can't resolve your opinions.


Talk to him at the right time. Don't just spring your problems on him whenever. Avoid bringing up problems before dinner, while he's paying bills or when he's immersed in a stressful situation, like fixing a problem with your car. And never, ever start an argument in front of your children.When you're wrong, admit it. You need to learn to respond to arguments and remain rational so you can recognize and apologize when you've made a misstep.

, Never talk to your friends or your family and say negative things about your husband if you're not communicating with him first. Talking about your husband behind his back is disloyal. When you get married, your first loyalty is to your partner, not to your birth family or your social group.


Complaining about your husband to your friends and family will not only not solve any of your problems, but it will also make them view your relationship in a more negative light.
Your friends and family may think they know what's best for you, but they don't know your relationship as well as you do and may unintentionally give you bad advice.

If you're looking for a specific type of partner, choose the friends you think might have that connection and ask them to set you up with single friends who match your criteria.

Be open to dating people outside your normal type, as you may find there's a spark with the person you least expect.;
, In order to meet the one, you first have to meet new people, and there's no better time than when you're both participating in a mutually loved activity.


For example, if you love old movies, wouldn’t it be great to find a partner who shares that interest? And what better place to meet that person than a classic movie theater or film festival.If you like hiking, jogging, and being active outdoors, consider joining a running group or outdoor activity club.
For fans of arts and culture, hit up local museums, art galleries, and the local theater.
Foodies can have a great time meeting at gourmet cooking classes or restaurant openings.

, The workplace is another popular and common place to meet a romantic partner,but if you’ve been at your job for a while and haven't found anybody, maybe it’s time to start getting involved socially with some of your co-workers. Go for after-work drinks, attend work parties, and get to know some of the people you work with. Even if you don’t find the one among your fellow employees, who knows who your co-workers will introduce you to!


If it’s available to you, you can always try looking for a new job, especially if you're looking for a partner with a specific job or skillset.

, There are hundreds of online dating sites out there that cater to people who are looking for very specific partners, and you're bound to find one that can set you up with the kind of person you're seeking. For instance, there are dating websites and apps for people:

Of various religions and faiths
In different income brackets
With certain hobbies or interests
Who want specific types of relationships
In different age ranges
With different educational backgrounds

, Clubs, bars, and social events are still a top way to meet prospective partners, and you can help increase your odds of finding the right partner by choosing locations where that type of person might go.


For instance, if you're looking for someone who appreciates the finer things in life, choose upscale clubs and events instead of local pubs and house parties.

, The notion of having a trophy wife involves having a partner that you're proud to introduce to friends and family. To be a trophy wife, therefore, you need to be intelligent, know what's going on in the world, and be able to carry on an intellectual conversation about a wide array of topics.Not only that, but you’ll easily attract potential partners if you can hold your own in a conversation, and you can help yourself by:


Staying on top of current events, read at least one newspaper daily.
Reading books and materials of all kinds, including fiction and non-fiction, features, history, political discourses, and classic literature.
Looking up college courses that interest you, finding the reading lists, and borrowing those books from the library to read in your spare time. This is especially helpful if you don’t have the money for a formal education but are still interested in certain degrees.

, Being a strong and independent person are always attractive qualities in a prospective partner, which is why you need to have your own dreams and ambitions, and should set and work toward your own goals.Moreover, a prospective partner will find you much more interesting if you have stories to tell and big dreams for yourself. Your goals can involve things like:


Traveling
Volunteering
Making a difference in the world
Starting a business or foundation
Education and learning
Taking up certain hobbies

, When it comes to so-called trophy wives, more often than not the women involved in the marriage were successful and wealthy before they married their partners.But everybody measures success differently, and setting and achieving goals is a good way to determine your own personal success. Depending on your dreams, success may mean:


Getting promoted to a certain position
Landing a dream job with your favorite company
Getting your own business or foundation off the ground
Visiting specific countries or landmarks
Obtaining a degree or diploma
Having a certain amount of money saved away

, Being fun, sociable, and easy to get along with will help you find the perfect partner, and it will make your partner even more eager to show you off to friends and family. Practice being charming, confident, personable, and fun to be around.Being charming doesn’t come naturally to everyone, but you can practice this by being kind, being a good listener, and don’t be afraid to tell interesting stories about yourself and the things you’ve done.
For some people, part of the appeal of trophy partners is that they can inspire envy in others, so if you get along with everybody and are charming, successful, and confident, people will be attracted to you., Proper hygiene is a good habit for anybody because it means that you care for yourself and take care of your body. Proper hygiene doesn’t have to be an elaborate routine, but whether you're still looking for your perfect mate or have already tied the knot, good hygiene is paramount. Nonetheless, a good routine can be as simple as:

Flossing and brushing your teeth at least twice daily
Showering every couple days and washing with soap or shampoo at least weekly
Keeping your hands clean and your nails nicely manicured
Wearing clean clothes
Combing or styling your hair

, Not only will frequent spa days keep you relaxed, but they’ll also ensure that your body is taken care of. Opt for treatments that involve keeping your hair, skin, and nails groomed and youthful, such as:


Facial treatments
Hot oil scalp treatments
Manicures
Pedicures

, Staying in shape, eating well, exercising,and keeping your body fit will make you healthier, more radiant, and will help keep you younger longer. Taking care of your body can also help attract a prospective romantic partner, and if you’ve already married then it also shows your partner that you care enough about the relationship to stay fit. To do this:

Exercise at least three days a week
Eat a balanced diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
Drink water whenever you feel thirsty
Get plenty of rest every night
Look after yourself when you're sick

, Fashion will always be a subjective notion, but by staying on top of current trends and keeping classically fashionable items in your wardrobe, you can dress to kill regardless of whether you're going to work, the gym, or a cocktail party.Not only that, but wearing nice clothes and looking good will attract the attention of others, and this will make you feel good, it will attract a possible romantic partner if you're still looking, and it can make your partner feel good too.


Wear outfits that are flattering for your shape and colors that complement your skin.
Read magazines and stay on top of what current fashions are.
If you want people to notice your body, wear form fitting outfits that still leave plenty to the imagination. Some suggest that showing 40 percent skin is the perfect amount to attract a mate,so try dresses and skirts that stop at the knee or a little above, and clothes that show some of your torso and arms but not too much cleavage.

, When you're wealthy and successful, you have the privilege of being able to spend more money on things you like. This makes it easier to stay on trend with current fashions, which is important for somebody who is supposed to be an icon for all things popular. And fashion doesn’t just have to do with clothes, as there are also trends with:Exercises, such as hot yoga
Spa treatments
Haute cuisine food and new restaurants
Jewelry
Cars and vehicles
Neighborhoods to live in

, There can be no such thing as a trophy spouse without the partner in marriage, and part of a healthy marriage means that you support each other and help each other succeed in life, in your careers, and elsewhere. Ways you can help your partner succeed include:


Being fun and sociable at meetings and parties for his work or friends.Complimenting him in front of his friends and colleagues, and always looking nice when you meet them., Any marriage is a give and take relationship that involves love, compromise, and trust. On top of getting the love and support you need from your partner, you must also ensure that you provide encouragement, have faith in your partner, and be there when your partner needs help or support.


Intimacy is also an important part of many romantic relationships, so even if your schedules are busy, always make time each other.

, Marriage is all about sharing your life with someone you love, and that means doing things, going places, meeting people, and making memories together. While you may both be busy, make time to enjoy your lives, which you can do by:


Making time for friends and family
Going traveling and vacationing together
Having shared hobbies or past-times
Having romantic date nights
Getting out and seeing the world (or just your city) together

"
"
Don't assume anything.,
Check your motivations.,
Watch your tone.,
Keep an open mind.Compromise is all about willingly seeing things from your spouse’s perspective and working to find a middle ground.",How to Compromise With Your Spouse2," It doesn't matter how long you have been together, there will always be things you don't know about one another. What’s more, relationships are hard work, as you both grow and change over time, so will your relationship.


Making assumptions can be self-limiting and prevent the growth of the relationship. How do you know when you are making them? Spotting an assumption is not always easy, but, generally, you are probably making an assumption when you feel rejected, neglected, hurt, or have an urge to lash out or blame your partner for something.Instead of assuming you know anything about your partner, make an effort to ask questions and maintain an open dialogue with one another.

, Emotions can be a major roadblock to compromise. When you feel upset or angry with your spouse, you might fight him or her on an issue that’s not even very important to you. Check yourself during a disagreement to see what’s really driving you.Are you truly invested in this issue or are you just disagreeing to prove a point? If you don’t feel strongly about the issue—and your partner does—relent in order to claim a win for the relationship. Don’t let your emotions divide the two of you.
For example, your spouse got a promotion that required a big move and you're feeling resentful about having to leave your group of friends in the area. You might fight your spouse on the issue despite knowing that the move would mean more income for the household. Instead of standing in the way of progress with resentment, let your feelings be known. Tell your spouse ""I'm really sad about having to leave behind my good friends. Will there be room in the budget for me to visit them a few times a year?""

, Sometimes the tone of your voice can skew your intended message and cause your spouse to put his or her defenses up. Couples often find that it’s not always what you say, but how you say it, that matters.Starting a tense conversation off with a soft, warm tone can make all the difference in how your spouse reacts. Try this:


When you have something important to say, take a deep breath before initiating the conversation. Use “I” statements that minimize blame, such as “I feel angry when you…” and use a friendly, affectionate tone. Refrain from using sarcasm or accusations that push the discussion into a bad place.

, If you remain close-minded or rigid in your own point-of-view, you reduce the likelihood of reaching a peaceful resolution.

"
"
Listen to understand.,
Post helpful reminders around your living environment.,
Find ways to compromise in everyday life.",How to Compromise With Your Spouse3," Most people listen in order to prepare a response. You should be listening to your spouse to get a full understanding of what he or she is trying to say. Actively listen and ask questions to better understand. Being a good listener involves the following habits:Turning to face your spouse and making eye contact. Or, sitting side-by-side and occasionally meeting his or her eyes, if full-on eye contact is too intimidating.
Allowing your spouse to get his or her full message across before responding.
Paraphrasing what he or she said to make sure you understood the message. “It seems like what you are trying to say is…”
Asking clarifying questions to clear up any misunderstanding. “So, you are saying that…?”
Adding your own response only after the above has been done.

, Compromise is a key skill necessary for conflict resolution.Early on, you may fall back into your old ways of disagreeing. You can prompt yourself to follow better habits by posting little reminders in your home, car, office, or wallet. These can be Bible verses, quotes, or any phrase that helps. Some examples might include:


“It’s better to bend a little than to break.”
“Compromise equals a win for the relationship.”
“Let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt.” -Colossians 4:6.

, Whether you have been the chief organizer or the chief follower, learning compromise is the key to a happy relationship from here on. Learn how to make suggestions that take into account both parties. Consider such possibilities as:


Agreeing to do an activity that your spouse wants to do this time--provided your spouse does an activity of yours next time. Set a date and stick to it.
Agreeing to do some of the activity that your spouse wants to do but adding in your ideas as well, so that the whole activity is a true combination of both your perspectives and desires.
Sharing tasks that neither enjoys doing by creating task charts that can be flexibly juggled around where needed. For example, vacuuming might be a chore taken on by one spouse most of the time except when they are unwell, away, or really busy. The other spouse can pick up on these occasions on the understanding that the spouse will return to the task when the situation is resolved, rather than the new arrangement turning into the norm. Chore creep after agreement can make the spouse who is lumped with an unfair level of chores very frustrated.
Agreeing to give each other time out from household and parenting duties on a regular basis. This will give both spouses an expectation of free time rather than it being assumed that ""someday down the line the other spouse will notice how overworked I am...""

"
"
Have realistic expectations.,
Don't try to change your husband.,
Roll with the changes.,
Accept that having children changes a relationship.,
Accept your mutual mistakes.",How to Be a Good Wife2," Neither of you are perfect. Unmet expectations tend to frustrate everyone. If your expectations are truly too high or unrealistic, then you need to set standards that are obtainable. For example, it is unfair to expect lavish possessions and have the love of your life home for every meal. If you want more together time, then be prepared to have that desire fulfilled at some expense.


Remember that no relationship is perfect. If you expect to get along with your husband and be happy 100% of the time, it won't work out for you.
Have realistic financial expectations, too. Maybe you and your husband aren't as far along financially as you hoped you'd be five or ten years down the line -- that's perfectly normal. Work on appreciating what you do have instead of expecting more.

, Accept him as he is and let him know that you would never want him to change in any way for you. He has so much to offer you if only you give him the space to be himself. He is a growing individual, just like you are. Love him for who he is, and he'll love you unconditionally in return.


Accept that you and your husband are not the same person. He won't always see the world the same way that you do, and that's a good thing. Being with someone who isn't exactly like you will make your relationship richer.
There's a difference between asking your husband to clean up more around the house and making him become a hiking fanatic when he hates the outdoors. You can ask him to improve in different areas, but you can't force him to like all of the same things you do.

, You will experience crises together, from the loss of a job to the death of a parent. You may suffer financial hardship, or you may find yourselves unexpectedly wealthy and unsure of what to do. Your marriage can survive the changes if you're willing to keep communicating and being flexible. Here are some things to keep in mind as you learn to accept change:


Remember that whatever changes happen, you and your husband are dealing with them as a team, not as people on the opposite side of a battle. Dealing with the changes together makes them much more manageable.
Roll with the changes in your love life. Though you and your husband may still be passionately in love, don't get disappointed if he doesn't want to make love every night or to kiss you twenty times a day like he did when you were newlyweds. You can still keep your love strong without wanting it to be exactly the same as it was when you first got married.
Roll with the changes with your bodies. Though you may work hard to stay fit and eat healthy, you have to accept that your 50-year-old selves probably aren't as svelte as your 25-year-old selves, and that's okay.

, You and your husband's relationship will undoubtedly change and evolve once you bring kids into the equation. This doesn't mean it'll change for the worse, but it will mean that you will be spending a lot of your free time focusing on your kids instead of each other. Accept that this will change your relationship and work to make it thrive in new ways.


To help this transition, work together to spend time with the kids, when you can, instead of isolating yourselves by taking turns.
Find new fun activities that the whole family can do together to help you and your husband stay strong as you raise your kids.
Strengthen your relationship by acting as a united front with your husband. You should agree on how to raise and discipline your kids so that you don't get into ""good cop"" and ""bad cop"" mode and position yourselves against each other when it's time to control your children.

, If you want to be accepting as a wife, then you have to be able to accept your husband's mistakes and to sincerely respect his apologies for doing something wrong (as long as it doesn't compromise you in a big way). If you hold a grudge too long, you won't be able to appreciate the good things about your husband, so it's best to accept his apologies, talk about how he won't upset you again in this way, and move forward instead of harboring resentment about the past.


Accept your own mistakes, too. Don't be so focused on being the perfect wife that you can't admit when you're wrong.
Admitting when you're wrong will help both of you grow as a couple.

Meet your husband's needs without compromising your own.,
Be your husband's best friend.,
Create shared dreams.,
Maintain your own identity.,
Work together to manage stress.",How to Be a Good Wife3," If he needs more sex, then open your mind to the possibilities. If he needs time with friends or time to pursue a hobby, then don't be possessive. He'll be happier, and he'll be grateful to you for your respect. You should meet his needs, or at least some of them, without doing anything that feels uncomfortable to you.


If he wants more sex, then consider having more sex with him, or think about why it doesn't appeal to you. But do not force yourself to do something you're not comfortable with just for his benefit. Instead, talk to him about it so he understands how you're feeling, and together you can decide on something you're both comfortable with.
If he's missing his time out with the boys, let him have a boy's night and have a girl's night of your own.
If he wants time to pursue his hobbies, let him take the time. He'll grow as a person from doing his own thing, and this will benefit your relationship.

, Develop true intimacy and unconditional acceptance. Demonstrate a willingness to be vulnerable, and be confident that your relationship can withstand conflict. Enjoy your shared history and your inside jokes. Forward him articles you know that he'll find interesting or just sit with him in companionable silence. Even your silence will say volumes when your marriage is strengthened by true friendship.


Though you should maintain other meaningful friendships so your life is full of love and laughter, at the end of the day, your husband should be the person that you turn to.
Aim to be the person that your husband has the most fun with instead of his best friend or his favorite uncle. You should be his #1 go-to person, whether he needs a good laugh or a good cry.

, Never lose sight of the dreams that you share. Whether your dreams include retiring to a warm climate or taking a trip abroad for your twentieth anniversary, embrace your dreams, talk about them and take steps to make them happen. If you and your husband's dreams don't intersect, then you'll be creating a rift as you both move further towards your goals, or if one of you doesn't get what he or she wants. It's healthy to have your own dreams along with your husband's, but you should make sure that none of your dreams are completely in conflict.
Even if your shared dreams are lofty, you still need to talk about them to keep your passion alive.

, Make sure you still have a fun and interesting life. If your husband left tomorrow, would you still have your own friends that you see at least once a month, hobby clubs you go to or sports that you play? If not, your husband will always be working to fill a void he cannot fill, and will feel inadequate. When you're fulfilled as an individual, then you have a lot more to bring to the relationship. You will be a much better companion if you can draw from your own interests, experiences, and insights.


If your husband thinks that he's the only good thing happening in your life, then he's bound to feel trapped.
Continue to pursue the hobbies or interests that were meaningful to you before the relationship. Though you may not be able to keep up with all or most of them, you should make time for the ones that were really meaningful to you.

, Men and women deal with stress all day and every day. Do what you can to help each other deal with the stress of every day life. Making sure that you are able to cope with your own stresses will take pressure off of your marriage. If one of you is chronically stressed out while the other doesn't understand why, then you'll have a problem.


Help your husband manage his stress by talking about it and treating him with extra care when he's had a rough day instead of making him feel worse by being angry that he's tired or withdrawn.
When you're stressed, let your husband know how you're feeling so he can pick up the slack around the house and help you out.

Make time for ""date night."",
Schedule sex into your life.,
Kiss passionately.,
Make your bedroom a sanctuary for sex.",How to Be a Good Wife4," No matter how busy you are, how stressful your job is, or how many kids you have, you need to make time to spend a romantic evening with your husband. If you don't have kids, aim for once a week, and if you do, try to squeeze in a date once every two weeks or as often as you can. Though it may sound corny, dressing up and going somewhere nice and special can renew your romantic connection and give you a breath of fresh air away from your home.


Your ""date night"" doesn't have to be romantically-themed. You can go bowling, play mini-golf, or even go for a night run together. Just do whatever you can to connect and spend some time together.

, You may feel that sex has to be spontaneous, but if you don't add it to your schedule, you may start to neglect it. Without the frequent intimate acceptance and love that comes from your lovemaking, a person can become dissatisfied, grumpy, and ultimately suffer from feelings of rejection and even anger. Remember lovemaking gives an intimacy and physical release that is vital for both of you.


In most relationships, each partner has different needs and expectations regarding the frequency of physical intimacy. Find a happy medium with your husband. Couples who feel responsible for meeting the needs of their lover tend to be happier in their relationship., After a while, you make do with a peck on the lips instead of with full-on French kissing. Make it a goal to share at least one six-second kiss with your husband each day, or every morning and night, even if you don't have more time for intimacy than that. You don't want your husband to think that kissing you is no different than dutifully kissing his children -- the passion should still be present in your kisses.


When you do make love, don't go straight to sex. Make sure that kissing is an integral part of your love making. It's great foreplay.

, Ban television sets, laptops and work-related materials. Your bedroom should be dedicated to sleep and sex. If you bring in your children's toys, the nightly news, or the extra work you have to do, then you won't think of your bedroom as a special and sacred place. Maintaining an area of the house for sleep and sex will make your love -- and lovemaking -- feel more special and vital to your relationship.You and your husband can work together to remove any irrelevant items from your bedroom. This can also turn in to a fun couple's activity.

, Take your time. Read the manual and you won't have to worry about the children handling sharp tools from your toolbox, as you can actually assemble the toy before Christmas when they are in bed! Have a glass of wine or a cup of coffee and relax; the hard part - actually braving the Christmas crowds and buying the toy - is done.

, Perhaps the garage, your bedroom, or a relative or neighbour's home?

, Normally it's a simple push-fit assembly and no tools are necessary. Use the assembled toy to gauge the size you need. Attach your gift wrapping paper to the perfectly straight edges that the frame provides. Within minutes, you have a perfectly gift wrapped cube that looks great!

, Go down and see what gifts they have got. Don't worry about the time; no doubt it's early but you'll be able to relax soon enough. Watch them rip open the gift. It's just what they wanted and they can play with it right now, because you've already assembled it! Whether your toy needed an initial mains battery charge, assembly, or was just a really difficult shape to wrap, you'll be sorted.

, It's fun when they first get the gifts. But then to stop boredom and wandering, have them help gather up the wrapping paper and put it in the recycling bin. Also, task them with specific duties to help prepare for the Christmas meal. If they whine, tell them they can return to their toys when they have finished helping out.

If you plan to make a traditional Christmas cake from scratch then this needs to be started at least a month before Christmas.,
Christmas shopping can be very stressful with all the crowds and you can't take the children with you because they will see their presents.,
Christmas for kids is all about the presents but make sure that you don't just buy them toys, buy the things they actually need as well.,
Many children creep around the house while their parents are in another room on the hunt for their presents.,
Before you wrap the presents carefully remove them from the box and check that they are not broken or damaged.,
Buy enough batteries and one extra pack of each just in case.,
When you put up the decorations let the kids help.,

, If you have kids get them to write out a list for you. That way you know what they most desire. You do not have to buy everything on their list; just get a few of the items and the rest is up to you. Also a good tip for Christmas shopping if you have children is to leave them with a trusted adult. If you do this make sure you tell the adult what they are to eat in case of any allergies.

, Most parents buy nothing but toys for their children, and by Boxing Day the kids want something else, so make sure you buy them things such as clothes, vests, socks, handkerchiefs, pajamas, combs etc.

, To prevent this, wrap their gifts, lock them in a secure cupboard and make sure the key(s) are always with you.

, Also keep your receipts so in such a case you can replace the damaged item. If the toy needs to be assembled then as to avoid the hassle on Christmas day and the possible injury of your children due to them fiddling with dangerous tools, assemble them before they get wrapped.

, There is nothing worse than receiving a present that you badly wanted and then discovering that you can't use it because you have run out of batteries.

, Also buy each of your kids a set of decorations and tell them that they are theirs to put on the tree wherever they want. This will make them feel special and included.

, So on Christmas Eve arrange some relaxing activities for the kids to do all day while you prepare for the busy day ahead.

, Instead have some healthy water, juice and fruit snacks laid out on a table for them so that you won't have to get any snacks for them which means interruption.

,, Christmas is after all the most wonderful time of the year!"

Some people enjoy something subtle, such as oranges and thyme.However, you can use whatever combination you want, including cinnamon, cloves, ginger, cranberries, and clippings of pine., Place the items in a pot big enough to hold them. With spices, you can use whole spices, like cinnamon sticks or whole cloves, or just ground spices if that's all you have. Pour in enough water to cover everything., Bring the pot up to a boil on the stove. Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat until it just maintains a simmer. You can simmer the potpourri all day, but you'll need to add water throughout the day as it evaporates from the pot."

You can use Christmas ornaments, string lights, strands of popcorn, tinsel, and anything else that looks festive. However you choose to decorate your house for Christmas, save some decorating for Christmas Eve so that you have something to do.;
, Making Christmas cookies is a classic Christmas tradition. You can eat them yourself or leave them out for Santa when he visits your house to bring presents. You can make sugar cookies or gingerbread cookies with Christmas cookie cutters and decorate them to be festive for Christmas. Try making these Christmas tree shaped cookies! You could even make gingerbread houses, if you have lots of icing and candy for decorations., There are lots of Christmas books and movies that you could spend your time enjoying on Christmas Eve.

Make plans for your future together and revise these plans regularly.,
Communicate!",How to Be Faithful in a Marriage," Once you have taken your vows, don't do anything to break that trust. You have both taken vows to be faithful in every way to one another. Now it's time to believe in one another and trust your partner. Suspicion and doubt don't cause a spouse to cheat, but if one spouse exhibits high degrees of any of these to the other, it spells trouble for the relationship. Set reasonable boundaries and stay within them - this fosters trust, and the longer you each stay within the boundaries you have agreed on, the more trust you will build as time goes on.


Your behavior early on will set the tone for the rest of your relationship. If you set a tone of faith, trust, and belief in one another and give each other a real sense that your relationship is solid and unshakable, it will be a great comfort to you and help you through difficult times. If you prove yourself worthy of his/her trust today, in ten years if someone accuses you of something, he/she will dismiss it, knowing that you would never betray him/her because of your history together.
On the other hand, if you do something that you should not have done, you can't expect your spouse to trust you totally. You have put doubt in his/her mind, and that has made him/her insecure. The only way to correct that is to do everything in your power (through real actions) to show him/her that they can trust you.;
, No, you may not come and go as you please, no matter how much that may rankle. You have a responsibility to your spouse or partner now, and the sooner you accept it, the fewer fights and arguments you'll have. Acting as if you are free and accountable to no one will pretty much ensure that you will be single again - soon. Instead, keep in mind your love for your spouse and the love your spouse has for you, your commitment and your vows. Examples:


If you agree upon something do exactly that. Don't change it unless absolutely necessary, preferably due to circumstances you cannot control. If this happens, call and notify your spouse of the change immediately - don't wait till he or she is worried or angry.
Though ""checking in"" or reporting changes in plans may rub you the wrong way, learn that you must sacrifice some things if you are to be successful as a team – remember that this helps your spouse to keep the trust she or he has in you. Being accountable to your spouse helps keep you close, and that helps build fidelity and faith.

, It's simply a matter of honoring your commitment, and of letting your spouse know when to start worrying. If you didn't want to be cared about or be responsible to someone else, you shouldn't have married.

, Avoid taking the ring off in most situations, even if your friends tell you to. Some exceptions are when playing sport, washing the dishes or if it could be damaged or cause you injury on the job. Do remember to put it back on straight away!


Leaving your ring on sends a clear signal to everyone else outside of your union. It reminds you that you are ""taken"" and most people will know better than to trespass.
If someone fails to heed the sign of your ring, show it to them close up and be sure they know it means you really are married and that you're not interested in flirting at all. If presenting your ring and clearly stating you're married and happily so doesn't work, and that person continues to pursue you, stop contact with that person at once, if possible. (If it's your brother's wife, you may have a tough time doing that, but limit contact to groups and never be alone with her. If she manages to isolate you from the rest of the family, extricate yourself quickly - kindly if possible, but rudely if necessary. In any case, be utterly clear.)

, If either of you is experiencing problems with intimacy, talk it through – and the earlier, the better. Being intimate through loving gestures, hugs, kisses and sexual relations is a vital part of keeping the two of you bonded.Even daily sweet nothings whispered to one another and praise for the things you love about one another on a regular basis are guaranteed ways to keep the fires burning and the original memories of why you fell for each other truly alive.

, Doing hurtful things to see how your spouse will react is a bad idea. The problem is that testing your spouse's reaction to flirting or paying other people too much attention creates a climate of doubts about your honesty, and introduces anxiety and turbulence. Don't pick fights just to see what she/he'll say or do.

, If you meet with someone who tries to come on to you and maybe even who is attractive to you, don't panic. Simply show no interest and say it clearly to that person. Explain that you're very happy in your marriage and have no intention of straying. Say exactly those words. Then excuse yourself and go someplace where there are other people around. Don't allow yourself to be cornered by that person again.


Don't get yourself into any situation where even a whiff of lust is near. It's natural to find yourself attracted to others, even people other than your spouse. But don't allow yourself to be alone with anyone like this, and don't go out of your way to see him or her. Don't daydream or email, don't entertain the notion of being with someone else - unless it's someone like Katy Perry or Ryan Reynolds. Someone unattainable is a silly crush (still, you shouldn't obsess over a crush like this to the detriment of your marriage). Someone at work, or at a party (i.e., in the same room with you) is a threat to your happy marriage.
Have an escape plan. For example, consider that if a certain person who attracts you comes near you, that you'll head for the bathroom and then perhaps another group of people - or even head home., Don't give a half-hearted ""Gee, I'm really attracted to you, but I'm married"" response. This sends a wrong message - it says, ""If only my stupid spouse weren't in the way, then you and I could hook up."" Anyone who knows you're married and persists in coming on to you will not hesitate to run over your spouse if she/he thinks you're at all interested. What matters is that you are married, and your commitment is to your partner or spouse. Put your foot down hard and walk away, leaving no room for doubt or hope. Don't worry about letting him or her down easy.


People who try to encourage a person to dally with them knowing full well that the other person is married are often very unhappy people, and they don't care to see anyone else happy. Ask yourself this question: ""Why isn't there someone special in their life?"" Often it's because they are simply not happy to be happy. Remember that if they don't mind harming your marriage, they won't be hanging around after the thrill of being with you wears off.

, If you know you'll be in a situation where you can't avoid a person who keeps coming on to you, take your spouse along. Knowing your partner is watching will keep you in line, and hopefully will deter any questionable acts on the part of the other person.

, It doesn't matter whether it's a job or a circle of friends. If you've tried your best to put the stops on the interest someone has in you - and worse yet, if you have started to return those feelings, you have to leave the situation immediately. If it's work related, either request a transfer or request that the other person be transferred, because it's endangering your marriage. If it's a circle of friends, stop hanging with the friends where you keep meeting this person. Don't moan and complain - remember, your goal is that 40th wedding anniversary, and beyond. No job, no chick or dude, no amount of ego boosting is worth destroying your chance at that. Remember: a few moments of pleasure are not worth discarding a lifetime of happiness with that special someone.

, Studies have shown that men who cheat start spending time away from home, such as working late at the office, going out for drinks after work, etc.Curtail this habit – bring the work home with you, schedule dial-in discussions with other workmates after hours using video conferencing on your broadband and take your spouse out to dinner instead of your colleagues.

, Be sure to not only plan, but to also do the exciting and amazing things you have planned together. Shake things up now and then and do things neither of you have done before. Go to places together that thrill and excite you, do things together that scare and awaken you and throw in unexpected treats, outings and surprises for one another here, there and everywhere.


When the children come, be sure to keep your spouse as number one priority. You can love your children absolutely without forsaking your love for your spouse. There has been a tendency in our current child-obsessed culture (partially, it's about hanging onto one's own childhood) to put the children's interests before the spousal love life. That's unbalanced and will end up exhausting everyone's limits, smothered children included. Be a loving role model for your children so that they grow up seeing parents whose love for one another and mutual respect endures throughout all the messy diapers, bossy tweens and curfew-breaking teens!

, If you are feeling pushed away, due to lack of attention or contribution. Communicate those feelings to your spouse. They may even be feeling the same way and most relationships that I have seen turn into a disloyal one because of lack of communication. One of the partners will find support to their emotions in another person who will listen. This can lead to a bad mistake which will have to be worked out later. If we can avoid this all together then temptation to stray will be less likely.


Examples: You are doing all the housework and your spouse is not contributing. Your spouse does not seem interested in you and you feel pushed away when you try to get attention. You feel something is missing in the way your spouse is treating you. You feel like something is missing in the area of the relationship that you feel is important.

Bake the fruit and ""cookies"" on a low heat (250 degrees Fahrenheit) in the oven until they dry out (or use a dehydrator). String them up together.Alternatively, you can use this same method to make a homemade potpourri. That is, make the dried fruits as you did above. Mix them with whole, dried spices like cinnamon sticks, cloves, and star anise to make a homemade potpourri., You can pick up pine cones that are already scented from your local craft store. Alternatively, you can find your own pine cones and scent them yourself. All you need to do is spritz them with a bit of cinnamon essential oil or spray. Place the pine cones around your home in small groups., Also called pomanders, these beauties have been used since the Middle Ages. All you need to do is poke holes in oranges or grapefruit with a toothpick or skewer. Poke a whole clove into each hole, and use the completed fruit to decorate your home."

Call a friend.,
Entertain yourself with something unrelated to Christmas.,
Go to sleep early.",How to Make Christmas Eve Go Faster2," Call or text one of your friends. You may not have seen them in a while because you might have time off from school, so you should catch that person up on what’s going on in your life and ask them about theirs. Try to immerse yourself in the conversation so that you are a little distracted from the fact that it’s Christmas.

, If you want to distract yourself from the fact that it’s Christmas Eve, you should do an activity that isn’t related to Christmas. For example, you could try one of the following activities:


Read
Write
Draw something
Play a musical instrument
Exercise
Take a bath

, The fastest way to pass the time will be to fall asleep, because when you wake up, it will be Christmas morning! However, sometimes it’s hard to fall asleep on Christmas Eve. Here are some ways that you can try to fall asleep faster:


Wear noise cancelling headphones to counteract distracting noisesWear socks to bed
Take a warm shower before you try to fall asleep
Go to your “happy place”
Listen to music"

Ask them what they want.,
Think about the items they want.,
Come up with a plan for earning and saving money.,
Wrap the present.,
If nothing else, make an awesome card.,
Bake Christmas treats and hand them out in your neighborhood.,
Talk to your parents about caroling with a group of family friends.,
Look around for service project opportunities and ways to give gifts to homeless shelters, orphanages, etc.,
Look in your closet, and pull out things you like that are fitting for Christmas.,
Keep the cold weather in mind, if you live in a cold winter climate.,
Finish it off with Christmas accessories.,
If possible, get a tree for your room.,
If you're saving money, consider making a string, paper, or felt tree on your wall.,
Buy or create holly to hang throughout the room.,
If you have a stand-up light in your room, you could wrap it with holly, but you could also wrap it in red paper or string to create a spiral effect, like the north pole!

,
Make or buy a wreath for your door.,
Create a ""workshop"" place, where you store all of your wrapping paper, bows, string, and presents.",How to Plan for Christmas As a Tween/Teen," It's helpful to know what they will actually want to receive when you're planning the gifts. It would be awful if you got them an extraordinary gift, but then they hate it and never use it!;
, Try to come up with ways to add a personal spin or a homemade touch to their present. For example, if they want a whiteboard, you could paint the rim of the whiteboard or cover it in pretty fabric, decorate it by fastening memorable photos to it with magnets, make homemade magnets for on the whiteboard, or come up with other customizations.

, You can't buy a gift with no money! If your parents don't give an allowance, look for change lying around on the ground in stores, at home, etc. Every penny counts!

, But, wrapping accessories cost money! Buy a Christmas gift bag with a little tissue paper as an easy fix. Dig in closets or in the attic (if you're allowed) to find wrapping paper. You could also use a friend's wrapping paper.

, You can do a lot more with homemade cards, fun to make, and also are cheap to make, using household items! Older people appreciate homemade cards more, and they'd love a long, sincere letter rather than a short, funny letter. For siblings or friends, consider their personality to find which type of card they want!

, Everyone loves classic Christmas cookies! You'll have fun baking them, too!

, Christmas songs is sure to brighten anybody's day!

, There are kids just like us with no families or homes, and they deserve a Christmas just as much as we do!

, Christmas only comes around once a year... take the opportunity to dress in a totally new outfit! Some of you boys might not understand, but it's important stuff! But, you don't need to spend money on a new outfit... it's more fun to get creative with your own wardrobe, and you should put your money towards more important things, like presents for the family!

, You may have a beautiful red dress that you love, but if it's non-sleeved, you'll get sick, or get very cold. Layering is very helpful for this, and often it's very stylish, if done correctly! Find a cozy, pretty sweater for over a dress or shirt, or a long sleeved shirt for under.

, Find festive earrings, a necklace, and a bracelet. This doesn't mean that they have to have a snowman or a candy cane, they could just be a Christmas color, or just match your Christmas outfit! Also consider adding a cute scarf and/or hat!

, This would be if you already have one, or if money isn't a concern. Decorate it with lights and ornaments!

, You could also use a combination of supplies that you have at home, too! Draw or make fake lights on the tree, and create a garland with string, pipe cleaners, or whatever you have. For the ornaments, you could glue pom pom balls onto the tree, or you could make homemade ornaments just like you would for a real tree, and ""hang"" them on the tree.

, Line shelves with it, wrap it around your bed, lay it on your dresser, and line the outside of your door frame with it! Don't be afraid to put a ton of holly in your room!

,, You can buy them cheaply, but you can make them cheaper!

, Especially if you own a desk in your room, this can become even more organized. You can get really creative with  how you make that look!

Gather your children and let them try out your scavenger hunt.",How to Hold a Christmas Scavenger Hunt," You'll need to create several clues to the ""finder"" to alert them to the next place where they'll find the next clue.;
, If you can, prepare yourself with several boxes (boxes that look like gifts work best) to hide each clue inside. You can also place the clue underneath safe Christmas decorations, tinsel, or something else. Only use stuff that is associated to Christmas, and plan out where each will go so that you can tackle the actual clue writing.

, Think up several rhymes that will help guide your kids to their next intended location.


Use your imagination when thinking up ideas. The key is to keep your kids mind's thinking, yet still keeping them uninformed until the very end.

, Make sure to disperse them into several rooms over long distances. If you have more than one floor, you can even have them chase up and down the stairs at times. Criss-cross the notes. If you can, have the clues hit into every room of your house.


Make sure you second-guess your own kid's intended route-markings, after you place the clues in their intended spots. Check to make sure the planned route you've set up for your kids can safely get them and you there, without crossing into a former location's answer.
A light mark of a pencil can help make sure you haven't crossed into a previous location's clue a second time around.
Clues that are in a room, can be placed in two different spots, but make sure they are easy to get access to.

, This could probably be inside cabinets in the bathroom or inside a master bedroom, or wherever you decide it imperative for them not to look.

, Either wrap up several gifts in a separate box, or if the gift is larger than one other gift box, have it in a place where you can be assured your kids can't accidentally notice the first time around and move it shortly before the scavenger hunt begins.

, Enjoy the hunt, and get into the Christmas spirit!

Find out where you can get your child’s picture made.,
Dress them up.,
Have them think about what they’ll ask for.,
Teach them about Santa beforehand.,
Get there early.,
Stay close by.,
Offer coaching and encouragement.,
Get them smiling.,
Have a portrait made.,
Order prints.,
Send out a Christmas card.,
Post the photos on social media.",How to Have Your Child Take a Picture with Santa," Do some research into places in your area that offer photo opportunities with Santa. Your best bet will usually be a shopping mall, large department store or town square, although toy stores and hobby shops might also offer holiday photo services. Mark off a day on your calendar when you’ll have some time to take your child in.More popular locations will usually charge higher prices and be in more demand. If you want to avoid some of the chaos or expense, take a look at alternatives like smaller studios.
Be prepared to spend a few hours negotiating traffic, waiting in line and getting the pictures taken.;
, Your child’s first picture with Santa is a memory that you’ll cherish forever, so pull out all the stops to make sure their cuteness gets captured. Use this as one of your few yearly occasions to get them into a nice, dressy outfit, or have fun putting together a festive costume. Don’t forget your props, like elf ears, reindeer antlers or a wintry scarf and pair of mittens.Get your child in on the fun by letting them pick out some of their own clothes and accessories.

, It’s customary for young children to ask Santa for a special gift or a request that they’re hopeful to receive on Christmas day. Tell your child that Santa is capable of granting wishes, and that they should try to think of something really exciting or meaningful that they want to come true. Their head will be spinning with the possibilities!Filling your child’s head with thoughts of toys, games and surprises can distract them from the scary unfamiliarity of the situation.
Emphasize that Santa only brings presents to nice, well-behaved children.

, When young children don’t know who Santa is, they may become frightened at his appearance or the strangeness of the setting. If your son or daughter hasn’t already learned about the wonders of Santa Claus, give them a little primer on his backstory, what he does and why they should be excited. Once the time comes to meet him, they’ll barely be able to contain themselves, rather than turning into a tearful mess.Show your child an image of Santa so they’ll already know what he looks like.
If possible, do a walk-by of a photo session going on at a mall or community center and give them a sneak peek of the proceedings.Be careful about making unnecessary reassurances about Santa. Saying things like “there’s nothing to be afraid of” may backfire and put ideas in their heads that weren’t there before.

, The closer to Christmas it gets, the longer you’ll be forced to wait to see Santa. If you don’t want to spend all day slogging through slow-moving department store lines, set out first thing in the morning and try to arrive before business starts picking up for the day. This will save you, and your little one, a lot of stress.Arriving early will also give your child a chance to see other kids getting their pictures taken, which can help prepare them if its their first time.
You might even have some extra time to sit and chat with Santa the studio is vacant.

, One reason kids often get scared when they pose for pictures with jolly St. Nick is because they get separated from mom or dad and plopped down on the lap of a complete stranger. When it comes your child’s turn, make sure you remain nearby and in plain sight. If they can see you standing there cheerful and unconcerned, they’ll be less likely to get upset.If your child is inconsolable, ask if it would be alright for you to get in the picture with them.
Bring a favorite toy or a stoic older sibling to help your young one see that there’s nothing to be afraid of., While the photographer is snapping the pictures, you can take part in the process from the sidelines. Lavish your child with praise to help keep them calm. Throw them the thumbs up, grin big and tell them how lucky they are for the opportunity to be introduced to the one and only Kris Kringle.Don’t try to do the photographer’s job for them. They’re usually trained in ways of making distraught kids more comfortable in front of the camera.

, Now for the hard part: taking a good picture. Giving an overwhelmed youngster some gentle cues to “say cheese” or flash their pearly whites can help put them at ease by calling to mind happy family photo sessions. Chances are, they’ll be looking your way for any indication of how they should feel, so the more ecstatic you appear, the better the chances that happy feelings will flow.There’s no guarantee that your child will be as thrilled by the spectacle as you are. If they seem totally overwhelmed or start pitching a fit, get them out of there and try again next year.Be happy with what you get. Even if somebody blinks or screams their head off, it doesn’t mean the photo is ruined. Try to enjoy the experience and the memories that came from it.

, Most commercial photo services will offer to print and frame your child’s picture with Santa for a small charge. A framed portrait can go on the wall, in your bedroom or over the fireplace where the stockings are hung. They make great gifts, as well.Put the portrait out every year when you’re decorating for the holidays.
Add a custom message or greeting to commemorate the occasion, such as “Smith Family Christmas 2016.”

, While you’re at it, get a few copies of various sizes made that you can slip in your wallet or pocket book, use for crafting purposes or frame to give to others. Print packages are usually inexpensive and give you a number of options in choosing how to share or display your photos. That way, you can always have that touching (or at least entertaining) moment with you wherever you go.Wallet-sized pictures are also perfect for making scrapbook collages, crafting photo ornaments for the tree or pasting in a multi-photo frame.

, Celebrate the holidays by proudly using your child’s photo as the centerpiece of your family’s annual mailer. All your friends and relatives will be able to see what a delight they were when they met Santa for the first time.Include a short caption detailing the experience, especially if there’s a humorous or adorable anecdote involved.
Reward your child for their bravery by making them the star of the Christmas card.

, Once you get the proofs back, scan them (or take a few candids of your own at the event using your phone) and upload them to your hard drive for eternal safekeeping. You can then post the best shots on Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat for all your followers to see. A picture is worth a thousand words—or, in this case, likes.Social media is a great way to keep in touch with distant loved ones and give them glimpses of your family as they grow.
Tag the business or location where the pictures were taken so that other parents can see how well they turned out.

Fold the bottom of the fabric over the bottom and inner side of the hoop, then glue it to the inner side or top of the hoop. The entire hula hoop should be covered and hidden by the sweater.
Alternatively, you could wrap the bottom of the sweater around the hoop and hold it in place with a few loose stitches.;
, Put on the sweater and stand in front of a full-length mirror. You'll decorate the sweater while it's on your body.

, Pin the metallic garland to the bottom of the sweater on one side of your body. Wrap the garland up and around your torso until you reach the space just beneath your arms.


Wind the garland up and around your torso like you would wrap garland around an actual tree. You'll need to pin it in place at various points as you work to prevent it from falling off.

, Pin the garland to the bottom of one arm, then wrap it all the way around and down the sleeve. Repeat with the other arm.


Try to wrap the garland in even layers around both arms. The positioning doesn't need to match precisely, but it should be close.
You may need someone else to help you pin the garland onto your sleeves. If you don't have a helper, you might need to take the sweater back off to work on the arms.

, Pin one end of the jingle bell garland to the bottom of the sweater on one side. Wrap it all the way around the bottom opening, pinning as needed, until the opposite end meets the starting point.


Only wrap one layer of jingle bells around the bottom opening of the sweater. Trim off the rest of the strand to use for your sleeves.

, Pin any excess jingle bells to the sleeves, doubling over the metallic garland you already attached.


Try to keep the same amount of bells on each arm. You may need to cut the remaining strand in half before pinning each half to its respective sleeve.

, Use safety pins to attach the white pom-poms to the body and sleeves of your sweater, spacing them apart at even but unmeasured intervals.


These pom-poms will serve as ornaments, so arrange them as though you were placing actual ornaments on an actual tree.

, Remove the ornament hooks and replace them with safety pins. Pin the ornaments to the body and sleeves of your sweater, spacing them apart evenly but without a set pattern.


Don't be afraid to rearrange some of the pom-poms you already placed to make room for the red ornaments. Continue rearranging as needed until you achieve a look you feel happy with.

, Hold your arms up, forming a point above your head by pressing your palms together. Look in the mirror to determine where any gaps or cluttered clusters might be and adjust accordingly.

, Use another safety pin to attach the point of the star to the opening of one sleeve. Allow the star to hang loosely.


When you bring your palms together above your head, the star hanging off your sleeve will turn into the tree topper of your sweater.

, The sweater is now finished. When you're ready to show it off, hold your arms above your head, forming a point by pressing your palms together. Doing so should create the silhouette of a Christmas tree, complete with decorations and a festive tree topper.

Attach the final two ties.,
Tie three bows with the excess tie material.,
Glue one bow to the top of the tree.,
Adhere the other bows to your sleeves.,
Decorate the tree with button ornaments.,
Wear the sweater.",How to Make an Ugly Christmas Sweater2," Cut each of the five ties with scissors, trimming each one so that it is approximately the same length as the sweater when measured from the wide end.


Try to choose ties that are Christmas themed. The patterns don't need to match--in fact, you can create an uglier sweater if you purposefully look for patterns that clash.
You'll use the broad ends of the ties to create the tree itself. Save the skinny scraps, though, since you'll need them later on to create bows.

, Position the first tie straight down the center of the sweater. Apply hot glue to the back of this tie and press it onto the front of the sweater.


The natural pointed end of the tie should face the bottom of the sweater and the cut end should face the collar. This cut end should also land just a little below the collar.
Fabric glue or fusion fabric tape can be used instead of hot glue, if desired.

, Place one tie to the right of the center tie, positioning it at a slight diagonal so that meets at the top in a blunt point. Repeat with another tie, placing that one to the left of the center tie. Glue both ties in place.


The bottom points of each tie should remain visible, but the corners above those points should connect to one another.
These outer two ties will overlap the center tie slightly, and the left-hand tie will slightly overlap the right-hand tie near the top. When finished, the bottom should form the base of the triangle and the top should form the tip.

, Position one tie next to the left-hand tie and attach it to the sweater with hot glue. Position the last tie next to the right-hand tie and glue in place, as well.


These outermost ties should roughly follow the same angle and placement as your previous tie layer. They will slightly overlap the ties of your previous layer.
When finished, these five ties will create a ""tie tree"" on the front torso of your sweater.

, Take three of the tie scraps and tie them into standard bows.


If the cut ends of these scraps start to fray, fold them down and hold them in place with a little hot glue to prevent further fraying.
Make sure that at least one bow is large enough to span over the entire top of your ""tie tree."" The other two bows can be the same size or slightly smaller, but they should roughly match one another.

, Use hot glue to attach the largest of the three bows to the top point of your ""tie tree."" This bow should completely cover the connecting point of all five ties.


Only glue down the center of the bow. Allow the loops and tails of the bow to hang loose.

, Glue one of the remaining bows to the top side of the right sleeve, near the opening of the sleeve. Glue the other bow to the same approximate point on the left sleeve.


The tails of both bows should flare out toward the opening of their respective sleeves.

, Randomly arrange 24 to 48 buttons over the ""tie tree,"" spacing them apart at even but non-uniform intervals. Hold each button in place with a dab of hot glue.


Use buttons of varying sizes, shapes, and colors. Space them apart as you would space apart ornaments on an actual Christmas tree.

, Once everything dries, the sweater is done and ready to wear.

Cut out a felt star.,
Glue the star to the top of the tree.,
Wear the sweater.",How to Make an Ugly Christmas Sweater3," Use scissors to cut the miniature tree skirt cleanly in half.


You'll only need one half the the skirt. You can discard the remaining half or use it for another project.

, Use hot glue to attach one tree skirt half to the bottom of the sweater. The straight (cut) edge should face and the rounded edge should hang toward the bottom.


If the cut edge of the skirt looks like it might fray, fold it under and hide it beneath the body of the skirt. Hold the fold in place with glue.
The bottom of the skirt should hang to the very bottom of the sweater, if not a little beyond it.

, Glue one end of the garland to the top of the tree skirt, 2 inches (5 cm) in from the side. Lay the garland straight across until you're within 2 inches (5 cm) from the opposite side.


The bottom layer of garland needs to overlap the top edge of the tree skirt. You'll use the garland to create the “tree,” and this bottom layer should look like the bottom of the tree sitting on top of its tree skirt.

, Zigzag the garland up the sweater, creating horizontally stacked layers. Make each layer slightly shorter in length than the one below it, creating the basic shape of a Christmas tree.


You may need to make some adjustments to the positioning of your garland, so don't start gluing it immediately. Wait until after you've arranged it over the front of the sweater. Then, once you are satisfied with the height and width of the tree, use hot glue to secure the placement of the garland.

, Wind the strand of miniature lights into the garland, spacing the lights apart as evenly as possible. Safety pin the strand to the sweater in 2-inch to 4-inch (5-cm to 10-cm) intervals to hold the lights in place.


Try to hide the wire in between the garland and the sweater so that only the lights themselves are visible.
Make sure that the battery pack hangs down at bottom of the sweater. Ideally, you should be able to hide this pack in your pants pocket when you wear the sweater.

, Arrange the ornaments over the garland tree as desired. Hold each one in place using a dab of hot glue.


Try to space the ornaments apart as though you were decorating an actual Christmas tree.
You may need to turn the lights on while arranging the ornaments to avoid accidentally crowding them out.

, Use scissors to cut a basic star shape out of yellow craft felt.


You may need to trace the shape of the star onto the felt using pencil before cutting it out. If so, make sure that the pencil-marked side faces down when you attach the star.

, Attach the felt star to the top point of the tree with a small amount of hot glue.


Alternatively, you can skip the felt star and pin a star-shaped brooch above the top of the tree, instead. Gluing a star-shaped plastic ornament to the top of the tree would also work.

, At this point, the sweater should be complete and ready to show off at your next ""Ugly Christmas Sweater"" themed party.

Limit commercial gifts and presents.,Don't use Christmas as an excuse to party, eat and drink too much.,
Remind your family of the facts before you put up a Christmas tree.,
Say grace before Christmas dinner.,

Explain to your children the real story of Christmas, of course, in a Christian way!",How to Keep Christ in Christmas," Worship God, sing and pray. Don't just go to Church but really take to heart the message of salvation that Jesus offered you. Remind yourself that you have been forgiven because he chose to die on the cross for all of our sins. Also, remember the message of the virgin Mary and Christ's miraculous birth. Keep in mind that the word ""Christmas"" comes from the words ""Christ's Mass,""meeting as a congregation. Attend Mass, or the services at church.;
, Don't eliminate them altogether, but make them special -- consider keeping them simple and giving no more than three per child from the parents. Jesus received three gifts from the three wise men: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. We can keep our gift-giving less materialistic and more symbolic of what occurred on the first Christmas. 

,, Much like the Easter bunny, Easter eggs, and even the word ""Easter"" itself -- Santa Claus, elves and decorating a tree is another adopted Christian tradition that was originally pagan (not about Christ).

, Thank God for bringing your family together on this occasion, for the food, and for all the blessing's you've received and health and family.

, Smile, laugh and have some special visits with neighbors, relatives, grandparents, uncles and aunts, cousins,...

Being too uptight about keeping ""cultural Christmas"" out of your children's worlds, when it is so widespread in our culture, may make them resent living a strict and formal Holiday life if they feel excluded from their peers' fun.

, Read a Biblical account of Christmas to the family after all the festivities are over (chapters 1 and 2 of Matthew is a good place to start). It will be a closing word to explain the actual meaning behind the celebration that happens on Christmas.

Consider a small token of appreciation for each helper.",How to Hold an Untrim the Tree Party," Send out informal invitations by email, text and even Facebook updates. For everyone close, just ask them directly to come along.;
, Use leftovers from Christmas, especially unopened packets of candies, nuts and other treats that were left after the festivities ended. Also make child-friendly treats. If you're offering substantial fare for a meal, try having a buffet as it allows everyone to help themselves as they're milling around enjoying the party.

, Have some on fragile bauble wrapping, others tinsel winding and others wrapping fragile decorations. As well as dealing with decorations, there are lights to carefully wrap up, the tree to take down and the floor to sweep and vacuum. Then, put everything back into storage.


Be sure to provide enough wrapping items and all the storage boxes to make it easier for everyone.

, The substance of the rest of the party is up to you.

, It doesn't need to be anything big, perhaps just a small sweet or a voucher for a movie or an activity like ice skating or indoor climbing, to encourage the kids to keep active during the break.

Avoid sticky situations.,
Stay in groups.,
Talk about your partner.,
Wear your wedding ring.,
Spend time with faithful friends.",How to Deal With the Desire to Cheat on Your Partner1," Avoid situations or places where you tend to become a bit flirty. If you know that after a few drinks you don’t make the best decisions, then avoid going to bars without your partner or invite them to tag along. Avoid similar locations where you have been tempted in the past, like clubs., Be especially careful to avoid being alone with people who you have been romantic or sexual with in the past. If you have a coworker who you’re flirty with, don’t go with them alone to lunch. Never spend time with them outside of professional settings.If they invite you out to lunch, you can say something like “Actually, I have too much work to do, I’m sorry.” You can also see if other coworkers would like to tag along.
If you must be alone with them, leave the door open and meet in an open space. Keep your interactions professional.

, If you find yourself in a tough spot, bring up your partner casually in conversation. This will serve as a reminder to both you and others that you are not available. You don’t need to be showy about your relationship, but do continue to make them aware of it.For instance, if they bring up a particular show they like you can say “My boyfriend really likes that show, too! I don’t care for it that much.”

, This is a great way to show the world and to remind yourself of your commitment. If you have a moment when you’re eyeing someone else, you might look at that ring and reconsider these thoughts. If you cannot wear it while working, consider getting a tattoo.If you are not married, consider wearing some other symbol as a reminder to yourself. You might consider a bracelet or even a piece of yarn.

, Spend a little less time with your single friends while you are struggling with these desires. Your single friends’ unattached lifestyle might influence you to do something you'll regret. Opt for more time with your married friends, instead.

Do not disconnect completely from these friends. Simply avoid going out with them to bars; opt for activities like lunches and movies instead.

Confide in your friends, not those who you’re attracted to.,
Set a time limit.,
Get in touch with your spiritual side.,
Imagine your partner walking in.,
Get to the root cause of your desire.",How to Deal With the Desire to Cheat on Your Partner2," In the heat of the moment when you feel tempted, call a friend. You can tell them about the situation so they can talk you out of it, or you can use them as a distraction to your desire. Once you get off the phone, you will likely have built up the courage to resist.You can say something like “Hey, remember when I was telling you about my coworker Alyssa? Well, she just invited me back to her place for drinks. I need you to talk me out of it.”
You might even call your partner to talk to them, too.

, If you cheat, you will hurt your family and the family of the other person, too. If this person is a coworker or friend, take opportunities to get to know their family. Use occasions like office Christmas parties to introduce yourself to their spouse and kids.If you won't have the chance to meet them, check out their social media so you know what their family looks like.

, If you are having issues in your relationship, avoid confiding in people you have feelings for. Rely on your partner or your platonic friends to discuss these things. You can talk to family, as well.You might call up your brother or sister and ask for advice or just vent about the situation.

, When tempted, step away from heated moments and agree to give yourself an hour to think. Often times, once this time limit is up, the moment will have passed and you will decide against making a bad choice., Spirituality or religion can be a great source of strength during this tempting time. Turn to your local center of worship for help with remaining faithful. Spend time in prayer or meditation at night.

You can also try becoming more spiritual with your partner. Invite them to places of worship and ask them to pray or meditate with you.

, You might have a regular flirtation with someone already going at this point. Imagine your partner’s face and feelings if they could see and hear what you are doing. Imagine also if the situation were reversed and they had an inappropriate relationship. Think on how that would feel for you., Reflect on your desire to cheat. You might want to cheat because you’re not being pleased sexually at home. You and your partner might be fighting a lot lately, as well. Think about what is truly motivating your desires and then work to address them.

For instance, if you are not happy with your sex life, suggest something new to your partner to spice things up.

Date your partner.,
Communicate effectively.,
Write a list of what you love about your partner.,
Evaluate your relationship.,
Consider an alternative relationship.,
Get help if necessary.",How to Deal With the Desire to Cheat on Your Partner3," Instead of thinking of the sexual or romantic things you could be doing with someone else, do those things with your partner. Surprise them with a gift or a picnic. Take them back to the spot where you first met them. Plan a mini vacation for just the two of you. If you invest in your own relationship, you will be less likely to wander., When there is a problem, talk to your partner about it. Listen to their opinions, without interruption. Try to have as few unresolved issues between the two of you as possible.Avoid yelling or cursing at your partner.

, Take a moment to reflect on why you fell in love with them in the first place. Write down everything you like about them, from the freckle below their left eye to their kind heart. Celebrate them for the things you love about them rather than finding these attributes in others.

You might even consider sharing this list with your spouse.

, Often times, your partner probably makes you very happy; however, the idea that grass might be greener on the other side can poison even the best of relationships. Begin keeping a journal documenting your days, and the status of your relationship with your partner.

Write down any arguments you had or times when they were kind to you. Think about what you would be missing if your relationship ended due to cheating.

, At the end of the day, some people are just not meant for monogamy. This does not mean that you should cheat, but that you should instead be honest with your partner. They might be feeling the same way and perhaps you two could have an open relationship, instead. Or perhaps, it is time to move on so your partner can find someone whose views on relationships are more in line with their own., If you have always had a problem with cheating on your partners in the past and you desire to turn over a new leaf, seek professional help. It is unfair to continue entering into romantic relationships with people if you have these unresolved issues. Many counselors can help reshape the way people think about things and create new habits. Find a therapist in your area and make an appointment for a session. Being faithful can sometimes be tough, but with the right supports, you can keep your commitment!"

Put up your tree, hang decorations around the house and string up a garland or two. Put some lights out the front; that way, they can be shared with everyone who goes past.


If you are in a hotel or somewhere that isn't yours you can still decorate with a few bits and pieces; choose items you can either carry home with you or things you don't mind parting with once the day has ended.
Making your Christmas decorations yourself is a fun way to get into the Christmas mood, and also lets you focus on doing something that is unique to your tastes and interests.





;
, Prepare a playlist of your favorite Christmas songs, or purchase pre-recorded Christmas CDs. Keep the music playing on Christmas day to help you feel in the spirit. As an added bonus, you can sing as loudly as you want along with the carols and not feel embarrassed!

, Send cards or email greetings to any family members, mothers father, sisters, brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, cousins and nephews.

, It's normal to buy things for yourself all through the year, so it's just fine to treat yourself at Christmas too. The great thing about buying gifts for yourself is that you get exactly what you want in the color, shape and size you want. Wrap the gifts up using great Christmas paper and put them under the tree to open on Christmas morning. Even though you know what they are, it's still fun to have new special things on Christmas.

, Since you are celebrating Christmas on your own, you can serve all your very own favorite foods. This might be as quirky as turkey and ice cream, as functional as pizza, or as traditional as what your Mother used to make when you were little. Anything that takes your fancy. Get your favorite foods, your favorite drinks, your favorite dessert and all the trimmings. Set the table up beautifully with a special tablecloth and candles to make it feel like an extra special meal.

, This will allow you to spend Christmas with others. Also it will mean that you will think more about the real meaning of Christmas and discover it is just as special whether you have hundreds of people to celebrate with or no one at all. If you are lonely, go to church services at three different churches on the day and see which is your best.

, Watch this as part of your Christmas Day celebrations.

, Movies are often open and can be a way of being around others while enjoying a film.

, This will allow you to be around others and to be helping. It's nigh on impossible to feel lonely when you're helping others and it can help put your own situation into perspective.

, Go for a walk or hike and be mindful of what you see and experience. How does the air feel? What birds do you notice? What sounds do you hear? Nature has a magical way of putting things into perspective."

Know when it’s over.",How to Deal With a Cheating Spouse," Your spouse’s reasons for cheating may not always be obvious, and you may feel that the natural thing to do is to blame yourself. Maybe you think you’ve grown distant, or that you haven’t been very forthcoming in the bedroom. Maybe you’ve let work overwhelm you and haven’t made enough time for the relationship. However, these may be reasons that your relationship needs some more work, but you need to know that nothing you do can ever cause your spouse to cheat, and you shouldn’t ever blame yourself for your spouse’s mistakes.


Sure, you may be at fault for a certain problem in the relationship, and it’s important to acknowledge that. However, you should never, ever think that some mistake on your part makes your spouse’s cheating okay.
If you focus too much on blaming yourself, then that will be letting your partner off the hook. It’s important for you to focus on your partner’s behavior, too.;
, If you want to drive yourself crazy as quickly as possible, then you can ask a million questions about the other man or woman, spend hours stalking that person’s Facebook profile, or even try to catch a glimpse of this person in person. You may think that knowing everything about this person can help you figure out what was wrong with your relationship, but in reality, this won’t give you any more answers, though it will cause you plenty of pain.When a spouse is having an affair, it’s rarely about the third person. Unless that spouse thinks he’s truly started a meaningful relationship with a third party, most of the time, it’s really an expression of the cheater’s dissatisfaction with himself or the marriage. If you focus too much on the other man or other woman, then you won’t be thinking about your spouse or the relationship.
Though knowing some things about the affair can bring you comfort, you may not want to know too much about what the other person looks like, what he does for a living, or any other details that are likely to distract you or to make you feel bad about yourself. It’s just not worth it.

, Though you may think that you’ll be able to move forward if you can just find a logical explanation for why the cheating happened, such as the fact that your husband has been feeling powerless ever since he lost his job, or that the third party came on to your wife so much that she couldn’t possibly resist, there’s no use in trying to make sense out of nonsense. Accept that you’re hurt and that you need to find a way to move on, but don’t think that making excuses for your spouse is the way to get there.What went through your spouse’s mind when he or she decided to cheat may defy logic. Don’t spend too much time trying to come up with a perfect reason for why it happened and work on moving forward instead.

, You may feel incredibly hurt and incredibly angry, and may have the urge to tell all of your family members, your closest friends, or even to post about it on social media to really get your feelings out. However, if there is a chance you want to reconcile and make things work, then you’ll have to deal with people looking at your spouse and your relationship differently for the rest of your lives. Instead of telling everyone you know, tell only the people close to you who you think can really help you think this through.


Once you tell everyone about what happened, you may feel an initial relief, but that could be followed by some pain and regret. You may not realize that you weren’t ready for everyone’s advice or judgment.
If you do tell your close friends about your partner’s infidelity, make sure you do so cautiously if you’re not sure what you want to do about it. If your friends think you’re definitely going to leave your partner, then they may tell you the 1,000 things they never liked about him, and this won’t actually make you feel any better and may lead to awkwardness down the line if you choose to stay in the relationship.

, Along with not telling everyone you know what happened, you shouldn’t worry about what the people who do know think about the affair. Though the people close to you can give you useful advice, in the end, it’s all about what’s best for you, and you shouldn’t ask yourself what everyone will think if you decide to leave or to stay in the relationship. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what everyone else thinks, and you shouldn’t let the judgment of others cloud your decision-making process.


Talking to the people close to you can definitely help you gain strength as well as a new perspective about your situation. But in the end, know that their opinions can never replace your own.

, Though you may think that you want to pack up your things or kick your spouse out of the house the second you find out about the cheating, you need to take more time to think this through. You can certainly spend some time away from your spouse, but avoid saying you want a divorce or taking any drastic measures right away. Give yourself time to reflect about what happened and what’s best for you and your relationship instead of doing something you may regret later.


Though deciding to take some time apart immediately can be a good thing, you should avoid saying that you want a divorce as soon as you hear the news; though this may be what your gut tells you to do, wait until you have a clear head before you decide this for good.

, Though it may feel good to be cruel to your spouse, to take away the things that he loves, or even to have your own affair in return, this kind of behavior won’t get you very far and it won’t help you move your relationship forward. Though you can be hurt, cold to your spouse, and keep your distance for a while, you shouldn’t actively make a point of making him or her feel worse, or you both will end up feeling terrible.


Punishing your spouse will only fill you with more bitterness and will make your relationship feel even worse. It’s okay to take some time apart and to be more cold and distant than normal, but being actively cruel won’t make anything better.

, You should take your time to think about what you want from your spouse before you begin a conversation with him or her. Don’t just start talking about the cheating and move on right to crying and making up. Instead, take some time to formulate a game plan so your spouse knows what you expect from him if he wants the relationship to continue. This shouldn’t feel like a punishment, but like a plan to move forward together.


Let your partner know what he or she needs to do for you to continue the relationship. This can include going to counseling together and possibly apart, taking concrete steps to rediscover the things you loved to do together, making time for communication every night, or sleeping in separate rooms until you feel comfortable sharing a space again.
If you’re thinking about getting a divorce, you may want to retain a lawyer as early as you can. The sooner you do this, the better bargaining position you’ll have.

, Even if you really feel ready to forgive your spouse or for things to get back to normal, you should know that it can take a long time to regain that trust and loving feeling you once had for your spouse. Even if you’re both determined to make it work, it can take a long time for things to feel, for lack of a better word, “normal” again, and for you to feel fondness toward the person you married. This is perfectly natural. If you try to rush things along you may run into trouble.You won’t be able to forgive your partner or to feel like things are back to normal overnight. It can take months, or even years, to rebuild that trust again.
You’ll have to take it slow, too. It may take many days for you to feel comfortable sleeping in the same bed as your partner again, going out to dinner with him, or to enjoy doing the things you loved to do together. Be prepared for that.

, Let your spouse know what you’re feeling. Tell him about the anger, the hurt, the betrayal, and the pain he has put your through. Don’t keep your guard up and act like it wasn’t that big of a deal; let him really see your pain and to hear how you’re feeling. If you’re not honest and open about what you’re going through, then you won’t ever be able to truly move forward together. Though you may feel shy or scared to reveal your true feelings, it’s important that you do so.


If you’re nervous about facing your spouse or not saying everything you wanted to say, you can write down all of the things you want to share. That way, you won’t get lost in the moment and forget an important point you wanted to make.
If you feel too emotional to have a conversation about what happened, give it a few days or wait long enough to feel comfortable talking about it as candidly as possible. Of course, the conversation may never feel completely comfortable, but you can take some time to get your footing if you need to. That said, you may not want to delay this conversation for too long.

, You may want some clarity when it comes to what your cheating spouse did. If you want to piece together how this has been going on, then you can ask questions about how many times it happened, when it happened, how it started, or even about what your spouse feels about this other person. However, if you want there to be a chance that the relationship lasts, then you should think twice before asking about details that you may be better off not knowing.


Ask any questions that you think will help you get a better sense of where your relationship stands. However, try to avoid asking questions just to satisfy your curiosity; the answers may end up hurting too much.

, As embarrassing as it may sound, as soon as you know that your spouse has cheated on you, you should both get tested immediately. You don’t know what diseases the third party might have had, and you won’t know whether or not this was passed on to you. Though your spouse may argue that this isn’t necessary, it’s what you need to do to make sure you’re both safe.


Going through this process will also help your spouse understand the gravity of his or her actions. Sleeping with someone else while also sleeping with you has put you at risk, and it’s important to acknowledge that.

, Though you will be feeling hurt, overwhelmed, betrayed, angry, and any number of other emotions that you want to let out, it’s important to also sit and listen to your spouse. You may feel as if hearing him or her out is the last thing you want to do, but if you want to get some clarity and to move the relationship forward, then you have to hear his or her side of the story. You may learn about new feelings or frustrations that you didn’t know your partner had.


It’s not fair to think that he doesn’t deserve to tell his side of the story or to have feelings in all this. Though you may not feel ready to confront your spouse’s feelings, you have to let him express himself if you want to move forward.

, Once you and your spouse have begun to talk about the cheating, you can work on improving your line of communication. Make sure to be open and honest, to talk regularly, and to avoid being passive aggressive as much as possible. Though this may seem impossible after what your spouse did, it’s important to communicate as well as you can if you want things to get better.


Once you’re up to it, make a point of meeting every day, pushing all distractions aside, and talking about how your relationship is going. If you feel like this is exhausting and only rehashing old feelings, then you should work on talking more about the present and future than the past.
It’s important that you and your spouse check in with each other to see how you’re feeling. This is the time to be vigilant and to focus on your relationship. If you don’t have strong communication, then it’s hard to move forward.
Work on expressing your feelings with “I” statements, such as saying, “I feel sad when you don’t greet me after you come home from work,” instead of using “you” statements, such as, “You never give me any attention after you get home from work,” which come off as more accusatory.

, Of course, once you start talking about the cheating, you have to make an important decision: do you think you can eventually forgive your spouse and have a healthy relationship again, or do you just think there’s no chance it’ll ever work? It’s important to be honest with yourself and to think about whether or not your relationship is worth saving. The most important thing is to take the time and space you need to really reflect before making any rash decisions.


If you’ve talked to your spouse, stated your feelings, and heard his or her side of the story while feeling like you’ve had a bit of time to reflect on your feelings, then you can start to decide whether or not you want to try to make things work.
If you decide you want to make them work, then prepare to put in a lot of effort. If you know it’s over for you, then it’s time to take the steps to get a divorce. If this is the path for you, then you should look in to the laws of your country and/or state — they tend to vary quite a bit.

, Unfortunately, no magazine, friend, family member, or doctor can tell you what decision is best for you—or for your family. If there are kids involved, then your decision gets even more complicated. Though you may think there’s only one right answer, at the end of the day, you have to be honest with yourself and see what your heart is really telling you. It can take a long time to find the truth, but the most important thing is that you recognize that no one else can tell you what to do or what to feel—especially not your spouse.This can be an intimidating thought, because chances are that you will need some time to figure out the answer. But if there’s something that your gut is telling you already, then you better listen.

, Remember that forgiveness really is a choice; it’s not something that either happens or doesn’t. If you’re willing to forgive your spouse, or even to try to forgive him or her, then you have to decisively make the choice to do so. Forgiveness won’t just fall into your lap or his, and you need to work to get there. The first step is accepting that you’re going to try to make things work.


Be honest with your spouse about this. Don’t let your desire to forgive or not forgive remain a mystery. Let him or her know that you really want to try to make it work.

, If you want to start rebuilding your relationship, then you and your spouse should spend quality time together that has nothing to do with the fact that your spouse cheated. Work on doing the things you used to love together and avoiding the places that remind you of the cheating that took place. Make an effort to start from the bottom up, making sure your relationship has a solid foundation through daily activities before you move forward too fast.You can even discover a new activity, such as hiking or cooking, to do together. This can help you see your relationship in a new light. Just make sure you don’t feel like your partner is suffering through it or trying too hard, though.

, When you’re dealing with a cheating spouse, you may feel like your last priority is to take care of yourself. You may be too busy feeling a whirlwind of complicated emotions to think about things like eating three meals a day, getting some sunshine, and making sure to get enough rest. However, if you want to stay strong during this difficult time and to have the energy to work on your relationship, then that is exactly what you have to do. Here are some things to keep in mind:


Try to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night. If you can’t sleep because you’re bothered by your spouse sleeping next to you, you should feel comfortable discussing alternate sleeping arrangements.
Work to eat three healthy meals a day. Though you may be prone to eating more unhealthy foods, such as sugary snacks, because you’re stressed, you should try to stay healthy to keep your spirits up. Fatty foods can make you feel sluggish.
Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day. This time is good for your mind and body and can give you some time to be alone and not think about the affair.
Write in a journal. Try to write in it at least a few times a week to take some time to get in touch with your thoughts.
Don’t isolate yourself. Spend more time with your friends and family to feel centered.

, Though counselling isn’t for everyone, you and your spouse should try it if you’re trying to make things work. You may feel like it will be too embarrassing or too much for you, but this can actually be the best way to create a safe space for you and your partner and for you to truly feel comfortable sharing your feelings. Find a counsellor you trust and make sure to give it your all during your sessions.


If this is important to you, make it clear to your spouse that it’s non-negotiable that you go. Your partner violated your trust, and he or she should be able to do this thing for you.

, If you have children, then dealing with your cheating spouse will be even more complicated. Your children will likely feel the tension in your home, and it’s best to be open and honest with them about the fact that you and your spouse are having some problems. While you don’t have to go in great detail, let them know you love them and that you and your spouse are doing the best you can to figure things out.If you’re thinking of ending the relationship, don’t let your spouse use your children to guilt you into sticking it out. While he or she may argue that your children will be better off with two parents at home, this may not be the case if those two parents are always fighting or no longer care for each other.
Make time for them, even while you’re dealing with this hard situation. Being with your children can make you feel stronger, too.

, If you’ve made every effort to make things work and just can’t see yourself forgiving your spouse or moving forward, then it may be time to end the relationship. Don’t be frustrated yourself for not being able to forgive your spouse, even if he or she has been working hard to regain your trust; some things just cannot be forgiven. If you find that you simply can’t continue the relationship and feel like you’ve made an effort to try to make it work, then it’s time to make the decision and move on.


Don’t be mad or frustrated with yourself if you feel like you simply can’t forgive. You’ve made the effort, and your partner is the one who violated your trust in the first place.
If you have been able to move on, then you shouldn’t be ashamed of yourself for “giving in,” either. You’ve made a choice that you think is best for your relationship and your family, and no one should judge that.

Look for declining quality in your relationship.,
Listen to your spouse.,
Be attentive to appearance.,
Note any change in sexual activity.,
Trust your instincts.",How to Determine if Your Spouse is Cheating1," People who have affairs may lash out because they feel guilty.Affairs may also be the result of a flagging, unhealthy marriage. Signs of an unhealthy relationship include: Your spouse will criticize you more often.
You will engage in more frequent fights.You will spend less time together.
He or she will avoid your calls.
A low-quality relationship can be a symptom or a cause of cheating. In either case, take steps to make things right with your partner. Talk about your concerns honestly and openly, and let them know that you love them and want a healthy, caring relationship.;
, When they become infatuated with another romantic partner, they may mention them abundantly in conversation. They might also mention their romantic partner critically in front of you, or stop mentioning them at all.Your spouse may quote a potential romantic partner at length, or relate a story about something innocuous they did together. If your spouse insists vehemently they are “just friends” with the individual in question in a way they don’t with other acquaintances, it may indicate an affair.
Alternately, if your spouse stops referring to someone he or she had spoken of frequently before (usually a coworker), it may be a sign they’re having an affair.Finally, if your spouse starts criticizing someone they previously had no problem with – a neighbor, a coworker, or friend – it may be to conceal the fact that they are actually involved with that person romantically and are attempting to mislead you.

, When your spouse is having an affair, they may take a new interest in their appearance.They want to look nice for their new romantic partner by purchasing new clothes, changing their hairstyle, or otherwise upgrading the way they look. Other visible signs your spouse may be attempting to please their lover with a new, more youthful appearance include:


visits to the dentist
a new pair of glasses
visiting the tanning salon more frequently
using a new cologne or perfume
losing weight
exercising more often

, If your partner is cheating, your intimate encounters with them may improve or evaporate depending on your partner.If your partner is satisfying his or her sexual appetite with someone else, they might have little energy left to spend on you. On the other hand, it is possible that in order to better conceal the affair, your spouse has decided to mislead you by boosting the level of intimacy at home. Perhaps the affair improved your partner’s sex drive overall or introduced them to new techniques in bed. Be on the lookout for changes in the level and type of sexual activity between you.

, If you suspect that something is wrong, don't ignore it. You may be detecting some subtle microexpressions (very brief flashes of an emotion other than the one being expressed) or insincere emotions.What is often chalked up to intuition or a gut feeling has a solid basis in biology. Trust your feelings when you suspect infidelity.

Hide your suspicion until you're sure.,
Gather evidence.,
Assess your evidence.,
Get social support.,
Know what you want should he be cheating.,
Avoid alcohol or other drugs.,
Try to remain calm.,
Avoid letting him make it about you.,
Ask him why he cheated.,
Re-assess what you want.,
If applicable, keep your children in mind.,
Seek out a couples counselor.",How to Confront a Cheating Husband," Don't confront your husband until you are sure that he really is cheating. There are a couple of reasons for this:


If you are wrong, and throw out an accusation like this, it could damage your relationship.
If you are right, but don't know it yet for sure, it'll be your word against his should he decide to lie about having an affair.;
, Before you confront your husband, you need to be sure he is cheating. Do what you can to obtain evidence without infringing too much on his privacy. Keep an eye out for ways to gather information.


For example, if he is checking his phone right in front of you, peer over and see if you notice him texting with a woman. See if the texts seem flirty or inappropriate.
Try to see whether he smells of different kinds of perfume after he comes home.
See if he openly communicates around you or whether he slinks off to the corner of the house to make phone calls or send text messages.
Keep track of his stories and look for inconsistencies. It takes him effort to keep track of lies and he may make mistakes upon repeating a story about his whereabouts. Write down what he says so you're sure you aren't fooling yourself if you think he is changing his story.

, Before you confront your husband, review your evidence and make sure that it is enough so that he cannot lie his way out of having an affair.


Based on the evidence you have, think about what he might try to say to convince you he is not actually cheating.
For example, if you find some emails that are about him getting a drink with a co-worker and it seems flirty but it is somewhat ambiguous as to whether he cheated, ask yourself whether this combined with what else you know about the situation is convincing enough or whether you should wait to find out more.

, Even suspecting your husband is cheating on you can be a very emotionally disturbing experience. Mitigate some of these negative feelings by letting in a trusted friend in on your suspicions before you confront your husband.


Your friend can offer you moral support to buffer against the stress and, possibly, guidance., Before you confront your husband, have in mind a sense of what your game plan is should be confess. This will help you to remain focused and will set the tone for proceeding with conversation despite it being highly emotional. Ask yourself if you want:


The relationship to end?
The relationship to heal?

, Although it may seem like a good time for some 'liquid courage', you want to be in a clear mental state when you confront your husband.


If you confront him while you are intoxicated, you may become violent or not be able to remember the details of the conversation later on. Alcohol and other drugs have been implicated in many cases of domestic violence. , Although this is certainly easier said than done, do your best to not let things get escalated. Neither of you will be thinking straight and this may give him the opportunity to slam the door and run away. If you give him the opportunity to escape the conversation, he may be able to get the time he needs to concoct a convincing lie. Instead, bring the conversation up in a calm and collected way.


For example, you might say, ""I wouldn't throw this out there lightly, but I'm really worried that you've been showing behaviors that suggest to me that you may be having an affair and I want to talk about that with you.""
If you find yourself getting worked up, try taking a few deep breaths in and out.
Try to remind yourself that although the pain may be near unbearable now, all emotional pain heals over time., If he tries to turn the conversation to you, such as that you are crazy or invaded his private space, calmly state that his behavior gave you serious concerns and that the conversation you are having is about whether or not he cheated on you.


Try to be as rational and logical as possible and re-affirm that his behavior led you to become concerned and that you felt it was warranted to poke around given how serious cheating is.

, Try to get a sense of why he had an affair; there will generally be a reason behind it. This will help you to decide whether you want to try to repair the relationship or whether it is time to let it go.


Try to gauge whether he seems sincere; go with your gut instinct here. If it seems like he is just telling you what you want to hear, be wary.

, Although you should go into the conversation with some sense of whether you want to end the relationship should he confess to cheating or try to repair it, re-assess this based on the conversation.For example, if he admits to having a sex addiction and has convincing evidence that he in fact does and he genuinely wants to repair the relationship, you might decide to change your mind and attempt a repair.

, If you have children, be sure to confront your husband when they are away. This could be an emotionally damaging experience for your children to witness.


If it is difficult to have the conversation away from them, go out for dinner with your husband. Instead of actually going to dinner though, find a quiet bench where you can sit and talk and have the conversation.

, If you are having trouble talking about the infidelity with your husband, or if repairing the relationship is something you are considering, you may want to see a marriage counselor to help you work through your problems.To find a couples or marriage counselor try searching the internet with the terms ""couples + counselor"" in the search box.

Have fun thinking about what to give your family, friends, and whomever else is lucky enough to get on your list. Write down your ideas to ensure that you don’t miss anyone. Whether it’s a gag gift or a sentimental one, taking the time to find the right gift for the right person is a great way to get into the Christmas spirit.Finding the right gift for someone may be difficult but you can search for online gift guides to help you through the process. A good starting point can be choosing a gift based on the personality or your relationship. For example, if the person is a friend from college, you can give them a sweatshirt from your alma mater.
Ask if the the person has a wish list. While it may seem lazy, research has shown that people receiving a gift that they actually want makes them happier than if they were to receive a gift that a lot of thought was put into. However, if you do put a lot of thought into a gift you may feel closer to the receiver.;
, It’s easy to get caught up in the holiday spirit so prepare a list and budget. Just because you have the perfect gift idea for your dad, doesn’t mean you should mortgage your home to get it for him. Be disciplined in your spending by creating a list, complete with prices and alternatives, and keep it with you at all times., Avoid the holiday crowds by shopping in the comfort in your own home. It is easier to stick to your budget as you keep a spreadsheet open or app to help you track your spending. You may also find great promotions and deals exclusive to shopping sites. Be aware to read the fine print on shipping and returns. You don’t want to buy the perfect gift and have it arrive 2 weeks late, damaged, and only eligible for store credit., Shopping online can be risky because you may not get a chance to see and hold the item. If the item is the wrong colour, size, or texture, you may not have time to return it. Shopping in person can also be a fun activity when done with company as you can joke or get another opinion if you're having trouble deciding.

, You can find many chocolate calendars that help you get into the Christmas spirit with a daily treat. If chocolate isn’t your thing, you can also use any calendar or download a fun app to help countdown the days. Countdowns help build anticipation and let you stay on track with your shopping and preparations.

, Waking up to the smells of the season are a great way to start each day. Create a Christmas aroma pot using orange, cinnamon, apple cider, and cloves. Let everything simmer during the day so that the aroma wafts throughout your entire your home., No matter what genre of music you enjoy, chances are there are Christmas songs that are perfect for your musical taste. While variety is good, only you know what songs can get you in the mood for the season.

The earlier you shop for decorations, the cheaper they will be. You may also use social media to find used and unique decorations as well as instructions on how to create your own. You may also decorate your food, your face, your clothes, or anything else you have permission to decorate.Buy festive wrapping paper, Christmas lights and ornaments on sale right after Christmas. Buy them with neighbors for bulk pricing.
Encourage your neighbors to decorate their homes with lights.

, There are many classic Christmas movies that you can stream online or watch on tv as many major networks will begin to show Christmas programming. You may also watch new release movies as Christmas time has some of the biggest and most anticipated movie openings of the year.Some great examples of Christmas movies are Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, A Christmas Story, A Charlie Brown Christmas, and Elf.

, Christmas trees are synonymous with the season. Whether you go out and choose a real tree or get your plastic one from the basement, enjoy the annual tradition of decorating your tree with your family and friends. Themes can always be fun to let your creative juices flow.Although live trees are traditional, consider a less flammable synthetic tree to reduce the risk of fire ruining your Christmas.
If you don’t have the space or budget for a full blown tree, visit local displays. Department stores and even entire neighbourhoods will display Christmas trees so check your community calendar., Gingerbread houses are a fun activity for family or friends. Find your favourite recipe and build the type of house that fits your budget and schedule. Whether you’re making it to be displayed or to be eaten, enjoy the process.You could also choose to buy a Gingerbread house-making kit. These kits are quite common, and can be found in grocery stores as well as department stores. Buying a kit can make the whole affair much easier and simpler, but can be more costly than if you made the ingredients yourself.

, Christmas is a great time to mix old favourites with new recipes. Baked goods are a fun gift and are tough to run out of since this is the most social time of the year. When you have free time to bake, make sure you freeze baked in sturdy containers that can stack easily.Ensure that the baked goods have cooled down and wrapped before storing them as you don’t want freezer burn.You may use royal icing to decorate cookies before you freeze them. Wait until the icing is hard before you stack them. You may also place each individual cookie in its own plastic bag before stacking.If you’re making a few different baked goods, keep them in separate containers to make sure the flavors don’t blend together. Store your treats in the back of the freezer to maintain freshness as they’ll keep up to 3 months., Advent calendars mark each day leading up to Christmas with a piece of chocolate and can be found at most grocery stores. They are cardboard boxes with little windows that you open, one for every day of December, up to Christmas. Use your imagination to create your own version with a small treat for each day. Whether you bake little pieces of chocolate or more extravagant gourmet candies, create anticipation as each day becomes a fun surprise., While many families may already have an annual tradition, make sure to send your invites early if this is the first year organizing a family Christmas. When creating your invite list, make sure that you are aware of any conflicts between family members or extended family to avoid any awkwardness. Depending on how many people you invite, be sure to create a menu for enough people and with plenty of recipes you can cook ahead of time.If you're inviting a large number of people, save yourself time and energy by asking for contributions to the meal. Make sure to keep an organized list to get enough variety for everyone and that anyone cooking is comfortable making their assigned dish.
Organize games and activities if there are a lot of children in your family. Young children may get easily restless in anticipation of opening their presents.

, Whether traveling on your own or with others, Christmas is one of the busiest times of year to travel so book your holiday in advance. Many people choose to escape the cold weather and look to vacation in warmer climates. Create a budget and look for all-inclusive packages to help save money.


Ensure that you are able to take the time off of work before planning any vacation. Other coworkers may have already booked the time off.
Read reviews or consult a travel agent if you do not know where you would like to take your vacation. Do not book your travel itinerary without researching the pros and cons of your destination. Vacationing should be an escape from any stress so put in the work beforehand to ensure a fun filled getaway.

, Add some Christmas cheer to your office by organizing a gift exchange or Secret Santa. Simply place everyone's name in a hat or organize a system in which each co-worker is anonymously assigned a fellow co-worker to buy a gift for. Make sure that there is a price limit and to stress that gifts should be appropriate for your work environment.For a more random exchange, create a cakewalk in which everyone buys a gift. Set a price limit so that no one goes overboard. Line up all the gifts and assign each with a different number. Follow the rules of musical chairs and play a song as everyone walks around the gifts. When the music stops, each person gets the gift closest to them., Depending on your faith, Christmas may be a time to express your faith. Many Christian churches will post their schedules for the holidays. Find your local place of worship and be sure to come early as some places of worship may be filled beyond capacity.

Look out for unusual behavior.When they answer their cell phone, do they often flee somewhere out of earshot or cover the screen when texting?,

Watch your finances.Are there any credit or debit card charges you do not recognize, such as restaurants, hotels, recreational activities, etc.?,
Check the phone.,
Check the computer.,
Hire a private eye.A detective can follow your spouse, track their movements, and take film or video of their interactions over an extended time period.",How to Determine if Your Spouse is Cheating2," Do they go on work trips or unusual outings with friends and insist on you staying behind? Is their reaction odd or suspicious when you confront them about these outings? They may be trying to evade you in order to keep their affair under wraps. Has your spouse taken up a new hobby or interest? If so, they might have picked up a new interest from their lover. Any sudden change in your spouse's routine or lifestyle could indicate infidelity.Write down exactly when your spouse goes to work, goes to the gym, goes for lunch, etc. Call your spouse's place of work when he or she is supposed to be there, and see if he or she picks up.
Their routine may vary due to the work that your spouse does, so take care to consider other factors when using schedule as an indication of cheating.

, If your spouse believes you are on to them, they may take extra caution in hiding their affair, making your job of unearthing the truth more difficult.Act cool and natural with your spouse even as you’re gathering evidence and picking up on the signals he or she is unconsciously broadcasting.

, Have you found receipts for flowers, gifts, or other strange expenditures? If so, contact your bank or credit card company about the charges to get more information. Confront your spouse about his or her spending. If their answers are elusive, unclear, or suspicious, it's likely your spouse is cheating.


Questions about finances depend on the specific expenditure, but might include:

""Do you think these charges are correct?""
""Did you buy ____? ""
""When did you buy ____?""
""Why did you buy ____?""


Elusive or unclear answers include:

""I don't remember.""
""It's none of your business.""
""Let's talk about it later.""



, Check your spouse’s text messages and cell phone calls. You might be able to find text or voicemail messages which indicate they are having an affair.


Even in the absence of explicit statements revealing an affair, you can use context clues to figure out if one is going on. If you notice a high volume of texts or calls between your spouse and someone else, it could be because they are having an affair. Other indirect evidence of an affair could be references to outings or recreational activities they shared together, but which your spouse didn't share with you.

, Your spouse may be communicating with their lover through social media, email, or internet chat service. Check his or her profiles for messages which indicate an affair is going on.


You should also check browser history. If the browser history has been deleted recently, it may indicate your spouse is concealing a recent web session which included viewing their paramour’s social media page.

, As an unknown third party, the detective can easily document your spouse’s movements to reveal infidelity (or, hopefully, a lack thereof).


Get a referral for a detective specializing in proving suspected extramarital affairs.
If you are unable or unwilling to invest the resources into getting a detective, do some digging on your own.Ask neighbors and your spouse’s coworkers about his or her habits. Try to discover if they were seen coming or going at odd hours (especially at times they claimed they were elsewhere), or if they’ve been seen frequently in the company of someone who might be a romantic interest. If you have access to your partner’s cellphone, social media profiles, or email, check them for incriminating messages."
"
Be patient.,
Use a soft approach.,
Ask probing questions.,
Become a lie detector.,
Ask directly.",How to Determine if Your Spouse is Cheating3," Your spouse may not be ready to confess that they are having an affair. Recognize that you cannot force them to confess.Often your spouse will deny they are having an affair many times before they confess to actually engaging in one, especially if you do not present them with hard evidence of their infidelity.

, Even though you’re angry and upset about your partner’s infidelity, always be gentle when making inquiries about their habits which may reveal they are having an affair. Adopt a non-accusatory tone of voice and do not yell. Sit when asking them questions and do not stand over them. Do not become aggressive or engage in physical violence. Even if they become angry at you for being “suspicious,” do not respond with anger. Adopt non-threatening body language by keeping your hands in your lap or at your sides. Do not cross your arms or put your hands on your hips when asking probing questions.

, There are many questions you can ask your spouse to discover if they might be engaged in an affair. Instead of asking or accusing them outright, ask questions about their whereabouts or habits to make them accidentally reveal they have lied. One technique involves utilizing the Volatile Conundrum. This means putting the potential cheater in a position where they have to make a snap decision about their behavior or whereabouts.


For instance, if your partner says he or she was at the batting cage with friends before coming home, you might reply that your friend was at the batting cage as well and reported that it closed early due to a broken water main. Even though this is untrue, your spouse will have to agree or disagree with this version of events, giving you the opportunity to later fact-check his or her rely.More general probing questions might explore why your spouse has changed his or her habits, appearance, or schedule. For instance, you might ask:

“Why have your hours changed at the office?”
“What made you want to dye your hair?”
”Why did you decide to lose weight?”
”Who was on the phone?”



, If your spouse offers long, overly-complex answers with abundant detail, or fidgets and squirms during the conversation, they may be lying to you. Liars also tend to present stories which are inconsistent or illogical. By asking the same question in different ways over a long period and looking for changes in their explanations, you might be able to determine if your spouse is cheating. For example, you might ask “Why did your work hours change?” Record your partner’s answer surreptitiously, then ask a similar question 7-10 days later, such as “Why are you working so late these days?” Finally, a lying spouse will exhibit microexpressions, very brief (1/25th of a second) facial expressions belying their guilt, fear, or surprise at being suspected of cheating., If you are still having a hard time determining if your spouse is cheating on you, take a more direct approach. Most will lie, but some will tell the truth. Liars tend to offer long, overly-complex answers, fidget or squirm uneasily, and will insert more interjections like “um” or “ah” into their replies. If your spouse reacts with anger or irritation, they might be lying to you.Be honest. If you have information which conclusively establishes that they are having an affair, present it. Do not dance around the subject or suggest indirectly that you suspect they are having an affair.
There is no perfectly accurate measure for detecting a lie. Everyone has different “tells,” the unique characteristics they display when lying.

Consider therapy.",How to Confront a Cheater," You do not want to confront your partner without some kind of proof. Even if you are positive your partner is cheating, your partner may be inclined to lie or become defensive if you don't have definitive proof. Going into the situation, present some kind of evidence.See if you can find anything that proves your suspicions. You may, for example, have received confirmation from a friend. You may also have stumbled upon incriminating evidence when cleaning the house.
Evidence can also help you feel more relaxed. Confrontation is inherently uncomfortable. You will feel more at ease confronting your partner if you're sure of yourself.;
, You do not want to run into the room angry and begin yelling at your partner. While imagining a wild confrontation may feel cathartic, it's unlikely to go over well in real life. In order to get what you want out of a confrontation, you need to have a plan.Choose a time and place where you can both talk. You want a time that is not disrupted by outside commitments. For example, agree to talk on a weekend afternoon when you are both free.
Plan on presenting your evidence rather than asking. If someone's been cheating, they're likely to lie rather than own up to the fact. Plan to start off by saying, ""Your sister told me what's going on. I know that you've been having an affair.""

, You should have some goals in mind going into the conversation. You cannot predict how the other person will react, or what he or she will want, but you can have an idea of what you hope to gain from the confrontation.Where do you want to go from here? Do you want to come to a decision about the relationship, or have you already decided you want to end things?
You may also have certain questions. You may, for example, want an explanation for the infidelity. You may want to know why your partner acted the way they did, and whether they want to work things out. You can, for example, ask something like, ""Why did you go to this other person when I was right there?""

, It's very important to go into the conversation having a sense of what you want to say. You should write down your thoughts ahead of time. In difficult conversations, it can be hard to speak on the spot. If you formulate your thoughts ahead of time, this can help.Think about what your feeling. What are the best ways to articulate this? How can you best make your feelings clear? Try to figure this out as you write and rewrite your thoughts on the page.
Also, consider what you want again. Do you have an end goal for the conversation? If so, include that here.

, You want to catch your partner at a good time. A confrontation about cheating is serious. It should not take place at a time when either of you are busy.Ask your partner ahead of time when a good time to talk is. You could even propose a time you think might work. For example, ""If it's okay with you, I would like to talk tomorrow night after dinner.""
From there, work on eliminating distractions. Make sure, before the talk, you power down electronic devices like the TV and your phones. You want to give this kind of conversation your full attention.

, You do not want to go into the conversation expecting it to go one way or another. This may affect your behavior, and make it more difficult to remain calm. Talking about cheating will be an emotionally draining experience. If you indulge fantasies in which your partner gets mad or defensive, you'll go into the conversation on edge.Instead, embrace what you don't know. Think to yourself, as you enter the conversation, ""I don't know."" Remind yourself, as the conversation begins to unfold, ""I don't know what is going to happen. I don't know how my partner will react.""

, It's important to stay calm if you want to address the situation in a productive fashion. You likely have questions you want answered and issues you want addressed. In order for this to happen, you cannot completely lose control.Take a few deep breaths before going into the conversation. You may want to even vent your emotions ahead of time, to someone else or in a journal, to get them out of your system.
It's okay to have emotions. You may cry or become angry. However, strive to keep these emotions from inhibiting your ability to communicate effectively. You can also act on your emotions after dealing with the situation.

, ""I""-statements are statements phrased in a way to lessen personal judgment. Instead of expressing an objective truth about the situation, you're emphasizing your personal feeling. The have three parts. They begin with ""I feel..."" after which you immediately state your feeling. From there, you would explain the behavior that led to that feeling. Lastly, you would say why you feel the way you do.For example, you may be angry and sad. This could provoke you to say something like, ""You completely disrespected me by carrying on this affair instead of admitting you were having feelings for someone else. We could have worked this out if you had talked to me.""
You can rephrase that sentiment using an ""I""-statement. For example, ""I feel disrespected that you had an affair with your co-worker because if you had told me about your feelings for her we could have worked it out as a couple.""

, Infidelity usually has some underlying cause. While no one needs to take all of the blame, there may have been an underlying issue with your relationship. You should discuss this to figure out how to best move forward. This is particularly important if you want to salvage the relationship.Your partner may be hesitant to open up about why they cheated. Factors that lead to an affair are sensitive, and your partner may want to spare your feelings. However, underlying factors need to be addressed in a healthy fashion.
As you address the reasons for the affair, go in with the right mindset. Do not think of it as any one person taking the blame. The two of you are working, collaboratively, on what may have gone wrong and whether it can be fixed.

, Infidelity is not always insurmountable. Many couples find a way to move on from an affair. However, infidelity is also a major breach of trust. After the confrontation, you may find the relationship is not worth salvaging.Remember, you need to know a lot about a situation before you can make an intelligent decision about what to do. During the confrontation, you should have uncovered a lot of facts about your relationship and your partner.
Do not make a decision right away. Spend a few days thinking things over and weighing the pros and cons. Making a decision about whether to stay after infidelity is never easy. Take all the time you need.

, If you decide you want to stay together, both of you need to commit to the healing process. Try to abandon feelings of blame and anger. Move forward together as a couple.Moving on together is reassuring for the partner who was betrayed. It is also encouraging for the partner who was unfaithful. You want to work on creating a new foundation for the relationship.
Accept that it will take time for you to re-build trust and intimacy. Lay down some ground rules in regards to things like communication. For example, maybe it would be best not to address the affair directly right now. You could say something like, ""I think we should work on having as normal a relationship possible. I don't want to mention the affair going forward unless it's absolutely necessary.""

, Regardless of whether you stay or go, you should get an STD test. If you and your partner were sexually intimate, you're at risk for contracting STDs if they were unfaithful. Make a visit to your doctor to run a full panel STD test., It's important to seek emotional support after a partner has cheated. If you need to vent your feelings, reach out to friends and family members.Remember not to be vindictive. You don't want to spread negativity about your ex. Focus on yourself and your feelings rather than complaining about your partner. Talk about our own feelings. Say something like, ""I feel so hurt by what he did"" instead of, ""He really hurt me because he's a jerk.""
Whether you decide to remain in the relationship or not, the support of others here is important. You deserve care, love, and support after having been betrayed.

, If you decide to move forward as a couple, counseling may help. A qualified counselor can help you work through your issues and get back to a healthy place in your relationship. Ask your doctor for a list of couples counselors in your area or get a list of providers from your insurance.Try to find a counselor who has experience helping couples repair a relationship after infidelity.

Find an accessible meeting place.,
Get 2 pre-paid visas.,
Know your job, know your place, know your man.,
Be opposite, be you.,
Be busy, be slightly unavailable.,
Be I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T!,
Be vigilant, prepared.","How to Be a Mistress, the 1/3 Method"," There is honestly no better place to have regular face-time with your man than close to his job. A man who's excuse to the wife will be ""I'm working late"" or the like, will undoubtedly be able to pull off the rouse if he's close by in case she calls or decides to stop by. If you don't already live close, consider finding a clean but inexpensive and discreet hotel room. This will cut down on the commute and mean more time together.;
, The first big mistake married men make is that they use their own accounts to woo, wine, and wife the mistress. WRONG! Getting a refillable visa card will secure your personal information and allow you to purchase anything without detection. According to the law of 1/3's, he's obligated to pay for home, personal needs, like car, momma's bills, etc, then you. Having a man with no money to begin with will prove challenging, but for love, we work with the lower 1/3.

, This is critical. No happy husband NEEDS a mistress. To have a lasting relationship, you have to know your purpose. Realistically speaking, most cheating spouses are seeking sex, good sex, great sex. If you know your job, you can command and demand whatever. Does your man expect home cooked meals? Find out what he likes to eat by paying attention to what he orders when you're out. Ask him what he ate or more importantly what is his favorite dish his momma makes. Be ye warned, knowing your place means respecting #1. Don't mention his wife, don't compare yourself to her, don't press the issue about meeting his family and friends. The reason your relationship works, is because it's NOT his marriage! Needing to intermingle your friends and his friends and your family with his family shows your insecurity...NOT SEXY! Being happy with your 1/3 means knowing that regardless of where he is at any moment of any given day, your 1/3 is superior and you are where he'd rather be, who he'd rather be with, and what or who he'd rather be doing. *insert sinister smirk here...Lastly, know your man. WELL! Does he hate a talkative woman? shut up sometimes. Is he slightly insecure about his manhood, play it up! (LOL) A beer drinker? Have his faves in the fridge. A surprise visit after an argument with the wife or a hard day at work is forgotten when a man can come home to a well oiled back porch, a cold beer, and his favorite song. Your 1/3 will be so memorable, his visits will increase and the perks will be many, if you're truly in this for the man. If he'd rather have back rubs keep warmed oil on hand. If he likes to talk about his day, be a good listener. A mistress must also be a tigress... (ROARR) Research, observe, absorb, remember and regurgitate!

, Generally, no cheating man wants a woman just like his wife. If he sought you out, it's because you're different and that's what he likes. Don't try on another woman's panties. Even if they're your size, they never FIT. If his wife is older, continue being youthful and spirited. Don't starts wearing flowered hats and white usher-gloves. If he wanted Miss Jane Pittman, he'd be at home! If his wife is not the looker you are, then GET PRETTY WITH IT! Bring your A-game sexy, especially when you go out together. A man married to Mrs. Frumpenstein will definitely appreciate having the woman on his arm ogled by other men (Sexy-classy, not sexy-trashy). If you're the business, let him see the work. Embrace your role as the opposite, be confident, be you.

, According to the law of 1/3 a man is never more interested than when he isn't chased. A wife who demands his attention at home, his single mom who needs yard work or car stuff done, these are obligations that supersede your needs or wants, however manipulation is a tool best used in place of the ""gimme"". If every time he calls, you rush to answer, well then why should he rush to call. A little mystery never hurt any relationship. Answering on the 3rd ring, or not answering at all, then calling right back, always tweaks the man's curiosity. Is there someone or something more important than his call, are there friends around? The last thing any cheating man can handle is reciprocation. You will be surprised how many follow-up calls or texts you receive after not answering the phone. You'll also see the 1/3 work it's way out in your favor too.

, What is more sexy to a man that a girl who's got her own? A woman who's got her own. Wait, don't think I mean arrogant and cocky with the i-don't-need-no-man attitude. That will get you cut from the team. Just know that most men want to spoil their women; buy you pretty things, take you on trips, see you excited about what they do for you. Appreciation is your greatest weapon, but throw in a little sass. Every now and then, not often... Pay for dinner before you order. Excuse yourself to the restroom, catch the waiter and give him your card and a $20 tip, then ask him to start the tab. When you're about to leave and your man asks for the check, watch his face when the waiter says, ""it's been taken care of"". Don't gloat or make eye contact, just kiss him once the waiter walks away and say ""thank you for being so good to me"". Don't treat too often, this will impact the EGO we are stroking and cultivating.

, The fact is, most extra-marital relationships end, if the marriage doesn't first. Just be ready for anything. A man who wakes up and is overtaken by guilt may decide you're not worth-it. A man who finally gets out of the marriage he hated may not feel you're wife material when he's ready to jump that broom again. Being the transitional tramp is a difficult tag to wear, but that is why 1/3 is all he gets, too. Giving in to the temptation here, sometimes the relationship is solid and in time this man's goals may have changed. Where you were only a side-dish before, maybe you've moved up to main course and you get to keep the man you worked so hard for. If that is the case, stay the course, maintain your 1/3 for at least a year. Be ready to change your number at the drop of a hat,or purchase a PO Box for your mail. A jealous woman will often try to find you and a weak man will give you up, smooth. So, protect your assets, park your car at a friends house for a while, don't become predictable in your comings and goings, and deny, deny, deny. As much as women hate to admit it. We don't want our mommas' to know their daughters are home wrecking' hoe bags. So your man should never know 1/3 about you, of what you know about him. What he don't know, he can't tell (bad grammar works here).

Take some time to think it over.",How to End an Emotional Affair," An emotional affair does not involve sexual relations. However, there are thoughts, emotions, and often behaviors which are not appropriate to a non-marital relationship. Some argue that without sexual infidelity, such a relationship is not really ""an affair"". But this sort of relationship is often extremely damaging to a marriage, just as much or more so than a physical one. The healthy bond between spouses are threatened because one (or both) spouses are investing time, affection, and attention to a ""friend"" which really should be spent with the spouse.
, The same emotions one may feel in an extra-marital affair is present in an emotional affair. This can be complicated, as an emotional affair means you have formed a strong emotional bond with another person. There may be a lot of affection and even love to the other person. But when such a relationship has crossed healthy boundaries, you may experience the following: Feeling guilty - this could be about the amount of time spent away from your partner/spouse, the time spent with the other person, the intimate details you're sharing, etc.
Vulnerability - you have shared too much, so much so that this other person could drop a lot of very exposing information if your partner happened upon them. Or, you feel vulnerable because you haven't met the expectations you feel honor bound to, such as being a perfect spouse/parent/etc. and the affection and attentions of another person are one way of escaping your worries about not being good enough.
Threatened - you feel threatened or your relationship feels threatened by the direction this emotional affair is taking.
Dishonest - you aren't being honest with your partner about where you're spending your time, or with whom. You may have even changed the gender of the ""friend"" you're suddenly talking to a lot, be it online, at work, or on social occasions, just to throw your partner off the scent. If it's an online emotional affair, perhaps you pretend you're playing app games, sending emails to a trusted friend, doing social media or some other benign act.

, You probably already know deep down that there is an element of dishonesty and cheating involved with the other person. Facing this squarely may be very difficult but some of the things to help you realize you're skating on thin ice include:


You know the level of depth of intimacy and connection with this person has become inappropriate. Your commitment to your partner is threatened or destabilized by someone else being so knowledgeable about the lives and happenings of the two of you.

, Understanding why you are in an emotional affair is important to help you move past it, provided you want to. Emotional affairs are a signal that there is something wrong with your marriage or long-term relationship.When a friendship, acquaintance or work relationship turns into an emotional affair, it is likely that you found an issue with your current relationship or your emotional affair partner may be manipulative and you lack the strength to resist.

, While you may be able to rationalize this current emotional affair as a one-off, if you don't deal with the underlying issues, you may simply fall prey to another such affair later on. Some of the underlying emotional hurt that might cause you to fall into emotional affairs include:


An inability to take criticism. If you're liable to seeing almost everything your partner says as a criticism because you always need positive feedback, this might set you up to wander.Any form of psychological trauma or long-term hurt not dealt with through therapy or other suitable help can sometimes lead to escapism behavior, such as getting involved in emotional affairs, rather than dealing with the deeper underlying issues. Getting help from a professional therapist or counselor may be one way to start breaking the cycle. Not everyone finds therapy useful, but acknowledging and finding some form of facing your emotional demons, is a good start to getting emotionally well again.

, Breaking off an emotional affair is easier when you realize this. Put yourself in the shoes of your partner, or the person you had an emotional affair with. Ask yourself: Would I really be happy if I were put in that position?. The unfairness is pervasive because:


An emotional affair is unfair to the person you are having the emotional affair with. Instead of being truly your cherished friend or lover, this person is simply filling a hole in your existing relationship, without any of the perks of a real relationship.
The affair is unfair to your partner. Your marriage or long-term relationship is a bond that requires faith, trust and long-term attentiveness. If you consider that your spouse or partner is continually unwilling to meet this need, your choice is either acceptance or moving on. If your spouse or partner is simply unable to connect with you emotionally, it's unfair to him or her to stay while you're secretly leaking energy outside of the relationship.
Last but not least, the affair unfair to you because you're splitting your consciousness or self into different sections, alienating these sections from each other. Rather than deal with the pain of being with someone who is not there for you emotionally, you've decided to try to have your cake and eat it too; it's a situation that can end up deeply scarring everyone involved.

, Is it rock solid underneath it all, despite your escapist fantasies? Have you been under a lot of pressure lately and chose to seek a thrill to try to cope, downplaying how much pain this can cause your partner? If you realize that what truly matters is shoring up your actual relationship, your most pressing action needs to be to end the emotional affair immediately.


Accept that relationships don't just happen. They all require work, throughout the life of the relationship. The sooner you accept this, the better for your own emotional strength.

, An emotional affair tends to last longer and stronger than many sexual affairs. Emotional intimacy tends to stoke the fires of desire and keeps the interest peaked rather than any gradual decline in excitement that is often the case with extra-marital sexual liaisons. There is always a ""what if?"" hanging over the relationship and a temptation to imagine that the two of you might suddenly be soulmates spending the rest of your lives together. The deep connection that has evolved can make the breakup harder to initiate. Moreover, if you have ""secret"" ways of keeping in touch, via text, emails, IM, etc., the temptation to stay in touch will be high at first.


Accept that this isn't going to be easy. But if you've made a decision that your spouse or partner is worth stopping this unfaithful dalliance, that's a price you need to be willing to pay.

, If you've decided to break it off with the person you were intimate with emotionally, then a quick break is often better than a drawn-out affair. Perhaps in writing, perhaps over the phone, tell the person why you're ending the affair. Or, be courageous and talk to him or her in person, explaining your well-rehearsed and considered reasons for ending the fling you two have been having:


""I'm writing you this letter/calling because I feel like I've overstepped the boundaries of my relationship with you. I get along with you, and I enjoy being with you, but the relationship we had was not fair — to you, to me, to my . I take full responsibility for what I did, and I understand if this feels strange. I hope we can still remain friends, but I understand if you no longer want to.""
If seeing this person in person, there will probably be a lot more to say and respond to. Be ready for possible tears, indignation or even an insistence that he or she has never thought that there were overstepped boundaries. It pays to be honest and to stick to your own feelings, reiterating that you certainly had feelings for the other person that you're not wishing to act upon any further.

, Your emotional lover may have sustained some lasting damage by being the shoulder to cry on without any of the other elements that come with a healthy relationship. Don't beat yourself up or allow guilt to overcome you, but use this opportunity for self-reflection and growth.


Seek help from a therapist to work on deeper issues that you haven't managed to deal with yet. You deserve to live a happier, more whole life, and this isn't going to happen by allowing yourself to be subsumed by other people.

, If you decided to end the emotional affair and rededicate yourself to the relationship with your partner, it might be healthy to try to address the issues that caused you to seek emotional solace in the first place.


What aspects of the emotional affair did you respond positively to? If a deep sense of communication was missing from your relationship, what steps might it take to get better communication between you and your partner? Think about bringing something like this up with your partner:

""I'd like to talk to you about how we can improve our communication. I really value this relationship, and I love you, but I think we can improve how much we communicate, and the ways in which we communicate. What do you think?""


Ask your partner if there are any issues that she or he is having with the relationship and try to improve those. Often, your partner will withdraw from a relationship when he or she is dissatisfied or confused, causing you to look for emotional satisfaction somewhere else. If you improve some of the issues that may be bothering your spouse or partner, you could find your own needs suddenly met.

, Get a journal and a pen, find a nice quiet spot to work, and free-write. Write down your thoughts. Write down your hopes. Write down what an ideal relationship might look like to you. Strive to turn your current relationship into that vision, recognizing that you must put in at least as much effort as your partner should.


Deal with your own emotional demons rather than using escapist strategies to evade them. Writing them down can help start your understanding of what's wrong, as can talking to people you trust.
Be open and frank with your partner about issues you think you need to tackle to feel like a more whole and healthy person. Your partner may just turn into your best ally over this, especially once he or she realizes the emotional challenges you've been facing and can see how you construed his or her behavior toward you.

, Once you've had a discussion with your partner, it's time to implement some of the changes you think could make your relationship better.


One big thing is distance. Maybe your relationship suffered because you felt smothered all the time. In that case, you'll probably want to take a little time for yourself. Or perhaps your relationship suffered because you didn't see one another enough. That would be an opportunity to carve more time out of your busy schedule to see one another, go on dates, and just be together.
Ask yourselves if you're only in it for the physical relationship. Lots of people who engage in emotional affairs are satisfied sexually but dissatisfied emotionally. Having a healthy sexual relationship is great, but not if it's at the expense of a nurturing psychological and emotional relationship.

, If you're feeling unsure, hesitant, or just like you need a break, put some thought into taking a temporary hiatus. (Alternately, instead of putting the relationship on hiatus, just take a trip somewhere away from your partner to freshen up your perspective.) Taking a break is all about giving yourself a brand new set of eyes to look at the world. We only get one life, so we better make it worthwhile.


If you decide that, despite everything, the current relationship is also not working, you may have to reach a decision to break up with the person, citing the unmet needs. It's always better to admit what isn't working despite trying than to condemn the two of you to a loveless, uncaring future.

Let your fingers do the walking.,
If you have a good old-fashioned land line, phone sleuthing is easy.,
Press Record Now.,
Use a baby monitor.,
Record digitally with a digital recorder.,
Break all trust and spy on your honey's personal communications.",How to Catch Your Cheating Spouse1," The phone is a common thread in all our lives, and it's only becoming more so as time goes on. So it is a pretty sure bet that their Affair d'amour is happening over the wires as well as—well, you can imagine.;
,


Take a spare to somewhere in the house where he/she rarely goes, and plug it into the phone jack. Unscrew and remove the mouthpiece (ahead of time) so that your sotto voce epithets will not give your sleuthing away.
When you hear him/her shout ""I've got it, honey"" (cause you just know it's him/her), go to your ""war room,"" and very carefully lift the receiver off the hook. Don't be too gentle: wiggling the buttons will make a clickety sound on the line that will get you busted.

, If you're pretty sure your soon-to-be-ex-honey is not going to call up his/her burning biscuit of bliss while you're around, but that he/she may not be able to resist a little sneaky call when he/she thinks you're not looking—or his/her cohort in canoodling may just have to hear his/her lover's voice before he/she goes to bed with ""him/her"", recording the conversation might work. If you plan ahead, you can tap the airwaves as he/she taps his/her inner Don Juan.


If you have a smart phone or a feature phone with a recorder, set the earpiece of the headset next to the microphone, and record the lovey-dovey ramblings for posterity. If the jig is up, and you have what you need, then no need to wait. Confront the louse with his/her toothbrush and an overnight bag, and send him/her out without his/her dessert. If it turns out, however, that the phone was his/her bowling buddy confirming Lane 6 this Thursday, whip up his/her favorite dessert, and serve it up with a smile.

, This is the cheap, low-tech way of listening in. Of course, if there are no babies in your life at the moment, this can be a bit tricky, but you can get around that. Wait till he/she goes out ""shopping"" one day, and hit the local gizmo shop. Get a basic baby monitor, a can of spray paint that will blend with where you will put the transmitter, and a roll of matching masking tape (in case the transmitter has blinking LEDs on it).


Paint the transmitter (the baby/secret side) with the spray paint. Cover up the microphone hole before you paint so you don't gum up the works, and don't over-paint. You don't want that thing to be stinking up the house.
Go to the room where you think she'll be making throaty sounds with her licentious Lothario, and cache the transmitter in a discrete location where she's unlikely to look. Behind some books, or the couch, or if you're really hapless, somewhere in the bedroom or bath.
Power it up, and put a portable radio in the room turned down to about human-whisper-and-giggle level. Go into your man cave, and turn on the receiver. Can you hear the radio? If so, you're ready to go. If not, make adjustments until you can hear the transmitter signal clearly.
When that phone call comes, and she says ""I have to get this... it's work,"" say, ""Okay, honey, I'll be in the man cave surfing the 'Net for..."" (You can say almost anything there: after she hears Okay, honey, I'll be..., she'll already have too much adrenaline pumping through her to hear you, anyway.) Go to your room, turn on the monitor, power up your recorder (phone, tape, whatever you've got), and listen to what happens next. Should you hear what you fear, call her a taxi, and send Ruby Roundheels on a one-way ticket to town. Of course, if you hear ""Okay, I'll have that report by tomorrow, boss, and I.... wait, what's this... a transmitter?,"" you might want to take that taxi yourself. You're going to be in hot water.

, There is a range of digital records, from pens, or thumb drives, or even phone look-alikes that are voice activated. That means you can just set one wherever you think your spouse may go for his or her phone fun, and when it happens, the electrical spy will spring into action, like a steel trap. Check that trap at your convenience, and good luck!

, Direct access of your cheating cherie's phone can reveal a lot—especially texts and tweets. Her close friends will be quite frank with advice and what they think. You may find the texts that are sent give you more insight than the ones received. A regular check will give you an idea of how things are progressing. Watch out for the use of false names so that if an incoming message arrives at an awkward moment, the false name gives nothing away.


Check email. Another way he'll schedule snogging sessions with that woman is to send send her emails or chat online. What if every email or conversation that your spouse sends online got mailed to you to read? Software called remote spy software records all of his or her emails, chats, instant messages, web sites visited and keystrokes and then automatically copies this recorded information to your email address.
Unless your spouse is very careful, you can also pop onto his or her computer (or phone) when he or she is not around, and look at history, recent applications, and other breadcrumbs to follow the trail of the philandering fink. Maybe a little email planning for the next rendezvous with romance, or some online hot chat logs.
The lout who is having the affair will quickly try to prevent you seeing emails through the use of passwords and saving the emails under different file names. To gain access initially, you may try using his typical passwords as a starting point. If that doesn't work, a Google search will easily find specialized software that can hack passwords.

, It'll probably be a quieter, slower day than you're used to, and that's okay. There was a time when silence didn't make people so uncomfortable, and your grandparents will enjoy the company. Do whatever they do; don't try to do what you want to do. Get a peek into what their daily lives are like. And don't judge or complain or criticize. Just try to appreciate the time you're spending with them.

, Let them tell you about what it was like when they were kids, even if you have heard the story a million times. Ask them about the most adventurous thing they ever did. Ask them who their first love was, their first kiss. Ask them when in their lives they felt the most happy, the most scared, the most excited. You might discover amazing things about them!


It might also get awkward if you find your grandparents pining for times gone past. You'll probably feel bad for bringing up memories that made them feel wistful. But by not asking about their lives, it'll show that you don't really care. And if you don't ask, who will? One day those memories will be lost if they don't share them with you.

Use any tools at your disposal.,
Install a GPS device.,
Count the miles.,
Pay particular attention to your spouse's friends.,
Study history.,
Watch for changes in behavior.,
Look for secrets.",How to Catch Your Cheating Spouse2," You can get help from inanimate objects—–they never speak! For instance, there are hidden cameras available in shapes unimaginable! They are so discreet that even you will not be able to make out that a state-of-the-art camera lies within. Hidden spy cameras range from wall clocks to houseplants to table lamps.

, Track where your wayward wife has been lately by using a GPS device. It will show you where she's taken the car, and for how long she stays. Next time she says ""I'm working late, honey,"" you can say ""Wow, Motel 9 must love you!""

, A cheap (free) alternative to GPS tracking is to simply record mileage before and after work. Does this square with the distance your spouse is traveling between work and home? Differences on the odometer can lead to targeted questions which can help you find out what is or is not happening.

, Who is being seen the most? Who is contacted the most? Are they your friends as well? When you meet them, keep a real alert on for bad feelings when talking to them. Don't ask direct questions of them. You don't want to ask them to choose who to support. What people don't say is at least as useful as what people do say.

, If the call history is blocked, then access the details online via telephone accounts. You will need to use a password to access this. However the chances are the password being used was set up long before the affair started so you probably know it or can second guess it. Look for frequency of use and call time. Are both of these factors increasing, steady or increasing? Knowing this will give you insight on how things are progressing.

, Changes in interests in clothes, appearance, weight loss or gain, coldness, distancing, hostility; refusal to talk about future projects, disengagement from you, disinterest in sex and more noticeably simply everyday affections. Monitor those changes are they increasing or decreasing? It's the changes that give away clues.

, Keep an eye out for a hidden phone your spouse may use to avoid detection. Also, check the trash on his or her computer—–often people throw things in the trash, and then don't empty it.

Deal with the aftermath of finding out either way.,
If you do get positive, concrete proof that your spouse is cheating, you now have cause to be miserable and unhappy.,
If you don't find proof of your spouse's infidelity, you now have little reason to believe your spouse is cheating.",How to Catch Your Cheating Spouse3," If you really believe your spouse is cheating on you, yet after monitoring phone calls, emails, and travel details, all you have is a gut feeling, than you need to make an essential decision about how far you are willing to go in pursuit of knowing if your spouse is faithful.


Honestly ask yourself why you don't trust your spouse. Do you have any reason, real or imagined, to believe your spouse is, or has been, unfaithful? It doesn't have to stand up to legal standards of proof, but do you have anything to go on beyond your feeling or hunch? It is not uncommon for a partner to self-convince that there is a case of spousal infidelity based merely on circumstances that have been molded into the evidence needed to justify one's own feelings, beliefs, and insecurities.
Just because he seems less interested in you doesn't mean he's cheating. Working late or going out with friends might mean only that. It's also not uncommon for couples who have been together for a while to forget why they fell in love because everyday life is a grind and people get comfortable with time, taking one another for granted. Moreover, sometimes work addiction takes over, and your spouse really has become ""wed to the job or start-up"" and rarely thinks of spending time with you.

, If you think you have real cause to suspect your spouse, then start with the assumption that she is going to take some kind of precautions to remain undiscovered when cheating.


She's not going to send emails from the home computer, or call from the home phone.
She's not going to claim to be working late and leave for a hotel rendezvous risking your calls going unanswered or being seen leaving work too early
She will use normal routines and patterns that you are well used to and simply use that time to have the affair. A sexual affair doesn't require much time or commitment. The two of them meet in the parking lot, hop into one car, head for ""their room"" at the Motel 9 for a half hour, and are back in time for shopping. She even comes home with purchases consistent with where they were supposed to be. So if you're truly committed to finding the truth, do this:

, Get a good camera with a zoom lens and put a GPS tracker on your spouse (clothing/bag, etc.) or vehicle. Hide a voice activated recorder behind your bed. Then, plan a trip out of town for two to four days, and share that information with your spouse.


Do your homework and make it look like you're leaving town by sharing details of your trip, while you secretly plan a stay at a hotel just out of town. (If your spouse expects details of your trip, book them, get confirmations to share with your spouse, but cancel at the last hour and stay close to home.)

, Make an effort to call your spouse from the airport and when you arrive at your destination. Do this from your cell phone and you can claim to be anywhere. Apologize that you will be working late and might not be able to call that night.

,


Follow your spouse (a rental is a good idea), but if you are prone to road rage or other rash acts, think twice about this one.
If your spouse simply goes home, park down the street and watch.

, Use the camera if appropriate. Check the recorders just in case you missed something.


If you need more time, call the morning you were scheduled to be home and apologize that you have to stay one more night.

, If not, don't overdo the stay away. Either way, don't let this charade drag on––you'll need to confront your spouse with your evidence or own up to your suspicions in order for the relationship to change, mend or dissolve as needs be.

, It isn't pleasant to discover that a spouse has been cheating on you. In fact, it's likely to be devastating as the foundation on which you've based your personal life is totally rocked. Moreover, you may carry feelings of self-loathing for the manner in which you had to sneak about to find out the truth. All in all, the discovery process is harrowing and can leave you feeling raw.

, The fact is that it is better known than not. In time, you'll learn that while this is a traumatic experience, there is a person who deserves you and that it's most definitely not this person. Seek the support of friends, family and perhaps your doctor or a counselor to help you work through what is now a difficult period. Deciding whether or not to leave your spouse is a minefield that only you can decide to navigate, with good support networks to keep you strong. You might find it helpful to start by reading How to mend a marriage after an affair.

, Or, if you still think your spouse is super careful and sneaky, you have at least discovered how easy it is to set up the conditions to catch your cheating spouse in the not too distant future. However, be absolutely sure that your continuing suspicions are valid; by this stage, you're likely to be ripping apart any trust that once existed in the relationship.

Wait for the ruling.",How to Avoid Paying Alimony to a Cheating Spouse," In many states, alimony is discretionary. This means the judge can decide whether to award alimony or not, depending on a variety of circumstances. In about half of the states, the judge will consider “marital fault,” including adultery.You need to find out if your state considers adultery. You should research your state law. Search online for “your state,” “alimony,” and “adultery.”;
, If you can’t find out whether your state considers adultery when deciding alimony, you should consult with an attorney. Only a qualified attorney can give you accurate legal advice about your state law.


You can get a referral to a divorce attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Call up the attorney and schedule a consultation. Ask how much they charge for a half-hour meeting.
You should also consider hiring the lawyer to represent you. Although you can meet for just a half-hour meeting, you might be better off hiring him or her to handle the divorce for you. Ask how much it would cost.

, Although some states consider adultery when determining alimony, it depends on the circumstances. You should discuss your situation with your lawyer.


For example, in Georgia, the adultery must have been the cause of the divorce. It isn’t enough that your spouse cheated five years ago but you reconciled. Instead, the infidelity must have ended the marriage., Your state might not allow a judge to consider adultery. However, you can still try to deny your cheating spouse alimony. Generally, judges consider the following financial factors:Income disparity. If your income is much higher than your spouse’s, then a judge is more likely to award alimony. However, if your incomes are similar, you have a strong argument against alimony.
Each spouse’s future earning potential. Your spouse may not be working now. However, he or she could have a college degree and higher earning power if they got a job. A judge will consider how much your ex “could” make, not how much they do make.
Your standard of living during the marriage. If your spouse became accustomed to a high standard of living, then the judge might award alimony. However, if you had a normal middle-class life, then you could argue that alimony isn’t appropriate, especially when your spouse can maintain that lifestyle on their own.
Whether your spouse stayed home to raise the children. If your spouse didn’t forfeit their career for your family, then you can argue alimony isn’t necessary.
The contribution your spouse made to your career. A spouse who works to put another through school or helps start a business has a stronger claim to alimony. You should point out if your spouse didn’t make any kind of contribution to your career.

, In addition to finances, a judge will consider other factors when deciding whether to award alimony. You should try to cite as many as possible to argue against your spouse getting alimony:The length of the marriage. If your marriage was short, then you can argue that alimony isn’t appropriate.
Your spouse’s age. Your spouse is more likely to get alimony the older they are. If your spouse is relatively young, you can argue alimony isn’t necessary.
Your spouse’s emotional or physical condition. If your spouse is disabled, then he or she will have a strong argument for alimony. However, if your spouse is healthy, then you can argue alimony isn’t necessary.
Domestic violence. In California, for example, the judge can lower or eliminate alimony if one spouse has been convicted of domestic violence., You might not be able to prevent alimony, even if your spouse cheated. Nevertheless, you should discuss other potential strategies with your attorney for making sure your spouse gets as few assets as possible.


For example, your spouse might have used marital property to support a lover. In this situation, the judge can deduct the money spent on the lover from the amount of marital property your spouse will get in the divorce., If your spouse pick up an STD during an affair, then you might be able to sue him or her for personal injury if the STD was transmitted to you.You should talk about this option with your lawyer.

, You need proof that your spouse has been unfaithful.Although you can tell the judge your suspicions, nothing is more powerful than evidence. In particular, you should try to get your spouse to admit to being unfaithful.


If your spouse admits to cheating, you should write down the day and time of the admission. Because your spouse might try to walk back the admission, you should look for other evidence.
Keep communications. Your ex might slip up and admit to adultery in an email or letter. You should hold onto these communications. You can introduce them into court as evidence.

, You can also get evidence of adultery by talking to the person your spouse slept with. He or she might confirm that they slept with your spouse during your marriage. A partner is probably more likely to admit this if their relationship with your spouse has ended.

, You don’t have to videotape your spouse “in the act” with someone else. However, you need to prove that he or she had the motive and the opportunity to cheat on you. You can prove motive and opportunity by gathering the following:Photos of your spouse and their lover together. It would be ideal if they were acting in an intimate manner in the photographs.
Phone records that show constant communication between them. Look for late-night calls or calls on the weekend.
Witnesses who saw your spouse and their lover together.
Credit card or bank records that show large purchases, hotel visits, etc.

, If your spouse has moved in with his or her lover, then you might be able to eliminate alimony altogether.Some states will prevent a person from getting alimony when they move in with a romantic partner.


You can ask family or friends where your spouse is staying. You may need these people to testify on your behalf.

, You might need to hire someone to spy on your spouse. You should think about hiring a private investigator.This person can follow your spouse around and find out who they are spending their time with.


Private detectives generally charge $40-100 per hour. They also charge for additional costs, such as mileage.You can find detectives in the phone book. Call one up and discuss the reasons for hiring them. Discuss the scope of the investigation and what kinds of evidence you want them to gather.

, You should probably be the person to file for divorce. You should pick up the forms required to file for divorce from the court clerk at the family law court in the county where you live. Often, these forms are posted online.


Divorce can be “fault” or “no fault.” Almost all states have “no fault” divorce, which means neither party is to blame. However, about two-thirds still allow you to allege “fault,” such as adultery.If you have the option of alleging fault when you file for divorce, then make sure to select adultery.
Some “no fault” states, such as Florida, still consider adultery when determining alimony.For this reason, even in a “no fault” state you should try to mention adultery in the divorce petition.
Your spouse might have beat you to the courthouse and have filed for divorce first. He or she should ask for alimony in the petition. In this situation, you will be able to “answer” the divorce petition and explain why your spouse isn’t entitled to alimony.Mention the infidelity and all other reasons.

, You have to file your papers with the court clerk. Make several copies. You also have to give your spouse a copy of everything you file in your case.This is called “making service.”


You can generally make service of divorce papers by paying the sheriff or constable to serve them. You cannot serve them yourself.Depending on your court, you can also hire a private process server, which you can find in the phone book. They make service for a small fee.
You might also ask someone 18 or older who isn’t a party to the case to serve the papers for you.

, In a contested divorce, you will need to have a trial or hearing. You will probably have many preliminary “status hearings” and conferences as you prepare for your hearing/trial. At these, you will appear before the judge and hammer out issues that will allow you to prepare for trial.


You may also have a chance for “discovery.” Discovery is the fact-finding portion of a divorce.In discovery, you can send subpoenas to people requesting documents, such as financial records. You can also have your spouse answer questions under oath. If you weren’t able to get solid proof of adultery before filing for divorce, then you can use discovery to gather additional, helpful information.

, You should identify your witnesses and ask them to attend the hearing. Tell them the date, time, and location. You may also send them a subpoena, which is a legal request to show up.


You can generally get a blank subpoena form from the court clerk., You can have witnesses testify and introduce documents to convince the judge that your spouse committed adultery. In many states, you don’t actually have to prove that adultery happened. Instead, you need to prove that your spouse had the “disposition” and “opportunity” to cheat.To prove disposition, you can introduce evidence that your spouse showed affection publicly with their alleged lover. You can introduce photographs of them kissing, hugging, holding hands, etc. Or you can have witnesses testify that they observed this conduct.
To prove “opportunity,” you should introduce evidence that your spouse was seen entering their lover’s apartment late at night and not leaving until the morning. Alternately, you could show that they went away together and stayed in the same hotel.

, Your spouse gets to try to prove that any conduct was innocent and not actually adultery. Depending on your state, your spouse may also argue that they are entitled to alimony even if adultery occurred.


You should be able to cross-examine any witnesses your spouse has testify. See Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself for more information.

, Currently, only two states allow jury trials in divorce proceedings, so your case will likely be decided by a judge.The judge should make a decision after hearing all of the evidence. If your case is complicated, then the judge may take the case under advisement and issue a ruling at a later time.

Find common ground with your grandparents.,
Assess your own role in the conflict.,
Decide what you can put up with and what you can't.,
Talk things over your grandparents.,
Consult your parents.",How to Cope With Annoying Grandparents1," Before tackling any problem, we need to be able to identify the real source of our frustration. It's easy enough to huff that our grandparents are so annoying, but what is it really about their behavior that bothers us so much?


Complaining to your grandparents (or to anyone who will listen) that they are annoying won't fix anything. Try to be specific as you identify the problem to yourself: “It bothers me when Grandma treats me like I'm five when I visit and won't let me watch “The Walking Dead,” even though I'm twenty-five”.
Before deciding how you'll deal with the situation and potentially confront your grandparents, spend some time reflecting and writing down your issues for yourself.;
, When dealing with any sort of interpersonal conflict, it's important to try to sympathetically identify with the other person. This means that you need to try to put yourself in their shoes and attempt to understand their perspective.


Try to figure out why your grandparents are acting as they do. You may eventually need to have a direct conversation with your grandparents in which you air your grievances, but you'll be better prepared for this if you first make some educated guesses on your own.
Grandma may not let you watch your favorite program when you're staying with her over winter break, but do you think that may be because she herself finds the program too gruesome?
Is it possible that your grandparents are trying to monitor what you watch because they still think of you as their innocent five-year-old and are merely nostalgic?
You may be annoyed that Grandma and Grandpa call you every other day, but is it possible that they just miss being able to see and talk to you more regularly?

, You have your own unique relationship with your grandparents, but you may not know much about them outside of this context. Assuming that your grandparents are willing to share, learning as much about them as possible will help you begin to understand them as individuals and may help you identify ways to begin to improve your relationship.


Before you begin to deal with your specific problem (your frustration with your grandparents' over-involvement or absence in your life, for example), talk to your grandparents about their own lives and relationships with their grandparents.
Ask your grandparents very specific questions: “How often did you see your grandparents?” “Were your grandparents strict with you or indulgent?” “What do you wish you had been able to do with them while you had time together?”
It may also help to learn more about the differences between generations. If your grandparents grew up during the Great Depression or the Civil Rights Movement, for example, learning this will give you important insight into their outlook on life.

, As you move forward with improving your relationship, it will help to be able to keep in mind your shared traits and values.


Do you share your grandfather's wacky sense of humor? Keeping this in mind will help you as you decide when and how to confront your grandfather about the particular thing that is bothering you. If grandpa responds well to humor, then approaching the topic with a joke could work well.
Think as well about what you are thankful for in your relationship with your grandparents: have they always been there for you? Are you able to call them at midnight when you have a flat tire? If loyalty is deeply important to them (and you), recognizing this may help you understand the source of some of their more annoying habits or may help you look past them.

, It's pretty rare for a problem to be only one-sided, so it's important for you to honestly reflect upon yourself to identify any ways in which you may have been contributing to the situation.


For example, is it possible that while you are currently annoyed with your grandparents for not treating you like an adult and allowing you to come in late at night, you are at other times letting them wait on you hand-and-foot as they did when you were younger? If so, be aware of the mixed message you are sending them.
Is it possible that you are transferring—responding negatively to your own traits that you don't like as you see them exhibited in your grandparents? If so, it's hardly fair to criticize them for never returning phone calls, for example, when you yourself have a spotty track record at this.
Are you impatient or hostile when dealing with your grandparents? You may think that you are successfully hiding your annoyance, but keep in mind that our body language, facial expressions, and tone can speak volumes.
Your grandparents also quite likely know you very well and are thus probably already aware of your frustration. This could very well be contributing to the tension.

, Remember that not every battle needs to be fought, and indeed, picking every battle will only increase overall tension and frustration.


Especially if you don't see your grandparents all that regularly, adapting your schedule and habits to keep the peace most likely shouldn't require too much effort.
You may have been waiting all week to get caught up on your favorite program, but is it really worth fighting over if you can DVR it or watch it later on your phone or laptop?
On the other hand, while you may decide that you can live with your grandparents' obvious distaste for your fashion style, you may not be able to (or want to) put up with their insults or hostility to your romantic partner.
The main point here is to decide what's important to you, both in terms of your own life and in terms of preserving your relationship with your grandparents.

, Once you've done your best to try to understand where your grandparents are coming from, find common ground, and figure out your own role in the situation, it's time for you to talk to them. Make sure that you choose an appropriate time and place to talk to your grandparents. If they turn in early, then deciding to talk to them about what you take to be their condescending attitude towards your career choice right before their bedtime will most likely not go well.
Try not to be accusatory in your language. Even though you find them annoying, don't start off by saying, “Grandma, you are so annoying when you constantly push more food at me.”
Instead, try framing your grievance with “I” language: “Grandma, I love that you cook me such tasty meals when I visit, but I sometimes feel pressured to overeat, which I find frustrating”.
Notice as well that when you talk with your grandparents it will help to frame the discussion in terms of what you appreciate about them, in spite of your need to address a problem.
You may also want to try reflecting your grandparents' questions or comments back to them. If you are bothered by their constant queries about your dating life, the next time they ask, try responding, “Why do you ask?”. Their answer may surprise you, or they may realize that that they've been over-asking.

, While it's probably best that you try to handle your problems yourself, depending upon the severity of the problem or your comfort level with your grandparents, you may decide to enlist the help of your parents.


Whether your parents have a close or strained relationship with their parents, they should be in a position to give you good insight. They can either provide you with advice about how to approach your grandparents or if necessary, discuss things over with them on your behalf.
If you do decide to vent to your parents or have them talk things over with your grandparents, be careful not to place them in too awkward of a position.
If your only issue is that your grandparents are annoying (and not malicious or abusive), then this is something that a mature individual should be able to handle independently. One of your parents' most important roles is to protect you, but not necessarily from life's everyday annoyances.
Of course, if your grandparents are abusive, things change entirely. There is no rule that we must retain contact with people who are toxic or harmful, even if they are family.

Be fully aware that your role as a grandparent matters.,
Try to deal with the transition to being a grandparent gracefully.,
Realize what you'll get out of the grandparenting experience.",How to Be Good Grandparents1," You are a source of wisdom, experience and patience. You may also be a source of childcare, either regularly or occasionally. You can help relieve ever-busy parents of the childcare when they need respite. But most of all, you get to have fun and enjoy the next generation, to watch them grow and know that you play a key part in their development.;
, Admittedly, some people aren't as fond of being a grandparent as others, as they're concerned that they are viewed as ""old"" when they have grandchildren or that they're just assumed to be caretakers when they'd rather be free of any responsibilities. In the first case, age is a matter of how you feel––you're only old when you let yourself feel that way. Indeed, grandchildren can help you to stay fit and quick witted, just because you need to keep up with them. As for freedom, that's something you need to work out for yourself and talk openly with your children about. If you really dislike having the grandchildren come to stay or you find they're spending too much time with you, talk to your children and explain what your boundaries are. It's your choice and they have to respect your decision.

, Grandchildren are a joy because you get all the fun but very little of the longer-term responsibility. Sure, you're responsible for them when you're babysitting them but if they get too much, you are able to hand them back. Moreover, unless you're standing in for the parents, you don't need to make the challenging decisions about schooling, after-school activities, health care, and such. You can advise and support but ultimately, you are much less responsible so it can free you up to enjoy watching your grandchildren grow up, and witness all the good things.

, If you want to keep your gift a surprise, ask your parents or another close relative what they think your grandparent would like for their birthday.

, If you don’t know what they would like, think about what they like to do and pick a gift that’s related to it. For example, if your grandfather likes to golf, a golf shirt would make an excellent gift., If your budget is tight, make a gift for your grandparents. A homemade photo album, card, or trinket will make their day!, If you aren’t sure what your grandparent would like, a gift card can be a good option! Make sure that they know how to use it and that it is for a store in their area--many older people are uncomfortable shopping online., This is especially important if you live far away from your grandparent! You should mail out packages about a week in advance, but if they live in a different country you may need to mail your gift several weeks before their birthday."

Learn about any generational differences in raising children.,
Enlist the help of your children's grandparents.,

Remember your first role to your children.",How to Cope With Annoying Grandparents2," If you are a new parent, your life has suddenly changed drastically, and you're still learning to juggle all the different aspects and demands of your life. Keep in mind that your children's grandparents are also adjusting to the new addition(s) to the family.


Before you angrily confront your children's grandparents about their behavior, try to determine whether or not you are still all in the midst of an adjustment period. Do you think that with time and patience the current discord will resolve itself?
If you'd rather nip things in the bud—you just can't handle the frequent, unannounced drop-ins, for example—make a list to yourself of the specific behaviors that troubling you.

, If you happened to have read the first method on coping with your own annoying grandparents, you'll notice that many of the steps here parallel those above. Even though your relationship with your children's grandparents is of course different in many ways from that of a grandchild-grandparent relationship, there are still commonalities. We're dealing with interpersonal familial relationships, and any time we face conflict, it helps if we first attempt to consider the other person's perspective.


It's quite likely that you or your partner will need to have a direct conversation with your children's grandparents, but thinking about why they are acting as they are will help better prepare you for that talk.
For example, you may be annoyed with your mother's constant inquiries into your newborn's feeding schedule (which you may take as thinly disguised criticism), but is it possible that she may be anxious on your behalf because of the difficulties she had when you were a baby?
Similarly, you may be entirely frustrated at the unannounced pop-ins, but your perspective on the situation may change once you realize that you haven't been so great at extending invitations to your children's grandparents to visit. Most likely, the grandparents are simply overly eager to spend time with their beloved grandchildren.

, This step naturally follows from the previous: you are doing your best to consider the grandparent's perspective; very little good will come from automatically assuming the worst about their motivations. You may think that your mother-in-law has been waiting for a chance to paint you as a failure, which explains in your eyes why she is forever bringing over food (does she think you are incapable of feeding your own family?), but don't dismiss the possibility that she is merely trying to ease your burden.
Perhaps your parents have barely called or visited since you've brought your newborn home, which leads you to believe that they aren't interested in their new grandchild. While this is a possibility, start from a charitable position and consider the possibility that they are trying to give you your space. It's quite possible that they are anxiously awaiting your first move.

, You have your own unique relationship with your children's grandparents, but you may not know know as much about their experiences with their parents or in-laws. Their behavior now is surely informed by their own experiences as parents, and they thus may have different expectations about how much or little to be involved with your children.


Ask your children's grandparents specific questions about their early relationships with their parents or in-laws: “Mom, how often did Grandma visit when I was a baby? Did you ask her for lots of advice?”
Similarly, ask your children's grandparents specific questions about their experiences raising children: “Mary, was John fussy as a baby? How did you deal with that?”
Learning as much as possible about your children's grandparents will help you begin to understand them as individuals and may help you identify ways to begin to improve your relationship.

, It's hard enough for you to sort through the conflicting and ever-changing advice on how to best care for and raise your children. Learning about how standards have changed (sometimes drastically) over the years will help you understand where your children's grandparents are coming from.


You may be thoroughly frustrated at your mother-in-law's constant nagging about introducing rice cereal into your weeks-old-newborn's diet, but once you learn that her pediatrician recommended this, it will make her current behavior more understandable.
Similarly, much less was known about SIDS, for example, even a generation ago, and it wasn't so long ago that parents were warned against placing babies on their backs to sleep. While this is certainly not a point you want to give in on, understanding that your children's grandparents were given different instructions will help you as you decide how to talk with them and make clear your expectations. , Rather than pushing the grandparents out completely or setting down an absolute, inflexible set of rules, find areas in which you can seek their advice and make them feel involved. You may have good reason to want to keep your young children on a set sleep schedule, but take note of Grandma Kayoko's baby-whispering skills: If she's able to lull any baby to sleep in minutes, ask her for a tutorial. When the baby sleeps over at her house, you can then ask Grandma to be prepared to rock baby to sleep at precisely 7pm.

, It's important that you remain as flexible as possible as you deal with your children's grandparents. There are of course going to be some issues, particularly those concerning safety, which you want to be firm on, but try to determine which behaviors on the grandparent's part are mere annoyances. For example, while it's important that your child have a nutritious and balanced diet, a couple of extra treats when Grandpa visits will not undo all of your hard work.
On the other hand, if you can't trust that Grandpa will put the baby down on her back without pillows and stuffed animals in the crib, you aren't going to be able to let him babysit at nap or bedtime. , It's important that you not expect your children's grandparents to be able to read your mind and automatically know what you want from them.


You've worked carefully to create a routine and set of rules that work best for your children after doing tons of research and consulting with their pediatrician. When your children are going to be under their watch, make sure that you are clear and specific in your expectations.
Similarly, while you may want your children's grandparents to be a regular part of their life, you may not have anticipated that they'd be visiting every other day. If you want them to scale back their visits, be clear: “Mom and Dad, we love having you over, but weekdays are a bit crazy. Could we all get together on Saturday or Sunday this week?” , First and foremost, you are your children's protector. If at any time you feel that your children are harmed as a result of their interactions with anyone, to include their grandparents, you must take steps to protect your children.


There is no rule that we must retain ties with abusive people just because they are blood.
Nonetheless, the relationship between grandparent and grandchild is potentially one of truly great reward and love.
It is also your job to try to surround your children with people who will love and protect them; improving your own relationship with their grandparents will only help to foster the bonds between grandparents and grandchildren.

"
"
Connect with grandchildren based on their interests.,
Set aside special time for each child during visits.,
Try not to play favorites.",How to Bond with Long Distance Grandkids1," Rather than trying to force conversation with a shy grandchild or playing sports with one who’s uncoordinated, maximize success by playing to their interests. Figure out what each grandchild enjoys and use that to strengthen your bond with them.


Use both face-to-face and long-distance check-ins to focus on their individual hobbies, passions, and talents. This allows you to recognize and appreciate the differences between each grandchild.
Ensure regular face-to-face time, even if it’s through the use of technology. This is especially important in their early years. The more bonding you have in their formative years, the easier it will be for them to willingly look for those special moments when you can connect with them and give them loving attention later on.
Just like parenting, being a grandparent is not one-size-fits-all. Trying to do the same thing with each kid won’t make them feel connected to you. Instead, show them that you are aware of what makes them unique. If you have a granddaughter who does ballet, take her to a show when you’re in town and send her videos of professional dancers.;
, Spending time with everyone at once is not only overwhelming but it doesn’t do justice for each child. Of course, some events like seeing a film or going on a vacation may require that everyone is in attendance. Otherwise, schedule an hour or two with each grandchild each time they visit you or vice versa.


One-on-one time offers you the best opportunity to develop and strengthen the bond you have with your grandchildren. Again, use the time to focus on each child’s passions. See a basketball game with a sports fan, or go to the botanical garden with the nature lover., There’s nothing that disconnects you from your grandchildren like favoring one over the others. While it may feel difficult not to spoil Little Henry who looks just like you, avoid it at all costs. Showing favoritism not only makes the other children dislike the favorite, but they also may develop negative feelings towards you in the process.


Treat all your grandchildren fairly. This problem is eliminated when you dedicate special time to focus on each child individually and are sure to focus on their interests. When they feel like Grandma or Grandpa provided them with quality time, they are less likely to care what you did with or for the others."
"
Decide what you wish to be called.,
Decide the ways in which you want to be of help as a grandparent.,
Let go of any need to parent your grandchildren.",How to Be Good Grandparents2," For some people, it is the grandchildren who come up with a name, while for others, they have a name already clearly determined that they wish to be known by. There are common names such as Gran, Granny, Grandad, Grandpa`, Grandma/Grandma, Nanny, Nan, Gammy, and so forth but you may also prefer your own real name or some other name you've made up. Decide in advance and make your preferences known.


Family tradition may dictate how you are referred to. If you're okay with this, that's great. If not, you may need to have a family discussion over what you'd rather be called.

, As already discussed above, this is something that you must determine. If you don't want to be the 5-day a week childcare stopgap, make this absolutely clear from the outset. On the other hand, if that's something you really want, say so. Consider the following when deciding how you'll help out with raising your grandchildren:


How active a carer do you wish to be? Do you want to take on full-time or part-time regular care to allow your children to keep working?
Are you close enough geographically to be of actual help? If not, how do you plan to connect with the grandchildren regularly?
Can you be of help with the more challenging tasks, such as helping with mealtimes, bedtimes, etc. when the grandchildren are newborn and very young? By assisting with the more challenging parts, you can give your children a much-needed break.
Consider vacation times. Are you willing to have the grandchildren stay with you? Do you wish to travel with them?
How is your health and how easily do you fatigue? These are really important considerations when determining how much help you'll give toward raising your grandchildren.
Consider your finances. Are you willing to help finance aspects of your grandchildren's upbringing (such as school fees, after-school activities, etc.) or is this absolutely against your wishes or abilities? If you do decide to help out financially, how will you draw the boundaries on this help with your children?

, Not only do they have parents to do this for them, but this is where your freedom comes in. You can advise your children as to things you think need attending to but you don't need to parent the grandchildren directly. Moreover, always see yourself as a helping hand, not as someone taking over. New parents, especially new moms, can feel criticized or trampled on if a grandparent takes over control of raising baby and dictates how things ought to be done. Remember that you're not in charge and that you must defer to the new parent's wishes.


Realize that times have moved on since you parented young children, at least two decades and maybe more. A lot changes in a few decades, including the wisdom on parenting. Do not try to interfere or boss the new parents around with old parenting advice. Some modern parenting advice is based on scientific studies about safety, that has overruled unsafe older practices. Unless you've done the latest research, do not presume old parenting habits are accurate.
Learn to send grandchildren back to their parents for permission, when they're present. If your grandchild insists on another cookie or to go to bed later and tries to use you as the decision-maker, help the child to learn that it's not your place to override the parents. Simply say something like: ""If your mommy or daddy thinks you can have another cookie/go to bed later, then it'll be okay. But you will have to ask them first.""

Build a good relationship with your grandchildren.,
Be careful not to over-spoil your grandchildren.,
Try your level best to not play favorites.,
Allow your love, patience and more philosophical attitude to life that comes with being older to guide your grandchildren wisely.,
Let your grandchildren know that you're always there for them.,
Tell the grandchildren stories.,
Take photos of you and your grandkids.,
Do some activities outdoors together.,
Give gifts that the grandchildren will appreciate.",How to Be Good Grandparents3," There are no instructions as to what to do and what not to do, other than to rely on your experience and the things you've already learned raising your own children. The most important focus is to build a strong, caring and loving relationship with your grandchildren, so that they know you can be relied upon and that you're there for them in a non-judgmental and supportive capacity.

, A little spoiling is natural, but too much can cause grandchildren to view you as a pushover or as a source of funds or goodies without end. Give them the odd treat that you know the parents won't be offering but don't overdo it.


Ask permission from their parents before taking your grandchildren someplace or buying them large, expensive presents.

, Once you have more than one grandchild, it can be tempting to have a favorite or two. Do not think that this goes unnoticed though––children are very perceptive and will pick up on it quickly. Avoid doing this, and keep your preference for any one child under wraps. Treat all of the grandchildren the same, giving them equal love and affection. Over time, it may be that when the children are older some of them visit you more than others, but by then they'll have made their own choices and you can make it clearer that you are supportive of the children who continue to connect with you.


If playing favorites is part of a family feud, try to avoid this. The children aren't at fault for the sins of the parents or grandparents. All you're teaching them is to be disruptive and disrespectful, not how to be kith and kin.

, Not being the parent gives you so much more leeway to be the kind, gentle and thoughtful influence in your children's lives. Cherish the time you spend with your grandchildren, even the lows, as these moments will make precious memories for each of you to look back on.

, This includes doing your best to avoid being judgmental. While you're two generations before them, and things were done in certain ways in your day, realize that times always move on and how your grandchildren see the world is likely to be somewhat different from how you see it. This is how life has always been and ever will be––as the older and wiser one, aim to see things from their perspective as much as your own and understand that they only see what is around them as the standard, not what you once grew up in.


Avoid saying things such as ""in my day we'd behave ourselves and not expect anything like what you get"" and other such negative remarks. Instead, aim to explain to them how things were different when you grew up and how you feel that has an impact on today's world. Use it as a way to examine history and change, not as a way to pass judgment on the child's actions or thinking. Otherwise, your grandchildren will simply switch off and consider you stuck in the olden days and ways.
Avoid being mean or unsupportive. This will only cause the grandchildren to not tell you things in future and may even cause them to stay away, which they can do as they're not your children.
Be supportive of their choices. They don't need to feel stupid or bullied by their own family. If they make choices that you really cannot connect with, explore your own reasons for being uncomfortable or unwilling to understand, and try to reach a compromise or at least an understanding.

, Topics for stories might include how things were when you were little, how life use to be and what has changed. You can also share funny memories that you had with your family, and fairy tales and folk tales.


A good family storyteller is worth their weight in gold. Even with TV, iPads and the internet, there will never be a replacement for a live, loving and friendly storyteller. Your grandchildren will lap it up!

, Do this when they are at the park, home, or some other place. Take many photos to share around.


You can also make them photos for times to remember. Take photos of them dressing up and doing a parade for you, for instance; that's always fun.

, Go to a park, the zoo, a craft place, a toy shop, shopping, show, marketplace, etc. Getting your grandchildren outdoors and taking them to places builds fitness, memories and camaraderie. Be the adventurous grandparent and thrill them every time they visit.


Realize that when taking small children to museums and educational places because, they may not understand much about these places. However, they will gain a subconscious appreciation for them, so don't feel that such educational visits are wasted. It's all going toward forming their deeper understanding of the world.

, Try giving them fun and educational things. You can give them gifts from your holidays, seasonal gifts, birthday gifts, and ""just because"" gifts.


Remember not to overload on the gifts, however; a good bond is all about quality time.

Ask them what kind of party they want!,
Set a budget.,
Choose a date and location.,
Invite the guests.,
Buy food and drink for the party.,
Decorate the event space.,
Plan a short birthday speech.,
Arrange for cleanup.",How to Celebrate a Grandparent's Birthday2," Many older people find large parties stressful. Ask your grandparent directly if they would prefer a big party, a small celebration, or a family outing. Don’t ignore their requests!, This will determine how elaborate the party will be. This is especially important if you are taking your grandparent out--don’t expect them pay for their own birthday celebration! If you would like other family members to help you with the costs, ask them as soon as you can., Ask your grandparent if there is a time and a place they would prefer. Be sure that important guests, like your parents, aunts, and uncles, will be able to attend as well., Ask your grandparent or parent for a guest list. Be sure to include your grandparent’s friends and relatives, even if you don’t know them. Do not invite your own friends, and do not “surprise” your grandparent by inviting someone they are estranged from. Be sure to send out invitations at least three weeks in advance., Whether or not you order food or make it yourself will depend on your budget. Make sure that each guest has plenty to eat and drink--a good general rule is one pound of food and three drinks per person. If you are having the party at a restaurant, you will need to make sure their prices fit your budget., Adult birthday parties don’t need as many decorations as children’s parties, but a few balloons and streamers will make the celebration more festive. Subdued, mature color schemes like black and white, silver and gold, and burgundy and cream are good choices for a grandparent’s birthday party., If you are hosting the party, you should prepare a short speech to deliver before the cake is served. It doesn’t have to be anything long or special--just thank the guests for coming, tell them how much your grandparent means to you, and wish your grandparent a happy birthday., This is especially important if the party is at your grandparents’ house. Don’t leave them with a mess on their birthday!"
"
Talk to your grandparent.,
Plan a small outing for your grandparent.,
Arrange a quiet birthday at home.,
Ask other relatives to get in touch with them.,
Tell them how much they mean to you.",How to Celebrate a Grandparent's Birthday3," If you don’t live close enough to your grandparents to visit, make sure you get in touch for their birthday! Call them, email them, or write them a letter, depending on what technology they’re most comfortable with.

, If they have asked to go out for their birthday, plan the excursion for them. Depending on their interests, make dinner reservations, buy show tickets, or arrange a tour guide. Make sure you arrange transportation and payment for them., If your grandparent would prefer to stay at home or visit you for their birthday, plan for a small celebration in your home or theirs. Keep it small and low-key--a small cake should be enough!, If you know that your relatives often forget to call or visit, remind them of your grandparent’s upcoming birthday ahead of time. Many grandparents would appreciate hearing from all of their children and grandchildren, and helping make that happen would be a great birthday gift., Quiet time together is the perfect opportunity to wish your grandparent a happy birthday and tell them about your love and respect for them. If you feel awkward speaking directly to them, write it down in a birthday card and give it to them."
"
Track the progress of younger grandchildren with technology.,
Schedule regular video conferencing.,
Send letters and care packages.,
Send emails or texts.",How to Bond with Long Distance Grandkids2," The digital age makes it much easier for grandparents to form and maintain attachments with grandchildren over long distances. Even if you have one who is a newborn and unable to answer a phone call, you can still keep tabs on their growth and development.


When it comes to developing a bond with very young grandchildren, the answer lies in staying in touch with their parents. Ask your son or daughter to include the ultrasound in an email or text message. If you can’t travel for the live birth, have someone record key parts of it so you’re able to observe from afar.
In addition, talking on the phone or videoconferencing can help you hear cries from infant grandchildren. To note how fast they’re growing, request that your children complete a monthly shot of each young child. Recording first words and steps on video is also another way for you to be kept abreast of growing grandkids.

, If you are just itching to hear their little (or big) voices each week, have your kids carve out a window when the whole family is available to do videoconferencing. There are a range of services out there like Skype or Google Hangouts that allow you to make live video calls. Endless possibilities await with this kind of technology: watch movies together, read books, listen to music, or cook the same recipe for dinner.


To connect in this way, you need a smart phone or a computer with a webcam and speakers. If you have trouble with technology, suggest that your older grandchildren teach you how to set up or use your equipment. Adolescents today are quite tech-savvy!, Keeping in touch doesn’t have to be elaborate. Old-fashioned letters can be just what your grandchildren need to stay in touch, and sending a response can help little ones perfect their handwriting skills. Care packages can be sent with the letters or separately, too. Include special treats, pictures of your life, birthday cards, little gifts, and even home-baked goods., A simple text message to say “I hope you have a good week at school” might lift a teenage grandchild’s spirits. On the other hand, you can ask your children to scan and email copies of report cards and hand-drawn pictures for you to stay updated on how your grandchildren are performing in school or at home.Any shared interest can be discussed through phone calls, text messages, or emails. If you and one grandchild have a shared passion for jokes, send some humor to their inbox. If one grandchild has developed an interest in baking, pass on a secret family recipe for cookies."
"
Share your family history.,
Play games.,
Use your travels to connect.,
Teach them a new skill.",How to Bond with Long Distance Grandkids3," The stories that have been passed down through your family must be carried on through your grandchildren. Although your own kids may tire of hearing about how your family settled, your grandkids will likely enjoy getting an illustrative description of the early days. Sharing history can be simple and straightforward or coupled with a creative twist.Involve them in an experiment that ties to current history lessons to your family’s beginnings. Use genealogy charts to track your family’s roots. Make a scrapbook to include pictures of ancestors they never got a chance to meet.

, Every family enjoys letting off a little steam with a fun board or card game. You may not be in the same room with your grandchildren, but many traditional games can now be played online. Through your computer, smart phone, or tablet you can connect with your grandchildren and choose from a wide selection of games like word puzzles, trivia games, picture games, mystery games, chess, checkers, sports games, and more., Make your grandkids feel like they are right there with you as you venture out during your retirement. If you are a wandering grandparent, send back postcards, souvenirs, or unique food items from your travels.


You can also arrange to take a trip with your grandchildren to introduce them to new cultures near and far and make unforgettable memories in the process. Depending on how young they are, it might be better if the parents came along to help with their care., Are you a jack-of-all-trades? Dust off your instruction manuals and help your grandkids learn a skill you cherish. If you live in a foreign country, it might be practical to get them started learning the dominant language in your area. Then again, you could teach them to hunt, sew, cook, paint, or play guitar."

Dress cool but not like a teen.,

Follow fashion code rules about hemline length.,
Update your hair and makeup.,
Be open minded about trends and societal norms in modern society.,
Have a sense of humor.,
Continue to see life as a learning experience.,
Visit your doctor.",How to Be a Hip Grandma," You want a fresher, younger look without looking like you raided your granddaughter's closet. Trying to dress as a teenager ages a woman rather than making her look younger.
, Mature women should opt for hemlines that flatter the body, and that typically means fewer plunging necklines and tiny mini-skirts. In general, however, adhere to the same rules typically followed by women in their 30’s or 40’s--shorts and skirts should be long enough to cover mid-thigh and necklines not exposing too much cleavage.

However, if you have great legs, show them off, and if your bosom is fabulous, wear V-necks!
Make sure what you wear fits. Too tight or too baggy is typically not good looking.


Shop at women’s stores--not teen or juniors sections. Even though you are a young, hip grandma, you are no longer 20 years-old. Luckily today’s women’s fashions include young styles and colors. Skip swapping clothes with your 15 year old granddaughter and shop in the women’s section. Instead of selecting old fashioned dresses and pant suits, go for younger looking tops, jeans and shorts.
Mix and match fun, bright colors and patterns. Just because you are a grandmother doesn’t mean you have to abandon fashion fun and color. Go with trending colors or patterns to express your love of life.

, No hip grandma would leave the house with grey in her hair or with the same look she wore in the 1980’s. Stay with the trends, but continue with the same mature approach. Use actress Helen Mirren or Goldie Hawn as an inspiration for hair and make up (also fashion).


Grey hair. It happens to most of us with age. You have the choice of coloring your hair, or embracing the grey. There is not one simple answer.
Is coloring the way to go? The best choice route is to visit a professional colorist, who can guide you on the best colors and options for you. However, home dyeing kits often yield very good results.
Visit a professional stylist for a fresh youthful cut. If you haven’t had your style updated in the last few decades now is the time to enter the new millennium. Request a style that is not only hip but goes with your unique personality, face shape and lifestyle.
Check out some of the latest makeup techniques and applications. You want to be hip, but not 14 years old so infuse some of the latest colors and techniques into your repertoire but make them age appropriate.

, Being a hip grandma means that you go with the flow, try to connect and understand the younger generation without judgment or lamenting about how times were “better” when you were a girl.


Lend a trustworthy, listening ear to your children and grandchildren. Leave any judgment in the past and be the kind of grandmother that can be your child or grandchild’s sounding board.
Try new endeavors with your family. If your grandchildren really think you might love zip lining (and you are in relatively good shape), offer to spring for a session and go for it with the kids.
Understand that times have changed since you were young--and that’s o.k. So your grandson wants to live with his girlfriend instead of getting married right away or has a few piercings--be that grandma who tries to understand where he’s coming from and be supportive.
Embrace new technology. Instead of seeing new gadgets and conveniences as a burden or refuse to learn how to send a text message, run toward it and learn more about why people love it. Take a class at the local Apple store or ask your grandchildren to teach you about how to maximize your smart phone usage.

, A cool grandma loves to laugh and continue to find humor in nearly any situation--even if it is relatively immature.


Laugh at yourself. A confident woman can definitely laugh at herself and find humor in her mistakes. She also knows that no matter her age, she is a work in progress, which can make for some pretty humorous material.
Find humor in the little things in life. So your cake turned out lopsided or you were watching “Americas Home Videos” and can’t get enough of watching a dad take the baseball bat to the family jewels; finding humor and silly laughs with your kids and grand kids will certainly make you a favorite, hip gal.

, Just because you are a mature woman doesn’t mean that learning experiences have to stop. Life is a never ending journey of learning and living--continue to embrace learning opportunities and be a role model to your family of how to get the most from life.


Pursue an additional college degree (or pursue a degree). If you always wanted to learn how to be a creative writer, take a class or pursue a degree in creative writing. Perhaps as a kid you earned a degree in something you felt would be more marketable, however now in your golden years the world is your oyster to explore.
Learn a new skill through classes or self exploration. Perhaps you simply want to learn more about a new hobby or have always wanted to learn how to paint with oils; you could either take a class or buy the materials and go for it on your own (or invite the kids, grand kids and friends).
Take up a sport. You may have wondered what this Lacrosse craze is all about--see for yourself by joining a senior league. You may fall in love with the sport.

, The only way you’ll be able to keep up with the family later in life is to maintain your health and prevent disease.


Follow up with all routine tests. If your physician orders a battery of tests, don’t ignore the order; do them. Early detection can add years to your life so be not only hip but smart.
Take medication as prescribed. Want to keep up with younger people? Then follow physician’s orders. You may feel older having to take blood pressure or cholesterol medication but you’ll feel worse if you don’t.
Explore different ways of healthy eating. Stave off illness and disease by adopting a healthy lifestyle. You’ll have more energy and feel happier if you eat healthy, don’t smoke and limit alcohol intake.
Continue (or start) to exercise every day. Think of fitness guru Jack LaLa land, who exercised and lived until he was 97. Clean living and exercise allowed Jack to do more push ups and pull ups than a person half his age. LaLanne once said, ""I know so many people in their 80s who have Alzheimer's or are in a wheelchair or whatever. And I say to myself 'I don't want to live like that. I don't want to be a burden on my family. I need to live life. And I'd hate dying; it would ruin my image.'"" Jack was a very hip grandpa.

Give them hugs and kisses and let them know how much they mean to you. Tell them how beautiful, smart, or funny they are and make them see that not a day goes by that you don’t think about them. Being as loving and caring as possible is the most important thing you can do.


Be affectionate. It’s important to give them hugs, kisses, and a lot of love.
If you’re the proud grandfather, just be aware that other people will be in line to hold your new grandchild ahead of you, including the parents and grandmothers. Have patience and you’ll have a chance to shower your grandchild with love.;
, Of course, grandparents are notorious for spoiling their grandchildren. While you don’t want to complete ruin their diets by feeding them nothing but cookies, you should indulge them a little bit by bending the rules just enough that their time with you feels fun and carefree. Let them know how special they are and reward them with little treats or gifts every once in a while so they know how much they mean to you.


Though you don’t have to spoil them with expensive gifts they’ll forget in a few weeks, you should give them treasured keepsakes that they’ll always remember.

, As the grandfather, one of your jobs is to tell your grandkids about what life was like when you were growing up. Though they may roll their eyes or act indifferent at first, it’s important for you to tell them what your parents were like and what your grandparents and life was like so that they have a deeper understanding and appreciation of the world they live in today, which is likely very different from yours. Even if they don’t seem to appreciate it at the time, they’ll be very grateful, one day.


Have them look at a photo album with you and tell lively stories about all of the people in their families to make them really come alive.
One fun activity you can do with your grandkids is to make a family tree together.

, As a grandfather, one of the most important things you can do is to make sure to be there for the milestones. You can be there when your grandkids learn to walk and talk, and also when they’re a bit older, when they start their first day of school or even when they graduate from elementary school. When they look back on these important moments in their lives, they’ll want to know that their grandfather was there every step along the way. Support and encourage them when those times come. They’ll need you for those big moments.

, If you’re lucky enough to have more than one grandchild, then you have to learn to love them equally, even if your adorable little granddaughter is always telling you how much she loves you, while your grandson likes to throw his food at your face. If you make your preferences known, your grandkids will be able to tell, and the one who isn’t favored will suffer. Just as in parenting, it’s important to love all of your grandchildren equally so they can thrive in the light of your love.


Learn to appreciate what makes each grandchild different, and try not to make them act like their siblings, except to model good behavior.

, Another important way to give your grandkids the love they deserve is to sit down and really listen to them. As the grandfather, you may be more used to talking than to listening, but if you really want to show them that you care, then you have to let them see that what they have to say is important. Sit them down on your lap or across from you during dinner, make eye contact with them, and let them tell you what happened during their day, what they’re looking forward to next weekend, or just what’s on their minds. If you’re really listening to them, it’ll make a big difference.


Put away your newspaper, turn of the TV, and avoid any other distractions. Give them all of your attention.

, Let’s face it. Most kids spend way too much time in front of the television, computer, or even their cell phones. As their grandfather, and hopefully as a man who is less dependent on technology than they are, it’s your job to get them outdoors. This can mean helping you out in the yard, going for a walk in your neighborhood, or even learning to play catch with you. The important thing is that they gain a love and appreciation for the outdoors — and they’ll have you to thank for it, even if they grumble initially.


Get them moving. In addition to encouraging your grandchildren to go outdoors, you should motivate them to be active. This should go hand in hand with going outside. If you’re on the beach, throw a Frisbee around or swim with them.
If you’re at a park, help them play tag or play ring toss or another fun game. Most kids don’t get enough exercise, and it’s important to keep them feeling active and energetic.

, Though spoiling your grandkids a little is every grandparent’s right, you shouldn’t do it so much that you completely disregard their parents’ rules and cause conflicts. Don’t completely ignore their bedtimes, their dietary restrictions, or how much TV time they get per day. Though letting them break these rules may feel good initially, it can lead to confusion in their household, and you should make sure that your grandkids know that rules are meant to be followed.Instead, help your grandchildren understand why their parents’ rules are important.
If you disagree with one of the parents’ rules, you can try talking to them about it (though you should avoid giving advice), but don’t tell the grandkids that it’s a bad rule.

, Another thing you can do as a grandfather is to tell your grandkids what life was like when you were growing up. Let them see that their world is still changing quickly and that they shouldn’t take anything for granted. If you have an extensive knowledge of history, politics, music, or really anything at all, then you should share this knowledge with your grandkids as much as you can; it will help them become mature, knowledgeable adults.


Spend time reading the paper with them and answer any questions they may have.
If they’re taking a history class, see what you can contribute from your own experiences.

, Though you may think that you’re the grandfather and that you have infinite wisdom to share with your grandchildren, you shouldn’t underestimate them, either. They live in a different world than you do, and it’s likely that they can teach you a thing or two, from how to send a text message to who the heck Justin Beiber is. Let them see that they are natural teachers and have a lot to offer, too, and they’ll develop more self-worth.


Ask them for help and don’t be shy about it. They’ll be proud to have something they can show Grandpa.

, Another thing you can do as their grandparent is to teach them the importance of being a good citizen of the world. This can mean everything from teaching them to recycle, to making sure that they are friendly to their neighbors and respectful in public. Remember that you’re a role model to them, so if you are a good citizen, they will follow suit.


Help them have good manners, be polite, and learn to respect the privacy of others.
Even the most basic tasks, like putting back your shopping cart or holding a door for someone, can help your grandkids become good citizens.

, If you and your wife are helping raise the grandkids together, then you should stick to the same rules and regulations. This will help keep things in your household consistent and will make your grandchildren treat you equally, instead of thinking that one of you is the “good cop” who will bend some of the rules. You should also treat your wife with love and kindness, and use your relationship as a model of love and care that your grandchildren can aspire to, one day.


Be affectionate with your wife in front of your grandchildren, and give them a positive model of a relationship.

, Of course, you can tell your grandkids to shape up when they’re misbehaving, but you should avoid being overly critical. It’s not your job to make them feel bad about themselves. You should praise them as much as you can and only criticize them if you think you want to teach them an important lesson and that it’ll be really good for their character. They should come to you for love and guidance, not discouragement.


Hold your tongue if you feel yourself wanting to be critical. Offer criticism only if it’s constructive, not if it’s meant to make your grandkids feel bad about themselves.

, If you want to help your grandchildren be strong and to build their character, then you shouldn’t criticize their parents in front of them. Whether their parents owe you money or are giving you too many responsibilities, you should kick that to the curb when it comes to bonding with your grandchildren; if they hear you criticizing their parents, they’ll think it’s okay to do that, too, and they’ll fall into bad habits.


It goes without saying that when it comes to actually talking to their parents, you should also treat them with kindness and respect, and avoid fighting with them in front of their children.

, As a new grandfather, you can try to be as helpful as you are able to be while maintaining your boundaries. Help the parents by watching your grandkids, running small errands for them, or helping out around the house when you can. You should be there as the parents adjust to their new lives and offer love, support, and a helping hand. When the new baby arrives, you should plan to be more available than you usually are.


If you don’t live near the parents, you can plan to take a trip out to spend time helping them and bonding with your new grandkids.

, While it’s important to help out the new parents, you shouldn’t let your responsibilities as a grandparent take over your entire life. You may be feeling overwhelmed or like you don’t have time to do the things you want to do. You may also feel not physically able to help out as much as you’ve been helping and may feel too proud to say so.


Though you may be excited to spend time with your new grandchild, you have to be open and honest with parents about how much you can comfortably take on.

, Though you may be eager and excited to be a grandfather, especially if you’re going it alone, you have to make sure to maintain your own life in spite of your new duties. Keep your usual meeting times with your friends, make time for cooking, fishing, walking, or anything else you normally like to do, and make time for decompressing with a good book in the process. It’s important to have a life so you don’t get too absorbed in the life of your new grandchild.


Keep spending time with your friends and your wife, and keep doing the same activities you loved to do before your grandkids arrived, whether you enjoy golfing, reading the paper, or gardening.
Remember that it’s likely that there are other grandparents who want to share your duties so you can’t expect to spend all of your time with your new grandchild.

, Though you may have a million and one ideas of how to raise children and though you may have raised 10 healthy, happy children yourself, when it comes to giving advice to the parents, your lips should be sealed unless that advice is asked for. Remember that you’re the grandparent and not the parent and accept that your role in your grandchildren’s lives is not the same as it would be if you were the parent.If the parents ask for advice, you should give it without being critical. Keep in mind that things have changed a bit since you were raising your kids, and you should account for that in your advice.

, Though you may like spending time with the whole family, as the grandfather, you may want to give the parents some time to be together without their children. Some alone time is important for them to maintain their relationship, even if they miss the kids when they’re not with them. Make sure you give them some time to decompress and are understanding of their need to be alone sometimes.Make sure the parents get to have a date night at least once or twice a month. They may insist that they don’t need time away from their kids; you should encourage them to get it.

If you want to go on an outing, you might need to suggest certain clothing, and even ask for financial help if needed, even before the grandchildren arrive. It is also a good idea to check opening times, session times and transportation timetables to make sure that everything is sorted in advance. When you make your plan for the day, however, take some time for resting and decompressing into account, too. You don’t want your grandchild to get too tuckered out.


Try to do something with your grandkids that their parents wouldn’t normally do with them. Take them to a new part of town they haven’t seen, or teach them something their parents don’t know how to do, whether it’s watercolor painting or jewelry making. This will make your time together all the more special and memorable.;

Often they will be interested enough to pitch in and help you, all the while holding fascinating conversations with you. Treasure these times because they hold the essence of intergenerational bonding. They may be interested in watching you cook, helping out in the garden, walking your dog with you, or even in checking out your favorite TV show.Your grandchildren will be used to life at their own household and will inherently be interested in the way you run yours. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to create a fun day for them; it’ll happen naturally.
That said, it’s good to have a back-up activity, such as a movie to watch or a pie to bake, just in case your grandchild gets restless and really wants to do something.

, Pass on your experience through your stories about what you have done and seen. Don't be afraid to share the ""strangeness"" of the past. To their ears it may be strange now but in the future, they will come to see your past as being as special as theirs, and in some small way, they will understand both you and humanity all the better for your having shared how life was when you grew up. You're the best record of what happened, so share it with them generously.


Tell them about your life and experiences and how they have informed your outlook. Let them know how much the world has changed since you were raised in it, what you did for a living, and which vital skills they’ll need for a successful life.
Pass on any life lessons you have learned, from how to have a happy marriage to how to manage your home. You may not want to give this information all at once or your grandchildren won’t be listening; instead, dole out this information little by little, and make sure it sticks.
Tell them to ask you any questions about your life or your past they may be curious about. The conversation doesn’t have to be one-sided.

, Though your grandchildren may not be super interested in the details of their family history when they’re younger, you should make a point of telling them about their family history so that they have a stronger sense of who they are. Sit them down with an album and show them who is who in the family lineage. Don’t just point, but make the people come alive by telling anecdotes and memorable stories about each person in your family, so your grandchildren feel invested in them even though they are long gone.You can even take it one step further and write it down. Give your grandkids a record of their family that they can cherish for all time.
Again, some younger kids may not have the patience or interest to care about their family history yet. You can try to sneak this information into your everyday conversation and activities so that they learn the truth in little, digestible bits and pieces.

, Your relationship with your grandchild doesn’t have to be one-sided. Times are changing fast, and one thing you can do to make your grandchild feel special is to ask him or her to educate you about what’s going on in the world, from the latest trends in music to Facebook or Twitter. If you’re tech savvy, then you can ask your grandchildren to tell you about fashion or what their friends talk about, these days. Show a genuine interest in their world and they will open up to you.


People love being teachers, and your grandkids will get even more excited to hang out with you if they know that they’ll have important knowledge to share with you.
Make sure you thank them for teaching you something. Show that you appreciate their help.

, One thing you can do is to make sure that you’re there for the important moments in your grandchild’s life, from birthdays to elementary school graduations. Though you may not be able to always be there, especially if you live far away, you should make a point of being there for the important moments when you can. Your grandchildren will remember those big moments in their lives, and it’ll be important for them to remember your presence during those times.


Your grandchildren will turn to you for love and support, not criticism. Give them love and support on their big days and show them how proud you are of them, even if you would have done things differently.

, This is something to keep in mind even before your grandchild is born. You aren't there to provide a never-ending source of babysitting and it is important to set the boundaries at the outset. Make it clear that you love your children and the grandchildren and that there are plenty of occasions for visits, but also make it clear when it is not OK to have the grandchildren staying over or being dropped off regularly. In this way, you will be able to enjoy the time spent with your grandchildren one hundred percent instead of feeling resentment or exhaustion.Don’t assume that you’re going to be a constant babysitter and at the parents’ beck and call as soon as the baby is born. You can give them the time you want to spend, but plan for the help you’ll give in advance instead of being “on call.”
If you don’t feel like you’re forced or pressured into hanging out with your grandchild, then your relationship will be much stronger for it.

, You cannot spoil children. You can unintentionally teach them that consuming too much is a good thing, which you'd never do, right? Teach them good values, like gratitude, respect, and patience and don't overload them with ""stuff"". Instead, smother them with praise. Notice all the good that they do and be vociferous about it when you spot it. And give them space; children are free to be a bit less restrained when they're with you. After all, they have parents to tell them off all the time. Every time you see them, give them a big hug and let them know that you love them and they are safe with you.


Though you can criticize their behavior occasionally if they misbehave in your presence, you should focus on being a source of joy and positivity. They already live with one or two parents who want to teach them right from wrong, and while you don’t want to go against their ideas, you shouldn’t be too stringent, either.
Of course, you shouldn’t let your grandchild follow completely different rules in your presence, or he or she will be confused about which rules are “right”. Still, you should go easy on your grandchildren and focus on praising them and letting them know how special they are.

, On their birthday, buy them presents that are thoughtful but not overdone. Sometimes give them what they ask for; other times put a little surprise in the wrapping paper that they didn't expect. The most important thing is that you’re there for them on their big day and that you let them know how much you love them. Write them a card letting them know how much they mean to you in addition to giving them a gift.


Just make sure to check in with the parents before giving the grandchild a gift. You don’t want your gift to upstage the parents’ gift, or to be too similar too it. That could make for an awkward birthday.

, Another way to show your love to your grandchildren is to shower them with affection. Give them hugs and kisses, put your arm around them, play with their hair, or just give them a reassuring touch to show them that you care. When you sit next to them, pat their knee or their hand, or just get close to show your love to them. As they get older, they may not be open to as much affection, but you should make a point of showering them with love.


Be a source of love and warmth to your grandchildren, so they know that they can come to you when they need comfort.

, Take the time to hear what they have to say, and to listen to every word without interrupting. Don’t be distracted and take the time to hear them out, instead of having them talk while you’re cooking or tending to your garden. Make eye contact and let them know how much you care without giving advice until they ask for it. The most important thing is that you don’t judge them and take what they say seriously.


Sometimes, your grandkids may tell you things they don’t even tell their parents. Help them out as best you can, but let them know that there may be cases where their parents should know what’s on their mind, too.
Be affectionate when they talk to you. Put an arm around them or place a hand on their knee to reassure them.

, You already went through parenthood and had to work on disciplining your children. Now, you can relax a little and focus on having fun with your grandkids. Though some rules will need to be enforced, especially if your grandkids stay with you for a prolonged period of time, such as a summer vacation, you should work on giving your grandkids treats, making them feel special, and even letting them have that extra cookie once in a while. They should come to you for love, not to have you lay down the law.Of course, you shouldn’t spoil them to the point where their parents are annoyed at how much flexibility you’re giving them. Find a way to make both your grandchildren and their parents happy.

, Even if you’ve raised 15 children successfully and feel like you know everything there is to know about parenting, you’re going to have to seal your lips unless you’re asked for advice. Your child and his or her spouse may have some different ideas about how to raise children, and they may not want to hear every little thing you have to say about the subject. Of course, they may call upon your expertise, but you shouldn’t assume that you’re going to tell them how to do every last thing, from how to change a diaper to how to help their child grow into a responsible adult.If you give the parents too much advice, they may pull back from you, leading to a more tense relationship between you and your grandchild.

, To succeed as a grandparent, you should accept the fact that you are the grandparent, not the parent in the child’s life. Your role is to spend time with your grandchild, give advice and help to the parents when it’s needed, and to be there for the new addition to your family. The sooner you accept that you are not the grandchild’s mother, the sooner you can be on to enjoying your own unique relationship.You shouldn’t focus on disciplining your grandchild and teaching him or her how to be an adult. Focus more on giving love, care, and support.

, You may think that you should drop everything as soon as your grandson or granddaughter arrives, but the best thing you can do is to maintain your own life while helping out the parents of the grandchild as much as you can. You want to continue having your own friends, your own social commitments, and your own hobbies if you want to succeed as a grandparent. If you drop absolutely everything to be with your grandchild, then you will be putting too much pressure on the parents.Find a way to fit spending time with your grandchildren into your schedule without making your schedule entirely revolve around your grandchildren and the whims of their parents. Of course, there may be times when they need some last-minute help, but you shouldn’t leave your schedule wide open just in case that happens.

, One thing you can definitely do when there’s a new addition to your family, or even when your grandchild gets older, is to help the parents out around the house when you can. You can wash dishes, pick up groceries, occasionally cook meals, or run small errands for the father or the mother when you have time. Though you shouldn’t have to turn into their housekeeper when they have a child, helping out around the house in little ways when you have the time can make a big difference.This can be especially helpful when your grandchild is just born and the parents are overwhelmed by their parenting duties.

, Sometimes, the thing that your child’s parents will need the most is some time alone together. While being around during family activities, celebrations, or trips can give them a helping hand, you can also find some time to be alone with your grandchild or grandchildren so that their parents can have some time to go out to dinner together or just to relax without their usual responsibilities for a little while. This can help relieve stress and to keep the parents’ relationship strong.Give mom and dad at least one or two date nights a month. They may deny that they really need this time together, but you should stress that it’s important for them to spend time together away from their child.

Even if your grandparents don’t ask, take the initiative to offer up your help. You can even ask your parents if there’s something you can do to help.Your grandparents might be happy to get help from you and teach you something in return. They might play a game with you or help you after school.
Ask, “What can I do to help?”;
, Many grandparents struggle with mobility and might need some help around the house. Tasks may be difficult or impossible to perform on their own. Help out by offering to do the dishes, mop, or do laundry. This can help them feel more comfortable and less worried about getting things done.See where you can be helpful and pitch in if you see a need.

, If your grandparents are working on a large project (like painting or house training the dog), offer to help out. For example, if they are waterproofing their deck, devote a weekend to helping them. Be willing to set aside time to help them with larger projects that they may struggle to complete on their own.


These can be great opportunities to spend time together and talk more.

, Maybe your grandparents need help filling prescriptions, getting groceries, or going to the bank. Running errands can be helpful, especially if your grandparents don’t drive or have difficulty walking. Find the ways you can contribute.If you don’t drive yet, go with your parents on errands for your grandparents.

, Show respect and be polite to your grandparents. Even if they ask the same questions over and over or struggle to hear what you say, show your care in how you interact. Respond in a calm tone when they ask you questions or need something. If they are talking, listen patiently without interrupting them. This shows that you value and respect them.Take a break if you’re feeling frustrated. Come back in a few minutes after you’ve cooled off.

, One of the greatest ways to show care is by spending time together. Spend time getting to know them. Watch a favorite television show, take a walk in the park together each week, or get together each week for dinner. Have them teach you a game, then teach them one you know.Have something special that you do together. For example, take a walk at the park each week or go for ice cream together.

, Ask your grandparents about their memories and stories from their lives. Get to know your family history. Ask about their life, and ask what it was like you have your parent as their child.


Consider drawing a family tree and make it with your grandparents.

, Grandparents are some of the best people to go to for advice. They have lived much longer than you have and had lots of experiences, both good and bad, to share with you. If you have something weighing on your mind, bring it to a grandparent to discuss. Not only will it give you a new perspective, it will also make your grandparents feel appreciated and valued.Ask advice about things like going to college, dating, marriage, and kids. If you want a second opinion, go to a grandparent.

, Some days may be harder than others, but remember that you are doing something for someone you love. If your grandparent asks for a lot of help, think about what you are willing and able to do, then do it with a positive attitude.


Especially if your grandparents feel lonely, make an effort to be sociable and happy around them.

, Give them thoughtful gifts that show that you care about them and are thinking of them. A gift can be a thing, like a watch or a cellphone, or an experience, like seeing a movie together or going somewhere beautiful to enjoy nature. Think about what your grandparents might appreciate, then make a kind gesture.Remember your grandparents’ birthdays and other special days and give gifts to celebrate.
You can ask your parents for help in choosing a gift.

, Grandparents love to feel proud of their grandkids. Invite your grandparents to your sports games, concerts, plays, recitals, birthday parties, graduations, and other events. They will likely enjoy being included and feeling like a part of your life.


Have a special place for them to sit if they struggle with mobility. This can also be a place of honor for your grandparents, such as sitting near you at your birthday party.

, Check in with your grandparents on how they are doing with their health. Ask if they are attending regular appointments, getting the medication they need, and are doing well. Ask if they have someone to call when they are sick or need medical attention. If they need help getting to appointments or managing their medication, offer to help them.Because health can decline with old age, make an effort to check in on your grandparents and make sure they are doing alright.

Use your common sense.,
Take pictures of your Grandpa.",How to Act Around Your Grandpa," It is crucial to show respect to all people, but particularly to anyone in your family, and most particularly to family members who are older than yourself. Your grandfather is very wise compared to you, and has had a great deal of life experience. This means he probably knows a lot more than you do about a great many things. Therefore you should listen to what he has to say, and take it very seriously. Besides, if it wasn't for him, maybe you wouldn't have been born.;
, Show your support by being nice. Use all your manners. When a friend comes over, be sure to introduce your friend to your Grandpa. Stay and talk for a little while before you run off and play video games.

, Be willing to repeat some of your words. People lose some hearing as they age. Look directly at your Grandpa when you speak to him. That makes it easier for him to hear you and you don't want him to have to keep asking you what you said.

, People like to engage in conversation and your Grandpa is no different. He wants to know that you are thinking about them and that you want to know what they think. Maybe you are not sure what to say. If so, then ask questions. Ask about what life was like for your grandfather in the past. Does he have brothers and sisters? If so, surely he has some good stories to tell. Ask if he remembers some funny things that happened in school. Ask what his first job was. Ask him to tell you about a time he was scared. Ask what foods he liked as a child. See if you can figure out how your grandfather communicated with friends before the internet was even invented. Find out if he remembers what life was like before cell phones. There are all kinds of things to talk about.

, Later you will not remember the stories your Grandpa has told you, so take the opportunity now to write a few of those stories down in a journal. Better yet, videotape a conversation with your Grandpa. Then you will have the information in his words.

, Go over and sit next to him when he is reading a book. Bring a book of your own and sit and read together. Try to join in with things he likes to do. If he likes to go fishing, ask if you can go along. If he likes to watch golf, try to figure out the rules and the players so that you can sit and enjoy the game with him once in a while. Notice what he likes to eat, and bring him some of his favorite foods. Find out what he likes to listen to on the radio,and put that station on. Try to get him to go for a walk with you. Exercise will do you both a lot of good. Tomorrow, next week, in 20 years, things will be different and you may not have the opportunity any longer. You never know when your Grandpa will be gone.

, Maybe he is quite old and doesn't have as much energy as you. It won't hurt you if you bring him a glass of water or help him to wash his car.Or go ahead and wash his car for him! Teach him how to use the computer. It may seem like second nature to you, but he is probably of the age where people are on the other side of the digital divide. Maybe you can help him set up a Google Plus account or something, so you can communicate with him when you are not together.

, If you have common sense then you will probably figure out the rest yourself.

, Hand your phone to someone else and ask them to take pictures of the two of you together. Keep those photos. They will become more precious to you as time goes by. One day you will be glad you have those pictures, plus, your Grandpa will feel honored that you want to have a few photographs of him.

, Consider the age of the couple and the age of the guests when deciding on a time. If the party is for an aged couple, you may want to set the time before dark.

, You may choose to host the party in your home. Some people have nice halls available at their churches for hosting parties. You may want to rent a room from a local community center or conference center. You might even consider hosting the party in an outdoor setting.

, Consult with the anniversary couple about who they would like to attend. Consult with any family members about the guests that should be invited. You may need to limit the number of people that are invited because of space or financing.

, You can order preprinted invitations online. You can hand write the information on standard invitations that you purchase from a local store. Decide if you want your invitations to include an RSVP card, so you will have a better idea of how many guests will attend.

, The name of the anniversary couple and the number of years they are celebrating should be included. You will need to include the date and time. You will need to state the location of the event, and possibly the directions for how to find the place of the event. If you do not want the guests to bring gifts, include a note about no gifts in the invitations.

, This will give your guests time to mark the date on their calendars.

, You may want to hire a catering service to prepare the food for you. Whether you prepare the food yourself, or hire someone, you will still need to decide on a menu.

, Most anniversary parties do include a special cake. You can order the cake a few weeks before the party and then pick it up the day of the party. You may want to order the cake from a bakery or a deli at a grocery store. There are also people who make cakes for special occasions in their home.

, You may want to keep things simple with table cloths and flowers, or you may choose to be more elaborate by creating a themed party. You also have the option of hiring someone to do the decorating for you.

, The amount of time you need will depend on your decorations. Decide if you will set up tables and chairs and how these will be arranged.

, Be sure to have your camera ready with batteries charged. You may even want to hire a professional photographer.

Give the gift of gold.,
Purchase something sentimental.,
Take your spouse on a vacation.,
Choose alternative gifts.,
Order violets.",How to Plan For a Golden (50th) Wedding Anniversary1," Gold is the traditional symbol for 50th wedding anniversaries and it is common to give your spouse something made from gold. Here are a few ‘golden’ ideas to get you started:Gold jewelry of any type (ex. earrings, necklaces, rings, watches, cufflinks, or tie clips).
Champagne glasses trimmed in gold.
Clothing trimmed in gold or of gold lace.
A gold nugget.;
, Fifty years is a long time to be married and chances are you share a lot of important memories with your spouse. Look for something sentimental that reflects your relationship or is a reminder of your wedding day.


For example, you could celebrate your 50th wedding anniversary by purchasing a new set of wedding rings or have the diamonds reset into new rings, if the old bands are worn.

, Another meaningful gift would be to take your spouse on a special vacation. Perhaps you could take your spouse to the same spot where you spent your honeymoon or to a destination they have always wanted to go to.

, Despite the fact that this is your golden anniversary your spouse may not want something made from gold. Instead, you can look to get them something that is meaningful, such as a framed picture of the family.

, Violets are the flower that is associated with 50th wedding anniversaries because the leaves of a violet are heart shaped and the flower is purple in colour. You could give your spouse violets in a golden vase to combine two of the 50th wedding anniversary traditions."

Remember, the bottom line is that you love each other.",How to Be an Excellent Grandmother to a Teen Girl," Say by doing this you find out her favorite singer is Taylor Swift. Okay, so ask her about Taylor Swift: what kind of music does she play, which is your granddaughter's favorite song, which music video is her favorite, and so on. Well, now you know more about your granddaughter and more about her personality. And, hey, you made your birthday shopping easier too.;
, A big part of the role a grandmother plays is letting her granddaughter confide in her, with the girl knowing there is someone on the planet who loves her unconditionally, will listen without criticizing her, and who will always be behind her, even when she's wrong. Another common confession made by a girl to her grandmother is a secret desire. For example, if a girl sees a sweater in a store, she will most likely tell her grandmother. There is no known reason here, but a theory I have is that she feels her grandmother will not laugh at her. Listen to your granddaughter; in today's crazy world, there aren't many people who will set aside a good half hour to just talk to a teenager, and she'll appreciate it more than you might think.

, Say she shows an interest in the heritage you've provided her. That is to say, if your side is Irish and you're both interested in that heritage, learn more about it together. If she wants to learn about something you know (knitting, for example), teach her. You might even be surprised with a handmade gift!

, Even though a fight between a grandmother and a granddaughter can be rare, disagreements do happen. If one does, make your point and walk away. She should get the clue to apologize. As soon as she does, you're well advised to forget it.

, Maybe your phone has a text message feature, but you're wondering how to use it. Chances are good that your granddaughter can figure your whole cell phone out in minutes, with hers being much more complicated than yours. See if she'll set up your phone for you, then teach you what the different functions do.

, Do it non-confrontationally. Just randomly ask her, ""So, where do you like to shop?"" or, ""What style are you into these days?"" After that, she'll really appreciate your taking an interest, plus you'll have a good idea for holiday shopping this year.

, This is an especially important concept if you live far apart or don't see her for long stretches of time. Send her a card blank on the outside, and with a little note on the inside. Call your son or daughter to find out when she has, say, an important test coming up, and send it then. Write something like, ""Good luck. But I know you'll do fine."" These will mean more to her than you might guess.

, Will she tolerate hugging any time, but kissing only in private? Will she let you hug/kiss her anytime? Ask her if there are any boundaries there. A girl appreciates someone who takes care not to embarrass her.

, You don't always need to go all out anymore. Every now and again, just sit on the couch with some sweets and watch TV. Being in close proximity is sometimes all you need to feel closer to one another.

, If that's not possible, at least call or e-mail each other once a week, or more if you want to. This is important to most girls because it shows them that you are still thinking about them and that you care about them and want to be a part of their lives, even though you see each other maybe only once a year.

, A girl in her teens will change her relationship with friends and parents, but, with her grandmother, she will often act the same at thirteen as she did at three.

Have a party with your grandchildren.,
Take your grandchild on vacation.,
Know who your grandchildren admire.,
Keep and open mind and continue learning.",How to Be a Cool Grandparent," Celebrate by blowing up a bunch of balloons, buying a cake and celebrating your grandchild.


Make your gift time together. Parents are often torn between work and caring for their children. It’s a rare occasion that a parent can spend the entire afternoon not fussing over the house or work and only focus on the child. However, as a grandparent, you can. Devote an entire day to talking with and focusing on what your grandchildren want to do or talk about.
Surprise your grandchildren - especially after they've had a rough day or week. Who wouldn’t want a party dedicate to them after a rough week in school or losing a big game? Find an impromptu time to surprise your grandchildren and celebrate the wonderful things make them feel great.
Pull out all the stops and include streamers, party hats, and even a fun party game. No party is complete without all the trimmings. Throw the party as though you are putting together a birthday party. Include balloons, party hats, streamers and even a cake. Find out what your grandchildren's favorite activities are and even sing a happy song.;
, Even if it’s camping in the back yard, plan a fun trip with either one or all of your grandchildren that they will remember forever.


Consider going camping or RVing. If Dom and Dad are too busy to go camping, make your grandchildren’s first experience extra fun. If you are into the RV scene, consider asking your grandchildren to come along for an adventure. Head to a favorite scenic wonder or take them to the ocean. Or, if camping is something you have in mind, be sure you have all the gear needed for comfortable camping. Consider an air mattress, blankets, coolers and a grill. Don't forget the graham crackers, marshmallows and chocolate bars for s'mores.
Take your grandchildren to a destination mom and dad haven’t been able to hit. Perhaps Mom and Dad have been avoiding a Walt Disney World trip mainly because Disney is a lot of work.
Try a few field trips. If a full-blown getaway isn’t possible, go on field trips to the zoo or local art museum. Share experiences and culture with your grandchildren in order to expose them to new adventures that you can discuss and share for years to come.

, Whether it's the YouTuber of the week or a tough MMA fighter, find out who they admire and why.


Offer to take your grandchildren to see their favorite band or role model. It may not be your favorite thing to do, but if you offer to take them to a concert or to see an event you’ll most likely be nominated for “Coolest grandparent of the Year.”
Ask questions about the person they admire. Find out why and where they found out about this role model. Show you have an interest in your grandchildren’s role models by asking questions such as what they admire most about this person and who did they discover this idol. Do you own research to help you understand why they may like this individual or band. If you can contribute a fact or two, you may solidify your role as “cool grandparent.”
Be willing to accept your grandchild’s “crazy” ideas for a role model. Just because your grandchildren think a rapper with gold teeth and 15 metal chains around his neck is cool, doesn’t mean you should automatically roll your eyes in disgust and make a snide comment. Find out more about their role model, and understand that the world may have changed since you were younger and that you can’t always judge a book by its cover.

, Just because you are a grandparent doesn’t mean that you know and have done it all. There’s still a world to explore and by just being open-minded and continuing to be a student of life will automatically make you a cool grandparent.


Offer to take a class with your grandchildren. Whether it’s a pottery class at the community center or learning to play a musical instrument, learn a new skill alongside your grandchildren to further your bond.
Ask your grandchildren for advice, even if you don’t plan to take it. Show your grandchildren that you respect their opinions by asking “what if” questions. If you’re divorced and want to remarry, ask about the current dating scene.
Laugh at yourself. When you do something funny or mess up, be lighthearted enough to laugh at yourself. Not only will you put others at ease, your grandchildren will see you in a more “human” light instead of an older, more serious adult.

Refer to the list of modern and traditional anniversary gifts below (in the Tips section of this article).,
Be creative when selecting a gift within the category.,
Don't feel like you have to limit your choices to the modern or traditional list below.,
Consider sending the couple on a short break or holiday.,
If you're still having trouble selecting an anniversary gift, consider this option that applies to most anniversary years: Give a bonsai tree that is as old as their marriage (i.e.,
Another anniversary gift standby is the gift of flowers.",How to Choose an Anniversary Gift," 3rd anniversary, 20th anniversary, etc.);
, This is an easy way to narrow down your gift search. Some couples may not even know, for example, that their 7th anniversary is traditionally thought of as the wool or copper anniversary. This is your chance to show them how thoughtful you are because of the research you've done to find this out, or the effort you spent to find something fitting.

, Using the example above (7th anniversary), you could give a classic set of copper pots to enhance their kitchen. Or, if they live in a cold climate, you could get a pair of thick, warm wool sweaters, or a cozy wool blanket (or even wool socks if you're on a tight budget). Be creative and use your imagination.

, After all, giving an anniversary gift isn't about following a list - it's about celebrating their marriage. If a category from the 20th anniversary sparks an idea for a couple's 15th anniversary, go for it!

, You could send them to the place where the proposal took place, or where they went for Honeymoon. Provide a romantic weekend in the city with theater tickets. Send them somewhere they have never been. Send them them to China for the 20th Wedding Anniversary!

, But not cut flowers, a bouquet or a floral arrangement. Instead, a perennial plant or bush of carnations, roses, tulips, or lilies can be extremely thoughtful when the appropriate sentiment is sent with it. For example, give the gift of a white carnation plant (not cut carnations) that the couple can plant in their flower garden at home. Write a card that explains that the white carnation represents pure and sweet love, which will bloom every year as a symbol of the love upon which their marriage is based. Other options include the sunflower, which symbolizes devotion, or pink and white roses that represent love, desire, and respect. Again, be creative - flowers have many meanings that are relevant to a marriage - friendship, faith, and loyalty are just a few to consider.

Surprise your significant other with a hot, home cooked meal for your anniversary celebration, or prepare the meal together for more of a feeling of togetherness.If you’re looking for a fresh, sophisticated take on the traditional home cooked dinner, plan a wine-and-cheese tasting for two.There’s nothing wrong with grabbing takeout. Chances are, the two of you spend a lot of time preparing food throughout the week. Take the pressure off by having something tasty delivered and spare yourselves the cook time and cleanup.;
, If fancy dinners aren’t your thing, order some food to-go and spend the evening relaxing and watching your favorite movies. Not long ago, you had to go to a theater and buy tickets in order to enjoy a movie night with your date. Entertainment models like Redbox and Netflix have made it easier than ever to choose from a near-endless catalog of movies from the comfort of your couch. This way it can just be the two of you and a leisurely night of viewing to give you a break from the hectic day-to-day bustle.If you’re having trouble deciding on what to watch, you can each pick a movie for a custom double-feature.

, Maximize the fun you have with your partner on your anniversary by hosting your own game night. Playing games together is a great way to compete, cooperate and challenge each other to get creative, and can make for a lot of laughs. Break out the board games, or find something interactive, like two-person Pictionary or Charades, for the two of you to do and let the good times roll.Pick a game like chess or Scrabble if you feel like testing your brainpower, or something more physical like Twister if you’d rather get up and move.
Don’t forget about video games! A little two-player madness might be just what you need to loosen up on your anniversary.

, What better way to show someone you care than by pampering them? Turn the lights down low, put on some ambient music and treat one another to a sensuous spa day at home.

Sometimes the best surprises are things you’ve wanted but have hesitated to ask for.
Jewelry is a popular gift for anniversaries, especially to commemorate decades, but you don’t have to break the bank buying expensive, impersonal gold and jewels. Try selecting a tasteful piece with your partner’s birthstone or a particular symbol that’s meaningful to them., Take the time to write out a personalized letter or poem by hand. Remind your spouse of what you love about them and of the fond experiences you’ve shared. It’s easy to fall into a routine and leave your deeper feelings unspoken: this will afford you the chance to say the things you don’t always get to say. A handwritten missive is something your loved one will be able to keep and cherish for the rest of their life.


Being mushy isn’t your only option. This is a good opportunity to put your feelings on display, but also to make your partner laugh by coming up with silly rhymes or referencing inside jokes that only the two of you are in on.

, Rather than going out and buying a gift, consider making something yourself. A scrapbook filled with pictures of the two of you would make a great anniversary project, and it’s something that anyone can do. Whatever you make should identify the sentiments and desires of your spouse and will ideally contain some characteristic of your own; your gift will be one-of-a-kind and will therefore mean a lot to your significant other.Think about gifts that are specifically suited to your loved one—for instance, if they’re an ardent reader, fashion a simple, eye-catching set of homemade bookshelves, or design a spice rack for someone who loves to cook.
Make a mix tape, burned CD or playlist for your significant other. This is a timeless gesture that never goes out of style, and can be the perfect complement to an anniversary present. Draw on a selection of your favorite tracks to compile a personalized mix and give the gift of music., Write and record a short video message of yourself wishing your spouse a happy anniversary. Simply use your smartphone, tablet or webcam to video yourself marking the day and offering words of affection. We live in an age where technology has made it easier than ever to document our lives, so use this ability to capture a special moment on your anniversary that can be replayed any time and bring tears of joy for years to come.Rehearse your message first and run through it a few times before you record yourself to ensure that you’re able to say exactly what you want to say.
Inject some personality into your video message. Sing, dance or use signs and props to make the recording memorable.

, Put aside practical talk of work, money and household responsibilities for the evening and just talk to your loved one. Use this chance to reconnect with them and strengthen the bonds you formed when you were first getting to know each other. Talk about anything and everything: your dreams, beliefs, goals, politics, things that make you laugh. Get to know the person you love again by sharing your innermost thoughts.If you’re married and/or have children together, challenge yourselves to talk about topics other than your jobs, kids and finances. Make your dialogue about the two of you.

, Whether it’s your first anniversary or your fifty-first, the two of you have been through a lot together. Reminisce over these times while you enjoy your dinner, spa night or game session. Trace your history back to the day you met or share funny stories or recollections of fond times. Your unique, ongoing connection should be the centerpiece of your anniversary., Cut loose for the evening and dance! Imagine that you’re with your sweetheart back in high school at prom, or make the living room your own personal nightclub and cut a rug until your feet are sore. Not only is dancing fun, it’s great stress relief and can make you and your partner feel more physically in tune with one another.


Have a good time! Go wild to the upbeat chart-topping hits on the radio and follow it with an intimate slow dance that brings you close.
Put on songs that have mutual significance for the two of you, like the song that was playing the first time you met or one that describes the way you feel about each other., The little things we tell each other can become commonplace when we hear them day in and day out. For your special day together, express to your spouse how much they truly mean to you. Sit them down and tell them face-to-face, just the two of you, with no distractions. Saying the words “I love you” is like a form of backing currency: it’s important not just to hear but to know the strength of the feeling behind it.


Telling a significant other that you love them is one the simplest but most powerful gestures you can make in a relationship. No matter how many times you hear it, it’s always touching to be reminded that you’re with someone that cares about you and wants you to know it.

, Anniversaries can be big events, but what’s even bigger is the kinship that you and your loved one share. You wouldn’t have stayed together for a year, or an additional year, if you didn’t feel strongly for them, and even though you might spend everyday together, now is the time to reflect on the things you appreciate about the other and savor being with them. So just relax, treat yourselves and take pleasure in spending the evening with the person who means the most to you.Anniversaries don’t have to be fancy, immaculately-planned occasions. Putting too much emphasis on making the day “perfect” can take away from simply enjoying being in one another’s company. Find activities that you both like to do that let you be together without interruption or distraction.

, If your parents have taken a lot of photographs of themselves and the family over the years, you may try editing them together to make a commemorative video.

Or try to teach yourself how to use video editing software and put the video together yourself.One option is to organize the video chronologically, starting with images of your parents when they first met. Then, you may then move into images of your parents together before you were born followed by images of you all as a family. You can also include text in the video as an added touch.

, Think about a trip your parents have always wanted to do together or an outing they may enjoy as a couple. Get them tickets for the trip and put them in a nice card.

You may then pool your money with your siblings and get them tickets to Costa Rica as a gift.
Maybe you are looking for a gift that is affordable but still special. You may get your parents tickets to a fun, once in a lifetime event such as a hot air balloon ride or a horseback ride through the mountains.

For example, if your home is decorated in early 20th century style, don't buy a piece of furniture that is extremely modern. Alternatively, if your home features modern decor, an antique from the 1800's may clash.
Look for common themes in design. Are there certain colors, patterns, or animals that are reoccurring in your home?, How do you and your spouse spend your free time? What do you really enjoy doing? By answering these questions, you can find a unique way to gift furniture that will be useful and appreciated.


For example, if you and your spouse spend much of your time in your pool, pool floats or accessories like a floating bar could be an appropriate gift.
Maybe you and your spouse enjoy fishing or other outdoor activities. If so, lawn chairs or seats for a fishing boat would be ideal gifts in honor of a 17th anniversary.

, Home accents are a great way to infuse personality and style into a home, so give gifts like wall art, vases, or throw pillows to liven up furniture.


Accessories are typically more affordable than large furniture pieces but can be just as useful and thoughtful.

, Bring back memories and milestones in your marriage by recreating events. Think of the most romantic and happiest moments in your marriage and reenact them. Plan down to the smallest detail: where were you, what was the occasion, what were you wearing, what was said?


For instance, take your partner back to the place where your marriage proposal occurred. Instead of asking them to marry you, vow to never be apart from this day forward.Reenact your first date.

This is a nice, quiet way to spend time together being creative and making something that you can use for years to come.

, Plant a tree or other long-living plant together. You can plant it in your yard, in a place which has significant meaning to you, or in a local forest. Consider a coast redwood, which is the tallest living organism. What a testament to your love!

, Go to a local pick-your-own berry farm and pick berries together. You can enjoy the quiet or talk about your memories together.

Maybe include a rubber duck for when you proposed to her by the pond in the local park, a coffee cup with a print of an art piece from the museum where he took your on your first date, or a drink umbrella for that time you both got caught in the rain and took shelter under an awning.

, Write a short book which you feel summarizes your relationship and how you feel. Any material you want to include or feel appropriate is fine. You can make the books by hand, by filling a blank journal, or you can find a local or online self publisher and get a real book printed.


Fill it with poems that remind you of your partner, pictures of the two of you or places you’ve gone together, things you had share together or describe your feelings about your marriage, a message to your past self about how much your partner mean to you, or a message to your partner or yourself in the future confessing your hopes for what things will be like.

Watch a movie: with a twist!,
Write notes to strangers.",How to Celebrate a Wedding Anniversary4," Geocaching is a fun activity where strangers hide treasures and then list the GPS location for other people to find.

If you can, rent out a local theater to show this special movie.

, Sometimes, life gets awfully hard. Not everyone has a great spouse like you do to help them through life. Inspire these lonely people by writing encouraging notes and then hiding them for strangers to find, under tables in restaurants or inside of books at the library. Write the notes together and share them with each other and then hide them together.


You can write messages like “Someday you’ll meet someone who loves you as much as I love her” or “Don’t worry. He’s out there. You’ll find him.” or “I didn’t think I’d find love either. I was wrong.” or “I’m so happy now. You will be too. Just wait.”

Write down how you feel.,
Work on what you can fix.,
Commit to improving your marriage.,
Consider seeing a marriage counselor.",How to Fix a Marriage1," While you might want to dive into the issues and what is wrong in your marriage, you won't really be able to know this until you speak with your partner. You should first identify how you feel and then why you feel that way. Write down the feeling (angry, distant, hurt, etc.) and then attribute the feeling to a pattern of interacting (you don't talk with your spouse about work anymore, you stopped date night, etc.).

When you are ready to talk to your spouse you can refer to this list.;
, Trying to force another person to behave differently will likely be met with resistance. Instead, focus on your own issues and work towards becoming a better person yourself. Understanding, loving, and improving yourself can help you improve your marriage in turn.Communicate the changes you will make to your partner so you can be on the same page about them.


Changing your own behaviors is easier than changing someone else's.
Work towards dropping negative behaviors or angry reactions and replace them with calm and constructive responses.
Carefully and honestly examine any personal problems that might be affecting your marriage and work to address them.

, Lack of commitment is one of the most common reasons cited for divorce. Finding a reason to stay committed and being dedicated to making your marriage work can help make your bond stronger. Try to establish and maintain a sense of “we” that you can both work towards building and strengthening.Remember good times and focus on those aspects.
Plan and discuss your dreams for your future together.
Commitment should come from both partners.

Marriage counselors may also by found by searching for “couples therapy”.
Marriage counseling is a form of psychotherapy done by a licensed therapist.
In some cases, marriage counseling can be done with only one of the partners present.

Pick a gift that is made of wax.,
Choose silver hollowware.,
Embrace the meaning.",How to Buy a 16th Year Wedding Anniversary Gift1," Each wedding anniversary has a theme. You can find lists of these themes online. Some people say the 16th doesn't have a traditional theme, but others say it's wax.


For example, the first anniversary is traditionally paper. The second is cotton, the third is leather, the fourth is fruit or flowers, the fifth is wood, the sixth is sugar or iron.
The seventh is wool or copper, the eighth is bronze or pottery, the ninth is pottery or willow, the 10th is tin or aluminum, the 11th is steel, the 12th is silk or linen, the 13th is lace, the 14th is ivory, the 15th is crystal. And, yes, the 16th is wax.
Don’t worry, it gets harder than wax. The 19th anniversary is chili pepper.;
, The traditional anniversary themes get a little goofy. After all, is your significant other really desiring chili pepper? How many people want a gift out of tin? Maybe wax doesn’t sound very romantic (although candles are always nice).


Thus, modern themes have emerged. The modern theme for the 16th wedding anniversary is often described as silver hollowware. Silver hollowware simply means hollow silver.Some gift ideas for silver hollowware are a silver tea set, flask, ice bucket, silver locket, wine goblets, or a fountain pen. You could put flowers in a silver vase.

, Explain it to your significant other so it doesn’t seem like you’re choosing a theme without thought.


Historically, silver meant awareness, clarity, and vision! Silverware can also represent family and connectedness. It can symbolize union because people sit down together when they use it.Don’t feel badly if you decide to mix it up. Instead of silver hollowware, for example, maybe you just go with silver. That’s OK. You could give your significant other a silver dipped flower or just anything with the precious metal.

Determine if there is a problem.,
Recognize this is not just ""what guys do."",
Consider the role of hormones.,
Try not to take it personally.,
Let your husband know when it happens.,
Tell him how it makes you feel.,
Do not accept unreasonable justifications for why your husband does this.,
Decide if this behavior is worth fighting over.,
Bring the relationship into the picture.,
Help your husband to break his habit.,
Seek marriage counseling.,
Seek individual counseling.",How to Get Your Husband to Stop Checking out Other Women," There is a difference between noticing other people, and actively ogling them. Keep in mind that most men check out women’s bodies without even thinking about it and women check out other women’s bodies as well.Try to be as objective as possible about the situation to determine if there really is something to be concerned about.


For example, if your husband is casting a glance around a room and spending as much time looking at the men's suits as he is looking at the women's dresses, then he is not ogling.
If your husband makes a comment that someone looks nice, and his comment is reasonable and not inappropriate (that is, he doesn't say she looks ""hot"" or ""sexy""), it's likely not an issue to worry about. It is normal to notice when people look nice, especially when they go out of their way to dress up or get a new haircut. Consider, if you made a similar observation about a man, would your husband have cause for concern?;
, If your husband is in fact checking out other women-- that is, his gaze is lingering across their breasts, hips, or butt, or he is making inappropriate comments or facial expressions while looking at them, this is not just normal guy behavior.


Keep in mind that it is disrespectful for your husband to ogle other women, especially in your presence.
Some men who ogle women may do so because they were taught that manly men treat women badly. Therefore, it is possible that your husband is just doing what he thinks is expected of him.

, Men have higher levels of testosterone and testosterone controls the male libido, so noticing women’s bodies is something that men are hard-wired to do.Staring, however, is a behavioral habit that can be changed.


Most men who ogle women developed the habit as teenagers, when their hormones were in overdrive. Looking at an attractive woman and feeling a sexual response gives a chemical response in the brain, which reinforces the behavior as pleasurable and contributes to a real habit that is hard to break.Because it is a habit, it might be something that your husband does not even realize he is doing (like nail biting or nose picking). In that case, your husband might become defensive when you point it out, and may even shift the blame to you and accuse you of being jealous, insecure, or overly controlling.
But luckily, because it is a habit, it is also possible for him to stop, provided he wants to stop. The key is to help him recognize when he is doing it and help him develop strategies to alter his behavior.

, It is easy to take it personally when your husband checks out other women, such as by feeling that you must not be attractive enough to keep his attention. But most men who behave this way do it no matter what their wives look like.


Remind yourself that your husband is not looking at other women because of something you did. You should not feel like you have to be more attractive to keep his attention. Your husband’s behavior is a habit and it has nothing to do with your looks or any other qualities.

, In the moment, point out the behavior you find inappropriate. It is possible that he does not realize when he's doing it, but mentioning it will help solidify your concerns.


Simply say something like, ""Do you know that you stare at women? Like right now — did you notice you did that?"" Because you are likely in public when this happens, it is probably not a good time to go into a lengthy discussion about the behavior, but pointing it out when it happens will give you a reference point for later when you can bring it up and discuss it.

, It is crucial that he knows how he is making you feel when he checks out another woman.


Try framing your discussion in terms of ""When you X, I feel Y."" Tell him when he looks at women's bodies or makes inappropriate comments, it makes you feel frustrated, jealous, angry, or disrespected.
Next, tell your husband what he could do differently in the future. For example, you might say: ""When you looked at Janet's breasts today, I felt really embarrassed and disrespected. In the future I would appreciate it if you would try to show more respect for my friends and for me by not staring at them that way."", He may try to justify what he is doing as right, normal, or unavoidable, and he may turn the blame around on you. This is not okay. He might, however, have a perfectly reasonable explanation for noticing another woman, such as ""Oh, I just noticed her unusual dress,"" or something similar.


When people engage in bad behavior and get called on it, it is common for them to gaslight the person that calls them on it. Gaslighting is when someone makes someone else feel like they are imagining the bad behavior, or like they are crazy or overreacting if they are bothered by bad behavior. It's a way of avoiding taking responsibility for behavior.If this happens, try to disengage from the conversation. Once your husband begins to blame you, it can be hard to turn the conversation around to a productive direction.

, If it happened one time, it might be best to drop it, but if it is a recurring behavior or if your spouse blames you by saying you are not attractive enough or too jealous, it might be time to consider marriage counseling.


Reinforce the fact he is making you uncomfortable. You must really show him he is making you uncomfortable to be sure he knows you are serious and that you consider what he is doing is completely and utterly wrong, and hurtful to you.

, If he is still justifying what he is doing, then you need to show him how serious you really are. Tell him that you feel your relationship is threatened by what he does.


In a healthy marriage, neither partner wants to engage in behavior that harms the other person or the marriage. If your husband is dedicated to the marriage and to you as his partner, your seriousness over this particular issue should convey to him that his behavior is unacceptable and that it has to change or else the marriage will suffer.

, If you husband feels like he is checking out other women without even realizing it, then his behavior may be a deeply ingrained habit. You can help your husband to break his habit if he is willing to do so.


One good way to break a habit is to identify the reward that you get out of the habit and find a way to replace that reward with some form of punishment.For example, if your husband feels aroused when he looks at an attractive woman, then you could show him a picture of something ugly or gross as a punishment for checking out another woman.

, If your husband's behavior bothers you and is affecting your marriage, it is time to seek counseling. Often it takes a neutral third party to reinforce that your feelings about this type of behavior are not overreactions, and that this type of behavior is destructive.


If you're a member of a faith based organization, marriage counseling is often available through your church. Try to find a therapist with certification in marriage counseling.
If marriage counseling doesn't help-- that is, if your husband continues to ogle other women and does not want to or try to change-- then you may want to consider a break. You deserve a relationship built on mutual respect.

, Individual counseling may also be helpful for you and for your husband. Talking to a counselor on your own can give you a chance to talk about how your husband’s behavior makes you feel. Your husband may also have some issues that he needs to work out with a professional counselor.


If you can't afford counseling, check out books that can help you to build self-esteem. Consider Brené Brown's The Gifts of Imperfection or Leslie Vernick's The Emotionally Destructive Marriage.

For example, bills, jobs, kids, parents, commitments, and lack of time commonly lead to a decrease in intimacy. However, you will never know for sure what the problem is unless you talk about it. Without asking directly, you will only be guessing about the problem.;
, Life is full of distractions and responsibilities. When you are busy with kids, a job, commitments, and other responsibilities, you may not have time to focus on your marriage. This can lead to a decrease in intimacy. Your marriage should be an important part of your life, not something you push to the side. You should make your marriage an important aspect of your life every day.This means you should consciously choose to work on your marriage and relationship every day. You may need to give up some commitments or push some things to another day so you can make your marriage an important part of your life.
For example, you may order takeout instead of spending an hour in the kitchen cooking a meal, you may tell your children to go play alone for half an hour, or you may decide to not check your work email at home so you can use that time to spend time with your spouse.
Instead of watching television for two hours, you may take a bath with your spouse, sit on the porch and talk, play a game together, or do a shared activity.

, Sometimes, people lose touch with their spouse when they have kids because all their attention goes to their kids. Part of having a healthy family and raising kids is a healthy marriage. You can take some of the time you spend with your children and devote it to your marriage to help improve the family.This doesn’t mean you are neglecting your kids. Having a stress-free, intimate, happy marriage is just as important for your children as your time with them.
For example, on weekends you may encourage your children to play with their siblings or in their room for half an hour to an hour to give you and your spouse time to spend together. Allow your child to go to a slumber party or consider not going to every sports practice in favor of taking that time to work on your relationship with your partner.

Choose a time when you are both alone and not distracted.,
Broach the topic of sex in your marriage.,
Focus on how you can both meet each other’s needs.,
Hear each other out.,
Ask if there are any specific issues or concerns.",How to Deal With Sex Problems in Marriage1," Having a conversation about sexual issues can be difficult and awkward, especially if you are both feeling the lack of sexual chemistry in the bedroom. Don’t spring the conversation on your partner when you’re having dinner at a restaurant or surrounded by friends. Look for a time when you are both alone, in a private space, to bring up the topic.

A good time may be when you are both getting ready for bed, or after you have dinner together at home.;
, A big part of strengthening the sexual relationship between you and your spouse is maintaining open and honest communication between you and your spouse. Bringing up the sexual issues in your marriage will show you are trying to make sex a priority in your relationship, instead of an occasional occurrence.

Perhaps you have grown distant from your spouse or your spouse has grown distant from you. Regardless, be proactive and get the conversation started. Let your spouse know that you realize it’s important to have an intimate connection in a relationship, especially in a marriage.

, Tell your spouse that you realize you have both been unhappy with your love life and that you want to try to do something about it. If your partner responds with, “Well, I’ve heard that before”, don’t take it personally. Instead, ask your partner how you can meet their needs, sexual and otherwise. Discuss what your partner feels is lacking in your sexual relationship and what you feel is lacking, as well.

Often, couples with sexual problems also have other emotional issues that have not been worked out and are hovering over the relationship. You could be lacking sexual chemistry due to boredom in the bedroom, a low sex drive (for you or your partner), a negative body image (for you or your partner), exhaustion due to the stresses of life, or a lack of connection mentally and emotionally.Try to work together to identify possible causes of your lack of sexual chemistry. It can be difficult to talk about issues around sex. But as partners, you owe it to each other to be honest and to share any concerns around intimacy and sex.

, Don’t interrupt your partner when your partner is sharing any feelings or concerns. Focus on listening before you respond or speak.

, Try to get to the root of your issues. Don’t be afraid to be specific about your concerns, as this can lead to solutions to address them.


If your partner brings up a feeling of boredom in the bedroom, think of ways to spice up your usual sex routine. Maybe your partner is feeling exhausted by their workday, or experiencing a negative image of their body. Discuss possible solutions to these issues, like taking less hours at work, going on a vacation just the two of you, or taking up exercise together.

Schedule time to be together every day.,
Plan with your spouse.,
Give each other what you need.",How to Fix a Marriage Lacking Intimacy2," Part of prioritizing your marriage and working on intimacy is spending time together. Your marriage can’t be a priority if you don’t make time for it. Take a look at your daily schedule. Find a block of time each day where you can be with your spouse.You may have to cancel something, rearrange certain responsibilities, or make certain things easier and quicker to make time for your spouse.
For example, you may choose to make a quick, easy dinner so you and your spouse can have half an hour after dinner to spend talking. You may ask your spouse to pick up the kids instead of you, go to the gym in the morning, or move a stack of work to the next day.
Spend at least 15 to 30 minutes together with no electronic devices. Talk to one another about your days. Hold one another. Kiss. Spend this time enjoying each other and connecting.

, You can’t work on increasing the intimacy in your marriage alone. It has to be a joint effort between you and your spouse. When you are figuring out how and when to spend time together, make sure you plan together. Don’t plan it and tell your spouse. Instead, work together. This can also start to increase intimacy.Sit down together with your weekly calendars. Think of times you can squeeze in 15 or 20 minutes to be together. If evenings are bad, consider mornings or lunch dates.
See if close friends or family members would be willing to watch your kids now and then so that you can spend some time alone with your spouse. For example, you could ask your children's grandparents or a friend who has children around the same age.

, Every person needs different things to feel an intimate connection. Some people are more physical, while others are more emotional. You and your spouse should discuss what you need from each other to feel more intimate.For example, you may say, “I need to be touched more, like hand holding, hugs, or your arm around me” or “I need you to be more affectionate. I’d like it if you smiled at me, complimented me, or acted happier to be around me.”
Meeting your spouse where they need you to can help you both get what you need, which will lead to deeper intimacy.

"
"
Plan a getaway.,
Make time for sex.,
Surprise your spouse.,
Include your spouse in your life.,
Try something new.",How to Fix a Marriage Lacking Intimacy3," You and your spouse should plan to take a mini vacation every few months. Take one night where you go camping, get a hotel room, or stay in a bed and breakfast just the two of you. This will help give the two of you some much needed private time to work on physical and emotional intimacy.You should try to spend a weekend away at least a couple of times each year.
If you can’t afford to go away, you can get grandparents or family friends to keep your children for one night so you and your spouse can have your romantic getaway at home.

, Physical intimacy is just as important as emotional intimacy. Sometimes, increasing physical intimacy can help to develop and nurture emotional intimacy. Though it may seem impossible to find time for sex, schedule time for this throughout the week.For example, you may go to bed early or get up early to have sex. You may decide to use the time while the kids are at practice or right after they leave for school to be together.
While being together may not seem romantic if it is scheduled, busy adults don’t always have time for spontaneous romance. Making time to be together, touching each other, and engaging in foreplay will help you not worry about whether it was spontaneous or not.
Try leaving a sexy note on your spouse's pillow, or send a text message to schedule in some intimate time.

, Another way to increase intimacy is to do small things throughout the day that will surprise your spouse and make them feel good. These small things usually take a few seconds to a few minutes and lets your spouse know you are thinking about them.For example, you might send them a text that says, “I love you” or “I miss you.” You can cook dinner if you normally don’t, do the dishes, or wash a few loads of clothes.

, Couples have different interests and friends, and this is perfectly fine. However, if you are trying to build intimacy, you may want to start including your spouse in things you like to do. Ask them to come along with you, to go out with your friends, or to try out an activity you enjoy.For example, if you enjoy fishing, ask your spouse to come with you. Even if they don’t fish, they can sit with you and you can talk, or they can read a book and you can enjoy being together. If you like to be active, you may ask your spouse to go hiking with you or to play a sport at the park.
If you go out with your friends to watch a game or for a weekly taco night, invite your spouse to come along.

, If you are struggling in your time together to find things to talk about or feeling comfortable around one another, work on getting out of your rut. Try to do something new together. It can be anything, as long as you are doing it together.For example, you may try taking a cooking or painting class, learning a skill like a foreign language or sewing, or going to play trivia. The idea is to do something together that will increase your communication and intimacy.

"
"
Listen to your spouse.,
Talk about important things.,
Seek counseling.",How to Fix a Marriage Lacking Intimacy4," During those daily discussions, you shouldn’t just talk and tune out. When your partner is talking, really listen. Get to know them again. Listen to their worries, concerns, frustrations, and joys. Building intimacy means sharing thoughts with each other and caring about what your spouse says and thinks.Be an active listener by restating what your spouse says or summarizing what they've told you. You may say, ""So, you're saying that..."" or ""Let me see if I understand this correctly...""
Prompt your spouse to continue by using short, one-word responses. For example, you may make noises of understanding or encourage, or ask questions like, ""How?"" or ""Oh?"" or ""And then what happened?""
Address their feelings by saying things like, ""It seems like you're feeling upset/scared/anxious/depressed/happy"" or ""I am glad you trusted me enough to share this with me.""
Maintain eye contact while your spouse talks. Don’t think about other things, like what you need to do or what you want for dinner. Keep your attention focused on your spouse., While sharing pieces of your day and talking about random things helps increase intimacy, it is also important to discuss more important things. This may include deeper questions on a personal or philosophical level. These questions get deeper into the way your spouse thinks and why they think that way.For example, you may ask your partner why they love travel so much, why they need to do something a certain way, or where they learned a habit from. Ask them about how their background and childhood has influenced the way they view the world.
Talk to your partner about their goals and dreams. You may have done this when you first got married, but what people want changes over the years. Talk about why you both want from life based on where you are right now.
You may say, ""When we first got together, you loved to travel. Where would you like to go? Why do you want to go there? I'm interested in knowing this about you."" You may also try, ""You've always been very punctual and insistent about not being late. Why is this so important to you? Have you always been like this?"" Ask your spouse, ""Did your childhood influence your political/religious/moral beliefs?"" or ""What are your goals and dreams? We haven't discussed them in a long time, and I really want to know what is important to you now.""

, If you and your partner are struggling to build intimacy despite working on it, you may want to see a marriage counselor. They can help you learn communication skills and work through issues that may be impeding your progress.


A marriage counselor can provide you with couples exercises that will help you work on emotional and physical intimacy. This can help if you aren’t sure where to start building intimacy or if one of you disagrees that there are intimacy problems.

Set the mood.,
Turn off any distractions.,
Experiment with novelty.,
Be open about your preferences.,
Show, rather than tell.,
Schedule sex dates.",How to Deal With Sex Problems in Marriage2," This could be staging a romantic evening at home, with candles, a massage, and rose petals. Or it could mean thinking of a situation in the past where you were both turned on and feeling sexually connected. During these moments, were you taking more time for foreplay? Were you having sex in different positions, times of day, or locations? Try to create a situation where you were both turned on in the past and may be turned on now.

Some couples find it difficult to have sex after having children. If you cannot recreate some of the past situations where you were both sexual due to your current commitments, focus on adjusting your daily schedule to make time. Ask your in laws to take the kids for the night, or plan a weekend getaway, just the two of you. Though it may not be exactly how it was in the past, you can still create moments now where you both are in the mood.

, Agree to charge your cellphones on the kitchen counter and leave your laptops in the living room. Reclaim your bedroom for the two of you to be intimate together, rather than text messaging or email. Eliminate distractions that may be coming between you and your partner, especially in the bedroom.

, Boredom is one of the major causes of sexual issues between married couples, especially when you both tend to fall into a routine or the usual go to positions in the bedroom. Discuss more adventurous positions or elements and be willing to try things you both haven’t done before to see if you both find them enjoyable. Don’t be afraid to experiment together.

This could be as simple as taking a hot bath together, or a long massage with scented oils in bed. Sexy lingerie can also be a simple, but effective way to surprise your partner.
You both may be interested in certain kinds of touching, different sexual positions, or integrating sex toys into your sexual routine. Look up positions or toys online, or go to a sex shop together and have fun browsing. Keep the experimentation fun and light.

, Rather than be embarrassed by your sexual desires, focus on being open and honest about what you prefer. Let your spouse know what you’re interested in doing, or trying, so you can both work together to create a healthy sexual relationship.

Use action-oriented terms and be specific. Rather than tell your partner, “I’d prefer we ‘make love’, rather than ‘have sex’”, describe what “making love” means to you. This could be something like, “I’d like us to spend more time kissing and touching”, or “I like it when you touch my hair or touch me lightly on my face.” It may seem strange to be so specific about your sexual needs, but the more detail you provide your partner, the more your partner can respond in kind.

, It can be difficult to put into words the things that turn you on. Offer a “hands-on” demonstration and show your spouse what you like. Chances are, it will be clear very quickly what turns you on, and your spouse will be able to follow your lead.

Take turns showing each other how you like to be turned on. Be generous towards your spouse and focus on pleasing them. Your spouse should then do the same for you.
If the prospect of showing your partner what you like seems uncomfortable, or daunting, get an “improve your sex life” self-help book and read it together at night. It will likely stimulate some great discussions and maybe some laughs.

, Though it may seem formal to schedule in time for sex, this can act as a form of reassurance that you will both make sex a priority. Try scheduling sex dates on a trial basis for six months. Focus on meeting the date and getting together in an intimate way, even if you don’t have sex. This will help you to organize your time around being intimate, rather than trying to fit intimacy into your schedule.

If you find it hard to get in the mood during the scheduled time, start by cuddling together or flirting with each other. Give each other compliments or simply listen to each other’s day while lying in bed. Focus your full attention on your spouse and don’t let distractions get in the way of your sexual chemistry.

Get a medical check up.,
Schedule an appointment with a sex therapist.,
Seek individual therapy.",How to Deal With Sex Problems in Marriage3," Schedule an appointment with your family doctor to rule out physical issues that may be causing your sexual issues. Check if any medications you are taking or any medical conditions you have may be a factor. .


You may want to ask your doctor about possible remedies if you are experiencing a low sex drive or other sexual issues, such as impotency. Your doctor may suggest medication or dietary changes

, A sex therapist is certified to help couples or individuals deal with sexual issues. You may be experiencing performance anxiety or impotency, or you and your partner may be having trouble sticking to a sex schedule or routine. If you and your partner are having issues discussing your sexual problems, or if you have sexual concerns, it may be time to consult a professional.

Most sex therapy sessions are one hour weekly meetings, for four to six months. To find a sex therapist near you, visit the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists; the Society for Sex Therapy and Research, or the American Board of Sexology., You may be working through your own personal problems, like body image issues, or psychological issues, and these may then be affecting your relationship with your spouse. Consider individual therapy, whether it is with a sex therapist or a general therapist. This may help you achieve a healthy self image that can then be channeled into your relationship with your spouse, in the bedroom and elsewhere.

Consider leaving the marriage.",How to Deal With a Narcissistic Husband," Narcissistic people are generally extremely self-centered, thinking only of themselves. They have inflated egos and crave attention and admiration.They are highly self-absorbed and are always looking for ways to be the best or successful. Because of this, the narcissistic husband may not love you as much as you love him. He may care more about his needs and interests while not caring about yours at all.


They lack empathy towards others, unable to put themselves in other people's shoes or understand and care about what other people are experiencing.;
, Narcissists are so obsessed with getting ahead and gaining admiration that they get jealous of other people's accomplishments. This can lead to possessive or even abusive behavior.

, Narcissistic husbands can try to control their spouses by isolating them from friends and family, which forces the spouse to be dependent on the husband. They can also try to control and manipulate their spouse by not showing her affection or attention.Some narcissistic husbands can resort to verbal and emotional abuse. They might make you cry or feel bad as a means of control.They might also resort to tantrums in an effort to control and manipulate their wife.

, Narcissists use lies to manipulate their spouses. They tell half-truths or their highly incorrect version of the truth so they don't have to take responsibility for anything. Many times, the blame gets shifted to the spouse.This is unhealthy for the spouse because they end up with all the blame, responsibility, and guilt.

, Because you are married, you should be able to talk openly and honestly about issues that arise. Remember to keep a level head when you talk to him. Be sure to strike a convincing tone, and explain to him in a non-confrontational way that you are unhappy with the direction your relationship is headed. Avoid accusatory tones and words; narcissists don't deal well with criticism.


Tell him how his selfishness makes you feel. Try saying something like, ""I need to talk to you about your selfish behavior. It hurts me because..."" If you are afraid he is cheating or spending too much time with other women, say, ""You mean so much to me; I hear you talking to her and I'm scared I'm not enough for you."" If your husband says hurtful things, tell him, ""Your opinion means the world to me; when I hear you talk to me that way I feel so small and worthless in your eyes."" Try not to yell angrily at your spouse. Openly discussing your hurt and fears is a more effective communication technique.Think about your husband's reactions and moods on a scale from 1-10. If he is angry or upset at a level of 3 or higher, wait before suggesting therapy. Mentioning it when his emotions are high will be counterproductive.

, Asking questions is a technique that will flatter him because it focuses the conversation on him.


Paraphrase what he tells you to show that you are listening when he talks. This also helps keep him in the center, which may help you move to your concerns later.
Mirror what he says. If your husband says, ""I feel that no one appreciates what I do,"" respond with, ""I know exactly how that feels. That must be very difficult and hurtful."", When pointing out his faults or suggesting a marriage counselor, use ""we"" instead of ""you."" This gives the illusion of a shared responsibility and blame instead of making it seem like all his fault, which may cause a negative reaction in a narcissist.


Instead of saying, ""You hurt me by being selfish,"" say, ""We hurt each other because we sometimes think more about ourselves than each other.""

, Narcissists rarely care about anyone else's needs. To get something you want, make it seem like it's about him.


If you want to go to a friend's house for dinner, don't say, ""I want to go eat dinner with Bob and Julie."" Instead, say, ""They really love you; they'd love to have you at dinner.""Convince your husband that doing things for you reflects well on him. Say something like, ""By helping me clean the garage, you show everyone how good you are at taking care of me."", Many narcissists are violently against the idea of therapy, so you have to think carefully about your wording when suggesting it. Making it seem like a shared problem, that there are things you both can work through, may encourage him to agree to seek counseling with you. Take responsibility for your actions instead of pushing it all on him.


For example, say, ""I'd like to see a therapist to figure out how we can communicate better and enjoy each other's company more. I want to work on ways for us to work better in our relationship so we can both get what we need."" This keeps the tone non-accusatory.
Commit together to attending multiple sessions. This is important because one session will probably not be enough. Instead, shoot for 3-4. Your counselor can help you decide this., Consulting a relative or a friend could help you deal with your husband. They also might be able to tell you how long this problem has been occurring. Has he been like this since he was an adolescent? Or is it a recent development?


Talk to family members or your husband about his past. Are there things in his past you two can work through that might help alleviate this problem?
Ask the friends and relatives what they have done in the past to deal with your husband. They might have more experience than you.

, Men have insecurities too, and sometimes they may make up for it sometimes in disagreeable ways. If the narcissistic tendencies are recent, try to find out what happened that made him start acting like this. Step into his shoes to figure out why he's hurting.


For example, if he's injured, or you've just gotten a recent job, he might feel like he isn't adequate enough. Thus, he may be trying to direct attention to himself.
If your husband says, ""My life isn't where I hoped it would be,"" respond with something like, ""Maybe not, but we have a lot of good things. We can work on the things you aren't happy with."" Then, point out the good things in your life and relationship, then help him make a list of things you can work on together to change.
If your husband has been hurt or injured, tell him, ""Honey, I know you are not quite at 100% right now, but that doesn't make you less of a person/man,"" or ""My new job doesn't affect the way I view you. You provide more than just a paycheck to this relationship.""

, If your husband is willing to change, there might be a way for you two to work through the problems. If your husband is not willing to change, there may not be any hope to make the relationship better.


Talk to him about his behavior and see how he reacts. You can start with being honest, by saying, ""I feel that I am being taken for granted and this relationship is more about you than me."" However, this might not work for serious narcissists. Instead, start the conversation with flattery and make everything about him. Say, ""You are such a great provider and strong presence in this relationship,"" and then go into your concerns carefully., Sometimes, trying to get a narcissist to do things takes a bit of work on your part. Try a reward compromise to encourage him to help you. This helps you change his expectations from him getting everything he wants to him getting what he wants while you get what you want too.


If you want him to mow the lawn, tell him you will do something for him after he mows the lawn. For example, ""If you mow the lawn for me this weekend, I will cook chicken wings and a cake for your poker game next Tuesday."" Make sure the reward is after the task. That way he starts to understand he needs to help you before getting rewarded.

, Your husband is your partner and deserves to feel loved. Giving him attention does not mean feeding his ego. Spend time with him, tell him you love him, decide on activities to do after work or on weekends together. Text each other through the day. This kind of attention should please a narcissist because you are paying attention to him.


Spend half an hour or forty five minutes together each night talking about your days. To make sure he listens to you, say, ""We each can spend half an hour talking about our days,"" or suggest switching back and forth between stories.
When choosing activities on the weekend, frame things where he is the center of attention. If you want to go to the movies, say, ""I know you want to see that new movie, why don't we go see it?"" If you'd like to go on a hike, say, ""You look like you could use some stress relief; let's go for a hike.""

, Remember that large-scale behavior changes always take time. Don't expect an immediate change. Continue to be gentle, compassionate, understanding, and loving.


Set an example of humility to counter his narcissism. Don't be sarcastic or show false humility.
Be honest as you assess his progress. Is he making an honest effort to change? Is he still treating you badly? Is the relationship worth continuing to give so much of yourself to?

, Make a place for yourself in the marriage. Take some control over things, whether it is money, the house, sex, or something else. Narcissistic people often think they are the most important person in the relationship; make sure that your husband knows you are as important to the marriage as he is.


Have humor in some of the situations. If your husband thinks he's perfect, use humor to dispel that notion. Help him see he's not perfect, the best, or the center of the universe. Let him know instead that he's important and that you love him, but other people are important, too.

, Most narcissistic people feel entitled to superior treatment; he might think, ""I deserve special treatment because I make the money and pay the bills."" Nothing gives him the right to treat you or anyone else with disrespect.


Be aware that by confronting your husband a host of other problems may surface. Set a few ground rules and stick to them. Always set a time-out signal; you both may need time to calm down before continuing a discussion. If this doesn't help then go for counseling before it gets worse.

, Narcissistic relationships can negatively impact your confidence. Start building it back. Use that confidence to handle the situations your husband throws you, use it to stay strong when he lies, and use it to stay calm when he may not respond well to your attempts to talk.Find hobbies. Part of gaining confidence in yourself is making yourself feel important and significant. Learn to sew, take a dance class, start running, or start writing. Do something that makes you happy.

, When your husband loses his temper because something doesn't go his way, remember this is just a way to control you. Walk away, leave the room, leave the house, or roll your eyes. This lessens his power over you, which empowers you instead.

, You will need a support system since your husband is not giving it to you. This system can consist of friends, family, or mental health professionals. They can help you stay confident, strong, and feeling worthwhile., If the relationship has gotten to the point where it is abusive, more than you can handle, or detrimental to your emotional and mental health, it might be time to separate or get a divorce.


Be assertive if you want to a divorce. When talking to legal counsel, refrain from getting emotional. More than likely, the narcissist will be emotional, so you want to present a collected persona. Present the facts as you explain your husband's behavior without being angry or holding back. Be honest and factual.
Present patterns of behavior. Be careful calling your husband a narcissist because the legal counsel may not know what that means. Instead, show the lawyers his narcissistic behavior."

Seek outside support.",How to Deal with Your Spouse Remaining Involved with Previous Stepkids," It's sometimes uncertain what role the new spouse will play in the life of stepchildren. There are often different intentions and expectations between spouses in regards to stepchildren. You may, for example, feel it's appropriate for you to play a minimal role in stepchildren's lives, as you have no personal connection with them. Your spouse, however, may expect you to commit more to their stepchildren.Early on, talk over what role, if any, you should have in your spouse's stepchildren's lives. Your spouse may want to have contact with them on their own and not expect you to join. However, your spouse may want you to make an effort to get to know their stepchildren.
If you have different expectations or intentions, talk it out. Try to find a middle ground. For example, you don't want to be involved at all, but your spouse wants you very involved. Maybe you could agree to spending time with the stepchildren once in awhile, but having your spouse prioritize their relationship with them more.
These sets of relationships can become complicated. If you can't come to an agreement, it's a good idea to talk things over with a therapist.;
, Think about who you will be to the stepchildren. Will you be a friend, a parental figure, a mentor? The answer to this question often depends on the role the stepchildren play in your family.In some cases, someone may have partial custody of their stepchildren. If they officially adopted stepchildren during their previous marriage, the stepchildren may be at your home for long periods. In this case, you may want to adopt a parental role. This may mean being willing to enforce rules and set boundaries.
However, sometimes stepchildren remain close to stepparents, but there are no legally binding relationships in place. Your spouse may simply see their stepchildren on occasion, as they have remained close despite a divorce. In this case, you may play a different role in their lives. You can interact with the children more like a friendly adult figure than a parental figure.

, If your spouse wants you to get to know their stepchildren, be willing to do so. Prioritize spending time together as a family. Try to get to know the stepchildren better and strengthen your bond.Spend real time together. You may be tempted to do something fun every time the stepchildren are over, but going to a theme park each time you interact won't help you get to know the stepkids better.
Instead, try to do low-key things with the stepchildren. For example, have dinner together or have a family game night.

, The role you play as a spouse to a stepparent is complicated. They are not your spouse's children, so you are not necessarily expected to be another parental figure. In fact, the children's parents may expect certain boundaries from you. Be respectful of this.Talk to your spouse about what they want from you. They may want you to be polite to the stepchildren, and join them on get togethers on occasion, but not to get too deeply involved. You may not be welcome to, for example, give the stepchildren advise or discipline the children when they've over.
You should also keep in mind what the children's parents want. Make sure your spouse knows any rules or boundaries the children's parents have set. They may not be comfortable with an adult they do not know engaging with their kids a lot.

, You cannot expect to get close with stepkids overnight. Children are often devastated by divorces and breakups, and may be unwelcoming to a new partner at first. Try to be understanding of this and not to take children initially being cold or even rude personally. Accept it's going to take time for the children to get used to you as a new person in their lives, and that you may have an evolving role over time., It can be frustrating dealing with a spouse's stepchildren, as the bond is something you may not personally understand. You may have certain expectations that are unreasonable. This can contribute to bad feelings and negative reactions. Examine your expectations and consider whether they're fair.When your spouse does not meet an expectation, pause and evaluate that expectation. Were you being fair? Did your spouse know you had that expectation? Can you let go of these kinds of expectations?
For example, maybe your spouse took their stepkids to the zoo without inviting your children. You expected them to do so, but pause and think about this. Maybe your spouse is not ready to have their stepkids meet your children. Maybe they just wanted to spend one-on-one time with their stepchildren. It may not be fair for you to expect your spouse to work on your timeline. You may not be able to always expect your children will be included, as your spouse's time with their stepchildren is valuable to them.

, Stepchildren may not initially welcome a new spouse. Try to see things from their perspective. It may be difficult to process a shifting relationship, and your stepchildren may be confused, upset, and hurt by your partner's sudden absence. Try to accept stepchildren can have a strong bond with their stepparents, and may still want time with their former stepparent. Allow your partner and their stepchildren to have this space., In blended families, resentments are unfortunately common. You may be resentful of the time the stepchildren take, or the fact your spouse remains in contact with their ex. Try to release what resentments you can. You do not want them to interfere with your relationship with your spouse or your potential relationship with your spouse's stepchildren.Try to compartmentalize all your frustrations. Think about times where you've felt left out, angry, or frustrated. You should also think about times when you did not act your best in the relationship.
Imagine yourself putting all those negative moments and emotions in a box. Then, imagine yourself closing the box and walking away from the negativity.
However, this may not work 100% of the time. If you're unable to let go of a resentment or frustration despite trying, you should talk it out. It's better to address major resentments head on rather than letting them linger.

, You may find you get along better with one stepchild than another. You may simply have more in common with certain stepchildren or one stepchild may be older and better behaved. Despite your personal feelings about the situation, try to avoid favoring any of the children.You should also be aware you may have a tendency to lavish affection or gifts on stepchildren to overcompensate if you have kids of your own. This will only make your children feel resentful of the stepchildren, so avoid doing so.

, If a conflict arises, pause and take a step back. Try to look at a conflict from an objective place. See if you can see a solution by removing yourself from the conflict.For example, your spouse is fighting with their ex about spending a weekend with the stepkids. Your spouse wants your support.
Try to take a step back. How would you feel if you were your partner's ex? Maybe you would not be comfortable with your ex's new spouse making demands regarding your children. It may not be a good idea to stand by your spouse in this case.

, After evaluating the situation, let your spouse know how you feel. Tell them that you've thought things over, and this is how you think the two of you should proceed. Be willing to listen to your partner's perspective as well and compromise if necessary.Explain any frustrations and concerns you have. For example, ""I'm just not comfortable getting in between your argument with your ex-wife. I wouldn't want my ex's new spouse weighing in on how I feel about my kids.""

, With stepchildren, there are often many adults involved in the decision making. In addition to your spouse, the children's biological parents will want a say. If the children have other stepparents, they also may play a role in conflict resolution. Make sure everyone has a chance to express themselves.Try to propose getting everyone involved in a conflict together at a neutral location to talk things over. Make sure everyone feels they can express themselves and their concerns openly. This may be difficult or cumbersome, but do the best you can.

, A therapist or support group can help if managing stepchildren poses a continued conflict. A family therapist can help you find ways to best integrate stepkids into your family. You can also turn to support groups, online or in your local community, for people from blended families.You can find a therapist online, through your insurance, or through a referral from your regular doctor. Look for someone with experience in stepfamilies if possible.

Confront problems in the relationship.,
Trust yourself and your feelings.,
Determine if your feelings are resentment.,
Accept that dealing with resentment may mean temporary conflict.",How to Deal with Resentment in a Marriage1," Often, resentment forms when a couple doesn’t discuss problems. This leads to the problem festering until one or both partners are angry and full of toxic thoughts. Instead of ending the marriage, you and your partner should discuss the problems that form so you can get them out in the open and work through them.When you feel angry or hurt at your spouse, tell them. Bring up the problem instead of letting it fester into resentment.
You may say, “I feel angry about something. I’d like to discuss it with you so it doesn’t become a huge problem in our marriage.”;
, Some people don’t bring up their feelings because they don’t trust that their feelings are valid. They may think they are overreacting or being too sensitive. This is not true. Your feelings are valid, even negative ones like hurt, disappointment, and anger. Allow yourself to feel these things so you can voice them to your partner.Remember that you are half of the marriage. Your feelings, even those of resentment, are just as important as your spouse’s feelings.

, Some people in a marriage think that they are falling out of love with their spouse when actually they feel resentment. This resentment can make you angry at the other person, not want to be around the other person, or think there are no feelings of love anymore.To determine if you are feeling resentment, take an honest assessment of your feelings. Are there things that your partner has done that have lead you to feel unappreciated, disappointed, angry, or hurt? Are there problems in your relationship that you haven’t discussed? If the answer to these questions is yes, you may feel resentment.

, Many people don’t bring up problems or deal with feelings of resentment because they don’t like conflict in their marriage. They want to do anything to avoid fighting with their significant other, and instead remain quiet to keep the peace. This action leads to resentment. While you may have minor conflict in the marriage for a few hours or days, facing the problems causing the resentment is healthier in the long run.If you have been avoiding saying anything because you don’t want conflict, think about your relationship as it is not with the resentment. Resentment doesn’t lead to a good marriage. A bit of uncomfortable conflict, or even some angry feelings, is worth getting through the resentment and saving the marriage.

However, try not to let it upset you too much. Anger and hurt can have negative effects on your mental and physical health.You’re already dealing with a lot of stress because of the nagging. Try not to let it harm you further. Stress can cause headaches, increased heart rate, and hyperventilating.
Take five deep breaths, slowly breathing in and out. This will help calm you.
After you leave the situation, try listening to soothing music or taking a hot shower.;
, Nagging can sometimes feel unbearable. If your wife simply will not stop being negative towards you, you should feel free to walk away. No one has the right to try to make you feel bad about yourself.Make it clear that you are finished with this interaction. You can say, “I am going to take a walk to calm down. Your words are hurtful.”

, When you are dealing with constant nagging, it is important that you recognize how you are feeling. Repressing your emotions will likely only make you feel worse. Instead, work on being open about how you are feeling. Some common emotions are:Anger
Frustration
Worry
Self-doubt

, Working to protect your emotional health is important. When the nagging is causing you a lot of stress, remember to take some time for self-care. Self-care is the act of treating yourself kindly and allowing yourself to take a break.Spend some time outside. Take a hike or catch a baseball game.
Treat yourself to your favorite food.
Take time to go catch a movie you’ve been wanting to see.

, It’s not healthy to keep your emotions bottled up. That can lead to even more frustration and anger. Instead, give yourself permission to voice your feelings. This can help give you some relief.Get together with a trusted friend and tell them that you need to talk.
Try writing in a journal. It can be cathartic to write down how you’re feeling.

, No one likes to be nagged. But which part of nagging is bothering you the most? Is it the requests or the way that they are phrased? Or is it possibly the timing or frequency of the nagging that bothers you the most.?Are you actually mad that your wife asks you to take out the trash? Or are you more upset that she asks you to do it the minute you get home from work?
Once you can clearly articulate the problem, you’ll be better able to address it.

, Your wife might feel defensive if you make demands. Instead of insisting that she immediately change her behavior, try taking a more sympathetic tone.For example, you might offer to meet her halfway on an issue that bothers you.
You could say, “I’ll be happy to take out the trash, but the minute I get home from work is not a good time for me. I’ll start taking it out in the morning instead.”

, When you are feeling stressed, it can be easy to allow yourself to become argumentative. Try to avoid this, and have a productive conversation with your wife instead. Make sure to clearly state how you are feeling and why.Use “I” statements to avoid casting blame.
Try saying, “I feel stressed when you ask me several times to do one thing.”

, If your wife doesn’t see your point of view, you might feel discouraged. However, it is important that you stand your ground. Remind yourself that you count and that your feelings matter.Tell yourself that no one has the right to discount your emotions. Even if your wife doesn’t see your point of view, your feelings are valid.

, The best way to understand your wife’s point of view is to listen to what she is saying. Take some time to work on bettering your communication. This includes practicing your active listening skills.Show that you are listening by maintaining eye contact and making gestures such as nodding.
You can also indicate your interest by paraphrasing. For instance, “I hear you saying that you feel I don’t help out enough around the house.”

, You need to have an open and honest conversation about your wife’s behavior. During this conversation, try to find common ground. You might find that you are actually both frustrated by the same things.You could say, “I agree that we’re not really working together on household chores. How could we create a more fair division of labor? I’m feeling really put upon lately.”

, The nagging might be a serious problem for you. But remember, there are lots of things you love about your wife, too. Reconnect with each other by being affectionate.Take time each day to hug your wife.
Be affectionate by rubbing her shoulders while you watch TV.

, If you are constantly dealing with nagging, you’ve probably asked your wife repeatedly to stop. She might seem to be listening and even agree to your requests. But it’s important to realize that that is not the same as actually being heard. Being heard means that your wife is taking in what you are saying, understanding it, and acting on it.If your wife continues this behavior, she’s clearly not hearing what you are saying. Make your emotions clear.
Try saying, “I have explained to you that I feel hurt, angry, and frustrated. I feel that you are not hearing me, because you continue to nag me, even though it hurts. I need you to understand my point of view.”

, Sometimes couples hit a rough patch. If your efforts at fixing the problem don’t seem to be working, you might want to consider some outside help. Counseling can be a great way for couples to learn new ways to communicate.Ask your wife if she is willing to attend counseling with you. That way, you can work on solving the problem together.
If she doesn’t want to go, you can go on your own. You can still get help processing your emotions.

, It is important that you get some kind of resolution. It is not fair for you to have to live with all of these negative emotions. If your wife does not changer her behavior, you need to keep revisiting the issue.Make it clear that you are not going to let the matter drop.
Try saying, “I know we just talked about this last week, but I haven’t seen any positive changes. I need you to realize how hurtful you are being.”

, If your wife simply won’t stop, you have every right to demand some sort of resolution. If you have tried to communicate and maybe even tried counseling, it might be time to make a firm demand.Think about whether the nagging is a deal breaker for you. If it’s not, you can keep trying to make your wife hear you.
If you just can’t take it anymore, make that clear. Try saying, “I can’t continue to live with this stress. If you can’t make some immediate changes, I’m going to have to consider taking some time off from our relationship.”

, Take a minute to put yourself in your wife’s shoes. Is she really that upset about the trash? Or is it possible that she is upset about a bigger issue? Many times, people will fixate on a smaller issue to hide their anxiety about something major.It’s possible that your wife feels like you aren’t actually hearing her when she speaks. This might cause her to keep harping about the trash, when really she is needing you to acknowledge her words.

, It’s possible that your wife needs some more attention from you. It is also possible that she is having trouble voicing her emotions. Take a minute to consider what she’s nagging you about.Is she constantly demanding that you make a point to come home from work earlier? Although unpleasant, this might actually be her way of saying she needs to spend more time with you.
Try spending a little more quality time with her. Take some time to sit and talk at least once a week. You might find that the nagging stops.

, If you have a feeling that your wife’s nagging isn’t actually about taking out the trash, take some time to consider what the issue really is. Then figure out how to put that into words. Ask her if you can talk, and then work towards resolving the issue.You might say, “I hear you saying I’m always too busy to take out the trash. Is it possible that you feel I’m too busy to make time for you?”
You can also re-frame the issue by explaining your side. You could state, “I know if feels like I ignore your requests. But actually, I’d rather take time to chat with you than do chores right when I walk in the door.”

, When your wife is nagging you, it is natural to focus on the negatives. You might find her irritating or annoying, or even mean. Try to combat these feelings by thinking about her intentions. You may find that she really has your best interests at heart.For example, maybe your wife constantly nags you to go to the gym. Take a moment to understand that she probably just cares about your physical health.

Listen to your partner’s concerns.,
Seek professional help.,
Use only “I” statements.",How to Deal with Resentment in a Marriage2," Part of dealing with resentment is listening to your partner. You can’t deal with resentment and the issues that lead to the resentment if you don’t listen to each other’s problems and feelings. Though it may be hard to hear, take a step back and objectively listen to what your partner has to say.Listening to your partner, even if you feel resentment also, helps you work through the problems and reach a solution. Refusing to listen leads to more resentment, and can eventually lead to the end of the marriage.

Forgive.,
Let go of your resentment.,
Use cognitive behavioral techniques.,
Propose solutions to the problem.,
Find time for physical connection.",How to Deal with Resentment in a Marriage3," Resentment happens when you don’t forgive what someone has done to you. To help move on past the resentment, you must forgive your spouse for what they have done. This helps you both move forward and repair the damage caused by the resentment.Forgiving someone means that you acknowledge a wrong was done, but then you don’t let it control your emotions and relationship. You accept the person was wrong, apologized, or didn’t mean to hurt you.
Sometimes, people are unable to forgive because they want to feel right and be validated. This can impede your ability to heal and move on.
Make sure that you have actually asked for help before getting angry at your partner for not helping.

, A series of hurts becomes resentment when you hold on to the wrongs and keep replaying it over and over in your mind. This lets it fester and become toxic. To deal with the resentment and move forward, you have to let go of the destructive feelings.To let go of these feelings, you have to understand that the negative feelings are in the past. They do not control you, your emotions, or your actions. What happens in the present isn’t the same as what happened in the past.

Letting go of the resentment allows you to heal, which is healthy for you. It helps you be able to build and have healthy, loving relationships.

, You can deal with resentment by changing the way you think. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a technique where you change negative thought patterns by replacing them with healthier thoughts.When you notice your resentment, acknowledge it. Then, instead of dwelling on those thoughts, tell yourself, “I will not obsess about this. I will let it go.” Then imagine yourself letting the feelings go, as if they were a balloon or smoke.

, When you sit down to discuss your resentment with your spouse, you should come up with ways to solve the problem or change the behavior. Ask for help if you need it from your spouse. Needing help is a common source of resentment, so ask for it to help resolve the feelings of resentment.You may say, “I need your help with the household chores. I cannot do everything myself. I think we should split up the work more fairly” or “I want you to spend more time with me/the family on the weekends instead of going fishing with your friends.”

, While you are dealing with the resentment in the marriage, don’t shut each other out. You may still be hurt, so you don’t touch each other, hug, kiss, or have sex. This isn’t the answer. Instead, focus on overcoming the resentment by connecting again physically.You may have to consciously hug and kiss when before you would have done it as a natural action.
Have sex with each other every day or two. This can help the two of you come to a better connection and start rebuilding the relationship, even if emotionally you both are still working through the issues—this way you don't create an additional problem.

Agree to share your feelings in the future.,
Prioritize your marriage.,
Identify your resentment triggers.",How to Deal with Resentment in a Marriage4," Things that lead to resentment are usually small things that can be dealt with easily. Once you deal with resentment, make a vow to each other to share your problems, hurts, and concerns with each other.This allows you and your spouse to deal with a small problem before it starts to ruin the relationship.

, Sometimes, resentment comes from not spending enough time together. Life can get hectic, especially when you have kids and demanding careers. To help minimize the resentment and keep it from occurring in the future, you and your spouse need to focus on making your marriage a priority.For example, take one night a week to have a date. You may choose to go out to dinner and movie, have someone watch the kids while you eat dinner together at home, or just curl up on the couch and watch television together.
Spend a few minutes each day talking to one another. Ask about each other’s days and listen while your spouse talks. Make sure to put up all electronic devices when this happens and just focus on each other.

, As you are dealing with your resentment, you should figure out what things cause you to start to feel resentment. This could be feeling hungry, upset, lonely, tired, or stressed out. If you feel these things, you can acknowledge these feelings and then let them go.You might also have triggers about things that your spouse does. This might be certain phrases that your spouse utters, actions your spouse does, things they forget, or ways they treat you.
It would be helpful if you and your spouse worked to identify your own triggers. You could then work on them one by one.

Ask yourself if you think showing love equals deserving love.,
Question if your work ethic makes you feel entitled.,
Look at what you’ve given up for your spouse and family.,
Consider your social group and their impact on your marriage.",How to End Attitudes of Entitlement in Your Marriage1," Entitlement is all about believing that because you do something, you are owed something in return. Do you feel that you care for your spouse a considerable amount and deserve the same amount of love and care in return? If so, you feel entitled to getting exactly what you give.


Hopefully, you put care and love into a relationship because you feel and know it is the right thing to do. If you do it simply so that you’ll get it back, you’ll only end up disappointed. This mentality will likely result in you feeling what you get back is inadequate compared to what you put in.;
, It’s common and natural to want a “thank you” when you support your family. Perhaps you expect it because you put in long hours at the office every day. Maybe because you take care of the home and the kids, you think you deserve an attitude of gratitude from your spouse.


Feelings of entitlement don’t necessarily just come in the form of wanting a “thank you.” One spouse may believe they deserve presents or even sex because of what they do. Entitlement refers to feeling that you are owed something, no matter what it is. Some spouses take advantage of this and hold it above the other spouse’s head, particularly in the case of sex., You or your spouse may believe that the other is indebted to them because of sacrifices they’ve had to make during the course of your relationship. Sacrifices are inherent in all relationships--marriages, parent-child relationships, and friendships alike. Comparing sacrifices will only lead to resentment and become a burden to your marriage.


If you’ve given up your career to stay home with the kids, you may think your spouse owes you because of this. Perhaps you moved away from your family to be with your spouse. As a result, you may have a sense of entitlement., As hard as it is to swallow, your friends could be contributing to the sense of entitlement felt in your marriage. Like the old saying goes, ""birds of a feather flock together."" It may be time to assess the opinions, ideas, and beliefs of your social group to determine how they are factoring into the imbalance happening in your marital relationship.


For instance, you could be listening to your friends who tell you that your spouse not going above and beyond for an anniversary or birthday is a bad sign. So, you pressure them to spend excess money on an extravagant gift or vacation that you couldn't actually afford.
If the ideals of your friends or acquaintances are impacting your marriage, you may need to learn how to tune out their feedback, or get some distance altogether."

If you allow too much time to pass, the incident will be forgotten and the details will become blurry. Try to sit down with your spouse within a few days of the incident in order to address it while it is still fresh.
Find a calm setting where you two can be alone. Presenting your case in front of friends will make you look wounded and your spouse like a jerk.
Talk with your spouse after he has had time to relax and unwind from work. Wait until the kids are in bed and after you’ve both had a chance to unwind.;
, Don’t take the blame for your spouse's behavior, but try to communicate how you feel in a non-threatening way. Say that you feel sad/upset/hurt when your spouse is condescending towards you.


For example, you might say something like, ""I feel sad when you talk to me in that tone of voice."" Or, ""I feel angry when you undermine my intelligence.""
Avoid saying that your spouse makes you feel a certain way because this phrasing may put your spouse on the defensive., It may be helpful to provide specific examples when you talk to your spouse about his or her behavior. Choose a recent instance and be specific about what was said and done.


For example, you might say, ""Last night during dinner you made a remark that was pretty condescending. You said that it would be a waste of time to try to explain your new project to me because I wouldn't be able to understand.""
Avoid choosing an example where you and/or your spouse were intoxicated, as the details may not be as clear.

, Your spouse might respond to you in condescending ways due to insecurity or a sense of inadequacy.Learning the motivation for your spouses bad behavior can make it easier for you to empathize with your spouse and get your spouse to start behaving in a more respectful manner.


Try asking your spouse to tell you what is really going on by saying something like, ""I feel like you might be upset about something other than me. What is going on?""
For example, if your spouse becomes angry and talks down to you when you ask him or her about work, your spouse may be feeling insecure about his or her ability to perform well. Although your spouse's behavior is still inappropriate, knowing what is really going on behind the condescension may help you figure out a better way of living together.

, Make it clear that condescending behavior is not acceptable and that you will not tolerate it. Stand your ground and do not change your mind if your spouse further belittles you or tries to make light of the situation.


One example of a consequence you could set is to say something like ""if you speak to me in that tone, I will leave the room. If you continue putting me down in front of others, I will take steps to end our relationship.""

, Don't let your spouse's condescension get to you. Next time he is condescending, think about what is funny about the situation. Make a joke or laugh it off by pretending to think that your spouse must be joking. By using humor, your spouse loses some of the power he or she is trying to wield through condescension.The exact humor that you use is highly context specific but it may be best to avoid self-deprecating humor since he is already being condescending and putting you down.

, One way to stop condescending remarks in their tracks is to turn the spotlight onto the person making the comments.To do this, ask questions that are relevant to the context. For example, if your spouse is being condescending about your parenting skills, you might ask ""how would you do it better?"" or ""what is the evidence for doing it the way you would like to?""

, Think back as to whether your spouse has recently become condescending or whether he or she has been condescending your entire relationship. You can do this by asking yourself some questions: Did you originally marry someone who came into the relationship with a condescending attitude, or did it develop later in the marriage? Determining if this is a new behavior or an attitude that he already held can help you figure out how best to handle his inappropriate behavior.


Did your spouse completely change after marriage? Is it possible that you didn’t see your spouse for the person he really is or was he putting on a game face before marriage to seal the deal?
Could a new job be influencing your spouse's behavior? From on-the-job stress to feeling heady about being promoted to a lofty position, job influences can have a powerful impact on even the most unflappable personality.
While this information can help you figure out more about why your partner is being condescending, when you confront your spouse, be sure to keep the conversation focused and on the present., You can get a sense of whether the condescension is motivated by something you may have done by looking at when the condescending remarks are likely to occur. Do they only occur in certain contexts, such as in parenting discussions? Or, are they more widespread? Nailing down a specific time and circumstance will help you determine if your spouse has a trigger behavior or context. However, keep in mind that sometimes people don't know their own motivations for their behaviors, so don't get stuck on this step if it is not helpful for you personally. If your spouse is condescending to you in the context of being around his work colleagues, does the behavior occur in front of the boss, equals or subordinates (or everyone at work)? What kinds of comments are delivered? Does he talk down to you when you try to weigh in on what’s happening at work?
One possibility is that your spouse feels intimidated or even embarrassed by your job and covers up his true feelings with catty, rude remarks. If this is the case, you can focus on addressing his condescending behavior within this specific context.
Do you find that you are always keeping your guard up when you and your spouse are around your family and friends? Or do you feel that you are constantly being “put in your place” by your spouse when around his family and friends?

, In some cases, your spouse has been chronically condescending to the point where the behavior is part of his personality. That said, people aren't always aware of their own behaviors.He may not know that he is behaving inappropriately. Also, if your spouse is overcompensating due to an insecurity, he may be so determined to muster confidence that he may not realize that his behavior is offensive.


Does your spouse continue talking with you after a condescending remark, acting as though nothing happened? If this is the case, he may not be aware that the remarks are rude and inappropriate.
Does your spouse seem to speak to everyone around him in the same manner or are you the only target? A sarcastic person may believe that condescension is just part of “his charm.” He may not realize that instead of being funny, the comments are mean-spirited and hurtful.

, Abuse can take many forms and it is not always easy to spot an abusive person. Some subtle signs of emotional or psychological abuse include:saying things to make you feel guilty
humiliating you on purpose
being extra critical of you
ignoring you
having affairs or flirting with the opposite sex in obvious ways
talking to you in a sarcastic voice or making fun of you
saying “I love you, but…”
trying to control you using isolation, money, or threats
constantly texting or calling you when you are not around

, If your spouse is also emotionally abusive and condescending to your children, you should take extra steps to protect them during this fragile stage of development. To do this, you can: Be extra kind to your children to make up for the abuse that they suffer. Tell them how much you love them and treat them especially well.
Explain to them that when people get angry, they say things that they don't really mean.
Make it clear that what people say about them, even a parent, isn't necessarily true. What matters is how they feel about themselves.
Alert social services to ask for help if the emotional abuse is severe or persistent.
Tell your spouse that he is emotionally abusing the children and that it is not appropriate and that if he doesn't stop you will take steps to end the relationship and get custody of your children.

, Friends and family can offer excellent support and advice during a relationship crisis. Try talking to your friends and family about what has been going on. Ask for suggestions about what to do next or where to get help.


You may even be able to stay with a friend or family member until you can figure things out and find a place of your own. This may be the best thing for you to do. If you have children, then getting them away from an abusive spouse will benefit them as well.

, Tell your spouse you want you both to go to couple's therapy. Couples therapy can be effective at helping you both to change your dysfunctional relationship dynamic.This can be an effective way for you to, in a safe space, make it clear that his condescending behavior is inappropriate and that it needs to change.


To get him to see how important this counseling is to you, consider saying that if he is unwilling to try this, then you will take steps to end the relationship.

Ask your spouse why they feel entitled.,
Talk to your spouse about what they want.,
Seek the help of a therapist.",How to End Attitudes of Entitlement in Your Marriage2," You can speculate all you want, but you’ll never get to the bottom of why your spouse feels they are owed something unless you ask. Understanding why your spouse feels this way may give you insight to their behavior and make you better understand it. The key to getting your other half to open up is to stay respectful and to avoid negative comments about how they feel.


Say to your spouse, “I feel like you believe I owe you something or that you are entitled to a certain behavior or action. Am I right? If so, can you tell me why you think that?” Coming from a positive place that is genuinely concerned about your marriage will encourage your spouse to be forthcoming with their thoughts and how they feel., Learning exactly what your spouse feels they are entitled to can help you understand their feelings. It could be that they just want acknowledgement of their efforts. It may be that they simply want some alone time because of how hard they work. Once you get this out in the open, you may be able to come to an arrangement that makes both of you happy.


You could say, “What do you need that I’m not giving you?” Opening the lines of communication in a way that says you want to help, rather than coming off as defensive or critical, can make your spouse more receptive to talking openly with you., You may feel more comfortable having a third party present when you try to talk to your partner about your or their sense of entitlement. Depending on your partner, they may be more open when a person is around, or they may shut down. You’ll need to take this into consideration if you go with this option.


Don’t make going to a therapist a surprise for your partner. Simply showing up at the office and telling your spouse you’re going to therapy is a surefire way to cause a big fight. Instead, say, “I think we have some entitlement issues we need to work on. We haven’t been able to figure out the root of the problem on our own, so I was hoping you would agree to speak with a therapist and see if they can help us.”"
"
Agree to meet each others’ expectations.,
Let go of selfishness.,
Perform selfless acts of kindness.,
Stop keeping score.,
Compromise.,
Learn to differentiate between entitlement and genuine need.",How to End Attitudes of Entitlement in Your Marriage3," Work out a plan with your partner about how you can both fulfill each other’s needs. However, only do what you feel comfortable with. If your spouse wants you to appreciate them with acts that you don’t want to engage in, speak up and come up with an alternative. Similarly, tell your spouse what you would like done to make you feel appreciated.


Consult with a marriage counselor for help if you are unable to come up with tokens of appreciation that you both feel comfortable with. An outsider looking in may be able to think of something neither of you can, since you are both too involved., If you are the person who believes they are entitled to certain treatment from your spouse, you’ll need to let go of what you feel. It’s understandable to want your spouse to be kind and caring, but to demand that they constantly owe you is inconsiderate and a definite way to end your marriage.


Understand that you aren’t entitled to anything from your spouse. What’s more, only doing things for your spouse because you want them to “owe” you isn’t productive or beneficial to your marriage., If you want the status of your marriage to improve, it's time for you to get off your high horse. Start doing acts of kindness for your spouse for the simple pleasure of serving them—not to get anything in return. Try to incorporate one small way to serve them into each day.


For example, you might ask your spouse, ""Is there anything I can do that would make your day easier?"" You can consider laying out their work clothes, buying them a special treat, or watching what they want on TV. This isn't done to get anything back, but simply to make them smile and feel loved and appreciated.

, A surefire way to spoil the satisfaction in your marriage is by keeping a running tally of who did what for whom. By keeping score, you and/or your partner are welcoming negativity and trust issues into the marriage. If score-keeping is a variable affecting your relationship, make the commitment to let bygones be bygones.


Throw away your tally sheet. Cut your partner some slack and try something new. Instead of keeping up with what they did wrong, search for things that they are doing right. This allows you to create a positive self-fulfilling prophecy in your relationship. You will see more positives, and, as a result, you will experience greater marital satisfaction., Some say that comprise is the secret to a long-lasting relationship. One of the best ways to keep your marriage happy is to simply work out a deal with your spouse. You may not fully agree with what they want, and vice versa. However, putting your pride aside and compromising can help you to both become happy and allow your marriage to become stronger.The best route to successful compromise requires that each person bend a little to make the marriage work. Determine how much an issue means to you and then discuss with your spouse how you can each make sacrifices to meet in the middle.
For instance, you might take turns choosing a restaurant for dinner rather than always making the executive decision. You might get your spouse's input on reasonable punishments for your child instead of making the call on your own.

, The line between what you or your spouse wants (i.e. entitlement) in your marriage versus what is legitimately needed can get murky. It's best to keep an open dialogue with your partner, and an open mind within yourself, to prevent your wants from getting confused with your needs.


A healthy relationship involves positive communication between partners in which they both can safely discuss their opinions, thoughts, feelings, and dreams, respect for one another as individuals, respect for one another's right to privacy, ongoing support and compassion from your partner, and the flexibility to compromise.If any of these staples are missing, your relationship may be in jeopardy. Other desires not listed here may need to be discussed on a case-by-case basis depending on your individual preferences and expectations.

Determine how the marital debt should be paid.,
Agree to payment arrangements for secured debt.,
Deal with joint accounts.,
Separate utility bills.,
Draft an agreement.,
Put it in writing.,
Ask the court for help, if necessary.",How to Pay Bills During a Divorce," Collect all documentation relating to your bills including financial records, tax records, pay slips, credit card bills, checking and savings account records, bank statements, utility bills, insurance records, and other bills. Ensure you have your own copies of these materials. If possible, the documentation should be stored outside the marital home; perhaps at your attorney’s office if you have one. , In general, the debt brought into a marriage by one spouse remains the individual debt of that spouse after divorce proceedings. If the debt is in the name of one spouse only, consider that debt individual debt for purposes of paying bills during a divorce. , Debt that is held in the name of the married parties jointly will be considered marital debt and will need to be divided up during divorce proceedings. , Individual debt, which was incurred solely by one spouse, can easily be dealt with as individual debt that should only be paid by the spouse that incurred the debt during the divorce proceedings.


This type of debt includes debt incurred before marriage, student loan debt, and credit cards used by only one spouse.
However, individual debt that is incurred for the benefit of both parties (regardless if it is in the name of just one spouse), such as utility bills, credit cards used by both spouses, and expenses for the children of the marriage should be considered marital debt. , Unsecured debt is debt that is not tied to property that serves as collateral for the debt such as a car or home. Unsecured marital debt, including jointly held credit cards, should be paid off prior to beginning divorce proceedings, if possible.


If it is not possible to pay off such debt before separating, joint debts should be divided and paid equally through divorce proceedings.
If any debt is incurred on the joint credit accounts by only one spouse after separation, that spouse should be responsible for repayment of that portion of the debt. , The general rule with regard to joint secured debt is that the person who remains in possession of the collateral for the secured debt should be responsible for paying for that debt during divorce proceedings.That is, if a spouse maintains the possession of a car that was purchased during the marriage, that spouse should be assigned with responsibility for paying for that car during the divorce proceedings. , While parties going through a divorce should take some steps to create distance between themselves and their spouse in a financial sense, maintaining some joint accounts to pay joint debt out of might be necessary.


If the payments for utilities or any other joint debt will continue throughout divorce proceedings, it may be necessary to maintain certain joint accounts.
However, it may be necessary to cancel any joint credit or utility accounts to ensure either spouse does not accumulate additional joint debt during the divorce proceedings., If the couple intends to maintain their marital home during the divorce, whether both or just one spouse is living there during the proceedings, the utility bills must also be assigned to the spouses and paid.


In some cases, the couple may decide to split the bills evenly and pay out of a jointly held account, in which each spouse contributes to during the divorce proceedings.
In other cases, utility bills may be divided between the spouses. In other words, for instance, one spouse is assigned to pay the phone bill and electric bill, while the other spouse is assigned to pay the water and cable bill.
In dividing up these bills, consider who is living in the marital home (if only one spouse is remaining in the residence), who is using the utilities, and (if only one spouse is remaining in the residence) whether the other spouse is maintaining another outside residence., Try to come to an agreement with your spouse as how to handle the bills while your divorce is proceeding. This agreement should encompass all of the relevant bills and provide an answer as to who is responsible for paying each of the bills in either or both of your names. , Do not rely on oral communications between you and your spouse when deciding who is responsible for bill payment during divorce proceedings. Make a written list of all the relevant bills and who is responsible for paying them, at what times, and in what amounts. This agreement should be dated and signed by each party.


It is highly advisable to enlist the help of an attorney to come to an amicable decision regarding who is paying what bills during the divorce. An attorney can provide you with more detail on the general rules based on your unique circumstances as well as to point out common practices in the event of a disagreement or to help you and your spouse avoid pitfalls that could lead to trouble in the future based on bill paying during divorce proceedings. , If you are unable to come to an agreement regarding the payment of bills during your divorce either with or without the help of an attorney, you can ask the court to help you.


If you have already started your divorce proceedings in court, you can request a hearing in front of the judge to help determine what the terms of bill paying should before the divorce is final.
If you have not yet gone to court for your divorce, you can file for legal separation and the bill payment details will be an issue before the court and the judge will help you resolve any disputes. The division of bills will be included as a part of your separation agreement. The court can help resolve any disputed issues and the agreement can be filed and legally recognized by the court.
The procedure for filing a legal separation varies from state to state and even within states. For more information on how to proceed with a legal separation, contact your local court clerk’s office and ask for the proper forms to begin the action. "

Approach their perfectionism pragmatically.,

Be patient.,
Accept yourself fully.,
Say when you’re hurt.,
Lessen your reactions.,
Ask yourself if the behavior is abusive.,
Communicate openly.,
Be sensitive to their feelings.,
Compromise.,
Love unconditionally.,
Ask for therapy.",How to Deal with a Perfectionist Spouse," Use labeling and reframing as gentle ways to point out your spouse’s unnecessary perfectionism. Sometimes, perfectionists make their own lives much more difficult than they need to be and may need their rigidity pointed out in a compassionate way. Especially if your spouse is missing out on something fun, point this out to them or make a separate decision on how to handle the situation.For example, say, “We don’t have to have everything done before your family arrives. It’s okay if things are not perfect.”
You can also say, “I know you like it when tasks are completed, but we’ve run out of time and I’d like to spend time with the kids. I’m going to play with them and you’re welcome to join. It seems like perfectionism to want to stay and complete the tasks, but that's okay if that's your choice."";
, A perfectionist may thrive on order and routine. If something is out of the ordinary or comes up unexpectedly, let your spouse know right away. Spontaneity or sudden changes can be upsetting. While you cannot always plan ahead for unexpected circumstances, communicate with your spouse as soon as possible regarding any changes.For example, if a dentist appointment was moved to another date, let your spouse know as soon as possible so that they can make plans.
Get into the habit of sending a text or email as soon as you know there will be a change.

, If your spouse tends to be on the controlling side, set some firm limits. Remind them that you are a separate being and have your own preferences, opinions, and ideas that are valid and worthwhile. Say that you’d prefer a partner over an instructor. If your spouse tends to steamroll you with their opinions or way of doing things, let them gently know that your view is important, too.Say, “That is one way to look at it, but I have a different view I’d like to express.”
You may also consider making a rule that whomever is in charge of doing a job gets to do the job however they like.

, Perfectionist people may feel angry or upset when they fail to meet their expectations. Your perfectionist spouse may become angry with you when you do not meet their standards. Having high standards for all areas of life can be draining, especially when failure is a possibility or actual outcome.However, it’s not your role to handle their upset or dissatisfaction. If your spouse is upset, let them be upset. However, don’t let them take their anger out on you.


Take a break if you need to. Say, “I can tell you’re unhappy so I’ll give you some space.” Or, it may also be helpful to say, ""I know you're disappointed, but no one expects you to be perfect but you.""

, Just as you adjust to living with your perfectionist spouse, they adjust to living with you. Making your marriage successful means being patient with each other and allowing each of you to be who you are. If you have demands for your spouse to compromise, be open to their compromises, too. If your spouse is genuinely making an effort for you, be grateful and patient in their progress.For example, if your spouse is working on spending more time with the family and less time cleaning the house, encourage them when they are present and be patient if there’s an occasional cleaning spree.

, If a perfectionist spouse is critical toward you, make sure you are strong in yourself and your own convictions. Low self-esteem won’t help you stand up to your demanding partner. Work on overcoming any “less-than” thoughts or feelings you may have.Reflect on what your self-esteem was like before this relationship, and whether or not you felt confident about your decisions before someone started challenging them.
If you struggle with self-esteem, work with a therapist to help you improve your self-image. Find a therapist through your insurance provider, a referral from a physician, a local mental health clinic, or from a recommendation from a friend or family member.

, If you feel hurt by your spouse’s words, speak up. Let them know that their harshness or criticism hurt your feelings and you do not wish to be spoken to in that manner. Share your feelings when their behavior or words hurt you so that they can be more sensitive in the future.For example, say, “I know you like it when things go your way. However, it hurts my feelings when you ignore my requests or ideas.”

, Especially if your perfectionist spouse comes at you with an accusation, it’s difficult not to get offended or hurt. However, don’t react in the moment. Give yourself a few minutes to calm down and collect your thoughts. Getting angry or upset at your spouse won’t help you in any way. If you are upset, let your partner know after the fact how they made you feel.Say, “When you criticize the way I wash dishes, it makes me feel angry. I felt hurt by your comment and I don’t want to be spoken to like that.”

, If your spouse’s perfectionism spills onto in ways that control or devalue you, this could be a form of emotional or verbal abuse. While your spouse may have high standards for the marriage, recognize when these standards are a way to exert control over you. If your spouse often puts you down, calls you names, tells you what to wear or how to behave, intentionally embarrasses you, or blames you for their unhealthy behavior, recognize this as emotional abuse.If you don’t do things the way your spouse wants them done, you might fear their aggression or rage. For example, if the bed isn’t made just right, your spouse may berate you or say, “You can’t do anything right!”
If your spouse is abusive, seek help. Talk to someone you trust like a friend, family member, or therapist. You can also call a helpline at 1-800-799-7233 to create a safety plan or talk about the abuse.

, Communication is key in any relationship. Both partners need to feel like they are heard and understood by the other, especially regarding expectations. When your partner speaks, hear them out and listen closely. Ask them to do the same for you. Even if your point of views are different, listen respectfully and give feedback regarding your understanding.For example, restate what they say to show understanding by saying, “So what I hear you saying is…“
Ask questions when you are unclear by saying, “I want to make sure I understand. Is this what you meant?”

, Perfectionists often are sensitive to rejection or the possibility of failure. Perfectionism can lead to emotional unavailability, which makes you feel like your partner is cold and distant. While you may feel outraged at what they say or do, be patient and sensitive to how they feel. Show compassion for the struggles they face and their own problems with self-esteem. Often, failures can deeply affect a perfectionist’s sense of self-worth.If this happens, show kindness and compassion and remind them of their positive attributes and successes.
Try to validate their struggle with words, such as by saying, ""I know how hard you can be on yourself - I'm sorry you struggle so much with that. Is there a way I can help you?"" Avoid telling them to “knock it off” because it is likely that they do not want to live this way.

, If your spouse expects the house to be perfectly clean and all events to be attended on time and to manage all responsibilities at all times, you may need to create some standards that both of you can agree upon. A marriage counselor can help you and your spouse to develop some standards that you will both agree on. If your spouse has expectations for you, create expectations for each other that feel fair and equal for both of you.For example, if your spouse expects you to pick the children up on time each day and then come home and cook a meal, agree on standards for them such as buying groceries and helping the kids with homework each day.

, While it can be difficult at times to be married to a perfectionist, remind yourself of the things you love about your spouse. Every person has their downfalls and shortcomings, including you and your spouse. Even when your spouse is being difficult, remind yourself and your spouse of your love.Write a note to your spouse saying what you love about them. Get in the habit of telling each other what you love about one another daily.

, Whether you think you should see a couples’ counselor or would like your partner to see a therapist, therapy can be a helpful part of getting through marriage difficulties. You may wish to go to therapy with your partner to work out relationship issues or request them to go on their own, depending on what you and your partner think is best.Bring up the issue of therapy gently. Say, “It’s hard being understanding and compromising in my position and this is affecting our relationship. I think a therapist could really help us work through this more effectively.”

Avoid talking about anyone’s character.,
Brainstorm solutions with your partner.,
Practice active listening.,
Consider attending couples counseling.",How to Cope when Your Partner Does Not Defend You to Family1," Discussing your partner's family is a sensitive subject, so you'll want to bring up the topic when your partner is in a receptive mood. Avoid discussing this when they are angry, tired, or stressed. Instead choose a time when you are both in a good mood and relatively relaxed.


It may even be a good idea to have the discussion when you are engaging in a mutual activity side-by-side rather than face-on to alleviate some of the tension. Consider bringing up the topic when you are driving or folding laundry. Say, ""Baby, I've been wanting to talk to you about your family. Sometimes, I feel like they are very judgmental of me, and you don't seem to have my back.""
Also, keep in mind that your partner may need time to process what you have to say, so you might need to break up the discussion into a few conversations over time. Try to be sensitive to your partner’s needs and give them time.;
, Be honest about what is bothering you. Your partner may not realize how their family’s behavior affects you.Use “I” statements to express how you feel. For example, say something like, “I feel frustrated when we spend time with your family because of the things they say to me.”
Try to keep your tone neutral during this conversation, even if you’re frustrated. Your partner might get defensive if you’re visibly angry.
Say something like, “I know you love your mom and she means well, but it really bothers me that she always criticizes the way I’m raising our daughter. I’m starting to dread going to family events because she usually has something negative to say.”

, Often it’s best for your partner to handle issues that arise with their own family. Let them know that you need support from them.You could say, “Next time your mom starts telling me how we should raise Olivia differently, can you step in and defend the parenting decisions we’ve made together? Your support would mean so much to me.”
Avoid blaming them for not supporting you in the past. Try to focus on what you need from them moving forward.

, If you make any kind of personal attacks on your partner’s family, your partner may instinctively jump to their side. Keep everything strictly factual when you make your case. Refer to specific events that have happened, and avoid making character judgments.Similarly, avoid using “always” and “never” statements. These statements are rarely true, and they often lead to an argument.
Remember that your partner loves their family, and it’s natural for them to feel loyal to their family members.

, Your partner knows their family best, and they may have some good insights for how to handle them. Work as a team to come up with some ideas for avoiding conflict and hurt feelings at future family get-togethers.For instance, you and your partner could sit down and evaluate what's happening and how to approach the situation based on the unique personalities of their family members. Perhaps, your partner knows a way to handle a certain family member that could help in your interactions. They might say, ""Aunt Sarah is judgmental of everyone I date. It may be better if we just ignore any comments from her.""
You could even try to come up with some dialogue and rehearse what each of you might say in certain situations. This may make it easier for your partner to step in when you need them.

, Even the most sensitive topics can be navigated more easily when you both practice active listening. This involves listening to understand rather than listening to reply. When your partner is talking, try the following:


Making occasional eye contact
Removing distractions like your cellphone or the television
Displaying open body language (e.g. arms and legs at your side and relaxed)
Asking questions for clarification (e.g. ""Do you mean...?"")
Summarizing their point to ensure you understand (e.g. ""It sounds like you're saying..."")
Waiting until they have finished their message before responding

, If you and your partner are struggling to reach an agreement on how to handle family conflict, couples counseling can help you understand each other better. A good counselor can teach you communication strategies and help you create solutions that work for both of you.You might suggest, ""Sweetie, I can see you are having trouble standing up to your family. I think it would be helpful if we saw a therapist who can help us figure out how to manage this situation. Does that sound good to you?""

Point out how your husband’s help will benefit the family.,
Ask your husband to do specific things.,
Show gratitude for your husband’s contributions.",How to Convince Your Husband to Watch His Kids More1," There are many reasons a man might not spend enough time with his kids. Did he grow up with the attitude that raising children is the mother’s job? Is he afraid to take care of the baby because he thinks he’ll do something wrong? Figuring out the source of your husband’s behavior is the first step towards helping him change it.Talk to your husband about his attitudes towards child-rearing when you’re both in a good mood. Keep your tone friendly, light, and curious. If your husband feels like you’re criticizing him, he may resist opening up to you.
Stick to ""I"" statements when you talk to your husband about the problem. Say something like, “Hey, Mark, do you have a minute? I've noticed that I'm the only one who watches the kids by myself. I was wondering if there’s any particular reason for that.”;
, Communication is key if you want your husband to watch his kids more often. Instead of dropping hints or getting frustrated because your husband doesn’t do things of his own accord, tell him what you need him to do and why.Keep your tone neutral or positive during the conversation to avoid making your husband feel defensive.
Say something like, “I’ve been feeling overwhelmed lately trying to take care of the kids and keep up with my job too. Do you have any ideas about how you could help me?”

, Most of the time, your husband will probably be glad to shoulder some of the childcare burden – he just might not know what exactly to do or why. Give him an incentive to watch the kids more often by telling him about the positive impact it will have.For instance, you might tell him, “The kids really look forward to spending time with you at the park, and I’m less stressed when I can make dinner without trying to keep order in the house at the same time.”

, It may seem obvious to you when the baby needs to be burped or the toddler needs help zipping her coat, but if your husband isn’t used to doing these things, he may not notice. Instead of assuming that his inaction means he doesn’t care about helping you, be direct and ask him to do things when you notice they need to be done.Pay attention to your tone when you ask your husband for help. Keep your tone friendly and upbeat.

, Your husband probably wants to do his best to take care of his kids and make your life easier. Reinforce his positive behavior by thanking him when he takes over watching the kids for you. If you show that you appreciate him, he’ll want to continue doing his part in the future.For instance, your husband changes the baby’s diaper without telling you to do it, so you might say, ""I'm so glad you're such a good dad.""

Separate your relationship from their family.,
Discuss boundaries with your partner.,
Have your partner communicate your family’s boundaries to your partner’s family.,
Maintain your boundaries.",How to Cope when Your Partner Does Not Defend You to Family2," You’re dating or married to your partner, not their whole family. Don’t let problems with your partner’s family members turn into difficulties in your relationship.

If you feel like the conflict is affecting your relationship, take a moment to remember all the things you appreciate about your partner that have nothing to do with their family. Write these down and read over the list now and then.
For example, if you only see your partner's family on holidays and special occasions, you might not fret so much about any tension because you don't have to deal with it all that often.""

, Sit down with your partner and come up with some reasonable limits together. Think about what both of you can do to minimize conflict and maintain family peace.For instance, one of your boundaries might be that your partner’s family members can’t stay the night when they come to visit.
Another boundary might be not allowing the family to factor in on certain couple decisions such as having babies, practicing a certain religion, or deciding where you live.

, Your partner’s family members will need to know about the new rules you and your partner have decided on. Your partner should communicate these boundaries to their family members, and you can both enforce them as needed. Be kind and polite, but firm.However, if someone insults you over the new boundaries, then stand up for yourself.


Make sure your partner’s family knows the reasoning behind your boundaries, too.
You or your partner could say something like, “We’re really glad that you care about us, but we’d rather not discuss our finances anymore. Our decisions about money are personal.”

, You may need to remind your partner’s family about your boundaries now and then. It takes time for people to learn new behaviors when they’ve gotten used to acting a certain way.If your boundaries are violated, you need to reinforce them by saying, ""Remember, we decided that we are not having children, Mom/mother-in-law. Can you please support our decision even if you don't like it?""

Be confident and assertive.,
Talk with your partner’s family.,
Deflect unwanted advice or comments.,
Consider limiting your contact with your partner’s family.",How to Cope when Your Partner Does Not Defend You to Family3," Remember that you’re an adult, too. Dealing with older family members, such as your partner’s parents, can make you feel like a child again, but it shouldn’t. If you feel like you’re being harassed or judged negatively, it’s your right to stand up for yourself.Being assertive doesn’t have to mean being disrespectful. You can stand up for yourself while still being respectful and kind.
For instance, you can assertively say, ""I know you don't understand my culture, but it's important for me and Henry to celebrate this holiday. I respect your beliefs, and I'd appreciate it if you did the same for me.""

, If you’re having trouble with a particular person, try bringing up the issue with them yourself. Taking the initiative to solve the problem will show your maturity, and they may respect you more for speaking up.It’s much better to talk through problems when they happen than to let them go unaddressed for years. Say, ""When you talk over me like that Josie, it makes me feel like I don't have a voice. I'd really appreciate it if you let me finish talking before sharing your opinion.""

, If your partner’s family frequently offers you unsolicited advice or criticism, prepare a few noncommittal responses to redirect the conversation. Practice these responses before you need to use them. This will help you stay calm and collected in the moment.If you’re talking to someone older, a good way to handle unsolicited advice is to respond politely with something like, “How interesting!” or “What a neat story!” For instance, if your partner’s mother tells you that you should feed your kids differently, ask her how she fed her children when they were growing up.
Other good go-to responses include “That’s interesting, I’ll have to try it sometime” and “Thanks for the advice, but we’ve decided to do it this way.”

, If you really can’t resolve your conflicts with your partner’s family, the best course of action might be to limit your contact with them. Skipping family events may be the best way to maintain peace and avoid straining your relationship with your partner.However, if you don’t want to skip family events, then you can also set a time limit for how long you will be there.


Limiting contact is probably a good idea if your partner’s family is outright abusive or disrespectful to you. People who act like this are unlikely to change their behavior.

Avoid criticizing your husband if he makes mistakes.",How to Convince Your Husband to Watch His Kids More2," If you have been the primary caretaker for your kids in the past, your husband may not know how to do things that are second nature to you.


Teach him to give the baby a bottle, braid your daughter’s hair, or cut up carrots for your four-year-old., The idea of taking over solitary childcare duties can be intimidating for someone who isn’t used to doing it. Help your husband get more comfortable watching the kids by having him take care of them when you’re doing housework or reading a book in another part of the house. He’ll feel less nervous knowing you’re just a few rooms away if something goes wrong., If your husband isn’t used to watching the kids, he’ll probably make mistakes with them occasionally. Unless his mistakes could have an impact on the kids’ health or safety, don’t criticize him or step in to take over. Criticism will make him feel discouraged and unhelpful.For instance, if your husband puts the diaper on wrong, you could say in a light-hearted way, ""Sweetie, it's on backwards! No worries, though! I've done it myself a few times!""

"
Divide tasks based on which ones you and your husband like best.,
Consider dividing childcare tasks based on the day of the week.,
Let your husband do things his own way.,
See a counselor.",How to Convince Your Husband to Watch His Kids More3," Make a list of childcare duties with your husband and go over it together. See which ones appeal to both of you most. It’s always easier to get someone to pitch in more when they’re doing a job they like., Compare your schedule to your husband’s. If one of you has a particularly busy day or two every week, see if you can split up childcare duties to prevent those days from being even more hectic.For instance, if your Tuesday and Thursday afternoons consist of taking your oldest son to various extracurricular activities, you might ask your husband to watch the younger children on those afternoons.
Try to be flexible if things come up and work as a team.

, As your husband becomes a pro at taking care of the kids, he’ll probably start doing a few things differently from you. As long as his parenting methods don’t threaten the kids’ well-being or directly conflict with your own parenting philosophy, avoid trying to make him parent exactly like you do.Letting your husband come up with his own childcare methods sends the message that you trust him and respect his parenting abilities.
Safety should always take precedence over feelings, though. For instance, if your husband lets the kids go out to play without coats on a cold day, you should step in and ask him to dress them more warmly.

, If you are having a hard time getting your husband to help out with childcare, or if you are just having a hard time communicating your needs to him, then you might want to see a counselor. A counselor can help you and your husband to communicate more effectively. Don’t wait until the situation escalates. See a counselor for help before it becomes too heated.

Accompany your spouse to the doctor or therapist.,
Research the characteristics of the disease.,
Create a schedule or routine.,
Focus on your strengths as a couple.,
Keep yourself and your family safe.",How to Cope when Your Spouse Has a Chronic Mental Illness1," Joining your spouse at doctor's and visits and therapy can be a great way to gain more insight about the disorder and address any issues that arise. These professionals can help you determine ways to help them cope and provide you with resources for support.Use these visits to ask questions, too. You might ask, ""Are there any lifestyle changes my wife can make to improve her symptoms?""
You might ask the therapist, ""How can I support my spouse while still taking care of myself?"";
, Understanding the hallmarks of the disease and side effects of medication can help you better care for your spouse. You can know what behaviors to expect and watch for, and what kind of support your spouse requires. You can also explain to your family what your spouse is experiencing and how to respond.


Talk with your spouse before speaking with family members. Make sure your spouse is comfortable with you sharing this private information with others.
When talking to your family about the disease, use age-appropriate information. When speaking with your children, use care to prevent them from becoming scared. Let them know in a gentle way what is happening with their parent, and what you can do as a family to help., Structure is important when you’re caring for someone. Keeping a schedule creates a sense of stability and comfort to both the caregiver and the spouse. It helps both of you to know what you need to do, and what is expected.


The schedule can serve as reminder for the patient to take their medicine, go to the doctor, take a shower, go to work, and help with some of the household chores. Writing down a schedule also gets these tasks off your mind, so that you can concentrate and focus on other things.Decide if you want to use a written schedule, such as a large calendar, and post it in your home, or if you'd prefer to go digital, using reminders and timers on your phone and using a shared electronic calendar. Discuss with your spouse what items need to go on the calendar (doctor's visits, therapy appointments, etc.) so that you're not micro-managing your spouse's life. Try using alarms or reminders on your spouse's phone so they take their medication at the right time.

, A chronic mental illness can cause major shifts in the way families and households are run. You might lose the primary breadwinner and take on the role as primary caregiver. One way to adjust to these changes and cope as a couple is to maintain some semblance of who you are as a couple.Use your strengths as a couple to help you through this confusing time. For example, if humor has always been a major bonding factor between you and your spouse, try to maintain some humor. If you always had a standing date night on Thursday, keep it — even if this means watching a movie together on the couch after the kids are asleep.

, Some mental illnesses, like schizophrenia, can cause people to behave dangerously. If you are to take care of your spouse, you must ensure that you and your family are safe. If you are in constant fear, you won’t be able to care for your spouse, or your family the proper way.


If you worry that your life is in danger, call the police or a crisis team. Your spouse may need to be admitted for professional help if you fear that your life or safety is in jeopardy."

Discuss your expectations.,
Tell your spouse why you need more help.,
Offer an incentive.,
Be willing to compromise.,
Practice tough love.,
See a marriage therapist.",How to Convince Your Spouse to Help Around the House1," Talk with your spouse about what “a clean house” means to both of you. Tell them what level of cleanliness you need to feel comfortable, and ask them for their perspective on the issue.Some people naturally have a higher tolerance for messiness than others. A cluttered table that drives you crazy might not even seem like a mess to your spouse.
Keep your tone calm and neutral, even if you’re feeling annoyed with your spouse’s habits. They won’t want to cooperate with you if they feel attacked.;
, Let your spouse know why you’ve been having a hard time taking care of the housework by yourself. Be honest about your feelings, but don’t accuse them of being lazy or not caring about you.You could say something like, “Between working late, driving the kids to soccer practice, and making dinner every night, I’ve been pretty stressed lately. It would really help me feel supported if you helped with a few more things.”
Point out the ways helping will benefit your spouse. For example, say, “You know I’m less grouchy when I’m not stressed, and if you help me out, we’ll have more free time in the evenings.”

, While you don't want to come off as bribing your spouse, they may need more incentive to help out around the house more. Think of ways to motivate your spouse by ""rewarding"" them for their help.

Consider offering them a weekend off after a full-month of doing household chores, a new TV with the money you save from not having to hire a cleaner, or an intimate evening together once a week.
Research shows that when both spouses participate in household duties, their sex life improves. Tell your spouse that you get really turned on when you see them pitching in. Just be sure to actually follow through if you're using intimacy as an incentive. And, never withhold sex simply because your spouse isn't pitching in., Work with your spouse to come up with a standard of cleanliness you can both live with. Don’t push your spouse to adopt your idea of a perfectly clean house. Instead, focus on improving your current situation.For example, you could agree that the den can stay messy as long as the living room gets cleaned more often.

, If your spouse is lazy or stubborn about helping out around the house, you may have to play dirty for a time. Tough love should only be reserved in extreme cases when you have tried everything else. This consists of cutting back or completely stopping the chores you generally do so your spouse learns to feel your pain.For instance, if you have asked your spouse to help out with folding the laundry and they refuse, you might stop washing the clothes. Make sure that the children have the items they need, and then suspend the laundry duties.
If your spouse points out the issue, you might say, ""Since I couldn't get any help folding the laundry, I had to slow down on all the washing until I have time to do everything. If you're willing to help me fold, I'll be happy to wash a load.""

, If your spouse refuses to budge about helping out or refuses to talk to your about the problem, there may be a bigger issue at hand. If you have tried and failed to convince your spouse to help out around the house, it may benefit you to see a marriage counselor.

Such a professional has experience working through marital conflicts. He or she can help you better communicate your needs and get to the bottom of your spouse's stubbornness.

You have the opportunity to create a different dynamic with someone, so go for it. If you felt like you couldn’t talk to your ex-spouse, commit to communicating more effectively now. You are no longer in a rut, so allow yourself to see yourself, relationships, and a potential partner in a new and different light.You don’t have to be the same person you were in the marriage. You can reinvent yourself to be who you want to be. Some people may feel restricted in a bad relationship, and cannot fully express who they are.
If you start to think, “I’ll never find love again” or, “This is too hard,” remember that this doesn’t have to be true. Focus on positive thoughts instead such as, “I can choose the kind of relationship I want to be in” and, “I can find a healthy and loving relationship.”;
, Especially if you felt blindsided by divorce or infidelity, it may be difficult to trust yourself to get back out there again.Give yourself time to recover before going back out into the dating marketplace. Regain your trust in yourself by starting to make decisions on your own and being pleased with the outcome. Start to listen to your gut feeling when it comes to red flags or something (or someone) who doesn’t feel right.


Pay attention to any red flags. Trust your feelings and don’t let a relationship go on longer than it must.

, In order to love others, you must first love yourself. If you struggle with self-esteem or self-worth, sort this out before you open your heart to love. Find the things that are unique to you, whether they be skills or abilities or silly quirks. Find your interests and explore them. You may realize you have a passion for dance or that you love volunteering at an animal shelter. Discover your passions and love the things that fire you up and make you, you.Ask a couple close friends what makes you special. While this may feel awkward or strange to you, listen to what they appreciate about you and take it to heart.

, People that are hopeful are more likely to find love.Even if you’re hesitant, keep a positive attitude and hope for the best. Especially if you came from a difficult relationship, remind yourself that not every relationship has to be difficult or end badly. Keep your head up and tell yourself that it is possible to find love.


Remind yourself of the couples you know who have a happy relationship. There’s no reason you can’t find a happy and loving relationship, too.

, Holding on to the pain of your divorce is not helping you to move forward. Even if your ex has made the divorce difficult, don’t get stuck on their flaws. Let go of their wrongdoings and admit that you’ve not been perfect, either.Emotionally detach from your ex and the relationship. Holding onto any grudges or resentment will not help you move forward.


For example, holding onto the pain of a cheating ex won’t help you move forward. Acknowledge that it hurt you, yet recognize that not all people cheat.
If forgiving your ex is too big an item to ask, then work on accepting the relationship and divorce.

, If you’re waiting to find love or date because you don’t feel like you’re good enough, stop making excuses. You might not feel attractive enough to date or that you make enough money to have a partner. If you look around and think that everyone is more eligible than you, stop comparing yourself right then and there. You have qualities and traits that other people want, and comparing yourself to others will always end in feeling bad about yourself.If you’re dating yet don’t feel satisfied with any partners, recognize that no relationship is perfect, no matter how it looks on the outside. If you want a relationship just like your parent’s or a friend’s, recognize that it’s impossible to replicate and each couple has their differences.

, If you’re holding out on finding love because you want to lose weight or make more money or have a different career, recognize that you are creating obstacles, or perhaps even excuses, for yourself. Don’t hinge your happiness on something in the future for when you can start to feel open to love. Just because you don’t have your ideal job or you’re not at your ideal weight doesn’t mean you don’t deserve to find love.Release the obstacles you’ve created for yourself and say, “I deserve to be happy right now as I am.” You may even consider putting up little signs on the mirrors in your home with affirmations like this written on them.
Some people won’t allow themselves to date if they have a child. Recognize that you deserve to be happy and find love and your happiness can be beneficial for your child.

, Perhaps you hold yourself back from finding love because you’re afraid. Recognize your fear and face it. What is it that makes you afraid? Are you worried about getting hurt again, cheated on, or heart-broken? Journal about your fears and find ways to move forward with your life, despite feeling fearful.Have you conquered your fears before? How did you do it? What makes you think you can do it again?
Many people hesitate to date or fall in love because they fear heartbreak. While heartbreak is difficult, you were strong enough to handle it before and you can get through it again should it happen. Even if you do experience hurt, it doesn’t mean that love isn’t out there for you.
If you find you are completely overcome with fear, then you might consider seeking counseling and working through it. At the very least, it may be a sign that it is too early for you to date.

, To open your heart to love, you have to make an effort to start dating. Go on many or few dates. Resist the urge to tell-all to your date and instead, reveal a bit of yourself at a time. You may overwhelm your date if you talk a lot about your divorce or inexperience with dating.Find singles events, try online dating, and let friends and family members know you’re open to date and meet someone new.

, If you’re starting to date, don’t rush into anything you may regret later. Take small steps and go out your own comfortable pace. If someone isn’t willing to follow your pace, reconsider. And don’t rush into a sexual relationship too quickly, as you may be hurt or disappointed and close yourself off to other potentially great opportunities.Don’t feel pressured to take a relationship faster than you want to. You don’t need to become physically or emotionally intimate before you are ready.
If you’re dating, let your date know that you want to take things slowly. They will either respect you and your wishes or move on.

, Make time for friends and family. If you’re feeling uncertain about entering a new phase of life of dating or opening to love, have people who care about you close to you. Don’t isolate from your support system. Ask questions about dating, love, laugh about your missteps, and discuss your experiences with friends to get some feedback.Surrounding yourself with friends means that you’ll have support from others as you explore new relationships and have people to fall back on.
Get in the habit of making phone calls or getting together with close friends often. Try to have a friends night at least once a month to get together, talk, and have fun.

, Commit to making one simple change and staying with it for 21 days. Making a change to your daily routine can open up new opportunities to meet people. It can also help you see yourself in a new light Commit to having a new experience or trying something that makes you fearful.Cut back your hours at work, attend a yoga class, start painting, or reinvest in an old hobby.
Do something positive for your life that can help open you up to love. Maybe you want to start journaling regularly, meditating, or spending more time outdoors.

, A therapist can help you if you’re feeling shaky about loving someone new. You can learn to improve your self-esteem, discover new coping skills, and talk about your fears in moving forward. Talk about the things that may be difficult to share with friends or family with a therapist.Find a therapist by getting a referral from your physician, calling your insurance provider or your local mental health clinic.

Set up boundaries.,
Make your health a priority.,
Understand it’s not your fault.,
Talk to your spouse about how you feel.,
Take a break.",How to Cope when Your Spouse Has a Chronic Mental Illness2," Taking care of your spouse is likely difficult, and so is taking on the rest of the responsibilities of your household. Since your spouse is sick, these types of responsibilities may become yours by default. But you are allowed to have limits to what you do, and you should share them with your partner.For instance, you can set the rule that you will take care of everything, but only if your partner seeks treatment, takes medication, and does what they need to do to get better. Check in with them regularly to make sure they are following through with their treatment plan and how they feel about it.
Although your spouse is sick, you still deserve the right to take care of yourself and protect your needs as well.

, You can’t take care of others unless you also take care of yourself. Caretakers often put everyone else’s needs above their own, which means they are often neglected. You must make taking care of yourself a priority, or you won’t be able to provide the care your spouse and family need.


This means you must take time to exercise, get enough sleep, and eat properly. You can’t take on these big responsibilities unless you are healthy yourself.Make time to go out with friends or engage in hobbies on your own.

, Your spouse’s mental illness and the effects of them are not your fault. Knowing this is important for your well-being. Any anxiety or depression your spouse feels isn’t related to you — it has to do with their mental illness.


Realizing this can prevent you from blaming yourself. For instance, if your spouse is suicidal, you’ll need to understand that you’re not the cause for those dark feelings; it’s the disease taking over. Knowing this can prevent you from experiencing depression or anxiety yourself., There are times when you’re going to feel frustrated, angry, helpless, and overwhelmed. It’s ok to tell your spouse when you feel this way. Doing so allows them to understand what you’re going through, and can provide the opportunity for you to become closer and work together as a team.


For example, you could say, “I love you and I want to take care of you while this is happening. However, when you close me out and treat me coldly, I feel helpless and angry. How can we work through this together?” Proposing that you want to get through it with each other lets your spouse know that they are not alone and that you want to help. If you are having difficulty processing your feelings, talk to a trusted friend or family member or a therapist, who can help you understand what you're feeling and what you need from your spouse.

, Caring for anyone is stressful and taxing, but especially when it’s your spouse with a mental illness. As such, it’s natural — and important — for you to get a break. Having some alone time or just spending a few hours with a friend can make you feel refreshed and, ultimately, provide better care.


If you can’t leave your spouse alone, enlist the help of a family member or friend to spend time with them so that you can leave. Your spouse may feel anxious about you leaving at first, but you can help them become more secure by initially leaving for small amounts at a time, and then gradually increasing the length."
"
Ask for help.,
Attend a support group.,
Give yourself time to grieve.,
Go to couples’ counseling.",How to Cope when Your Spouse Has a Chronic Mental Illness3," Taking on the responsibility to care for an adult with a mental illness is extremely difficult to do alone. Instead of suffering in silence, ask your friends and family members for help. Doing so can ease some of the burden on you, which can help you to take better care of your spouse.


Ask your friends when you need help with even the simplest of tasks. For instance, you can ask them to pick up groceries for you, shuttle the kids to school or practice, take your spouse to the doctor, or even make dinner for you. Don’t feel bad about asking — they will likely be more than happy to help., You aren’t the only person who is taking care of a mentally ill spouse. Sharing your experience with others can help you feel like you’re not alone when it seems like you’ve got the weight of the world on your shoulders. You may be able to make new friends, or learn coping methods from those who are in the thick of it, just like you.


Ask your spouse’s doctor for names of support groups, or look on the Internet to find a group near you., You may only associate the process of grief with death, but you can actually experience grief at other times, such as when there is a major change in your life. You may need time to grieve your ""old"" life, as well as any future plans or expectations that have been impacted by your spouse's illness and your new role. Allow yourself time to acclimate to your new life.

A therapist may be helpful in guiding you through this process.

, Your spouse’s mental illness and the pressure it has put on you could create a strain in the relationship. If you are committed to making your marriage work, you owe it to yourself to seek help from a counselor. You can use this space as an opportunity to discuss your feelings and the issues that have occurred because of the situation.


You may find that attending therapy alone is more beneficial. Going to a therapist by yourself may make you feel more comfortable talking about the struggles you endure because of your spouse’s sickness."

List important household tasks.,
Assign chores.,
Create a schedule.",How to Convince Your Spouse to Help Around the House2," Write down which areas of the house need the most cleaning and which chores you do most frequently. Get specific about what needs to be done on a daily or weekly basis.For example, don’t just put “clean the kitchen” on your list. Instead, break the task down into washing dishes, wiping down countertops, taking out the trash, and sweeping the floor.

, Using your list, work with your spouse to divide up chores in a way that seems fair to both of you. Take your other responsibilities and your individual preferences into account during this process.For instance, if your spouse likes to cook, it might make sense for them to take over the kitchen duties.

, Agree on specific times when you’ll get your housework done. Don’t just plan to do it whenever you’re free or feel like it. Instead, commit to a schedule so that you’re both accountable for your work."
"
Teach your spouse how to do chores they’re not familiar with.,
Avoid picking up the slack if your spouse doesn’t do their part.,
Make chores as simple as possible.,
Let your spouse see you working.,
Keep your expectations realistic.,
Reward yourself and your spouse for getting things done.",How to Convince Your Spouse to Help Around the House3," Don’t assume your spouse knows how to load the dishwasher or choose the right setting on the washer. Instead, show them how you do it, and let them practice under your guidance before taking over on their own., If your spouse doesn’t uphold their end of your cleaning agreement, don’t do their chores for them. That will only send the message that they can get out of doing housework by “forgetting.”Once your spouse is inconvenienced by their own lack of effort, such as not having any clean clothes, they will probably become more motivated to help out.

, Your spouse will be more likely to lend a hand if cleaning and putting things where they belong is easy. Streamline any chores that are unnecessarily difficult to do, and make sure putting items away is convenient.For instance, if your spouse leaves their clothes on the floor, put a laundry hamper in your room instead of nagging them to bring their laundry downstairs.

, Your spouse may not have an accurate idea of how much work it takes to keep your house clean. Motivate them to pitch in more by doing household chores when they’re around or telling them about all the tasks you accomplished earlier in the day., Don’t criticize your spouse’s efforts around the house, especially while they’re still learning. They may never do chores exactly to your liking, especially if you have very high standards for cleanliness. Instead, focus on appreciating their help.If you really want a particular task done a certain way, it’s probably best to do it yourself.

, Not everyone is motivated by the prospect of having a clean house alone. If your spouse needs some extra incentive to do housework, plan rewards to keep both of you on track.For example, you could plan a nice meal or a fun evening out if you both keep up with your chores all week.

A “soft” problem is less defined and may or may not have a solution, so you should take your time to really evaluate your marriage before ending it over a soft problem.

Hard problems include the three A's: abuse, addiction, and adultery.



 


Soft problems include things like growing apart or no longer feeling the sensation of being ""in love."" These problems usually mask unrecognized problems, like feeling isolated, ignored, or criticized. You need to pinpoint your underlying problems and address them before you can conclude that leaving your wife is the best way to remedy them.;
, Leaving your wife will be a brutal process, even if you manage to separate on fairly amiable terms. If you catch yourself dreaming of an idealistic future and want to leave your wife simply to pursue it, stop right there and reconsider.


For example, if you're thinking of leaving your wife for an old high school sweetheart or a new, exciting lover, there's a high probability that you are treating your new relationship with too much idealism and not looking at the benefits of your current marriage or considering the repercussions that may result from leaving under these conditions., If you have a soft problem, try working things out with your wife. Seek out a marriage counselor and see if there is anything you can do to make your marriage work again before you call it quits.

, Once you are certain that leaving your wife is the best possible option, start the process and don't look back. One of the most important things you need is certainty, so if your decision is sound right now, stick with it and try not to doubt yourself in the future.

, This person should not be your wife or someone whose allegiance lies with your wife over you. Pick a reliable friend or relative, or hire a professional therapist.

A confidant can lend you emotional support throughout the process and guide you objectively when your emotions are clouding your perspective.






Letting someone know also adds a level of safety to the entire process.







, You will need a place to stay after you leave home. If you cannot iron out any long-term plans, at least figure out where you can go on a temporary basis immediately after the separation occurs. The place you pick should be available to you for a few months, at least.

If you plan on staying at a friend's or relative's house, find out in advance how long you can stay there.






If you plan on moving into your own place, begin shopping around for an apartment before you declare your intentions to your wife. If possible, sign the lease on your new place before you officially leave your wife.







, For most situations, “leave” ultimately means “divorce.” Ask yourself if this is what you expect and want to happen, or if a legal separation is a better alternative for the time being.

, Make a list of everything you share with your wife—money, valuables, properties, and so on. Plan out how you think these assets should be split between you after you leave.

If your financial assets are all kept in one place, you have a legal right to half of those finances.






Valuables that are owned by both you and your spouse must be divided equally. Those that are specifically yours, including family heirlooms, can be counted among your goods. For the items you own jointly, make a list of those that you would be fine losing and those that you intend to fight for.






You also need to find out which services are linked and which are separate. Services include things like phone and Internet plans. A service you will no longer use, like the Internet at your house, will become your wife's responsibility. Joined mobile plans will need to be split apart once the divorce or separation begins.







, This includes your marriage certificate and all deeds and titles. Locate the paperwork and make copies. You should store these copies in a secure location outside of your home, especially if you suspect problems during the split.


Look for vital statistics, military records related to benefits, bank statements, insurance policies, social security statements, information regarding retirement accounts, vehicle titles, mortgage statements, loan documents, kids' school records and contact lists, credit card statements, checkbook statements, and stock certificates., If you only have a shared account or if your wife has access to your personal account, open your own private account without her knowledge. Redirect your paychecks so that they are directly deposited into this new account.

Keep an eye on any joint accounts during this time, as well. If your wife is manipulative or emotionally abusive, she may start withdrawing money from those accounts in an attempt to prevent you from leaving.






You can usually withdraw up to half of the money in your joint accounts, but doing so suddenly could alert your wife to the fact that something is amiss.







, If you trust your wife well enough, you may not need to move your personal keepsakes and heirlooms anywhere. If you are anticipating a problem, though, it's a good idea to stealthily remove anything that could be damaged or somehow used against you.


Make sure that any item you remove from the house can legally be defined as belonging to you, as a separate person, rather than to you and your wife. Usually, gifts and inherited valuables belong to an individual instead of a married couple.

, Again, if you expect an amiable enough split, you probably don't need to worry about firearms in the home. If you have any reason to fear for your physical safety or for the safety of your wife, though, you should remove those weapons from the home and place them in a secure spot without your wife's knowledge.


You may not worry about your wife pulling a gun on you, but also keep in mind what she might do to herself after you leave. If there is any chance that your wife might harm herself, you should still remove all of the firearms from the house.

, This is advisable regardless of whether or not your wife is usually an even-tempered woman. Make a spare key for your car, your home, and anything else important. Give these spare keys to a trusted friend or relative.

, This usually won't be necessary, but if your wife has threatened to file a false report of domestic abuse in the past, she just might follow through with that threat once she finds out that you intend to leave her. Let your local law enforcement officials know about any threats made in the past.

Tell the police about her previous threats and about your upcoming talk, and ask them about ways to protect yourself against false reports.






The police may still need to check on a situation when a claim of domestic abuse has been made, but if they have advance warning, they might take that into account when deciding what action to take in regards to that claim.







, Plan out everything you plan to tell your wife before you actually break the news to her. Have a script and memorize it to the best of your ability. You do not need to know every word, but you do need to remember every point.

Keep the focus on your reasons for leaving and on your experience. Avoid accusatory language that pushes the blame on your wife, even if you feel that your wife is largely to blame.






Describe your expectations (separation, divorce), and make sure that you leave room in the conversation for your wife to reply to those expectations with her own thoughts.






Check yourself as you prepare the script. Ask if anything you wrote has been written out of anger or a desire to hurt your wife. If so, remove or revise that portion.







, You will likely need support after you talk things through with your wife. Let your chosen confidant know when you plan on breaking the news and ask him or her to be available to talk afterward.

, Do not spring the news on your wife at random. You need to plan out the day, time, and location. Arrange things with your wife so that she knows to leave the time slot open, but do not tell her before the predetermined time.

Do not surprise your wife with the news before she leaves for work or when you're out at a party or restaurant. Set aside a time when you can talk without restrictions on time or speaking volume.






If you are worried about your physical safety, choose a public place that still offers some degree of privacy, like a park.






Stick with your plan and resist the temptation to blurt everything out ahead of time in a moment of anger or pain.







, Sit down with your wife and calmly go through the script you created earlier. Expect her to be emotional, but try to avoid getting into any screaming matches during the talk. Remain as calm, detached, and objective as possible.


Keep in mind that you should talk with your wife, not at her. Pause during your script to check in with her, making sure that everything is sinking in.
Be focused and consistent. Remember that your talk has a specific purpose. Do not say or do anything that could confuse that purpose during the duration of your talk. You might want to soothe your wife's feelings or get distracted by the good memories you've shared, but doing so will only delay the inevitable and draw things out even longer for both of you.
Avoid arguing over the meaning of words and state things simply, yet as kindly as possible, to improve your odds of being understood.
Try to be understanding if your wife is surprised or hurt by your declaration, but do not back down or feel the need to justify your decision., If you and your wife have kids, figure out how to tell them. Ideally, you and your wife should tell your children together. If you suspect that your wife will attempt to manipulate them, however, you need to sit down with your kids and have a separate talk with them.

Make a script for your kids in the same way you made a script for your wife. Be honest, and make sure that they are not to blame for the separation.






Even if your kids are already adults, you should wait until after you leave before telling them about it.







, After you tell your wife that you're leaving, you need to actually leave. Pack your bags and leave the house that same night, if at all possible.


Staying in the same living space as your wife is asking for trouble. The atmosphere will be more volatile and the two of you will be more likely to snap at each other or do something regrettable.

, Do not drag your feet. You might be tempted to think that you can take your time on the legal proceedings once you are physically separated from your wife, but the longer you procrastinate, the harder it will actually be to make the next move.


Many jurisdictions enact orders that can protect your assets during the divorce process, but these court orders can only come into effect once you file.
There is also some chance that your wife will not take you seriously until she actually has those divorce papers in hand.

, While some exes can eventually become friends again, for right now, you need to cut off all contact that is unrelated to the divorce or separation.


You'll still need to keep in touch with each other to sort out details of the separation, and if you have kids, you will have to deal with each other even more frequently. You need to cut out social calls, though, especially those made on lonely nights when you're craving intimacy.

, The process is difficult, but you can make it through. Turn to loved ones and therapists for emotional support as needed, and consult with a lawyer or law expert for legal support.

, Stop drinking, exercise, read, play sports. Do things that you love, that maybe you didn't have time for before or that your spouse didn't enjoy. This will give you something positive to focus on.

, Horrible hangovers, spending too much money on booze, calling in sick frequently, and wallowing in self-pity are all good reasons to quit drinking. When you get the urge to drink look at your list and remember how far you've come.

, Healthy, alert, energetic. Too much booze can weaken you, making you lethargic and lackluster. No one wants to date a lush. Take care of yourself. You deserve to live a good life!

, Even if your ex has removed all of his/her things from your shared house, it will still be a house of memories. Get out of there. Move into a nice new area, closer to the new friends that you hopefully have made by now.

, Even if it's just to soothe your broken ego. Chances are you won't meet the new love of your life there, but it will show you that there are indeed many more fish in the sea. You'll also see that some of those fish are way nastier than you believe you are, and some of them are way more awesome than you believe your ex was.

, Paint a piece of furniture a colour your ex would've hated. Go somewhere your ex never wanted to. Dye your hair bright red! Do stuff you always wanted to do, but never could because you always had to consider somebody else.

Get back on your feet.",How to Leave Your Husband," Deciding to end your marriage is one of the toughest and most important decisions you'll ever make, so it's important that you're 100% certain that your marriage is really over before you start taking the next steps. If you're on this page, chances are that you've already made up your mind, but here are some reasons that your marriage may really be over:


If you've already basically uncoupled. This means that you and your husband have separate friends, separate interests, don't spend time with each other, and don't really know what's going on in each other's lives.
If your husband is no longer willing to try. If you've repeatedly brought up the problems in your marriage and your husband either promises to change and never does or flat-out refuses to change, then it may be time to leave.
If you're in an abusive relationship, then get out. There are no good reasons to stay in an abusive relationship -- or to prolong your pain. If your relationship is truly abusive, then it may be best to get out ASAP and to figure out the rest once you're safe.
If one or both of you has been repeatedly unfaithful. It's different if one of you has had a fling and has worked hard never to let it happen again -- but if cheating and flings are the status quo in your relationship, then it may be beyond saving.
If you no longer feel like a team. If you have stopped making decisions together, communicating, or compromising, then it may be time to leave.
If you can't agree on whether or not to have kids. If you're dying to have kids but your husband refuses, or vice versa, then there may be no point in continuing the relationship if you can't see eye-to-eye on this important matter.
See if you can make this decision with a cool head. You should not decide to leave your husband in the heat of the moment, but after you've had some time to really think it over.
See if you've tried everything and nothing's worked. If you've tried couples therapy, had many long conversations with your husband, and if both of you have attempted to change your ways but to no avail, then it may be time to leave. But if you've felt dissatisfied for a while and your husband seems to have no idea, it may be worth it to see if you can talk things through first.;
, The steps below can help you make the plans you need to make to leave your husband secretly -- letting him know only as or after you walk out that door. This can be helpful if you're not sure how your husband will react, or if you think he'll try to stop you from leaving. But if you're both open to conversations, if he's very supportive, and if you're always honest and open with each other, then you may just want to talk to him first and see if you can work things out.


You may be surprised by how many of your feelings your husband shares -- or by the lengths he's willing to go to not lose you.
This doesn't mean that you should let your husband convince you to stay. But if you're on the fence and aren't sure if maybe you can really make things work, then talking to him can make a big difference.

, It may be hard, but this step can be vital in many ways. Leaving a marriage can be a volatile situation and staying quiet will allow you the time to prepare and establish yourself before you actually walk out the door. Tell only a few, close people who support your decision. Tell the people who can give you some help and guidance -- not people who can't keep it to themselves.


If you don't want to talk it out with your husband and want to escape a bad situation, then it's better to keep it to yourself so you have time to figure out the details. If your husband knows about your plans and doesn't want you to leave, then he can try to thwart your plans or to make it very difficult for you to get things done.
This may seem sneaky, but your goal should be to leave on the best financial footing. You don't want your husband to get in the way of that.
It may be hard not to act once you've made your decision, but it could take between two to six months to plan an exit strategy that will help you keep your footing financially. Though you may be ready to walk out that door any second, know that it may be better in the long run if you take some time to get organized before you leave.

, This is especially tricky for stay-at-home mothers who may not have outside income, but having some money saved up will help you move forward on a better financial footing. Starting a separate account, even if you don't have much money to put in there, at first, can help get you on the right track. This will make it easier for you to have your own finances sorted out once you do leave your husband.


Taking money from a joint account should be a last resort -- something you do right before you leave.

, If you are leaving the marital home, it is important to find a new place to live. In some cases, temporarily staying with other people can be helpful, but in the long term, you will need to find housing you can afford. This will raise some bigger questions about where you will live -- if you don't have children, it may even be relatively easy for you to move across the country to be closer to your family. Maybe you just want to try something new and want to live in a new climate. Whatever you want to do, having either a plan and a temporary place to stay or even signing a lease at another place can get you closer to your goal.


If you and your husband are really on the same page about the divorce and are comfortable enough with each other to talk about it, then you can talk about who is going to move out of the home you share together. If there are children involved, this can be an even more important question.

, Throughout a marriage, you will accumulate many important documents such as paperwork pertaining to your mortgage, vehicle and retirement plans, among others. Make sure you have a copy of these documents since the property in question could be an issue in the divorce.


If you see many documents that you're sure if you'll need, then you should make a copy of those just in case they end up being important. It's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to getting your paperwork together.
If you really want to make thorough copies of everything, then you may want to hire a professional to make a copy of your home computer's hard drive and even to take photos of certain valuable belongings. This can help you in the future if some money goes ""missing"" during your settlement.

, If you and your husband have children together, then it's important to figure out what's best for them. Do you think your husband is a great (or at least decent) father who will be involved in his children's lives, or do you have reasons to believe your children should have nothing to do with him? This will be one of the biggest decisions you make throughout the process.


Just keep in mind that you can't just decide your children shouldn't see your husband because you don't want to see him anymore. There should be a good reason (like alcohol abuse) to keep him away from his kids.
You should make this decision with an even head, because it will determine many things, such as, potentially, the place where you live, as well as your children's futures.

, A divorce is costly and time consuming, so you may wish to shop around for a price you can afford, especially if you think it will be a drawn out process. Though you may be tempted to save money and to do this yourself, the right lawyer can really help you make the process easier and less painful. You don't want to end up getting embroiled in a financial mess you don't know how to fix just because you didn't want to spend money on a lawyer.


If you really don't have the budget for this, then you can consider hiring a paralegal.

, If you're doing incredibly well financially already, then this is definitely a bonus, but it's important to consider the budget you'll have after you leave your husband. It's important to ask yourself these questions before you walk out the door so you don't feel stumped when the time comes. Unfortunately, studies show that many women have to deal with a 1/4th or even a 1/3rd drop in their standard of living after a divorce; however, don't let this discourage you! If you make a solid plan, you'll work through it. Here are some things you'll have to figure out:


What new expenses will you take on?
Where will you cut back?
How much more will child care cost (if you have children)?
How will you earn the income that you need?

, Alimony or child support could definitely be a part of your future income, but in today's economy, it may not be a guarantee. If you're certain that your husband will pay reliably, that's one thing, but you have to ask yourself if you can really count on your husband.


This can get even trickier if you're the main breadwinner, because then you will be the one paying alimony.

, If you don't have a credit record apart from your spouse, then it's important to get one as soon as you can. You can start by getting a copy of your credit report; you can get at least one free copy a year from each of the three bureaus at AnnoualCreditReport.com. Check it out and look for errors. Then, begin to build your own credit by making wise purchases, making payments on time, and being thoughtful in your money-management.


You may think that you have a strong credit record just because your husband does, but this may not be the case if you have not been very involved in the financial aspect of your lives.

, After you have a better sense of the budget you need to live on, then you have to think about whether or not you need to boost your income to cover it. If you have a well-paying job and plenty of savings, then great -- but if you need to get a job and have spent time out of the work force, or if you need a higher-paying job, then you'll need to make moves in that direction. This doesn't mean you should become CEO of a new company before you leave your husband, but you can make some moves to make it easier to boost your income once you do leave. Here are some things you can do:


Take classes that help you specialize in necessary skills for getting the work you want, whether you need to brush up on your computer skills or to get certified in a specialized form of training.
Buy a new suit so you are interview ready when the time comes.
Get your resume in order. You don't have to send it out before you leave your husband, but you should have it on hand when the time comes. Once you leave, you are likely to feel even more overwhelmed, and you may not have the time or mental strength to do something like update your resume.

, You may choose to start with the smaller, less obvious items or you may decide to do it all in one day. You must determine what the safest approach is for your situation. If you think your husband is going to get violent or threatening if he sees you packing up your things, make a plan to do this when there's little chance he'll be around. Still, though, it's best to have some friends or family members there to help you for your own safety and protection.


It can be helpful to pack when your husband is at work. Even if he supports you in leaving, packing when he's around can be more painful.

, You may have already told your spouse you are leaving or it may come as a complete surprise. Even if you know you have made the right decision, this last step may be the hardest emotionally. Of course, every situation is different. If you and your spouse have been talking about this for months, then it may not come as a shock. If you're in an abusive or threatening situation, then leaving suddenly is your best option.


Whatever your reason for leaving, it's up to you to decide which method of leaving is best -- whether it's a frank and honest conversation or leaving without a note.

, This is not the time to be alone with your worries. After you leave your husband, you should lean on your family, your friends, or even a therapist, as much as you can. This is likely the hardest thing you'll ever have to do, and the pain will be much more manageable if you have the support and love of the people who care about you the most. There's no shame in asking for help.


Though it's important to get some alone time to deal with your feelings, it's equally important to be out and about, to make plans with your friends, and to indulge in long conversations.
Don't be afraid to call up old friends to ask for help or just to chat. They'll understand that you're going through something very difficult and will support you all the way.
Unfortunately, not everyone may be on board with your plan and you may lose some friends or family support in the process. Don't let this stop you from being firm in your decision, and know that your decision can lead you to build new and rewarding friendships.

, This may not happen overnight. You will have to recover both emotionally and financially, and it can take years for you to feel independent and in control of your life again. The important thing is that you know that you are on the path to recovery, and that the decision you made will lead to more happiness in the long run, even if it may not feel that way now. And once you've gotten back on your feet, you can praise yourself for having the strength to decide to leave your husband, and for following through on your ideas.


Though women tend to lose financially after a divorce, this does not keep them from exploring new things they never knew they loved, advancing in their careers, or doing many amazing things that they were not able to do during their marriage. In the long run, you should be able to not only get back on your feet, but to become a stronger, wiser, and more fulfilled person in the process.

Don’t rush into a relationship.Some people have a hard time being single after many years of marriage.,
Try a dating website.,
Ask your friends to introduce you to single women.,
Don’t limit yourself to typical places.,
Meet single parents through your kids.,
Ask out women you’re interested in.",How to Meet Women After a Divorce1," Do not let your desire for a romantic partner cloud your judgment. If you feel you are still not emotionally healed or grieving over the loss of your marriage, take some time to let the pain subside.


If you often find your thoughts dwelling on your past relationship or things your former spouse would do, you are probably not ready for a new relationship.If you are not truly over your past relationship, you might end up (consciously or unconsciously) entering a new relationship as a temporary distraction. Doing so will be unhealthy for you and the woman you date.
Look for women with whom you are compatible to have a healthy, long-term relationship.;
, Sites like OKCupid, Match.com, and eHarmony are among the top sites for meeting singles online.You can specify what your marital status is as well as your age, race, and other personal stats. These sites will give you a quick way to meet many different women from your area.


Choose a flattering but accurate picture of yourself. Don’t use blurry or old photos, and choose a picture in which you’re smiling.
Describe your interests and personality. Be specific. For instance, don’t write that you like travel and movies; write instead that you enjoyed China and want to go back, and think Stanley Kubrick’s work is brilliant.
Be wary when meeting women online. Always use caution when meeting people you do not know well or have not met in person.

, After a divorce, you should count on your friends for emotional support to help you pull through. As you begin to heal more fully and prepare to re-enter the dating world, your friends can help you out again. Since your friends know you better than anyone, they’ll have a good sense of what kind of woman you’re compatible with.


Request your closest friends to keep an eye out for women you should meet. For instance, you might say to a friend, “It’s hard to meet women around here. If you know anyone I might be interested in, please let me know.” If they know someone they think you’d get on well with, meet them for coffee or lunch along with your mutual friend. If things go well, ask the woman for their contact info and arrange a more private date.
For instance, you might, at the end of a successful meet-up with your friend and his or her female acquaintance, say, “Well, this has been great. We should do this again next week.” If you can get your friend to play along, hopefully they will suggest they are unavailable for meeting-up next week. That leaves the ball in the woman’s court.
If she, too, indicates she is unavailable next week, leave it to her to suggest another occasion when you might meet either one-on-one or with your mutual friend.

, While meeting women in bars, nightclubs, and dance halls are the standard locales in which to meet women, open yourself to the possibility of meeting women in other places too. Grocery stores, libraries, coffee shops, and the gym are all great locations for meeting single women after your divorce.For instance, if you’re at the grocery store and you and a woman are both checking out the freezer containing vegan pizza, chances are that you both share some very specific ideological viewpoints and (possibly) a set of similar interests. Chat her up about her interest in veganism and invite her over to share a tasty pizza pie.
Don’t be shy. Meeting women outside of bars and the usual singles haunts can provide friendship, even if a romantic relationship doesn’t develop.

, If you have children who participate in community events or sports, attend their games or events. Other single parents might also be in attendance. For instance, if your child plays basketball, you might find single mothers in the stands nearby. Smile and make friendly small talk. For example, you might say, “Wow, that was a great pitch,” or “The opposing team is a really good.” After a few games, ask if she and her child would like to go out after the game with you and your child.You could say, “Gee these girls have played really well. I think they deserve a reward. Who wants some Yummy Pan Pizza?”

, There are many ways to ask for a date. A good indirect way is to make it seem like the date is their idea. For instance, you might ask a woman, “Are there any good movies playing this weekend?” If she replies, for instance, “Yes, ‘Alien Attack’ is playing at the theatre not far from here,” you should follow up with, “Wow, I’ve been looking forward to it, we should go tomorrow night.”


Another technique is to make the date an opportunity not to be missed. For instance, you might ask a woman out by inquiring, “Have you eaten at Tasty Sandwich Shop? It has an excellent lunch menu.” She might reply, “No, I have not, but I’d like to.” In this case, follow up with “Great, let’s go together. How about tomorrow at noon?”
You don’t have to look at every opportunity to spend time with women as a date. Use the above examples to hang out with women you have only a platonic interest in as well.
Be creative with your invitations for dates. Use your own circumstances and your knowledge of the woman in question to make the right invitation.
Don’t be afraid of rejection. Sometimes people really can’t meet for any number of reasons. Don’t assume they’re just making an excuse. Wait for them to make a counter-offer, though, before making another pass.
For instance, if one woman you’ve met says she has to go to class and can’t meet, wait for her to suggest an alternate date idea before asking her out again. At that point, she knows you’re interested and will reciprocate when and if she is ready.

Plan activities you can do with the women you meet.Make a list of at least 15 activities you’d like to do with an ideal partner that you couldn’t or didn’t do with your ex-spouse.",How to Meet Women After a Divorce2," Divorce can be hard on the ego. You may feel unwanted, unloved, or cynical and suspicious of others after getting divorced.But unless you are comfortable with who you are and can honestly confront the pain, frustration, and disappointment you feel about your past, you will continue to lack confidence.


The dissolution of your marriage may have felt like the end of the world, but those feelings don’t own you. Stay mindful of your feelings and practice emotion-focused coping. Emotion-focused coping is the strategy of acknowledging that you cannot change what happened, but you can change your reaction to it. In other words, accept that you’ve been through a divorce and feel bad about it, but remember that you still have the rest of your life ahead of you. Look forward to happier tomorrows.Try to avoid your ex. Talking to or otherwise interacting with them might reopen old wounds. If you find they’re on your mind, distract yourself by going for a jog or playing a game.
Being in a happy relationship does not define you. Become happy and confident with yourself before you attempt another relationship.

, When your marriage ends, you may feel depressed and hopeless. Combat these negative feelings by rebuilding your positive mental attitude.


Write a list of your good qualities and post it somewhere you’ll see it each day like your fridge. For instance, you might list qualities like “generous, caring, thoughtful,” and “intelligent” (among others) on your list. Share your list with a support group of friends or family to get a more objective view of yourself. Look at it when you wake each day.
Make a list of new beliefs or affirmations you want to incorporate into your thinking. Read these new concepts or beliefs aloud after reading your list of positive qualities. For instance, you might make an affirmation list which reads, in part, “I am a good person and deserve to be happy,” and “I do not need to be married to have a full life.”
When you feel negative feelings or thoughts intruding, make yourself aware of them and push them away. Tell yourself they are not your real thoughts, and are thus empty of meaning.

, Do not let your divorce ruin your life and health. Spend time with your family and friends.Engage in the hobbies you haven't had time for due to marital obligations, or develop new hobbies that you've always wanted to try. Maintain good hygiene by dressing well, showering and shaving regularly, and brushing and flossing your teeth. Eat a healthy diet centered on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.


Keep your home tidy and clean. Feeling organized and fresh will give you a positive energy and help you attract women, too.

, Will you set a low social price and become involved with anyone willing to tolerate you? Or will you demonstrate that you value yourself and be more selective in your dating practices? While these decisions often go on at the unconscious level, becoming more aware of your dating behavior is an important step towards determining what kind of relationship you can expect when meeting women.

, For instance, your ex may have hated the rodeo, auto races, and the gun range. Being honest about what you’re interested in and what you look for in a partner will help you make positive dating choices. Look to meet women who are interested in these activities and willing to go with you.


Don’t wait too long before asking out women you’re interested in. Sometimes the mere act of going on a date -- even one which ends miserably -- can jump-start your feelings of independence and make you more comfortable with the notion of being single."

On the other hand, you might feel comfortable dating again after just one year. Be honest with yourself and expect your partner to do the same when you renew your romantic relationship with them after a divorce.

, Asking your ex for a date is little different than asking any other woman for a date, with the useful exception that you already know her. However, before asking her out, be sure that she is open to the idea. Inquire through mutual friends or intermediaries what her feelings are about you. If you’re still in regular contact with her, broach the subject gingerly. Inquire, for instance, “Do you think there’s any chance we could rebuild our relationship?” If she replies in the affirmative, move forward with the dating process.


One of the good things about dating your ex-wife is that you already know just what to say to make her interested in going out with you. Think about her favorite restaurants, bands, and activities, and inform her that you have tickets or reservations at the venue in question.
Use your knowledge of her sense of humor when asking her out. For instance, if her favorite band is Great Band, you might jokingly say, “I’m pretty busy this weekend. I have two tickets to the Great Band concert on Saturday. Couldn’t find anyone to go with me. Oh, well! I’m going to make a ton of money scalping this extra ticket!”
At that point, she will probably be very excited to go out with you again. If she is not, however, don’t feel too badly. She is probably just not at the stage where she feels comfortable dating you again. Be patient when attempting to date your ex.

, Similarly, do not date your ex simply because he or she is very familiar to you. Date your ex only because you believe that you two are compatible together and are capable of a new relationship of mutual love and respect. Search your feelings and be honest with both yourself when determining why you want to date your ex.

, While you cannot change your partner, you can change yourself.


Avoid extreme positions like “I will never ___” or exaggerated accusations like “You never/always ____.”
For instance, if your ex spends a lot at the grocery store, don’t say “You always spend too much on groceries we don’t need.” Instead, explain in a clear, calm tone “I don’t think we should be spending so much on groceries, they always go bad before we can eat them all.”
While all relationships have both good and bad times, re-engineering your relationship with your ex requires that on balance, you have more good times than bad.

, When you’re dating your ex, to make the relationship work you will need to adjust the way you communicate, starting with your listening skills.


Couples often fall into certain communication styles or habits and have a hard time breaking them. Date your ex-spouse with an open mind and try to hear their point of view anew, as if for the first time. Since you and your ex have spend a significant amount of time apart, chances are you both have changed. Hear them out.
Do not interrupt your spouse when they are critiquing you or offering advice. Listen to everything they have to say and speak only after they are done speaking.

Take some time to grieve and feel the gamut of your emotions. There may be days you feel overwhelmingly sad, or others when you feel loving or forgiving toward your ex, and still others when you feel fear, relief, resentment, or confusion. Whatever you’re feeling, allow yourself to actually feel it and not push it away.If you need to laugh, cry, stomp your feet, or watch sad movies, respond to your emotions and allow yourself to feel them.;
, It’s often easier to blame your ex than to take responsibility for yourself. However, keep the focus on yourself. Step away from blaming and anger and focus on your own healing. Blaming your ex might make you feel justified in your feelings, but it won’t help you along on your healing journey.When you start to think of all the ways your ex has wronged you or hurt you, shift the focus onto yourself. Ask yourself how you have grown or learned from the situation and decide how you will move forward with your own life.

, Anger, blame, resentment, and bitterness can drain your energy quickly and ultimately keep you in the same place without moving forward. While it’s normal to be upset and think about things in the past, don’t dwell on negative feelings toward your ex. Remind yourself that these feelings won’t help you move forward.If you find yourself stuck in these feelings, accept them and move on. For example, say, “I’m angry at my ex, but it doesn’t have to affect my day.”

, Find some healthy outlets for stress through relaxation. Divorce can keep stress levels high, so get in the habit of performing stress-relieving activities daily for 30 minutes. Relaxation can also help you cope with depression and stabilize your moods.If you don’t know where to start, try daily yoga or and meditation. You can also journal, listen to music, take a walk, or read a book.

, Forgiveness can be an important part of the healing process. Forgive yourself for the choices you’ve made. Then, forgive your ex for the pain they have caused you. Forgiving them doesn’t mean you have to forget what happened or how they hurt you. It’s for your own health and well-being in allowing yourself to move on.Forgiveness helps you release the resentments and anger you hold toward your ex or your divorce and allows you to move forward in a positive direction.

, While alcohol and drugs may give you a temporary escape, they won’t help you heal and move forward with your life. Especially if you’ve had a problem in the past with alcohol or drugs, now is not the time to return to them. Avoid putting yourself at risk, especially if you feel stressed. Stress can cause relapse, even if you’ve been abstinent for a long time.If you’re struggling to cope without turning to drugs or alcohol, get some support. Join a support group, call a sponsor, or spend time with sober friends and family.

, Surround yourself with people who love and support you. Be with people who help you feel positively, who truly listen to you, and who help you. Talk to people who are willing to listen to you without judgment or criticism.It can be helpful to gain perspective and ask for advice from friends who have also gone through a divorce.

, If you’re having a hard time coping or you feel like the divorce has led you into feelings of depression, it’s time to see a therapist. A therapist can help you identify and cope with your feelings as well as help you find coping strategies to relax and deal with stress. They can help you create a plan to move forward with your life.Find a therapist by calling your insurance provider or local mental health clinic. You can also ask for a recommendation from your physician or from a friend or family member.

, You may choose to meet other divorcees through a support group. These are great places to make connections, share your experience, ask for advice, and give and receive support. Group members may offer recommendations for professionals (such as therapists or lawyers) and can help support you through this difficult time.Look for a support group in your local community or find an online-based group.

, A divorce is both a beginning and an end. Instead of dwelling in the past, create an exciting present for yourself. Try something you’ve always wanted to do but felt you couldn’t. Do something that excites you or scares you and embrace this new period in your life.For example, if you’ve always wanted to paint but never seemed to get around to it, pick it up now. Go hiking, take a road trip, study martial arts or plant a garden.

, Maybe there are parts of yourself that you tucked away while married that you can now rediscover. You may not remember what it was like to be single, so reconnect to the things you enjoyed when you were single. For example, if you used to love skiing yet your partner didn’t like the cold, now is your opportunity to dive back in and do something you love. You can reconnect with who you used to or want to be.Think back to activities you enjoyed, places you liked to go, and people you may have cut out of your life.

, Some people find solace in faith and spirituality following a difficult time in life. Whether you’re currently involved, want to get back into a faith, or you’re curiously seeking something outside of yourself, seeking out a spiritual practice can help you feel supported and guided during this difficult time.Get involved in a church, synagogue, stake, mosque, or another spiritual center. It can feel good to contribute to something bigger than yourself. Connect with other like-minded people.
You can also get involved in a self-practice. Try meditating or reading sacred texts. Talk with other people who are spiritual and share your views.

, Some people jump into dating as a way to experience their freedom from marriage. However, it can be a cover-up for the pain or confusion you feel in dealing with a divorce. If you think dating will help you heal, take some time before you start seeing new people. Make sure you’re emotionally ready to be with someone else. If you are with someone, don’t be afraid to take your time and go slowly in building a relationship.If you’re dating as a way to forget the pain your divorce is causing, take a step back and consider focusing on yourself.

Seek help from a therapist.,
Write about how you feel.,
Talk to someone about how you feel.,
Join a support group.",How to Handle Divorce Anger1," If you are struggling with anger due to your divorce, then you may want to seek help from a therapist before you do anything else. A therapist can help you to identify the sources of your anger and learn healthy strategies for dealing with your anger., Journaling can be an effective way to express your anger and to understand the reasons behind your anger as well. By simply writing about how you feel, you may start to notice patterns and you can use these patterns to figure out what triggers your anger regarding your divorce.Try making a list of everything about your ex that makes you feel angry. What does your ex do or say that makes you feel angry? Then, for each item, try to identify at least one potential solution that you can work towards as a long-term goal.
For example, if you feel angry at your spouse for cheating on you, then you might decide that a possible solution is to forgive your spouse for this offense. Keep in mind that you do not have to achieve this goal overnight. Check your progress once per month to see how you are doing.

, Sharing your feelings with a friend or family member can also be a good way to express your emotions. Call someone up the next time you feel angry and share your thoughts and feelings.Talk to a friend or family member who is willing and able to listen to you without judgment. Don’t talk to someone who is also close to your ex-spouse because it might be uncomfortable for him or her. You may also want to choose someone who can empathize with you, such as someone who has also been through divorce.

, Support groups can also provide opportunities for you to express your feelings and gain some validation from others. During these sessions, you may find comfort from sharing your feelings with people who can relate, hearing about similar struggles, and getting support from the group.Try joining a support group for people who are also going through a divorce for another healthy way to express your feelings.

Use calming strategies when anger strikes.,
Exercise more.,
Find new social opportunities.,
Avoid taking anger out on your loved ones.",How to Handle Divorce Anger2," Although it is important to express your anger, it is not helpful to become enraged. Therefore, you should develop some calming strategies to deal with anger. Some good ways to calm yourself down include:Meditating. Meditation is a great way to get focused on the present and tune into your body, which can help to defuse your anger. If you have never meditated before, then you may want to consider taking a class.

Doing deep breathing exercises. Deep breathing is a natural, easy way to calm yourself down. Inhale a slow, deep breath into your abdomen, and then exhale slowly. Repeat this process for about 10 minutes, or until you start to feel calm.
Counting to 10. Try closing your eyes and counting to 10. This should give you a chance to calm down, but you can always count to 10 again or pick a higher number such as 50 or 100 if counting to 10 is not enough., Getting plenty of regular exercise can also help to defuse your anger and improve your overall sense of well-being. Try taking kick-boxing classes, starting a running program, or taking up rock climbing.You might also consider getting a punching bag. Hitting something when you feel angry may help you to feel less angry.
Try yoga. Yoga is a great way to strengthen and tone your body while also quieting your mind. Try taking a yoga class to get some exercise and relaxation at the same time.

, During a divorce, your anger may cause you to feel isolated and you may start to withdraw socially. Instead of allowing your anger to isolate you, try to build some new social connections.Try to find ways to meet people with similar interests. For example, you might take a class at your local community college, join a book club, or get involved with a local charity.

, While it is normal to feel anger from your divorce, it is not appropriate to take your anger out on your loved ones.If you find yourself lashing out at friends and family members due to anger at your spouse, then seek help from a therapist right away. Lashing out at your loved ones can cause permanent damage to these relationships.


To determine if you are taking your anger out on others, start paying closer attention to your behavior and attitudes. If you are mistreating your loved ones and/or feeling justified in doing so, then you may be directing your divorce anger towards your loved ones.

Watch for physical signs of anger.,
Identify thought patterns that may lead to anger.,
Steer clear of situations and places that are likely to anger you.,
Consider anger management classes.",How to Handle Divorce Anger3," Anger can cause certain physical symptoms that may help you to determine when you need to use your calming strategies. Some of the physical symptoms of anger include:feeling like you stomach is in knots
clenching your fists or teeth
feeling short of breath
getting a headache
having a flushed face
feeling restless, like you need to move around
not being able to focus
feeling tense, such as in your shoulders and neck
having a racing pulse

, Certain thought patterns may also lead to anger or escalate your anger. Learning how to spot these patterns may help to defuse your anger. The next time you find yourself thinking a negative thought, try to challenge it. Some thought patterns that can lead to anger include:Overgeneralizing. For example, you might get angry when you find yourself thinking, “She was always dishonest with me!” To reframe this thought, you might change it to something like, “I have some issues with trust because of the instances where my ex-wife lied to me. However, I don’t have to keep feeling angry about these events.”

Jumping to conclusions. For example, you might get angry if you think to yourself, “He is trying to get full custody of the kids to avoid paying any child support!” Instead, try changing the thought to something like, “I feel upset that he wants full custody, but I do not know his reasons for wanting full custody.”

Blaming. For example, you might get angry when you think to yourself, “It’s all her fault that I am so unhappy!” Instead, you might change the thought to something like, “I have been depressed lately, but there may be lots of reasons for how I feel.”

, Putting yourself in a situation that you know is going to make you angry is a bad idea. Therefore, if it is at all possible, try to avoid these situations and places.For example, if you get angry when you see your ex-husband with his new girlfriend, then you should avoid going places that you know they like to go. Or, if you tend to argue with your ex-wife when you drop off your child at her house, then you might ask a friend or family member to drop off your child instead.

, If anger is a persistent problem in your life, then you may want to consider enrolling in an anger management class. Anger management classes can teach you how to identify the reasons for your anger and help you to develop healthy strategies for expressing and controlling your anger."

Take a length of time.,
Stop blaming yourself.,
Clear out thoughts of your ex.,
Get excited to go out.,
Consider your motivation.,
Decide if you can handle a bad date.,
Think of things to talk about.,
Put your best foot forward.,
Listen to your instincts.",How to Know when You're Ready to Date Again After Divorce," How much time you need after a divorce will vary greatly from person to person, but most experts suggest taking time for yourself to heal and recover before you begin dating again. Wait until you feel stable with your home and family life before you try to date again.Some signs that you might have taken a reasonable about of time include feeling comfortable in the routine you have established for yourself and your kids, and not feeling a sense of longing for your past relationship on a daily basis.
There is no set amount of time it will take for you to recover. It may take weeks, months, or years, all of which are fine.
Putting yourself out there too soon could cause a bad experience and make you reconsider dating, in general. Take the time you need to get right with yourself first.;
, It’s common to feel a sense of guilt after a divorce, with thoughts that you are hurting your family by separating. Regardless of validity, these thoughts are natural, but they can also be toxic to a new relationship. A good sign that you are ready to start dating again is that you’ve given up guilt surrounding ending your last relationship.When you feel a sense of guilt, remind yourself of the reasons you ended your marriage and evaluate why they were in the best interest of you and your family.
Give yourself gentle reminders every day that there is nothing to feel guilty about until you genuinely stop feeling the need to blame yourself.

, If you still regularly think about your ex or have become preoccupied with how they might be spending their time, your mind is not open for the experience of a new relationship. Wait until you can move on from consuming thoughts of your ex to develop a new relationship.You likely would not want to date someone who was emotionally unavailable and preoccupied with someone else. Offer others the same respect and make sure you’re not caught up on your ex before you start dating.

, After a divorce, it is natural to want to take some time and focus on your home life. It can be hard to start dating again from home, though. Try going out to dinner or a movie with friends or family to get comfortable being social again before you start dating.


You may also want to try taking yourself on self-love dates, where you do something you enjoy on your own. This could be anything from seeing a movie to taking a dance or photography class, or anything else that makes you happy.
When going out and being social in general terms feels more comfortable, it may be a sign that you are better equipped to start dating.

, Open yourself up to the idea that there are a number of different relationship styles, and think about what you want as you start dating. Do you want a casual relationship, someone for long-term companionship, someone to try to build a new family with, or something else?Your dating goals may change over time. This is common and in no way a bad thing. Knowing what you want now is still important, though, as it will help you determine who you are and are not ready to be with.

, It’s a simple fact of life that some dates are going to go poorly. That doesn’t mean all dates will be bad, but if you are not in a place mentally or emotionally where you feel you can recover from a bad date, listen to your instincts.Ask yourself, “Would one bad date ruin dating as a whole for me?” Be honest with your answer. There is no right or wrong, and it is better to wait until you can handle the experience than to force yourself into something too soon.

, It’s ok to let a date know that you are divorced, but your entire conversation should not hinge on your past relationship. Think about what you could talk about with a date, including things like your children, your work, and your hobbies.If you do not think that you can reasonably get through a date without divulging all the details of your previous marriage, then wait.
Practice making small chat with friends and family, and have them help coach you if you think you need it.

, Your relationship with yourself does a lot to dictate other’s relationship with you. Consider whether you are not only able but excited to dress up, talk about all your good qualities, and make a good general first impression.If your self-esteem is not totally in place yet, that is completely understandable. Take the time you need to build a good relationship.
If you need to, try working with a professional such as a therapist to help you recover your relationship with yourself before you start dating again. There are a number of practices that specialize in helping divorced individuals do just that.

, You don’t owe anyone anything, including a date. Listen to your gut. If you feel that you are ready to meet someone new, put yourself out there. If you don’t think you’re there yet, it is in your own best interest to wait.Starting to date again will likely be somewhat intimidating regardless of when you do it. But only you know when the idea goes from truly frightening to frightening but exciting.
Don’t put yourself on anyone else’s calendar. You will know best when you are ready.

credit card bills
bank accounts (savings, checking, etc.)
mortgage or lease
investment paperwork
tax records
insurance policies
childcare expenses (school, daycare, etc.);
, The easiest way to split expenses would be to divide everything 50/50, but that might not be possible. Another option is to split household expenses but to have each spouse be responsible for their own personal expenses like haircuts, student loans, food, etc.When dividing household expenses, you can have each spouse pay a percentage based on how much they earn. For example, if one person makes $4,000 a month and the other makes $2,000 a month, then the first spouse will pay two-thirds of all household expenses.
Also identify new expenses. For example, if you need to move out of the house, then you will probably have a new rent payment. If you need to buy a new car, then you’ll have a new car payment. Don’t forget these new expenses.

, Identify how much you make at your job. Multiply your pay stubs by the number of pay periods in the year, or look at your most recent tax return. If you can earn overtime pay, then calculate that, too.


Separating can be expensive. If you decide to go through with a divorce, then you’ll also probably need to pay an attorney. Accordingly, you might need to find another part-time job, at least until things stabilize.

, Compare your income with your expenses. If you can’t afford your new living arrangement, then you’ll need to go through the budget and cut anything that isn’t a necessity. Talk with your spouse about what you can cut.The following are good candidates for cutting:


entertainment expenses, like cable, Netflix, or Amazon Prime
expenses for eating out
wine and alcohol
vacations

, You might not know how long you will be separated. However, in some states, you can get permanent legal separation.In this situation, you will need to draft a separation agreement, which is like a divorce agreement. Even if you think the separation might only be temporary, you should still get a written agreement.


In the agreement, you divide up debts and assets. The agreement is legally binding, which means that if your spouse violates it you can go into court and get a court order., Your spouse might be a higher earner than you. In this situation, you could ask for alimony, which is called “separate maintenance” because you are still married.Separate maintenance can be included in any separation agreement you and your spouse draft.


If you can’t reach an agreement with your spouse, you can also ask a court for temporary alimony.

, Even if you draft the most detailed budget, you will still have to talk with your spouse, especially if you have children. New expenses arise constantly—your child wants to play a sport, your child is injured, the home needs repairs, etc. Commit to keeping lines of communication open.


You also need to talk to your spouse if you decide not to follow the budget. For example, if you want to pay more on the mortgage, then run the idea by your spouse.You may also want written permission from your spouse. This might seem too formal, but try to get an email at least in which they agree to the change.

, You remain responsible for any debts you took out as a couple. These debts can include car payments, house payments, credit card debts, etc. You should identify your joint debts and commit to making timely payments. If you don’t know what debts you have jointly, then get a copy of your credit report.You can get a copy of your credit report by calling 1-877-322-8228.
Alternately, you could visit http://www.annualcreditreport.com and order a copy from each of the three national credit reporting agencies., Move quickly. Closing all joint accounts will prevent your spouse from running up bills on your credit cards or clearing out shared checking or savings accounts.Before closing, make sure that all outstanding checks and debit charges have cleared. If they haven’t, then they’ll bounce if you close the account too soon.You should be able to close a bank account on your own. Usually, you will present a photo ID to the bank official and possibly complete some forms.
To close a joint credit card, you should call up the credit card company immediately., If your separation becomes permanent, then you will need your own bank accounts and credit cards. It is best to establish them as soon as possible.If you have direct deposit, then make sure to arrange for your deposit to go into your new account.
Even if you and your spouse reconcile, there is no reason not to have your own financial accounts.

, One easy way to divide credit card debt is for each spouse to take out your own new credit card and then transfer half of the debt as a balance transfer.Usually, the credit card gives you 12 months or more at 0% interest, so you can pay down your debt quickly.

, If you don’t split the debts yourselves, then you are basically relying on your spouse to make their payments as promised. Accordingly, you want to keep track if they are really paying the bills. You should purchase credit monitoring.You can often get credit monitoring services from one of the three major credit reporting agencies: Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion. Other companies include Identity Guard and LifeLock.
Credit monitoring services vary depending on the services they provide and their cost. For example, Identity Guard’s Total Protection Plan costs $19.99 a month and monitors changes to your credit reports across all three credit reporting agencies. It also tracks your Social Security Number across thousands of databases., You should decide quickly what you intend to do with your house. If you can’t afford it, then you should think about selling it. However, selling a house rarely goes quickly, so you want to give yourself plenty of time.


Alternately, you could rent out the house so that you can cover your mortgage payments., If you end up divorcing, then you might need to divide any property you purchased during your separation. For this reason, you should avoid large purchases, like a new car.Wait until you are divorced.


However, don’t forget to treat yourself every now and then. Separation is emotionally draining on everyone, and if you need to visit a spa or play a round of golf to feel better, then go ahead and splurge.

, If you invest, then you should consider changing the allocation so that you have easier access to cash. You might want to sell certain holdings or change the mix in your investment portfolio.You may also need to rethink your investment goals. One goal might be to save as much money for your children’s future college expenses. However, you may need to delay this investment if money is tight during the separation.

, Your emotions might be running high, and you might find it difficult to talk with your spouse about your finances. In this situation, you should seek professional help. A marriage counselor can help you and your spouse listen to each other.The purpose of the counseling isn’t to save the marriage. Instead, you will focus on tackling financial issues. Often, our emotions get in the way, and the counselor can help you stay on track.
You can find a marriage counselor in the Yellow Pages or on the Internet. You may also get a referral from your doctor or minister., An attorney can help you analyze your finances and understand where you will stand if you do get a divorce. You should hire your own attorney and not share one with your spouse. To find a family law attorney, contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral.You also might need an attorney’s help if your spouse doesn’t keep up their end of the bargain. For example, if your spouse continues to spend money from a financial account, then you can go into court and ask the judge to freeze the account., You might need help untangling your finances or planning for the future. If so, then you should meet with a financial advisor. Try to find a financial advisor who has experience working with people during a separation or a divorce.You should look for a financial advisor who has the Certified Divorce Financial Analyst (CDFA) designation.
You can find a CDFA by visiting the Institute for Divorce Financial Analysts website, which has a locator feature: https://www.institutedfa.com/find-a-cdfa. Enter your location and click “Search.”

Prior to dating someone else, be sure you either want to end the relationship or that the other person is okay with seeing other people during the separation.Think about how you would feel in the other person’s shoes.
Consider relationship counseling.
Remember that communication is a major factor in repairing a relationship, so talk with the other person if you may want to reconcile.;
, If you are married, it is generally not advisable to date other people until the divorce is final. Dating other people can increase animosity between divorcing couples, which tends to decrease the likelihood of amicable settlements and increase the cost of divorce attorneys and other court costs. In some circumstances, dating before the divorce is final can also negatively impact property settlements and custody determinations.Former spouses who become jealous that the other party has found a new relationship tend to be less willing to agree to property settlements or parenting arrangements.
In states that grant divorces on the basis of fault, the fact that you have a relationship during the separation can be used as evidence that you had a relationship prior to the separation.
The character of people you regularly bring in contact with your children is relevant to parenting arrangements. Any new partner could potentially be subject to examination and/or investigation by the court or other party because of the proximity s/he will likely have to the children.

, During a separation, emotions are generally raw. Both parties to the relationship are usually hurt and potentially angry about the breakup. You may want to take some time to get to know the new you, especially if the relationship lasted several years, instead of jumping into a quick rebound relationship.Some experts recommend waiting at least six months before making any major decisions.
Be sure you are dating because you enjoy the company of the company of the other person instead of to fill a hole left by the loss of the relationship or out of anger at the other person.
Consider going out with groups of people instead of paring up with any one person to help fill the void left from the loss of the relationship.

, During your separation, it is good to meet new people. This can lead to filling those hours that you previously spent with your partner. While this is not technically dating, it is the beginnings of becoming available to date. Some ways to meet new people include:Volunteering for issues that interest you, such as museums or animal shelters
Taking classes for things you enjoy, such as cooking, writing, or a sport
Starting or joining a club or organization, such as a book club or a religious organization

, Going out in groups is not technically dating, even though those groups often are comprised of couples. Going with groups of people to events, including movies, restaurants, and sporting events is a good way to socialize while your divorce is pending. It is also a good way to get to know the other person without the stress of a formal date in the background. Almost any activity that can be done one-on-one can also be done with a group of people. Consider such activities as:Going hiking with a mixed-gender group of friends
Seeing a play or movie with a mixed-gender group of friends.
Going to the beach or park with a mixed-gender group of friends.

, If you do decide to go out on a paired-off date while separated, exercise discretion. This does not mean be secretive, but you don’t want to throw it in your former partner’s face, either, especially if s/he is having difficulty dealing with the breakup.Don’t change your Facebook status to reflect any new relationships.
Don’t announce dates on social media.
Don’t talk about your dates in front of your children or friends who are also friends of your former spouse.

, If you are still married, the potential date has the right to know this. Only with this information can that person make an informed decision about whether s/he wants to be involved with the stress that is usually involved in this stage of your life.


Often, people feel betrayed if they learn that information has been withheld from them.
Once you start dating, your partner(s) could potentially find themselves involved in your case against their will.
Some people feel it is morally wrong to date others before the divorce is final.

, Realize that children cope differently at different ages, and that children of all ages are likely to be resistant to you dating soon after separating from their other parent. Think about how your child(ren) are likely to react to you going out with other people.Have your children had the ability to process their emotional issues regarding the separation?
Adolescents tend to hide their fears.
Children under age 10 tend to be more possessive about their parents.

, Children frequently have concerns about losing a parent during a separation or divorce. Children of any age should be made aware that just because you are dating, you are not trying to replace their other parent.Open lines of communication, but don’t overshare. If a child is fine with you dating, end the conversation.
Reassure your child that the other person will not replace their other parent or take you away from them.
Allow your child to voice concerns and emotions without fear of punishment.

, Even if your divorce is final and your children appear to be okay that you are dating, you should avoid having them meet every person you date. The children should only meet a person that will likely be around for a while, not casual dates that will likely come and go.Young children tend to form attachments more easily than adults. If your casual relationship doesn’t work out, your child may need to deal with the loss of this person, too.
If you have not gotten to know this person very well, they may bring some exposures to your children that you would prefer they not be exposed to.
Realize that children need time to transition to their new lives with separated parents before new people are added into it.

Don't get yourself worked up before hand.,
Don't jump right in discussing the alimony.,
Tell them that you have talked with an attorney.,
Do not get defensive or try to defend your numbers at length.,
Wrap things up.,
Do not let the other bait you with additional topics that are difficult and they know will get your dander up.,
Follow up.,
If you do not agree, simply send an email to that affect and include your original narration.,
Let the attorneys finalize the issue.",How to Discuss Alimony During Divorce," Make sure you have consulted a family or divorce attorney who is licensed in your state and county. There are many aspects to calculating alimony in a divorce that you will be unaware of. Find out what the range should be (it is not a set number and can be modified by a judge). There is no point in wrangling about numbers if they have no basis in fact and may change significantly.;
, During a divorce no one is happy. You never marry someone with the intention of divorce, many hopes and dreams have died and this is when you bury them. Understanding that this process is difficult to the other person is key. You want to make sure things are equitable and hopefully they do too. In this vein, it is important to avoid setting a stage where anyone, yourself or them, will be uncomfortable or anxious.

, Avoid your or their home if possible, a neutral spot that is quiet where you can take your time. Also, don't announce that you are going to discuss alimony in advance. Do not tell them ""we need to talk so you don't get screwed"". Keep it simple and non-confrontational.

, The state has already set the alimony guidelines and you know what it should be. This is not the time for negotiating.

, That will be the tense part. Start by asking about small things such as how they are doing, how their work is going, etc. Ease into things, there's no rush or deadline. When it is appropriate to discuss alimony, you will know. Bring it up simply, matter of fact with no hesitation or indications that you are anxious or angry. Your emotions will feed them.

, Tell them the number you and your attorney feel is appropriate. Tell them why that number is appropriate but don't get into details, that is between your attorney and yourself. If they have not seen an attorney, encourage them to do so. When the papers are finalized, they will need a basis for disagreeing, if they do.

, Again, this is not a negotiation.

, When you are finished discussing alimony it should be time to wrap things up. Do not start talking about other difficult topics. Each topic has their turn and their time. Try to wind things down with other small talk like you did at the beginning. This will help calm tensions created from the discussion and keep each from having the impression that the other wants to be offensive and nasty. Keep track of the time and when it is time to leave, do so politely and confidently.

, Thank them for their time, get up and leave. You have done what you wanted and need to do. You are finished.

, When you are finished send an email to the other. Provide a brief recap of the pertinent things that were said about alimony.


If a number was agreed on, state that. If not, restate the number you gave them. Make it professional, brief and very clear.
Ask them for their confirmation that this is their recollection. It doesn't matter if they don't reply as ""silence gives consent"". If they do reply and say it was different than you said, consider it carefully. If you believe that it should be modified then rewrite your email and send that one asking for their confirmation.

, This is not legally binding but can be used to show the other's behavior if necessary. Primarily it is a good record to jog your and their memory in a time that dulls the memory considerably.

, You have discussed alimony with your soon to be ex. There is no point in haggling, leave it in the hands of the attorneys. The best part is that knowing this number will allow you to budget and plan for your future that, although difficult in the short term, is going to be brighter and full of possibilities.

Talk to a therapist.",How to Handle Loved Ones Critical of Your Divorce," You may be able to overcome criticism about your divorce by opening up about your reasons. Some family and friends may not be privy to the details of your relationship, and may need to be brought up to speed. Put some thought into how much you want to share with family and friends.


In some cases, depending on how close you are to the other person, more of an explanation may be required to get their support.
It may even be nice to practice what you are going to say and how you will respond to possible questions.;
, It can help you build morale if you begin breaking the news to loved ones who you expect to be supportive. This is a smart way to “rehearse” for the more challenging conversations you will have later.


For instance, if you have a supportive friend or sibling, start with them. You might say, “So, we have decided to move forward with a divorce. Despite going to counseling, we are fighting every day. Our staying together is only making everyone involved suffer, including the kids. Can I count on your support through this difficult time?”, If you and your future ex are on friendly terms after the split, it may be wise to share the news with conservative loved ones together. This demonstrates a unified front about the decision, and prevents any side from being labeled the “bad guy.”


You might say, “Mom, Dad, Michael and I have decided to get a divorce. We understand that you all are against divorce, but our marriage has reached an irrevocable place. We think it’s best for us to split before any more damage is done.”, If going into your discussions you expect someone to be critical, consider bringing in reinforcements. You might have a sympathetic friend or sibling accompany you when you break the news as a show of support. You might also ask this person to have an isolated conversation with your critical loved ones afterwards in order to plead your case.


For example, you might tell a sibling, “Our parents are going to hate me forever because of my divorce. Will you please talk to them on my behalf? They have always respected your opinion.”

, If, despite your best efforts, your loved ones continue to be critical of your divorce, you may need to confront them. It’s possible they aren’t aware of how hurtful their response has been. Perhaps expressing your feelings will help resolve the disagreement.You might say, “I know you don’t believe in divorce. I didn’t either until I arrived at this point. It hurts me to know I can’t count on your support. I feel all alone.”

, Speak up for yourself by gently asking your loved ones to kindly support your decision, even if they don’t necessarily agree with it. They love you, and likely want what’s best for you. So, simply ask if they can try to be more understanding.


Your request might sound like, “I know you regret going through your own divorce, and you think I’m making a mistake. But, please understand that my situation is different. I really need you right now. Could you please support my decision?”, If your loved ones have developed a relationship with your spouse, it can be hard to come to terms with changing roles. Their criticism may just be a confused way of coping with their own feelings about your divorce. Give them space. In time, they may come around.Your loved one may have formed a connection with your spouse over time which led them to certain opinions regarding your partner. It may initially be difficult for them to see your reasons for wanting a divorce because of this connection.

, Going through a divorce can be hard enough without a critical audience. If some family and friends don’t understand your decision, it may be best to get some distance from them as you go through this process.


After seeing you healthier and happier outside of an unhappy relationship, they may start to understand and be empathetic to your situation.
In the meantime, simply avoid making too much contact with people whom you know are negative or disapproving.

, Coping with a divorce is a stressful, emotional process—one with no clear deadline. Dealing with criticism from loved ones may complicate the process even more. Be sure to be gentle on yourself and nurture your mind, body, and spirit.


Eat nourishing foods like fresh produce, lean protein, and whole grains. Drink plenty of water. Stay away from unhealthy coping tools like alcohol or drugs. Cut down on fast foods or empty-calorie junk foods that don’t support your health.
Manage your stress by trying relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing. Do things you enjoy like playing board games with family, seeing a new movie, or reading an interesting novel., Empathetic loved ones are priceless during a confusing life experience like divorce. Turn to your core support group to offset any negative feedback you get from others.


Instead, reach out to those who are value you and support your decision. Express your appreciation for these non-critical people by saying something like “You know, I really appreciate you being there for me. It’s been really difficult with so many family members criticizing my choices. I’m glad to have your listening ear. Thank you.”, Spending time with people who are going through a similar experience may also be a comfort as you cope with divorce. A support group features non-judgmental individuals who are all trying to come to terms with a divorce. These individuals may offer you hope about your future and may even have stories about critical family members who eventually came around.


Reach out to your divorce attorney or spiritual organization. They may be able to refer you to a support group in your area. You might also research local and web-based groups online., The impartial advice of a marriage and family therapist is a valuable resource to have as you navigate your divorce. Professional therapists are trained to help you manage common problems associated with divorce such as confused children and unsupportive loved ones. Your therapist can also recommend healthy ways to express and cope with your feelings.


Ask your family doctor about a mental health therapist in your area. Look for one who has experience working with divorced individuals."

Don’t make matters worse by being hard on yourself or expecting too much too soon. Take a few days to yourself, or with someone supportive, to vent or forget or whatever you need to do.It may seem silly, but it can be helpful to indulge yourself during this time. Get a soothing massage. Take long, hot baths as you ponder your feelings. Drink tea by the fire. Don’t worry so much about managing the everyday right away, just care for yourself and accept the pain.;
, One of the most important relationships in your life is disintegrating. It’s normal and perfectly okay to feel like you should grieve. Depending on the particulars of your divorce, you may feel sadness, shock, despair, fear or anger among other emotions. There is no right way to grieve. Grieve in the way that feels most natural to you.It may make grieving easier to avoid your spouse, if at all possible, during this time. Find a new route to work if you usually see her each day. Put away the photo albums or mementos that make you cry each time you pass.
You should let yourself feel what you must. However, don’t allow your feelings to be in the driver’s seat. Doing this can result in impulsive decisions and actions occurring that you later regret, such as showing up at your ex’s doorstep begging her to reconsider.

, A support network is essential during divorce.Reach out to or accept support from those around you who love and support you.


Be sure that the confidants you select have your best interests at heart and are not simply interested in hearing gossip or badmouthing your ex. Seek out people who are positive influences that give you a healthy outlook on life and encourage you to make good decisions.

, It can be tempting to turn to drugs, alcohol or other unhealthy behaviors during this difficult period in your life. These substances or activities may appear to numb your feelings, but it is only temporary. Find healthier methods of coping that boost your mood.Examples of healthy coping methods may include phoning a friend when you feel particularly low, exercising, spending time outdoors or doing a hobby, or meditating to reduce stress and calm your mind.

, Don’t play into the irrational belief that seeking outside help means you’re weak. You need someone with whom you feel comfortable talking to and processing the events taking place in your life. A professional can help you understand what you’re feeling and make plans to move forward with your life when you’re ready.

, Keeping a journal can be a helpful way to unload your thoughts and feelings about the divorce. Getting what’s in your head down on paper can provide relief from what you’re feeling. What’s more, journaling is a great way to problem-solve.Try to devise solutions to some of the issues you write about in your journal. For example, if you notice you keep worrying about how you will get by financially, possible solutions may be to find a job or speak with a financial advisor who can help.

, Renewing or strengthening your relationship with God, a higher power, or the universe can help you manage the overwhelming pain and heartbreak that comes with divorce. A spiritual mindset is also one of faith; therefore, you may feel more positive about your future., Divorce will bring with it a host of new responsibilities. Regardless of how long your were married, you have probably come to rely on your spouse in various ways. You must anticipate a major shift in what you may or may not be responsible for moving forward.


Maybe your spouse often did all the cooking and laundry and now you are faced with learning these tasks as an older, single person. On the other hand, your spouse may have been the primary breadwinner and the divorce causes you to assess your skills, get a job, and develop your own financial security., Research has repeatedly shown that joint custody, in which children are able to split time between both parents rather than mostly living with one parent, is the best option for kids in fractured families.These kids have feel more secure from continually being cared for by both parents, they are able to follow a healthy example, and they may grow up to be better problem-solvers.Of course, this option may not be best in your case. Work with your family lawyer to determine which arrangement best suits your unique circumstances.
If you do decide to co-parent, avoid allowing your feelings to overshadow the needs of your children. Strive to listen to and compromise with your ex in order to adopt consistent rules and disciplinary strategies for the kids.

, The dissolution of your marriage can turn your world upside down. It’s important to keep a regular schedule in order to maintain some aspect of structure and familiarity in this new chapter of your life.Don’t clear your schedule of your regular girl’s night or personal training session. If you enjoy and look forward to these activities, maintain them for normalcy.

, The aftermath of divorce is a perfect time to think about yourself and the kind of life you would like to lead moving forward. The prospect of facing the world, no longer as one of two, but on your own, can be both exhilarating and terrifying. Make the decision to take advantage of your single status by setting goals that allow you to redefine yourself and live the life you want. Set a new small goal each week to boost your motivation.Did you once have a dream of completing your college degree? Have you been putting off starting your own business or traveling to another country? Sit down with a pen and paper and create a step-by-step plan to reach your future goals. A weekly small goal may be researching schools or obtaining your previous college transcript.
Still, you must be realistic about the goals you set and the feasibility of you accomplishing them. For example, you would want to take your children and any custody issues into consideration when thinking about starting a new career or relocating.

, Another way to rebuild your life and redefine yourself is finding new interests. A divorce is an ending and a beginning. Establishing a new identity is significant in helping you move on. If you still keep up hobbies that you shared with your spouse, that’s fine, but try to find new activities to do that reflect your own desires.


Have you always wanted to run a marathon? Learn a new language? Go for it! Maybe you could never have a pet due to your spouse's allergies--now might be a great time to get a cute puppy!, Post-split you may be so busy trying to make it through each day that you take little notice to your surroundings. However, stop and take a look around you. Does your current living space represent who you are as a single person? Or, are you holding on to a coupled identity? Know that what your living space looks like and how it makes you feel are vital in your rebuilding.


Your physical environment can have a huge impact on your mood, create or reduce stress, and influence your behavior or motivation.You don't have to spend money to redefine your space. Pack away those things that make your upset or sad. Move around the furniture. Change out the curtains to make the space brighter or more airy. Add in some brightly-colored artwork or rugs to give you a major mood boost.Grab that can of paint from the garage and touch up the walls.

, Make an effort to survey your desires before entering into a new committed relationship.


Once you feel ready to date, challenge to see someone outside your usual ""type"". For example, if you usually date conservative business types, see how you like a person who is more free-spirited and liberal.
If you desire, choose to be single and work on yourself before jumping back into the dating world. Society is much more accepting of singles than decades ago. So, don't feel the need to quickly get attached.

Make sure it's the right decision.,
Think about your options.,
Consider keeping your plan private for now.,
Tell your spouse when it's time.",How to End a Marriage1," If you're reading this article, you've probably decided it's over. But take some time to make sure you're certain this is the right choice. You may be angry, upset over a big argument or depressed, but is the marriage salvageable? Have you talked it through with your spouse, and tried your best to make it work? Is there anything you can do to save the marriage? In the end, when you know, you know. Think about whether the following is true:


Are you and your spouse already essentially living separate lives, spending little time together? Are you uninvolved in each other's daily wants and needs? Have you stopped making decisions together?Have you or your spouse turned to people outside the marriage to meet your emotional needs? If this has gone on long enough, it might be time to end it.If the relationship is abusive, and you feel your health or life is in danger, there's no question that it should end. You need to get to safety as soon as possible.
Have you gotten outside help? Consider talking to a marriage counselor before making this decision. Having a third party's input can be really helpful. If nothing else, talking with a marriage counselor might help you decide for sure whether this is the right thing to do.;
, The end of a marriage usually implies divorce, but before you jump straight to making plans to divorce you might want to consider other options, like just living apart for awhile or getting a legal separation.That will give you time to live separate lives and see how it feels for your family. Being away from your spouse might make you see things a little differently. This trial period can also help you ease into changes that would otherwise seem very abrupt.


You might consider staying with a friend or relative for awhile so that you can sort out your plans without worrying about the legal side of things just yet.
In some cases there's no time for thinking things through. If you're in an abusive marriage, take steps to end it so you can get out right away.

, Ending a marriage changes everything between you and your spouse. In some cases, things can get very contentious. In order to protect yourself and make sure it goes the way you want it to, you might want to keep your decision to yourself while you make plans to separate your finances and set up a new living situation. You can tell a few trusted people who can help you make preparations, but don't tell someone who might share it with your spouse.


This give you a chance to leave with your finances in order. If everything you own is also in your spouse's name, you'll need time to sort things out so you'll be able to start life as a single person and support yourself. Your spouse could make this very difficult. If you think the divorce could be contentious, start planning a few months before you break the news.
This is especially important if you're leaving an abusive situation. Don't tell your spouse - make plans, then leave. Your spouse will find out before long.

, You know best how to break the news. If you've been fighting for months, maybe it's already clear that things have come to an end, but for the sake of closure and clarity it's a good idea to have a straightforward conversation. You could arrange a quiet time at home to have the discussion, or do it in public, where the discussion might be less likely to devolve into another fight. Figure out a place and time and mark your calendar, so you know it will happen that day.


If you're searching for the right words to say, you could start with ""We both know this is not working out. I'm ready to end the marriage.""
Your spouse will either agree or be upset. In the best case scenario, you'll be able to remain friends, but a marriage's end can be very unpredictable.

Talk with other moms about weight loss.,
Do not diet unless instructed by a doctor to do so.",How to Burn off Baby Weight1," You can begin the conversation on weight loss during your final pre-natal appointments if you feel the need, but it is best to begin discussing weight loss after the baby has arrived.


Follow post-partum instructions. These are valuable and will help your body recover. Recovering is the first step in achieving your pre-pregnancy body.
Discuss weight loss at first post-partum appointment. This is usually 4 to 6 weeks after birth. You can decide if weight loss is something you can do on your own or if you would like the help of nutritionists or trainers. The doctor will help guide you to the healthiest ways to lose weight for your situation.;
, Trying to lose all the weight in 6 weeks is not a healthy attainable goal. You may weigh more than you did pre-pregnancy due to enlarged breasts, especially if breast-feeding, and enlarged uterus. It takes time for the uterus to return to normal size and breast-feeding requires extra fat stores.


Do not live by the scale. Using a scale is a good way to track overall progress, but can mislead women when it comes to losing pregnancy weight. A better method to measure progress at first is to measure waist size with a tailors tape.






If you notice your waist size is slowly decreasing, then you are more than likely losing extra adipose (fat) tissue in one of the most vital areas, your torso. Also, you can track how you feel. For instance, as you lose weight you may have more energy and become less fatigued. These are signs you are becoming healthier and you should continue what you have been doing.







, After you have discussed weight loss with the doctor it may help to log your goals and timelines. Checking progress once a week or every other week can be helpful in staying motivated. You will want to avoid obsessing though.


Remember, checking progress everyday can be misleading because bodies fluctuate daily in terms of water weight. It is the long-term progress that will help you understand if you are losing the extra baby weight.







, Being a new mom brings many new responsibilities. You will need to work weight loss into this new schedule. It is best to move at a pace you feel comfortable with rather than forcing it.

If your goals seem too aggressive based on your new schedule then you should scale back or increase the amount of time you are giving yourself.

, Trying to squeeze into old pants to soon may make you feel worse about your weight and would not be comfortable. Also, do not overcompensate by wearing clothing that is too large because this may make you appear larger than you are and also may not be comfortable. Clothes that fit will flatter your body the best and be the most comfortable.

, Pregnancy causes many changes in a woman’s body. The increase in hip size may be permanent. Also, breast size may change over the long run. If you are concerned, talk with your doctor and they will be able to let you know what may not change.

, Many women will share what they went through. By connecting with other moms you will not feel so isolated. Many new moms are going through the same struggles as you. Often, new moms may want to work together to get the weight off. The buddy system is a great way to motivate because you now have accountability to more than yourself.

, It is very important after you give birth to eat a healthy diet with enough calories.

Many diets do not allow for enough calories or limit certain food groups. This can result in mal-nutrition and increased healing time after child birth.
USDA’s Myplate is a good place to look if you are unsure what a well-balanced healthy diet should consist of.

Assess your financial situation.,
Start saving money.,
Figure out where you're going to live.,
Make plans for the children.,
Rally emotional support.,
Start living separately.",How to End a Marriage2," If you and your spouse have joint accounts, you could be left high and dry after the divorce. Don't assume that everything will turn out completely fair. Your spouse could end up taking more than his or her share. Protect yourself by separating your money from your spouse's and doing the following:


Start a separate bank account. Put in as much of your own money as possible. Don't take money from joint accounts at this time, unless it's an emergency situation.
Start your own line of credit. If you don't have your own credit card, it's a good idea to start building credit history now, so you'll be able to get a loan or make a down payment on a new place.

, If you've been relying on your spouse's income, you might need to get a job or take on a new source of income so that you can sock away money to support yourself during and after the divorce. This might mean you need to go from part time to full-time work, or take on a second job so you have another source of income. In addition to making as much money as you can, save it by doing the following:


Cut back on spending. For the time being, limit your purchases to essentials.
Create a budget, and stick to it. Figure out how much money you're going to need to hire an attorney, rent a new place, pay for groceries, etc.

, You could stay with a friend or relative in the first few weeks or months, but in time you'll need to find a permanent place to live. If you have children, finding a stable place to live is even more important. Spend some time researching affordable options.


If you're on good terms with your spouse, discuss who's going to live in the home you're sharing, and who will need to leave.
If you're going to be on your own, you might want to move to a brand new city to get a fresh start. Think about who you could stay with and start making plans.
If you have kids, decide what size house or apartment you'll be able to afford.

, If you have kids, you'll need to account for the big changes the end of your marriage will bring into their lives. Will they live in the same house? Keep going to the same school? You'll need to figure out how their living situation will change and account for smaller changes, like schedule disruptions. This is something you and your spouse should go over in detail, so that it's as easy on your children as possible.


Decide when to tell them. Telling your children you're getting divorced is a big deal, and something you'll want to put thought into before you bring it up.
Think about custody. Do you want full or partial custody of the children? If you want full custody, which is rare, there will need to be a good reason - like your spouse is abusive or unfit to be a parent. If this is the case, gather documentation you can use as evidence to prove it in court.

, In the coming months, while you and your spouse get divorced, you're going to need a lot of support from your friends and family. Tell the people closest to you what you're going through, and ask them for their help. Talk to friends who have been through it themselves and ask them for advice.


Consider getting therapy. The divorce process can be devastating, and a therapist can give you the right tools to make it go more smoothly.
Take good care of yourself. Ending a marriage is one of the toughest life experiences a person can have. You thought you were going to spend your life with this person, and now it's over. You're going to be dealing with a swirl of emotions during this period. Make sure you're eating healthy food, getting enough sleep, spending time outside, and doing whatever it is that makes you feel as good as possible.

, Whether this means packing up your share of the belongings and moving, or saying goodbye to your spouse who's moving out, it's time to go ahead and live separately. During the divorce proceedings, things will be easier if your lives are already distinct from one another's.


Figure out which belongings are yours, and which are your partners. When it comes to purchases the two of you made together, you'll need to figure out who paid for what or decide who gets it.
You might choose to leave for a few days while your partner moves out, or vice versa. That way you won't risk having a fight while you're trying to pack boxes and leave.

Hire a divorce attorney.,
File for divorce.,
Participate in divorce proceedings.,
Recuperate.",How to End a Marriage3," Divorces can be very complicated and difficult to navigate on one's own. Even if you don't have children or many assets, it's not something you want to do all by yourself. At the very least, you should have an attorney look over your divorce paperwork. Shop around for a divorce lawyer to find one you can afford.


Look for an attorney who specializes in handling divorces. Don't select just anyone from the phone book - you'll want someone with experience. This is especially important if your spouse doesn't want to get a divorce, or if you plan to sue for grounds (such as adultery).
If you don't feel you can afford an attorney, you could still hire a paralegal to help you navigate the process or review your paperwork to make sure it is filled out properly.
Some states have resources for a ""do it yourself"" divorce. Conduct research to find out if this option is available to you., The requirements and paperwork for filing for divorce differ by state. Work with your attorney to carefully fill out the proper paperwork and file it on time. In most cases, the first step will be to file a petition for divorce with your local court clerk, where your petition will receive a case number. Your spouse will be informed and will need to respond to the petition.

, Depending on the specifics of your divorce, you may be able to settle it out of court with a mediator. If it's a ""no contest"" divorce, meaning both parties are fully on board and are on amicable terms, you might not need to go to court.If it's contested, meaning your spouse doesn't want the divorce or doesn't agree to your terms, you will likely have to go to court to have a judge rule on matters of property distribution, alimony, child custody and child support.


Throughout the process, you may need to present evidence related to your financial situation. Organize your bank statements, pay stubs, receipts, and other papers so you have them ready if you need them. Your attorney should help you with every step of the process to make sure it goes smoothly.
If the custody of your children is in question, there will be a separate set of paperwork to work through. Be prepared to present evidence related to your fitness as a parent. You'll need to show you have a steady income, stable living situation, and so on.

, This will be an emotional experience for you. The divorce process itself may take many months - months that can be emotionally grueling and exhausting. After that, it will take a long time to get used to your new situation, whether or not the divorce was contentious. Lean on your friends and family for support, and get outside help from a counselor when necessary to get through this difficult time. In the end, when your marriage is really over, you can celebrate this chance for a new chapter in your life.

Breastfeed your child if possible.,
Drink plenty of water daily.,
Sleep when you can and try to sleep enough.,
Control your stress level.",How to Burn off Baby Weight2," Breast milk provides the best nutrition and nurture for your baby, and it benefits the mother as well. Breastfeeding releases a hormone that helps the mother relax and it lets your uterus know that it is time to return to normal size.


Many women experience uterus contractions during breastfeeding that occur because of the shrinking of the uterus, so don't be worried if this happens to you.
Breastfeeding can burn 600 to 800 calories a day. Doctors recommend consuming 500 extra calories a day when breastfeeding, but you are burning more and that leads to weight loss. It is feasible to burn off the extra baby weight with breastfeeding alone if you gained only the recommended amount of weight.

, Water is essential to hydration, especially if you are breastfeeding. You will need the extra water to help with milk production.


Water will also help you feel full so you don’t over-snack throughout the day. This can help keep weight off and help with excess bloating.
You need enough water so that you are not thirsty, your urine is fairly clear in color and you are going to the bathroom every few hours.

Eat the way you want your child to eat.,
Eat small meals with snacks through the day.,
Consume foods that give you the maximum nutrition.,
Eat when you’re hungry and stop eating when you are full.",How to Burn off Baby Weight3," When your child starts eating solids, you will most likely aim for the most nutritious foods with many fruits and vegetables for her. It is good time to start evaluating your diet to determine if you would feed your child what you eat. If not, you probably need to change your eating habits. This doesn’t mean you have to give up everything. You can start by adjusting your main meals to be more nutritious and balanced and go from there.

, How you eat can be just as important as what you eat. By eating more frequent small meals you will maintain blood sugar and energy levels better. This will keep you satiated and help with over-eating at other times during the day. Good snacks to eat are whole nuts, cheese and whole grain crackers, fruits and vegetables.

, Your body will require so much more after child birth, and even more if breastfeeding. You will want to continue taking your prenatal vitamin and eat foods packed with nutrition. You will require extra calcium, healthy fatty acids, folic acid and protein.

Eat foods like milk, fish and whole grains, and avoid foods that are high in empty calories or fat calories. Fruits and vegetables are high in fiber and this will help you feel full longer as well as aid in digestion.






The best way to ensure you are getting the most out of your foods is to eat from every food group. USDA’s Myplate is a great place to learn how to eat and track your progress.

, When people over-eat they confuse the biological function that tells the body when to stop eating. This can make it hard to know if you are full until it is too late.

The best way to overcome this is to only eat if you feel hungry, eat slowly to give your body time to process the amount of food being consumed and stop when your body begins to give signs of fullness. This method often works better than counting calories and many women find they lose weight with less effort.
The amount you eat will vary depending on energy expenditure, so don’t be surprised if you consume more on some days and less on others.

Avoid excessive tummy toning exercises.,
Break exercise up throughout day.,
Work with your baby.,
Incorporate strength and cardio training into your exercise routine.",How to Burn off Baby Weight4," Abdominal muscles separate during pregnancy to make room for your baby. These muscles may take a long time to reconnect properly and doing too many crunches can further exacerbate the separation causing a “pouch” appearance in that area.


Some exercises tone abdominal muscles that are safer after childbirth. These involve isolating and engaging the muscles of the abdomen and can be done while sitting or standing.

, It may not be feasible to exercise the recommended 30 minutes a day all at once, but this can be broken up into smaller increments through the day. Not only does this relieve the stress of finding time, but it will also help maintain energy levels and mental health through the day. Try doing 10 minutes of exercise at a time spread through the day. Each increment can focus on a different aspect, such as cardio or strength., Walking with your baby in a stroller is a great way to begin getting exercise. When you feel up to it, try walking with the baby in a sling or carrier for the extra weight resistance. You can also try yoga, stretching and dance exercises that can be done with your child.


If you are unsure how to work your baby into a fitness routine check the local gyms and health clubs for mommy and baby classes.

Learn from any mistakes you made.,
Remind yourself you are only human.,
Make an honest assessment of your marriage.,
Tear down your assumptions about divorce.,
Make positive changes to combat negativity from guilt.",How to Deal With Guilt After a Divorce1," A big cause of guilt is a nagging that mistakes were made and had things been done differently, the marriage would have lasted. We can't change the past and feelings of guilt won't change that. Rather than use the past as a reason to hold you back, recognize things you wish you had done differently and use them for positive change in the future. Sometimes healthy guilt can be useful and a way to recognize unhealthy behavior from your past. Since you may not want to, or be unable, to make things right with your ex, you can learn from your mistakes moving forward. Change future relationships and go out of your way to show those around you that you are making positive changes to your life.;
, Unhealthy guilt is when you dwell on things you cannot change, but many times could not help. It's easy to create scenarios that make you the main guilty partner in your relationship. Allow yourself to accept that you are flawed, make mistakes, and that's okay.Tell yourself that you did what you thought was right at the time, based on your emotional and life circumstance. Accept that given the circumstances, you acted how your emotions and psychology dictated.

, Guilt from a divorce can come from putting unfair blame on yourself for the relationship's problems. It may help to take a step back and look at the relationship as a whole and how both parties contributed to a situation that became untenable.

, A big source of guilt is the negative connotations and stereotypes assigned by society. It's thought of as a failure, a flaw, and even frowned upon religiously. While these are difficult to deal with, you can remind yourself that you are only trying to be happy and that cultural stigmas are relative. Divorce has become increasingly common and society is constantly re-defining what should have a stigma. Only you understand the intricacies of your marriage and can understand why it was best; not outside perceptions.If you feel a stigma or pressure from people around you, communicate about it. Let them know your perception, and though you never got married with the purpose of getting divorced, it became an unfortunate reality. People who care about you should be able to support your decision.

, Guilt can color your future in a negative way. Rather than dwell in guilt, demonstrate to yourself the change was beneficial by making positive changes. A divorce can be a time to rediscover yourself as an individual.


Find what makes you happy. Find hobbies you stopped doing during you're marriage, take up a new skill that you put off, or even make a career change. This is a time for you to begin to focus on you again. This will assuage your guilt by reaffirming you can live a positive and fulfilling life after divorce.Keep a list of ways you're improving as a tangible reminder of how you're trying to thrive after your divorce. This sort of optimism can lessen the power of past guilt.

Deal with relationships with in-laws.,
Manage mutual friendships after divorce.,
Don't let guilt seep into parenting.,
Root for your ex to be a good parent.,
Don't pressure your child to make difficult choices.",How to Deal With Guilt After a Divorce2," Many times a marriage can result in you forming a very deep relationship with your in-laws, to the point of them becoming like family. It's obvious once you go through a divorce with their child, that relationship has to change. It is unfair to expect them to make a choice between you and their son or daughter, but you can still be amicable and even affectionate with in-laws after a divorce.


Be clear about your desires. If you want to still have a relationship with them, tell them how important they are to you but you understand how difficult the situation is.
If kids are involved, staying amicable and overall positive can be particularly important. You will want your kids to have grandparents in their lives in a positive way. Make sure to communicate that whatever differences you may have, it's extremely important that the children come first., While lawyers may be able to divide up properties and material belongings, friendships can be far more tricky. If you had mutual friendships, such as couples you'd regularly double date with, it can be difficult to manage these relationships after your divorce. You may be unlikely to hang out with those couples in the same way again and they may feel an urge to choose either you or your spouse, or even to remain neutral.Communicate and be open about difficulties. Talk to your friends about what they feel awkward about, what is giving them difficulties and what make your friendship work, given the circumstances.
Don't use your friendships as leverage or competition with your ex. This will only put your friends in a more difficult situation. Avoid talking negatively about your ex, and don't display resentment or jealousy if your friend is still communicating with your ex.

, Children can make guilt even more intense. You may feel like you're depriving your child of a full family, or that the divorce will have a severe detrimental affect to their life. Even though you may feel guilt, it's important to continue to serve as a parent and role model for children who are already dealing with the difficulties of divorce.Keep a child-centered divorce. Be consistent and reliable in time spent with your children and do not let difficulties between you and your spouse affect your parenting.
Don't try to be your children's best friend and try to win them over with gifts and bribes. They will need support but you shouldn't let your guilt promote bad parenting habits. But be empathetic to what they're experiencing.

, You can help assuage some of your guilt by making sure that your child will continue to have stable, loving parents, despite the divorce. Rather than trying to outdo your ex, communicate with them on ways you can both help your children.


Avoid putting the blame on either partner involved. Do your best to co-parent in the early stages so that the shock is not too great for the children. , If your child is of an age that they are able to influence who they will live with, no matter what do not make the child feel guilty for their decision. Also, do not let yourself feel guilty if they choose the other spouse. The child is in a difficult decision and any decision they make is hard."

There will usually be a structure where you can talk about the feelings you have and maybe even have a person in the group assigned to you that you can call when you're struggle. DivorceCare is one group that offers groups and seminars to help get over divorce and have locations in nearly every state.There will generally be support for people of all ages and of all stages in the divorce process. The groups generally sign something agreeing that everything said in the group is confidential so you don't have to worry that what you say will leave the group.

Show Tough Love.,
Continue to stretch your mind.",How to Be a Successful Stay at Home Mom," Our society downplays the stay at mom, but you know that your childis your greatest masterpiece. Feeling inferior will only sabotage your efforts to be successful in the home. You are the queen of your home. Act like one!;
, As a stay at home mother, you are your own boss. Only you will decide if things get done or not. A daily schedule and to do list are very important. Have a basic schedule in which you make time for housework, meals and snacks, naps, play time, study, and personal time. Each morning list five things to accomplish that day. More than five tasks can be overwhelming and create a sense of failure if they aren't completed. Any uncompleted task can be moved to the next day's to do list. Important note: be flexible. Stay at home moms are subject to many interruptions. Maintain routine but make room for changes if they arise. Set aside a nap time, that will help a lot.

, Too many stay at home mothers do not take care of themselves as they should because of their many responsibilities. Schedule in bubble baths, putting on makeup, hair appointments, anything that you need to work at your optimal level. Don't forget some girl time. Staying at home with kids all day can be overwhelming. You always need adult time. A happy, pampered mom is a better mom!

, Children need the security of a loving and firm mother. Requiring obedience from an early age will keep you from unnecessary conflicts and stress. Giving your children age appropriate tasks around the house teaches children to be assets to the family and to society. And it is giving them a sense of responsibility.

, Being at home does not have to limit your development! Learn something new everyday. Schedule in time to read, study, exercise, or write that novel. Be the best example of intelligence, character, and discipline to your children that you can be. You are their primary example.

Be able to admit that something you did may have been wrong, and don't be afraid to apologize.,
Respect your child's love for the other parent.,
Love your children more than anything.,
Make your child feel special.",How to Be a Good Mother," Never laugh at your kid's hobbies, interests or friends. Instead, help your child follow their dreams by providing support, encouragement and the opportunity to do so.


So, your daughter doesn't want to study medicine and become a doctor? Don't get angry, this is your child's life and they can make some of their own decisions.
Understand that it's okay if your child thinks differently than you. Don't get mad because they have a different opinion than yours.
Who cares if you daughter listens to hip hop music and wears an excessive amount of eyeliner? She's still your daughter.
You might not do what your kids do, but that is their decision, not yours. You have a big impact on their lives already: you choose what school they go to, when they eat dinner, the amount of allowance they get a week. Don't overdo it.;
, Being a mother is a little challenging sometimes. But keep your cool and try to stay patient. Try this approach to other problems. Stay calm, explain the practical reasons not to do something, and then why you don't want them to do something.

, If your son likes music, buy him a guitar and watch him play. Ask questions about music, like his favorite kind of music or his favorite song. If your daughter is interested in fashion, take her out for a shopping spree. Ask her what her favorite thing about fashion is.


Your child might have some interests that you can't understand, no matter how much you try. That's okay. Just do your best to be supportive in a positive interest.

, Okay, so blowing money day after day isn't the best thing to do, but don't automatically say no to everything your kid asks for. If you always say no and follow this with a lecture about saving money, you will be known as the ""Tight Parent"", the one who never buys anything. Buy something small every now and then. Even offering to purchase some candy or chips at the store can make a difference. Every now and then, buy something big that you are sure your kid wants. For example, an iPod in their favorite color, or maybe a nice computer. And be generous at birthdays - maybe buy them something they have been hinting they want for a while. You can also take them out to a special dinner, see a movie, and choose a nice gift or receive nice gifts from parents.

, Try your hardest to always be understanding and a good listener. Knowing that they can go to their mom for friendship advice, homework help, or just a hug goes a long way for kids. Not having someone they can talk to can cause kids to retreat into a shell, so make sure you talk to them about how they feel regularly.

, It might be hard, but it's better for everyone if you just admit to your mistakes and apologize. It saves everyone the trouble of being mad that you're being stubborn and teaches your kids that it's okay to make mistakes, as well as the importance of an apology. Simply calm yourself, evaluate the situation, determine what you did wrong and why. Then apologize and explain how or why you acted the way you did. A good way to start off may be: ""I would like to apologize for how I acted earlier, and I realize that I was wrong,"" then transition into the rest.

, You should not be jealous of your child loving their father, grandparents, aunt, cousin, uncle, brother, sister or friends.

, Without loving them, it means nothing whatever you do in your life. Understand whenever you love your child or not, somehow deep in your child's heart, they will love you forever whenever they are loved, or not.

, Give them goodnight kisses, hugs and normal kisses, let them sit on your knee and show your love by sharing your memories and dreams and with special endearments (darling, honey, love) and nicknames.

Appreciate your children for who they are.",How to Be a Cool Mom," When they do start to open up to you about deeper things going on in their lives, remember to listen lovingly and without judgement. At the same time, don’t expect them to tell you everything. Respect their space, privacy, and independence and trust that you can have a strong relationship without knowing every aspect of their lives.Express your willingness to listen by saying something like “David, I want you to know that I love you unconditionally and am always here to support and listen to any problems you might be having. Even if you know I won’t like what you’re saying, I want you to know I’m here to listen without judgement.”;
, Whether it’s a conversation about school, relationships, politics, or the weather, talking with your children is an important part of being a cool mom. Talking to your children is not always easy, particularly at the difficult ages, such as during the teen years. However, making an effort to communicate and listen to your children’s thoughts, feelings, and opinions will have a last impact on your relationship with him or her and your status as a cool mom.


Ask your children questions. For example “What was the best part about school today?” or “How did it make you feel when Jan didn’t invite your other friends to her birthday party?” or “Does it make you upset when your boyfriend is late to pick you up for a date?” are ways to get a conversation started. Once the conversation is started, you might get more insight into your children’s feelings and opinions than you thought possible.

, Particularly if your children approach you with an important or sensitive issue, they deserve all of your attention. For example, it is really important that in our technological age, you put your phone down when talking to your childrenShow them that they are your first priority.


Turn off the radio or the television. It is difficult to give someone your full attention if there are other distractions around you.
Don’t interrupt. Even if it’s difficult, try to hear your children out and attempt not to lecture. If your children feel like they are in for a lecture every time she talks to you, she will be less willing to do so.
Show you care through your body language. Turn toward your child so you can properly engage with him in conversation. Make eye contact, and keep your facial expressions as neutral as possible.
Accept that you may not always like what you hear. Inevitably, your children will do, say, or believe things that you disagree with. However, it is important to keep an open ear, and as much as possible, an open mind.

, Just as it is important to listen to your children, part of being a cool mom is being honest with your children in return. This will help you to gain their their trust and respect.


Let your children know you make mistakes. Don’t be afraid to admit to your children if you’ve messed up, and don’t be afraid to apologize for it. Showing that you’re human too will help your children feel that they can relate to you in a more realistic way.
Talk to your children about your own life experiences. For example, you might want to tell them about a time that you got caught in a lie by your own mother, or got in trouble at school. Explain to them the triumphs and tribulations that you faced on your journey to adulthood. They will appreciate the feeling that you can relate to them.

, A tender touch from mom can go a long way if your child has had a bad day at school or a fight with a friend. All humans crave a physical touch, so a warm embrace (or however else you choose to show affection) or a kiss can strengthen your relationship with you child.Don’t underestimate the primal power of a physical touch.Affection is also a good way to show that you are proud of your children. Cool moms aren’t afraid to tell their children they are proud of them, and they aren’t afraid to show it either.
If you aren’t the physically affectionate type, express your feelings for your children verbally. A simple “I love you” or “You’re fantastic kids” will boost your children’s confidence and strengthen your bond.

, When your children are in front of their friends or peers, it is probably not the best time to be overly affectionate. However, when you are alone at home, it is a great time to show affection to your children. Make sure you choose to show or tell your children you love them at times that they won’t find embarrassing. In particular, avoid getting overly affectionate in public.

, Get to know their friends, learn the rules of the sports they play, find out what they think is the coolest part of the hobbies they enjoy. Ask your children questions about the things they like to do and why. Even if you don’t actively engage in these activities with your children, make an attempt to understand them.Attend their choral concerts, sporting events, school plays, piano recitals, etc. Nothing makes a cooler mom than one that is in the audience supporting their children. Make being present a priority, and if you can, become involved. For example, bring orange slices for your child’s soccer team for them to eat during a half-time break.Ask them to show you how to do one of their favorite hobbies, and give it a try. This will make your children feel like you are truly interested in their lives. Alternatively, involve your children in your hobbies.Research shows that engaging your child in your hobbies will bring you and your child together., Never try to corral your children into doing particular activities if they are interested in other things.


When your children find activities and hobbies they are interested in, be engaged without being overwhelming. Become involved with their hobbies and interests, but allow them to explore and develop their passions on their own in a way that lets them grow and develop alongside their peers. Show an appropriate level of enthusiasm- this may mean always being in attendance at your child’s soccer games, but not bringing you own megaphone to cheer him on.

, social media. Learning to use the latest social media that is probably utilized by your children can be a great way to show that you’re up to date with the latest technology. In addition to making you a cool mom, it also provides you with a subtle way to keep an eye on your children’s friends and activities.


Become “friends” with you children on social media, but don’t suffocate them. While having a Facebook profile may make you a cool mom, posting on your children’s page constantly or commenting on their activities in an overly protective way will likely take you out of cool mom territory and make your children regret your online presence. Limit your Facebook interactions (and Instagram, Twitter, etc.) to “likes” and maybe a rare comment.
Draw boundaries. It’s unwise to post overly personal statements or sentiments on your children’s social media. Never scold your children about their social media use on their social media page; instead, use it as an opportunity to have an open, honest, and productive conversation with your child. Keep some distance on social media.

, Designate a special day (it can be once a month, once a season, or once a year) and make it a day that you dedicate to spending one-on-one time with one of your children.Pick a separate day for each child to allow some important parent-child bonding to take place. Whether you do the same activity each time or try new things, you and your child will both value the time you spend together. Here are some suggestions for how to spend the day:


Have a girls’ glamour day: go shopping, get a massage, have your nails done, have a fancy lunch out, and drink champagne (or go out for “mocktails” or milkshakes if your child is not of legal drinking age).
Try a class. Whether it’s a yoga class at the gym, a cooking class at a local restaurant, or a pottery class at an art studio, try an organized activity to make new memories.
Go to a special event. Do your children have a favorite sports team or favorite band? If you can, take them to a live event; if not, plan a special “date” to watch the game or show on TV.

, Meeting the people with whom your children spends the majority of their time is an important part of being a parent and can solidify your role as cool mom. While being a cool mom doesn’t mean that you need to let them engage in activities that you may not be comfortable with, this does mean that you must make an effort to accept their friends for who they are.


Accept that some of your children’s friends will start to feel like your own children, while others will never do more than mutter “hello.” The most important thing is to make your children feel like they can be friends with anyone.

, Encourage your children to bring their friends over to your house. More importantly, make your home a place where they can feel comfortable and a place where they want to spend time.Be present, but not overbearing. It’s a great idea to stop in to the room your children and his friends are hanging out in and say hello, but don’t overstay your welcome. Keep an eye on the activities going on, but don’t hover.

, Don’t try to fill the role of older sister or best friend if it means neglecting your role as mom.


Don’t be afraid to say no. Sometimes, as a mother, you will be forced to make the unpopular decision. While this is a demonstration of your love for your children, it is unlikely that they will see it that way. This is when you must play your primary role- mom.
Be there whenever and wherever they need you. Your mom may be the only person who won’t get mad at a 1am phone call “just to talk” if you’ve had a particularly bad day. Be that person for your children and be prepared to offer guidance, wisdom, and a listening ear at all hours of the day.
Keep some distance. Allow your children to have their own experiences, make their own choices, and live their own life.Watch them grow up into the people you helped them to become.

, Make rules and stick to them. Ensure that any punishment fits the crime. While disciplining your children may not make you a cool mom at the time, you are teaching a lesson and instilling values that will inevitably make you a cool mom as your children grow up and realizes that everything you do is out of love.

, Whether it’s raising their allowance, treating them to a meal at a favorite restaurant, or taking them to an amusement park or cinema, giving your kids a treat will make you the coolest mom around.


Don’t use these treats as a bribe. Instead, use them as a reward or as a “just because you’re you” present. This will encourage your children’s positive behavior and make them feel special.

, Your children will keep secrets, and this is an important part of growing up.Being overly nosy or snooping in your children’s personal belongings is a surefire way to create tension in your relationship. Unless you believe you have a real reason to worry about something your children may be doing, respect their personal space and allow them to have secrets.


If you feel your children may be engaged in something that is potentially harmful to themselves or to someone around them, it is important to talk to them and address the issue as soon as possible. This doesn’t give you permission to snoop, but in extenuating circumstances, you may need to breach your children’s privacy if you feel they are threatened in any way.

, Your children need boundaries, and will respect you for setting them.Remember that your children need you as a parent first and foremost, and as a friend after.

, The most special thing about your children is that they will grow into totally unique people who have their own dreams, desires, ambitions, and emotions. The easiest and best way to be a cool mom is to simply love your children and guide them as they grow.

Make it clear what the rules are.,
Establish responsibilities in the household.,
Enforce rules consistently.,
Respect your partner’s rules.,
Re-evaluate the rules.",How to Be a Strict Mom1," Do not expect your children to read your mind. When you set rules, explain them to the entire household. You can even post certain rules on the fridge. This will help your children understand how to act in the house and why you are disciplining them when they get in trouble. Children should realize that they are in trouble because of their choices, not because you are mad. Some good rules to set include:



Rules about safety: Hold an adult’s hand while you cross the street. Don’t go near the stove while someone is cooking.

Rules about manners: Always say please and thank you. Wait your turn in line.

Rules about interacting with others: Share your toys. Don’t push other kids. Don't call other people names.

Rules about house routines: Put away toys when you are done with them. Don’t touch the thermostat. Clean your dishes when you are done with them.

Rules about going out: Be home by curfew. Call if you will be late. Get permission if you are going to a friend’s house after school. No drinking alcohol.;
, Everybody in the household should contribute in some way. You can do this by setting up a chore wheel in the kitchen or by giving everybody a certain responsibility in the house. In addition to cleaning their own rooms, children should help with the house chores. Even toddlers can do age-appropriate chores, such as picking up toys and clothes from the floor. It is up to you whether or not you pay your children an allowance for their chores. Chores include:


Washing the dishes after a meal
Feeding pets
Vacuuming the carpet
Washing the windows
Putting away groceries
Mowing the lawn

, When your children break a rule, they should be disciplined. Do not let them off the hook once but punish them another time. This will make your rules seem flexible or negotiable. For minor rule breaks, a firm talking may solve the issue, but you should still remind them that the rules are in place for a reason.While consistency is good, you might change the discipline if your child has been honest with you about breaking a rule. Explain to them that you appreciate them coming to you. This is especially important with teenagers, so that they are willing to come to you when they are in trouble.

, If you are raising your children with a partner, be sure that they agree with your rules. They should also enforce these same rules. If children realize that one parent is more lenient than another, they will start to find loopholes in the house rules. If your partner establishes a certain rule, you should enforce it as well.


If you are divorced or if your child’s other parent has a separate household, you should both agree on some common rules. Establish what rules are the most important. This will give your children some consistency.If you cannot agree on rules, you should ask a counselor to mediate for you.

, As your children grow up, they need different rules and responsibilities. You may even decide to trust them with more liberties than they had when they were younger. Periodically, examine your household rules and whether they are working or not. Adjust them as needed.

Make sure to explain rule changes to children. You might say, ""Now that you are older, I expect that you will help take care of the dog more"" or ""Since you can drive now, I want you to know that you have a new curfew of 9 o clock.""

"
"
Use a calm, firm voice.,
Show them the consequences of their actions.,
Take away toys and privileges.,
Put younger children in time out.,
Ground teenagers.",How to Be a Strict Mom2," You can raise your voice, but avoid yelling at your children. You will find that you are becoming more upset than they are. Instead, use a stern but level tone that indicates you are not pleased. This will demonstrate that you are in control.If you are upset, angry, or unable to keep calm, do not discipline your child yet. Find a quiet, safe room where you can become level-headed first. With very young children, however, you may need to discipline them immediately.

, Effective discipline shows children that their actions have consequences. This will prepare them for the difficult choices they may have to make later in life. There are two types of consequence-based punishment. These are:



Logical Consequences: When your children break a rule, you create a consequence by punishing them.This is effective on young children under the age of five who might not yet realize the effect of their actions.For example, if your toddler throws a tantrum, put them in time-out.

Natural consequences: In non-dangerous situations, you let your children make a mistake and learn from the consequences that occur as a result.You can start doing this when your child is a toddler up through their teens. For example, if an older child does not do their homework, do not help them with it. Instead, let them get in trouble at school. After school, discuss with them the effect of their actions, and let them know that you expect better from them in the future., If your children consistently break the rules, you should take away something they enjoy for a brief period of time. Do this immediately after they break the rule.Only take away the privilege for a certain period of time. When you return it, make it clear that if they do not behave, it will be taken again.


For younger children, you might threaten to take away a bedtime story or morning cartoons.
Older children might respond better if you temporarily take away a video game console or TV time.
If you have a teenager, you might want to take away their phone, chargers, or internet access for non-school related matters.Never take away something the child needs. For example, do not take away meals.While you might sometimes put your child in time-outs during special events, make sure that your child can still socialize, even when they misbehave. Childhood is an important time to learn social skills.

, Set a certain area in your house to be the official “time out” spot. Warn your children that they will be put there if they do not follow the rules. When they do get sent there, set a time limit. One minute per year of age is a good measure. Do not let them leave before the time is up., For teenagers, being grounded is the social equivalent of time out. You have taken away their ability to go out with friends. This can be effective to discipline your teenager if done correctly. Set a reasonable time period that they will be grounded for. They should not be grounded for more than a few days.If your teenager has a birthday party or a dance coming up, warn them that their bad behavior may prevent them from going.If they want to go, they will have to make it up to you, either by taking on more chores or writing an apologetic letter to you.
Do not strip away all of their privileges at once. You may find your teenager is acting out more because they have nothing left to lose."
"
Explain why your rules are important.,
Learn to say no.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Avoid name calling.",How to Be a Strict Mom3," Children are not born with an innate sense of rules. They may not understand why you have such rules in place. Explain that you are trying to teach them important lessons about the world. Let them know in a kind manner that you love them, which is why you want them to help them learn how to survive in life.You can say, “We have rules in this house because we love you and we want you to be successful. You will always find that there are rules in life, and it’s important for you to learn how to live by them.”

, Children and teenagers often like to test their boundaries. They may plead or cry, but you should be firm in saying no when you do not want them to do or have something. If they respond with a tantrum, stand firm. Do not give in, or else you reward their behavior.


Instead of telling your children that they cannot do or have something, tell them instead what they can do. For example, instead of saying, “No ice cream before dinner,” say, “you can have an apple instead.”You might try to explain why you said no. For example, “You have to wear your coat outside, or you could get sick.”You can explain the reason why you said no once or twice, but do not repeat yourself constantly if your child keeps asking.
Older children might try to reason with you to convince you to change your mind. If they are respectful and rational, you might consider giving in. This does not make you weak. Rather, it rewards them for reacting in a mature manner instead of throwing a fit.

, When your children do something right, praise them. They will quickly learn what acceptable behavior is. Your children will associate good behavior with positive attention. Furthermore, by not constantly scolding them, you will develop a stronger relationship with your child.


For example, when they say please and thank you to a server at a restaurant, you can say, “I’m so proud of your good manners.”
You can also give your child rewards when they have done well. For example, you can say, ""I'm so proud of how well you have been doing in school that I am going to take you out to ice cream.""

, Being a strict mom does not mean you have to insult or swear at your child. Name calling can be harmful to a child’s self-esteem, and it will not encourage them to improve their attitude.If you feel yourself getting irrationally angry at your children, try to calm yourself down. Take a deep breath. Count to five before speaking to your child. Leave the room for a few minutes if you need to."

Stay positive at all times.,
Try to not worry too much.,
Try to remain calm and keep your cool.,
Try to cut back and make time and room for parenting.,
Ensure that you have support from a family member.,
Take time to maintain your other relationships.,
Go easy on yourself if you have to shift your obligations.,
Be forgiving of yourself.,
Have fun and enjoy your new baby.,
Give yourself a huge congrats on getting to be a mother.",How to Be a New Mom1," Your or your spouse's being negative about anything will discourage you. More importantly, the baby develops its psyche under whatever conditions it is brought up in. So be careful what you say about yourself and your baby. Reasonably happy parents make for a better-adjusted, smiling baby.


Believe that you can be a good mom, and you will be. Believe that your baby is going to be a good baby, and he or she will be, or at least you will ensure that he/she will be.;
, To worry about anything drains your energy. Worrying does not solve any problems. It makes the problems seem bigger than they really are.


If your baby gets a fever, for example, try to not worry right away that he/she will get brain damage, etc. Most fevers go away after about 24 hours. Just give your baby some medication as directed by the label, and everything will most likely be okay. Let your baby sleep as much as they want to to fight off the fever.
If your baby is crying and you can't figure out why, it may be because of gas and that they need to be burped. Usually babies cry when they are hungry, for the most part, but their needing to burp is something that is harder for moms to think of. Sometimes you will have changed your baby, fed your baby, but they are still crying and it might be driving you crazy. Don't worry, every mom has been there, at a loss and not knowing what else to do. You may just need to pat their back and hold them upright so that they can burp.

Swaddling your baby can also comfort them and help them to stop crying, if the crying continues after feeding and burping.

, Don't worry too much if you make a mistake or lightly bump your baby's head, and don't let your spouse worry too much either.

,


Take as much time off work as you can in this time so you won't have to worry about sleeping so many hours every night so that you are rested for work.
If you can, move to a smaller house or cheaper apartment so that your family can survive on one income until your baby is older.

, You can't do this huge new job on your own. You will feel overwhelmed if you don't have any help at all.


If at all possible, make sure you are living near supportive family members.  You will definitely need their help and advice. Also whenever you have questions, Google whatever it might be. You can find the answer to pretty much anything online.
You have to have breaks, even if it's just going to the store by yourself, baby free, once a week. Try to get your mom or mother in law to babysit once a week, so you can relax and recapture the peaceful life you had before taking on all this responsibility.

, Still have friends after your new baby comes. If you used to go to a book group or religious group, keep going. It helps a lot to have other women to talk to about being a mom.


Make sure you maintain a healthy relationship with your spouse and don't let the baby consume all of your time. It can be easy for your husband to get jealous of a new baby, but if you still do things together, that will help. Watch movies together, play games, or go shopping.

, You probably won't be able to do everything that you did before your baby arrived.


If you used to go to church every Sunday, don't stress yourself out too much if you can't make it to church on Sundays anymore. You can find alternatives during this phase of your life, such as watching online church services or going to a mid-week Bible study when a babysitter is available.
Be flexible and refrain from forcing yourself to go out when you know the baby might have a very hard time in the nursery, etc.

, Have grace with yourself. You don't have to be the perfect mom, because no one alive can be a perfect mom. We all make mistakes, but always know that is okay.


Don't blame yourself for not being perfect. Realize it would be impossible to be. Don't expect too much of yourself or anyone else.

, Don't just take care of him or her.  Play with your baby, laugh with them, and make faces and noises at them. Dress them up in tons of cute outfits. Take lots of pictures.  Learn to enjoy this time because it goes by quickly.

,  Not everyone gets to be one. Remember to be incredibly thankful everyday that you have the most precious gift in the entire world. Recognize that it is a tremendous privilege to get to be a mom. You are a very lucky and very fortunate woman.

Learn ways to make being a mom easier on yourself.,
Prop the bottle up on a blanket.,
Get a swing.,
Use diaper rash cream often.,
Breastfeed your baby.,
Utilize a sleep training regimen to avoid too many sleepless nights and promote good sleep habits for your baby.Although studies suggest that babies who ""cried it out"" had no significant short-term or long-term change in their development as opposed to babies whose parents used check-and-console or ""camping out"" sleep training regimens, such regimens positively impacted the psychological and sleep-related health of the parent and child.",How to Be a New Mom2," It is hard enough to be employed 24/7 as a parent. The hours can be a very hard adjustment to make.


Your life now revolves around your new little one. You have to deny yourself and serve your new baby in almost every single hour of your day. You keep getting your sleep interrupted. You can't get outside as much as you might want to. Remember to give yourself breaks sometimes: listen to fun music or watch some good movies.

, This will free your hands so that you can get some work done.  Sometimes, this can be a nice break which will allow you to get things done or just relax for a bit.

, Nothing will do more for making your life easier than getting a swing. Fisher Price is a good brand; they seem to be durable and last longer. Babies are used to motion, because when they were in your tummy, they rocked and rolled all over the place whenever you moved around.


Swinging is a good way to get your baby to sleep, since they are moving like they are used to. You can try rocking them yourself, but it can be hard to set them down after you've rocked them to sleep. Babies usually wake up when you lay them down in their crib etc. A swing saves you from having to worry about that.
It is possible for a baby to sleep in a swing, one that reclines back, or a bassinet, since co-sleeping is not recommended.Swing sleeping can give you peace of mind that your baby is strapped in and won't be able to roll on their tummy, which can be dangerous for them and cause SIDS.You can also give them their bottles in the swing. You can hold the bottle for them or, as mentioned before, you can prop the bottle up on a blanket to make things easier for you.

, With disposable diapers, babies get rashes a lot. This can lead to a lot of crying and discomfort for them.


Sometimes babies resist diaper changing time, or are extra fussy, because they have a rash. 

, Milk is much cheaper than formula, and is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics because it provides the necessary nutrients that are easily digestible by your baby and is associated with a lower risk of SIDS.If you are switching from milk from formula, mix the formula with milk. You need to slowly wean your baby off of the formula.  If you don't do this, they may become constipated and unhappy.  Constipation happens with an abrupt change in diet, so make transitions in food ""slow and easy"".

,""Camping out"" refers to the parent staying in the room for increasingly shorter periods of time when the baby is crying, while ""check-and-console"" refers to the parent returning to check on the baby at increasingly longer intervals.Don't neglect your baby if you suspect there is a serious problem—attend to their needs as best you can.

, Track your rent or mortgage, utilities, phone bill, insurance, car payments, student loan payments, food and other expenses that you have every month.

, These include entertainment expenses, birthday and holiday gifts, vacations, school fundraisers, magazine subscriptions, cable TV, and so on.

, Be sure to calculate whether you will be able to handle unforeseen expenses, such as a new transmission in your car, or a locksmith if you get locked out of your house, or a trip to the emergency room.

, Going to work can cost money, even though you’re earning money. Make a list of expenses associated with work, such as gas money, parking, dry cleaning, getting a morning coffee, bus fare, and so on.Think about take-out food as well. When you’re tired from a long day at work and you don’t want to cook, you may be more likely to eat out or order take-out.

, If both parents work, then your children will need some form of childcare. Daycare can be very expensive, especially if the child is in full-time daycare. The average annual cost of daycare now exceeds in-state college tuition in 36 states.Calculate how much income you would bring in if you were working. Balance this with how much money you’d need to spend on childcare if you were not at home with your child.A grandparent or other relative may be able to care for the child, thus reducing childcare expenses.

, Figure out areas that you can cut so that you can afford to stay at home. If you regularly get coffee at the local coffee shop, think about making coffee at home and saving $3 every day. If you subscribe to magazines, think about cutting out these subscriptions.


A good way to determine what you can cut is to track your spending for two months. Write down everything you spend money on, down to the penny. Keep a notebook with you at all times, or track it on your phone. Tally up your receipts. You may find that you are spending a lot of money on frivolous things that you don’t need., If you are not going to work, you won’t be adding to a retirement fund, paying into social security, or contributing to a 401(k). Depending on how long you plan to stay at home with your child, these lost earnings may not last long. But they are something to consider.Also consider that if you step out of the workforce, you may have to restart your career track at a lower earning rate than you would have if you’d never left the workforce. Women especially are subject to lower pay. Unfortunately, not working for even a few years can have a potentially detrimental effect on what you might earn.

, If your income is very low, you may be eligible for food stamps or other public assistance. Check with your state’s Department of Human Services to find out more.


For example, the federal government program, Women, Infant and Children (WIC), provides supplemental food, nutrition education and other benefits to low-income families."

Prioritize the basic tasks.,
Make loose schedules for your kids.,
Schedule household chores for certain days.,
Plan your meals.",How to Be a Stay at Home Mom2," Stay at home moms, especially ones with new babies, can feel overwhelmed at the thought of running the entire household. You may be exhausted from taking care of an infant who doesn’t sleep at night, for example. Keeping up with kids’ demands all day can make it hard to get things done. Strive to get the basics done.Get the kids up, dressed and fed. Get yourself showered, dressed and fed. These two things will help you on your way to feeling more on top of it.

, Depending on your child’s age, it can be very helpful to have consistent schedules. You know that your daughter wakes up every morning around 6:30 a.m. You know she takes a nap at 10:00 a.m. You know she needs lunch when she wakes up at noon. You may need to pick up your older son from school at 2:45 p.m. Plan a schedule for your kids.


Keep the schedule flexible, so you can accommodate unplanned activities.
As your kids get a little older, adjust the schedule in a way that makes sense for their ages and interests.

, It may be helpful to choose one day of the week to be laundry day, another day for grocery shopping, another for baking. While your family may generate a ton of laundry, saving it for Tuesdays will keep you from feeling like you’re constantly doing laundry.Enlist your kids to help you with chores. Preschoolers can help sort laundry, kindergarteners can help unload the dishwasher, and older kids can make dinner once in a while.

, Make a meal menu for the week. This will help you in knowing what to buy at the grocery store. You can also plan meals around leftovers. For example, you can roast a chicken one night and use the bones for a chicken soup the next night.

Take regular trips to the library.,
Rotate toys in and out of use.",How to Be a Stay at Home Mom3," When you find other families with young children, schedule playdates. Invite the other parent and child to your house. Once you get to know each other, you might find yourself scheduling a weekly playdate. You might even be able to trade off childcare.

, Visit local landmarks, parks, factories, and other places to enrich your children’s education. This can be especially helpful in breaking up the day when you have small children at home.

, Give your kids a chance to get messy and creative. Plan arts and crafts projects that align with their interests. For example, if your child loves playing with play dough, try making handmade ornaments out of salt dough. If your child loves drawing, practice making a story book.


Build up a cache of materials to use in arts and crafts projects. This might include toilet paper tubes and paper towel tubes, egg cartons, ribbons, string, cellophane, pipe cleaners, and so on.

, Build library visits into your weekly schedule. This is a good opportunity to nurture a love for reading.


Most libraries hold story times that are age-specific. These can be wonderful opportunities to meet other families.

, If there are too many toys available, young kids may get overwhelmed with the choices. It can be hard to focus on one activity when there are 10 other possible activities in immediate view. Select some toys to remove from use and store them out of sight. Every few weeks, bring these toys back into circulation, removing and storing other toys."

Join a mommy group.,
Connect with other stay-at-home parents.,
Schedule playdates with other kids.,
Volunteer with a local charity.,
Have a social network online.",How to Be a Stay at Home Mom4," Lots of communities have mommy groups that hold regular get-togethers. Your children will be the same ages, and you can share advice and stories about raising your kids. You may be able to find a mommy group through your hospital or pediatrician, church, library, community organization or local university., Introduce yourself to parents at the park, playground, dance class, and soccer practice. In order to keep yourself from being isolated, you will need to find other parents with schedules like yours. You can still connect with your working friends, but they won’t likely be available on weekday mornings. Having other stay-at-home parents in your circle of friends will help keep you in a social network.

, When you find other families with young children, schedule playdates. Invite the other parent and child to your house. Once you get to know each other, you might find yourself scheduling a weekly playdate. You might even be able to trade off childcare.

, Find a nonprofit organization or other charitable cause whose mission you support. Schedule regular volunteering at this place. It might be an animal shelter, an arts organization, a nature conservancy or other organization. This will help you connect with others who have like-minded interests as well.


You may choose to volunteer at places that are child-friendly. This can be a great experience for children to learn about giving back to the community and helping others.
You might also want to volunteer at your child’s school.

, You might also find it useful to have a community of friends online. You might not always be able to see each other in person, especially when one kid has the flu or another kid is taking a nap. But staying in touch online can give you another social outlet to share stories and solicit advice.

Be honest with yourself.,
Split chores fairly.,
Be good to yourself.,
Get a babysitter.,
Go out in the evening.,
Get exercise.,
Have hobbies that you can do at home.",How to Be a Stay at Home Mom5," Staying at home with your child can be very hard. Studies show that stay-at-home-moms may experience more depression, worry, sadness, and anger than working moms. This is partly due to isolation, under-appreciation and little contact with adults during the day. The schedule for a stay-at-home mom is intense as well, with no time off, no sick leave, and no vacation time.Know that these feelings are common. If you’re feeling this way, you’re not the only one. You should be honest with yourself so that you are making the healthiest choice for yourself and your family.

, Just because you are the stay-at-home parent, this doesn’t mean that you should have to do all the household chores. Work with the other parent to assign tasks fairly. For example, your partner can make dinner some nights, or do the dishes, or put in a load of laundry.


It can be common to think that you haven’t done any “work” just because you’ve been at home all day. Remember, taking care of children and the home is very hard work. Plus, you get no breaks and very little time for yourself. Make sure you aren’t carrying all the weight at home.

, Treat yourself to a movie, schedule time for a massage, and meet up with a friend for coffee. Don’t feel guilty about nurturing yourself. You will be a better parent and person when you take care of yourself too.

, While you intend to save money on childcare by not working, this doesn’t mean that you have to be at home with the kids 100% of the time. You and your partner still need time together without the kids. Make time every few weeks to have a date.

, Schedule regular times after your partner comes home from work when you can go out by yourself. You might use this time to run errands without kids, see a movie, or visit a friend.

, Exercise can help relieve stress and tension that may build up when you spend your days with children. You may need to schedule exercise time when your partner is home with the kids, or when your kids are at school. You can also schedule time when your kids need to be quiet so that you can do a yoga video in your living room. Whatever you choose, make it a priority for yourself.


Take the kids for a bike ride, or buy a jogging stroller so you can go for a run with the baby.
Some communities have mommy exercise classes, such as Baby Boot Camp or Fit4Mom. In these classes, you exercise with other parents while your child sits in a jogging stroller.

, Just because you’re at home with your children doesn’t mean that everything you do must be child-focused. Find some hobbies that you can do while your children play.


You might take up gardening, sewing, playing a musical instrument, building something, painting, photography, and so on.
Spend some time reading. Taking quiet time for yourself may encourage your kids to spend the time reading as well.

Create a better world.",How to Be a Bohemian Mother," One of the main tenants of the boho lifestyle is to understand that less is more; material wealth does not equate to happiness. To be a bohemian mother and mentor, you must first embrace this for yourself.Do not put value in owning new things. Avoid buying new items just to be trendy and fashionable. Try to only purchase things for you and your children that you actually need, not want.
Try to enjoy non-materialism in your life, such as embracing friendship and life. Teach your children that friendship is important and longer lasting than just things. Encourage children to meet new kids their age at school or during activities.
Find joy in the everyday. If you struggle with this, try writing down three things that make you happy during the day. This can be an excellent activity to do with your children.;
, As with material wealth, social prestige can be a driving force in our modern society. To pursue a true boho lifestyle, do not try and be the best, brightest, richest, or flashiest.


Be friends with people from different social classes and encourage your children to be the same. Rather, do not put emphasis on how much money people make. That shouldn’t be a determining factor in friendship.
Encourage children to work on their creativity or their own skills rather than trying to be “cool.”

, Freedom of expression is a recognized inalienable right in the United States and is being fought for by the United Nations.. Do not take this right for granted.


Use this right to protest or demonstrate the rights you believe in.
Explore different social, religious, or political parties without fear of legal persecution (at least in the United States).
Get your kids involved in something that interests them. Help them research and pick causes that they want to stand up for.

, Sustainable living is protecting the environment and community in which we live. Being responsible in buying and consumption can go a long way in making a better future for the next generation.There are a few simple things you, and your children, can do to live a more sustainable lifestyle.

, This is a simple way to live sustainably is to recycle glass, paper, and plastic. Many communities have recycling programs. Check with your garbage collection program to see if they have an option for you.Have your kids get involved by separating plastic, glass, and paper. Getting them to establish a habit early in life will help them continue the Boho ideals.

, This will less harmful on the environment and more healthy for you and your children. There are many easy recipes to create natural cleaners with many purposes around the home.For example, baking soda and vinegar make an excellent cleaning agent for carpet, glass, and general grime.

, This reduces waste and is a more renewable way to carry your groceries or purchases.Explain to your children the importance of reusing items. You can get them interested by having them paint on their own reusable bags! Make them unique and fun to use., Drinking from a plastic bottle can be very wasteful and produce a lot of garbage. Buying lunch every day can be very expensive and also produce a lot of garbage. By simply changing to a reusable water bottle and lunchbox, you are reducing your waste and saving money!Create unique lunch boxes for your children. They can help decorate them so that involved with sustainability and artistic expression.

, You and your children can grow your own food and learn respect for mother nature by planting a garden. If you do not have the green space, you can still grow an indoor herb garden.Teaching children to garden is a great way to teach them all sorts of things, from science to life to sustainability to nutrition!

, Modern technology can supplement the bohemian lifestyle well when it comes to sustainability. Renewable energy technology makes it easier than ever before to go green. Electric cars and solar panels are just a few ways you can reduce your carbon footprint and be more bohemian in your home., Cloth diapers are great and renewable. This is a sustainable way and is considered healthier than other alternatives..

, Breastfeeding is the natural way to feed your children. There are many benefits for natural breastfeeding, including creating a healthy immune system for you and your baby., There are many benefits to wearing your child in a baby sling or papoose.It promotes physical development for the child, it is convenient, and it promotes security.

, Find like-minded parents to help you with your quest in bohemian motherhood. Having like-minded parents can help you answer questions, discuss options, and express the bohemian lifestyle!, Do not expect your children to fit into socially constructed roles. Let your children explore hobbies and lifestyles in order to let them find what makes them happy.


This includes letting your children explore gender identity. Do not try and push them into a specific gender or role.

, Giving material gifts to your children just reinforces the pursuit of material goods. For holidays, birthdays, or special occasions, give you children gifts that will help them respect a bohemian lifestyle and enjoy life.Try giving tickets to an event such as a play or a concert.
Take them to a class to introduce a new hobby.
Them them to a park or zoo to learn something new and have fun.

, To uphold the boho lifestyle, you want your children to explore, grow, and learn. However, they might still test your parental authority. It is important to be consistent in your discipline, but not to stifle their growth.Discipline with love by listening and communicating how you want your child to behave.
Remain calm
Never physically harm your child.

, Get involved in your child’s life! Play with them. Explore with them. Take a class with them. This will help strengthen your bond with your child, and encourage your own creativity., There are many skills that have been forgotten or neglected in the modern age.

Crocheting
Gardening
Woodworking
Speaking/Reading a different language
Writing/poetry
Cooking

Schedule coffee or lunch dates every few months to stay in contact and update each other on what’s happening in your lives. You may hear of an opportunity that will work into your stay-at-home life, or you may decide you want to start work again.

, Read trade magazines, newsletters and other industry updates to keep yourself knowledgeable about what’s happening in your industry. Attend workshops or conferences to learn about new practices or products., Many stay-at-home parents balance competing desires to stay home and continue a professional career by finding part-time work.

When it comes to wardrobe the choices become even more personal.,
Little things like wearing jewelry, a hat, a fashion scarf, a cute purse, etc.,

If you are still trying to shed baby weight you might also consider joining an online calorie counter like myfitnesspal.com or myfooddiary.com.,
If you want your smile white, getting your teeth whitened either at home or at the dentist can do a lot for making you feel better about yourself.,
Take time for yourself.,
You are a mother and probably someone's partner as well, but you are also an individual.",How to Be a Classy Mom," This basic step is essential for everyone, even as a common courtesy for others. I don't know what it has to do with being classy as much as simply taking care of your teeth. You could always get fake teeth.


New moms may have a really hard time fitting a shower into their day if they are trying to fit a million things into nap time, but try to make this a priority. You will feel fresher after a shower and that feeling will help you power through the rest of your mommy to-do list.






Wash your face with a drugstore cleanser like a Neutrogena brand cleanser, shampoo and condition with drugstore brand products like Pantene and shave your underarms.






Try to shave your legs and bikini area (unless you prefer natural) if you have the time. Don't worry if you only get to it once a week... that's better than letting it all go completely! Then again, some women do not believe in shaving ones legs and if that makes you feel classy then go for it!





;
, Women often have no choice but to give up their glamorous hair style when they get pregnant. Even though your glamorous messy-bun may have worked just fine in the past, try not to let yourself go completely. A salon cut and color are expensive and color is often considered a no-no when you have a bun in the oven (unless you don't care and are trying to evict (if you know what I mean)). Then, after 9 months of growing out your roots you simply just don't have the time or the money to keep up with a $200 style. For some women, keeping a short or buzzed haircut is also just as glamorous. Miley Cyrus basically shaved her head and she is on the cover of Elle magazine. Miley = glamour.


Try to convert your old style into a classy, mom-friendly do. If you are looking for 'class' and 'mom-friendly' just think of Kate Gosselin. That's classy, right?






If you like short hair, try a bob. If you like long hair, try long layers. You can easily put off a trim with these styles without anyone noticing.






If you have long hair, try a side part with a low ponytail and a clear elastic instead of the ""gym ponytail."" It's just as practical but you'll look more put together. You can always dye your hair back to its natural color so it saves you time and money in the long run, but sometimes it's fun to play with other colors either using home dyes or girly salon days. You can always wear a hat, too. Those can be fun.






If you like having thinner eyebrows, getting them waxed can do wonders for making you feel more put together. For a cheaper option there is always tweezing them at home. More time consuming and not as thorough, but some people look better with thicker brows.







, If you're well rested you might be able to get away with just concealer for any blemishes or under-eye circles. If you want to feel a little more fixed up, but don't have time to make a production of things, using eyeshadow (in whatever colors flatter your face), mascara, and maybe some eyeliner and lip balm or gloss can help you feel pretty without taking a lot of time if you're in a hurry.

, You need colors and styles that work for you. Don't let anyone tell you that because you're a mom you can't wear shorts and tank tops in the summer, or that you can't wear high heels and dangly earrings anymore. You can! Just be careful with longer earrings because little ones find them fascinating dangling from your ears. I usually save those for dates when my kid isn't there. You can wear anything the women without kids are wearing. If you're self-conscious from baby weight, exercise is great for your health and boosting your confidence and sense of happiness and well-being. Part of the struggle for mothers with maintaining the appearance they did before having kids is due to lack of time for themselves from taking care of everyone else, but also possibly in part to society's view that mothers have to throw on a sack and hide because they've born a child. Ridiculous. Whether you're a thin mom, a curvy mama, athletic, bigger, wear what you want. You will definitely feel better about yourself if you make an effort to look stylish and dress and accessorize in a way that feels like you.

, can really add flair to an outfit and make you feel more put together and confident. Also, sexy bras and underwear can help to make you feel beautiful and womanly. It's the little things. ],, If you have some time, you can do a mani & pedi at home for fairly cheap, or make a girls' day at the spa. The summertime is when your feet will be showing the most, so if you can only get pedis then, no worries. Nobody is yanking your boots off in the winter to examine your toes and judge you. Just trim them and keep them clean in the winter months.

Wear gloves while doing the dishes to avoid chipping your manicure. If you have too much trouble keeping your manicure looking fresh than avoid polishing your fingernails. A clean set of fingernails looks better than a set with chipped polish.







, It not only improves your health and appearance, it shuttles endorphins through you to make you feel happy and like you will get through motherhood because you got to do something for you. Even thirty minutes a few times a week is good. If you were active before having a baby, or have the okay from your doctor, you can work out for an hour several times a week. You can join a gym, use workout DVDs, take a fitness class, work out to videos on You-Tube, etc. There are so many options. Even taking your baby on a walk with you can make you feel good and burn some calories. When the baby is napping could be used for exercise, but sometimes you might need a nap, too, so you could do it early in the morning or at night. Don't beat yourself up if you can only exercise three or four times a week. That's still exercise and great for your health., These sites are great for helping you manage your diet. Counting calories can work for some people, especially if you have a specific goal like losing weight or gaining muscle, but be aware that some people become obsessed with it. Just be careful and keep things in perspective. The important thing is to eat mostly healthy and get a good variety of different types of nutritious foods. Allowing yourself a treat sometimes will make this easier to maintain and keep your diet from sucking the joy out of your life. Balance is important.

, Getting a teeth cleaning before whitening should improve results.

, There is a balance between abandoning loved ones and being their servant. Yes, take care of them, but you have to take care of yourself, too. Exercise, sleep, and time to yourself to relax, get pampered, etc. are vital for your sanity, happiness, and frankly theirs as well. When mama ain't happy, nobody's happy. Have date nights with your partner, a day out with friends, time alone, whatever gets you rejuvenated so you can be happy and treat your family in a way that makes them happy, too., Be the absolute best you can be for your little ones and partner, but never lose yourself or feel like you can't take a moment. If you're depressed, you won't be able to help them because you'll be too miserable. If you take care of you as well as them, you'll be an individual and a team with your family. You don't have to choose and you don't have to live in sweats. Even making it a goal to put on jeans instead of yoga pants on days you're at home and combing your hair can boost your mood and appearance dramatically."

Decide to have fun with your kids.,
Take it easy on them sometimes.,
Get help.,
Have a night for some fun.,
Focus on keeping your relationship healthy.,

Make time to relax every day.",How to Be a Happier Mom," Try to put yourself in your children's shoes. If you can understand what they are thinking, what they might be going through, you can be a mother that values her child's opinion, and respects them. This is how you earn respect back, in turn.


As your kids get older, you may find that they talk less and less, or let you in just a little less than they used to. This can be hard, but try to take it as a sign that they're independent. They're growing into real people. Make yourself available if they need you, but don't pry into their lives.;
, Patience is a necessity when you're a mother. If you lose your cool with a five year old, you're just having an adult temper tantrum. Instead, remind yourself that kids are (brutal truth, here) kind of annoying sometimes. They're going to be that way. The less you hold onto some ideal version of the way they should behave, the happier you and your kids will be allowed to be.


Accept who your kids are and don't try too much to change them. You can influence their behavior in little ways, but you can't make them into something they're not. Give your kids a hug and move on.

, Sometimes, the world can seem too overwhelming. If you're getting frustrated with all the responsibilities, it can be tempting to want to check out for a while. But the real trick to happiness as a mom is in staying in the room. Let yourself be satisfied that you're providing for your kids with your positive presence. Be the best mom you can be.


If you have quiet time for yourself, it's still possible to be around your kids. Sit in the living room and read your book, or zone into your computer if that's how you choose to relax. Don't lock yourself away. Just being there means a lot.

, Simply put, the more you can invest in your kids' lives, the happier everyone will be. Play with your kids. Talk to them and try to understand what they're doing when they're playing.


As your kids get older, it's still important to spend quality time with them. Don't force them into a march that they're not interested in. Let them decide what you do together. Take your child to their first Rated-R movie when they're almost old enough. Give them a little thrill every now and then.
Of course, playing blocks with a five year old isn't the most interesting thing in the world, so find a way to budget your time. Give your kid 15 minutes of block playing in exchange for some clean-up time, to help take some chores off your to-do list. Win-win.

, Motherhood doesn't have to be about punishment and rules. Remember, you're the one in charge. Talk to your kids and get more invested in their lives. When you do have to punish them, take the time to explain what you're doing and why you're doing it, so they don't come to see you as an angry presence in their life, but as a just authority figure.

, Motherhood is tough, especially if you're doing it on your own. Sometimes, it takes a whole village to raise a child. You need a support network that you can rely on if you're starting to feel stressed and over-worked. Don't take it out on your kids. Get people to help you.


Talk to family members, friends, neighbors, and others if you need someone to watch the kid for a couple hours. Even just half an hour to yourself can be a life-saver. Pay for childcare if you can afford it.
Get the father involved, if he's on the scene. Father involvement in their children's lives have so many benefits for the children, but also for you as a mother. It will support you and bring you closer together as a family.

, Take a day at least once a week for a girls night out, or a date night. It'll help you feel young and stay happy. Arrange childcare for the night and let your kids know it will be a regular thing.


Your kids can have fun with the arrangement too. Let them have a movie and pizza night while you're out.
Alternatively, arrange a night where your kids spend the night and their grandparents, or stay with a friend or a neighbor. Take the night to just relax around the suddenly quiet household. Total bliss.

, If you're married, single, or in some other arrangement, it's important to spend enough time working on your relationship. Having kids can make romance tough, but it's absolutely important for your health and happiness. If you're in a bad relationship, your happiness will suffer, and your kids will suffer in turn. Make it a priority.


If you're in a bad, or manipulative relationship, you need to end it. It's never good to remain in a bad relationship ""for the kids.""

, Parenting takes up a lot of your time, but it doesn't have to be your life. Find something that you can devote a couple hours a week to doing, after your kids go to sleep. Pick up a new skill that you can be working on aside from your regular parenting duties. Learn to play an instrument, if you're so inclined, or start playing a sport.


If you start jogging, that can be 15-20 minutes each week that you have totally to yourself. Outrun your stress.
If you don't work, consider arranging your time so you can do something part time. Even 10 hours a week can help you feel like you've got a new social group and responsibility as an outlet. It can really help. Plus, you'll have a little side money!

, Even if it's just an hour a day to do a workout, or 10 minutes to put some make-up on, it can make all the difference to how you feel for the rest of the day. It will make you happier and as a result it will make your little one happier. Schedule it into your day. Make it a serious priority.


Have little daily relaxations, like a cup of tea on the porch, or a good book with a glass of wine. Also schedule in more significant relaxations every now and then. Get a massage. Go on vacation. Treat yourself.

""Where do babies come from?"" is a natural question, especially if your kid is about to have a younger brother or sister., However, you don't need to provide more information than your child is asking for. That is, you don't have to talk about sex (yet) if your young kid is just asking about where babies come from., If your child is old enough to ask, they're old enough to have an answer., Older kids may feel uncomfortable asking about babies and sex. You should acknowledge that sex can make people feel uncomfortable, and that's fine.However, younger kids are asking a simple question. If you show you are uncomfortable, they will pick up on it. They may associate that embarrassment with sex and their bodies., You should know the basics before talking to your kids. You may have forgotten what you knew from sex ed. Pick up a book to learn it again.

, You don't need to give all the information available, but you should answer honestly. Don't make up stories about storks or cabbage patches.For instance, your child may ask where you'll get her new sister. You can say, ""Mommy grows your little sister in her uterus, which is near her tummy."", Kids 6 and under may not understand if you try talking about sex. Instead, talk about what's needed to make a baby--eggs and sperm.As an example, you could talk about a seed. If your kids ever helped you garden, you could say, ""Do you know how plants come from a seed? Well, babies come from seeds, too. The daddy has the seed, and the mommy has the egg. They join in mommy's body to grow a baby."", You can get help to answer the questions your child has. For instance, read books with your children to help answer questions.Your library will have a wide selection of books.
You can also use educational websites. Many websites explain the basics to kids. Just be sure to explore the sites with your child., Don't be afraid to call parts by their names--penis, vagina, womb, and so on. As long as you're comfortable with the terms, your kids will be, too., Your child may be satisfied with a little information, but she may want more. Wait until you've answered all her questions before moving on to other things., It's fine to give your child information in little spurts, as he requests it. You don't need to have one sit-down talk about it. Instead, let the topic work its way in naturally., If your child is asking questions because you or your wife is pregnant, let your child be a part of it. That is, take him along to ultrasounds so he can see the child develop. Let her feel the child kick. These types of activities help your child understand the reproductive process., Even kids under 2-years-old want to know about their bodies. They also want to know about other people's bodies. They're old enough to start learning the proper names for their body parts., Kids this age will start to notice differences between their bodies and other people's.They're old enough to learn what should stay private.For instance, kids this age do masturbate. However, they are old enough to learn that this activity should only be done in private. In fact, even kids under age 2 can start learning about privacy., Kids in this age can start learning about the basics of sex. They should also know the basics of relationships. For instance, they should know that some people are straight, while others are homosexual or bisexual.They should also be learning about puberty at this age.As above, don't be afraid to answer questions as they arise. For instance, maybe your child asks ""What's a hand job?"" You could answer: ""A hand job is when adults are having sex, and one uses his or her hand to touch the other person's genitals.""Be matter-of-fact and to the point.

, Children this age are ready to know what sex is. Also talk about safe sex with them, including birth control and condoms.Talk with them about waiting to have sex until they are ready. Reassure them that everything they are going through with their bodies is normal., These kids are going to be more embarrassed about talking about sex. However, if you've talked to them earlier, they should be ready to talk when they have issues.Also, reinforce the need for birth control. Let them know how they can get it and help them access it if necessary. Though it's difficult for many parents, you need to accept that kids this age may have sex."

,


If you are nursing, move your most comfortable easy chair into the baby's room. Set up a table next to the chair for a bottle of water, your glasses, a clock, maybe some music, and anything else you will routinely need during nursing. If your partner will feed the baby at night, it is good to pump breast milk or have the formula bottles ready ahead of time. In general, try to always prepare about 10 bottles each time that you ""make bottles"" of formula for your baby. You can buy pre-mixed formula to make this easier.
If you are going to be up in the middle of the night, you might as well be comfortable. Make it even easier on yourself by not actually getting up when your baby wakes you. You can have one of those new cribs that fits right next to your bed and has a side that drops.Then just reach over, get your baby, and nurse him/her while lying on your side.
If you are bottle feeding, keep everything you need for formula preparation conveniently grouped on the kitchen counter. You will be way too tired to be searching in the drawers and cupboards in the middle of the night for the lid of the bottle etc. Or, just before bed, prepare bottles by taking a clean, empty, dry bottle and measuring out the dry formula. Then cap it, and place it next to your night stand or in the baby's room along with a couple bottles of plain water - again, pre-measured if you think you might not get it right in the middle of the night. Just open the bottles and mix and feed. In the morning, take the empty bottles down to be washed. Another alternative is to buy the ready-to-feed formula in bottles for nighttime feedings, but this can get expensive. It can also be helpful to buy a mini fridge to keep in your room with the bottles of formula if the kitchen is far away.
You may have a perennial incision which will require washing with each trip to the bathroom, and this will require certain equipment. There is also a possibility of hemorrhoids. Again, make things easy on yourself by putting all those materials within easy reach of the toilet. It is important to take care of yourself. The closer the materials are, the faster you can get yourself taken care of so that you can get back to that baby. Good products to have on hand are Preparation H, Tucks Pads with Witch Hazel, Tylenol or Motrin. A squirt bottle for gentle cleansing and diluting urine is helpful for this healing area.

, It's essential to avoid sleep deprivation so that you can remain alert when caring for the baby. Know how much sleep you need per day and get it in bits and pieces, sleeping when your baby sleeps, and napping when your baby naps--avoid the temptation to catch up on email while the baby is sleeping. You need to rest when the baby rests. This is very important.


Place the baby on his/her back when they sleep and keep the crib or bassinet near you with no pillows, quilts, or toys (a light blanket can be placed below the baby's arms and tucked in lightly along the bottom half of the crib).If you choose to co-sleep, read up on how to do so safely. Also see the Warnings section below about sleeping positions.
Call your doctor or midwife if the baby seems to be sleeping excessively (over the normal 16 hours a day) as this may signal an infection., Some people feel that effort should be made to get your baby on a schedule right away, and others believe in letting a natural rhythm arise at its own pace. Either way, do what is most manageable for you without causing stress to the baby. It will take some trial and error to find a good balance. If you won't be working for awhile, then it won't really matter when your baby sleeps. Sometimes it's best to just let them sleep whenever they are ready to and not force them if they aren't ready yet.


Try to keep things picked up and keep your house very clean. This will prevent your baby from getting sick, and it will make you feel more at peace if your working environment is always clean and tidy.
Help the baby differentiate night and day by playing and keeping the room bright during the day, and by avoiding playing loud music and having bright lights at night. Change your baby's clothing on a constant schedule, as this will help them know that onesies are for playtime and night gowns are for bedtime. Swaddling at night will also help your baby to feel comfortable, warm and sleep longer.

, Over 50% of women experience tearfulness, tiredness, sadness, and difficulty in thinking clearly on the third or fourth day after delivery. This is probably caused by a sudden decrease of maternal hormones. Don't ignore these symptoms and any feelings of sadness or guilt that result; talk about it with someone who's close to you, and don't try to feign happiness if you're really feeling down.

Feel your emotions all the way through! Some of it will be painful and that is okay. Not only are you adjusting to an awesome event in life, your body is releasing every hormone known to woman around the clock. It should pass within one to three weeks, as the hormones stabilize and you acclimate to the new situation. If you need to, get help from a caring counselor.







, If you can afford it, hire a housecleaner, even just once every two weeks.That can help a lot. Get a babysitter if you need a break. Consider hiring a postpartum doula. If your partner is in the picture, support everything he or she does to help out. Be willing to let your partner dress or bathe the baby, and to take the child out for a walk or a drive; a parent who feels supported in his or her efforts to attend to the baby is more likely to want to spend more time with the baby. That is likely to be a win-win situation for all involved. Relax and let your partner run with it. Chances are they can change a diaper just as well as you can! Sharing the responsibilities is a good thing. Discuss how they can help you more, if you need it.br>
, Strollers are nice, but you may find that keeping the baby right on your chest will be the most convenient for you even while you cook meals. Taking a walk outside can be very refreshing for both you and the baby, and a baby carrier can make getting around very easy and comfortable for both of you. Having more contact time with you will make your baby calmer and happier, which will benefit you too.

, If you ate your way through nine months of pregnancy with the mindset of providing for two, don't expect to immediately go back to 1400 calories a day with the will power of a professional bodybuilder. It may take a week or two for your habits to adjust. Plan to eat 3 healthy meals a day, and give yourself a little flexibility with your snacks until your body catches up with your eating habits. After your doctor or midwife gives you permission, start exercising again in small increments. If possible, join a gym. Not only will going to the gym get you out of the house, you will be inspired to stay on track by all of the twenty-somethings in sports bras and spandex. Don't forget to drink enough water and take a good quality daily multivitamin.

, Some moms will find time away from the baby to be relieving, while others will prefer to keep the newborn with them at all times. It's an individual choice. Either way, stay in touch with your support system, whether that consists of the father, your close relatives, or friends. Consider finding other new mothers and connecting with them. Many places have groups of moms who meet regularly, and they can often be found with a little research on the Internet. As far as guests are concerned, limit people from visiting during this time when your child is vulnerable to contagious illnesses; most people are at their most contagious before they show symptoms of being sick.

, Don't be surprised if the baby loses a few ounces of weight during the first few days after being born--they'll usually bounce back to that weight after seven to ten days. Look for the baby to demand to nurse every 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, appear satisfied after feedings, takes both breasts at each nursing, soak 6-8 cloth diapers or 5 disposable diapers each day, and pass 3 or more soft stools per day. Call to choose a pediatrician and set up an appointment for your infant's check-ups. Have the baby checked up on by an appropriate health professional on the third or fourth day after birth (if the newborn was discharged within 24 hours of delivery) and two weeks after birth; this is a good time to ask him or her any questions you may have. Always remember and keep up to date with shots. Immunization, flu, and others are important to get during this and the next few months. You may choose to decline or postpone immunizations. Smaller babies, especially premature, are more delicate and they don't have the immune system of a toddler or preschooler.


Spitting up is not uncommon and is nothing to be alarmed about, as long as the baby's weight gain is on schedule.
The umbilical cord stump will usually fall off during the second week; until then, give the newborn sponge baths instead of tub baths, and fold the front of the diaper down below the navel to keep the area aired and clean. If it gets dirty you may dab the stump with alcohol.
If the baby is circumcised, place a dab of petroleum jelly on the circumcised area to keep the diaper from sticking to it.

, Don't have unprotected intercourse, as it is possible to ovulate and get pregnant even a few weeks after giving birth.It is recommended to wait 6 weeks to start being sexually active, due to healing time, stitches, starting contraception. If you plan to depend on exclusive breastfeeding for family planning, learn and do the guidelines.

, The first few days and weeks will be rough, and you might be tempted to forget that you are in the midst of a miraculous and wonderful time. So even though you will be tired and sometimes stressed, do remember to soak in the joyful parts of the day. Cherish every minute, even when you are up at 2 am giving the baby a feeding and you look out the window and all is dark except your house. These few months will pass quickly and believe it or not, you will miss it!

Do lots of physical things to tire yourself out.,
Do something you enjoy doing in the evening.,
Help wrap up presents with your mom, dad or sibling.,
Write out a list of things you can do if you wake up too early.,
Set a time for going downstairs with your family.,
Try to imagine that it is just another normal night.,
Try to clear your mind and refresh it by reading a book.,
Go to sleep early on Christmas Eve to ensure that you will get your daily eight to ten hours.,
Don't come up with excuses to get up in the middle of the night.,
Try your best to sleep in.,
Find things to do if you have to wait for everyone else to wake up.,
Wake everyone up when it's time.",How to Wait for Christmas Morning," For example, help mom and dad with preparation chores around the house, play ball outside, walk the dog or visit a friend and go running, sledding or cycling in the park.
, Try a quiet and calm activity that draws you right in, such as coloring in, drawing, painting miniatures or weaving a bracelet., Wrap any presents you haven't done yet. This can help you to see that the spirit of Christmas is also about ensuring other people deserve joy and excitement too, not just you.

Ask mom and dad if there is any present you can open up before they get up. This might be a good way to stave off the excitement until they wake up. And, you can always check Santa's goodies.

, This can help you to find fun things to do until it's present opening time.

, Your mom and dad might not like you waking them up at 4AM. A time around 7:30 is reasonable to wake your parents up, but let the rest of your family sleep until they wake up naturally.

, Follow all of your nighttime routines. Wearing your most comfortable pair of pajamas helps too!, This will help you fall asleep and make you tired. It will also give your mind a topic to think about while you drift off to sleep.

You can read Christmas stories but this will make it harder for you to clear your mind!

, There is nothing worse than being tired on Christmas! Also, sleeping can help you to pass the time the fastest, without feeling too excited or anxious.

If you cannot sleep, try reading some more for a while. Read an exciting book that takes your mind off the next day. Have a glass of warm milk or a turkey sandwich to help induce sleep.
Try using traditional sleep methods, such as counting sheep or counting backwards from one hundred. Only allow yourself to think about going to sleep, for example just repeat in your head, ""I am going to go to sleep now"" over and over.

, You are only letting your body succeed over your excitement. Just go back to sleep., If you are the type of person who regularly enjoys sleeping in, why not snooze for an extra hour today? Those presents will still be underneath that tree whether you wake up at 4:00 AM or 10:00 AM. If you're the type of person that gets up early, try to go back to sleep until you think it is an appropriate time to get up.

If you wake up very early, see what the big guy brought you.







, Distracting yourself with fun things will help to pass the time and will stop you from poking the presents to try and guess them. Here are some things you could try:

Listen to music. Any kind of music you want but use headphones.






Draw. Make a pretty picture for Santa Claus or your Aunt who is visiting from Ohio. They will love it.






If you are allowed, watch television. It will have to be quiet though. Cartoons that are normally very loud should be down very low.






Read a book. You could get lost in a good book and forget all about yearning for that special time.






Write in your journal. It may seem very boring but, writing about your excitement may get it out. If it isn't fun then maybe you could fall asleep!







, By this time you should be ready to go and wake up your parents!

Ask about her preferences for your role.,
Discuss her opinion on medication.,
Get her opinion on medical or surgical intervention.,
Listen carefully and non-judgmentally.,
Ask the mother about her breastfeeding decisions.",How to Be a Birth Advocate2," In order to effectively advocate during childbirth, you must be aware of what the mother expects you to do and what her wishes are for her delivery.


Some mothers may not have thought through in advance all of the decisions they will have to consider during delivery, so it is your job to make sure she knows what may come up. Once she knows the possible decision points for her delivery, the two of you should take time to talk through each possibility and discuss her decisions.
Ask whether you will be the only guest during delivery and what she would like you to do. Some women might like you to provide comfort services, such as calming massages, a few magazines, and her favorite snack once labor begins. Others may want your role to involve only communication with medical staff and some encouragement during delivery.

, One of your primary responsibilities as a birth advocate is to help the mother defend her decisions regarding pain medication.


If she has firmly decided in advance that she does not want to use medication, inform the medical staff of her decision in advance and again once she is admitted for delivery. If she is in considerable pain and seems to want to change her decision about medication, ask whether she would like to consider it or if she would like to continue with her goal of a medication-free birth.
Support her decision either way. Medical staff often asks repeatedly about pain management and are willing to accommodate requests at many points during delivery. There is often a point during delivery after which staff cannot perform an epidural, however. This may be the appropriate time to convey a single offer of pain medication during delivery if the mother previously decided against it; otherwise do not bother her with repeated offers.

, Even during deliveries that a mother intended to be entirely natural, certain circumstances may require medical intervention or surgery.


If the mother has expressed in advance a decision to avoid intervention if possible, inform medical staff of this choice upon admission to the birth unit and ask that they discuss potential interventions with you prior to mentioning it to her, particularly if the intervention is purely optional.
If an intervention becomes necessary for the health or life of the mother or her baby, it is your responsibility to convey the severity of the situation to the mother and allow her to make a decision in line with her values. Once she has decided, defend her choice to the medical staff and offer continual support and encouragement to the mother, especially if she had to accept intervention when she had not desired or anticipated it.

, Childbirth is a highly personal experience and every woman may have unique expectations, desires, and opinions surrounding her upcoming labor.


Do your best to understand and support her decisions, and make a note of her choices so that you remember what she wants when it comes time to advocate during delivery.

, If the mother will be delivering in an institutional setting but would like to breastfeed her baby, part of your role as a birth advocate is to inform nursing staff of the mother’s decision and request that the baby be allowed to stay with the mother as much as possible to facilitate breastfeeding.

"
"
Meet the doctor or midwife in advance.,
Rehearse advocacy statements with the mother or a friend.,
Introduce yourself to the labor team upon arrival.,
Be vocal but understand that the mother’s opinion may change.",How to Be a Birth Advocate3," Obstetricians and nurses frequently work with birth advocates and are often happy to meet them in advance.


Take advantage of an advance meeting to discuss the mother’s preferences with the delivery doctor, midwife, or nurses. This will make communication easier during the delivery and give you all the opportunity to address potential concerns prior to the delivery.
Some doctors or nurses may be very happy to give you pointers for communicating with them and other birthing staff during the delivery. They may also be able to tell you what to expect about interacting with staff and helping advocate for the mother in a way that the staff will respect and appreciate.

, If your role will involve firm statements about the mother’s decisions, such as “She does not want any medication,” practicing a firm but respectful tone may give you the confidence you need to effectively communicate for the mother during delivery.

, Once the mother has been admitted for the birth, let staff know who you are and why you are there so that they know who to consult with questions or concerns first. Introducing yourself will also remind the staff that you are there for the mother and that she has clear expectations for what she wants out of her delivery and assistance.

, As a birth advocate, your job is to verbally defend the mother’s decisions as much as necessary, but if the mother has changed her mind it becomes your job to defend her new choices.


If a mother is disappointed to have to accept medical or surgical intervention due to the circumstances of her delivery, your role as a birth advocate will become essential to her confidence and satisfaction with the birth process. Remind her that she is making the best decision for her and her baby and refocus her on safely delivering a healthy child.

, go wake them up, or go see if they are up. Then the two of you can creep down/upstairs and take a look at your presents! Take a look around and play a guessing game about what stuff is.

, This is very important, because your parents may want to see your reaction to the gift that they got you, or that Santa got you. Some parents allow you to go look and maybe take something small out of a stocking. But only if they say so. No one wants to get in trouble on Christmas!

, Then go watch some television.

, Wake up! I wanna open presents!"" Maybe try making their favorite tea/coffee or make a small breakfast. They might like that more than yelling kids. Give them time to wake up, and then when they are ready, you can start the fun.

Review your current budget and recalculate based on the expenses of your new baby.,
Help your first child adjust to having a sibling.,
Reevaluate your schedule to manage your time with 2 children.,
Get organized.,
Plan ahead when heading out the door.,
Lower your expectations.,
Recognize that you now have 2 personalities to get used to.",How to Adjust to Having a Second Child," If your baby will be going to a daycare, include that cost per month, in addition to diapers, wipes, formula and other baby needs.;
, Ideally, the adjustment should come before your second child arrives. Put the focus on your first child when dealing with the new baby, and always have your first child help take care of the second. For example, when changing a diaper, have your first child help get the diaper and wipes. Always praise your child for helping.

, Time management is a necessary skill if you want to get through your days successfully. Recognize, however, that you will need to add more time to your tasks because they will probably take longer now as you have 2 children to take care of. Try to schedule much of your housework while the children are taking naps; this will reduce the amount of interruptions.

, Second baby adjustment means putting everything in its place and keeping it that way. Juggling the needs of 2 children is stressful enough without having to search for wipes or teething medicine. Picking up after yourself will save you the time you would have to put into cleaning up the house.

, It will take longer to get ready to leave the home, whether you are doing errands or going to an appointment. Try to be proactive in getting diaper bags prepared ahead of time so you don't need to pack them every time you head out. Have shoes, keys, bags and anything else you usually take with you, ready in their usual spot so you are not searching for them.

, Don't expect that you can do it all with 2 children. With 2 children to take care of and entertain, you may find that you cannot get it all done. If you cannot, you will be left feeling frustrated and incapable.

, The likelihood that your new child is the same as the first is slim. Find a way to treat your children the same on the outside while nurturing their differences on the inside. For example, the rules of the home should apply to both, but 1 child may be more artistic while the other is athletic. Take the time to learn how both your children fit into the family.

Wake up any siblings and have some fun with them as you wait to open your presents!",How to Wait on Christmas Morning to Open Presents," Think about something calming and just breathe in and out slowly. Avoid thinking about presents or anything that reminds you of them because it will make you more anxious to open them.


To help you try to sleep again, focus your mind on a non-Christmas related, somewhat unusual topic, or just simply relax your body. If you are genuinely too excited to sleep, read on.





;
, Attempt to read a slightly difficult book to read. If you read a difficult or boring book, there may be a chance of going back to bed. Also, reading in bed instead of a couch will help out, because you will be in a more comfortable position to fall asleep. If you cannot fall asleep with this method, just grab an interesting book that you can get stuck into and read for a while.

, You can just sit in bed doing head rolls and even yoga positions for fun. They will relax the body and make you less anxious and tense.

, Thinking about the story line will definitely pass the time. Try not to associate anything about Christmas into the story, making you, once again, more anxious. You can also draw.


On the other hand, maybe it's a good idea to set your mind on writing a short story (or even a novel) with a Christmas theme to it. Be sure to write out the blurb, who its written by, and include the illustrations and front cover.

, If you have a laptop in your room, surf the web for a bit. You might get pre-occupied with what you're doing and may lose track of time. Just avoid looking at your computer's clock (if it's on your taskbar). Even better, you can take the clock off your taskbar so you don't have a clock to look at.

, Preferably choose something interesting. Try to avoid stations with Christmas movie marathons, because this will obviously make you think of Christmas. If you are allowed to use on-demand, rent a movie or two. Preferably something you wanted to see when it came out in theaters, or an action movie.

, Put on your headphones, turn on a game console and play on it for a lengthy amount of time.


If you're waiting for a new game that leads on from an existing game, play that game to ensure you've completed all levels and tasks on it, or just to remind yourself of how fun the game is.

, If your room is already spotless, you can dust and polish the surfaces in your room and make sure it seems spotless. Put away clothes or color coordinate them. Be sure to finish off with some heavily scented air freshener. This may seem boring, but this definitely passes time.

, Still got pages of homework to do before January? Now's the time to finish it all off!

,, It doesn't have to be a Christmas movie. You could also watch youtube videos., Get dressed, style your hair, put on make up (if you wear it) and try out different deodorants and perfumes. You want to be perfect for the camera. If you like, practice smiling in front of a mirror and what you'll say.

, Try using foods like mince pies, carrots, cookies and milk to get yourself into the wonderful Christmas spirit!

, Also, perhaps scan the room to check if he has left you a letter!

, If you have your parent's permission, open your stocking. Do this very slowly and carefully, examining every single one of the items to pass time.

, If you have no siblings, simply play a game for a while. After all this, it's bound to be time to open up those extraordinary gifts! Merry Christmas!

, To keep them from thinking about their pacifier, give them something else to do and avoid a fit or a fight that might make you feel like giving in to your toddler.

, Bedtimes and nap times should be the last instances you wean your toddler off the pacifier, as they are probably the times your child will ask for it the most.

, Birthdays work well for this, since the pacifier can easily be ""replaced"" by gifts. Gifts that your child recognizes as signifying a transition to older childhood - such as a toy reserved for or identified with ""big kids"" - are also especially effective for this.

, If your toddler goes to their room to get the pacifier, explain to them that they can only have it if they're going to bed and ask them if they're ready for a nap or bedtime.

, When your child stops returning to their room every day to spend time lying in bed with the pacifier, try taking it one step further and hiding it. When your child asks for it, tell them maybe it will be there for them later.

, Leave it hidden when they go to bed and only give it to them when they ask about it. Before long, you'll be able to say ""Hey, you haven't asked about it in four days, how about we just go without it tonight?"".

When you don't want them to use it any more and you want to get rid of it, poke a Pinhole in it.",How to Stop Pacifier Use5,", It will now not work when they suck on it any more. This causes the child to think it is ""broken,"" and they will not like it any more.

This method works for hollow pacifiers.
A similar method for solid pacifiers is to get a razor knife and shave a tiny amount off the tip each day when they are asleep so it gets shorter and shorter.

This is a common method here. Some children immediately reject the 'broken' pacifier where others continue to use it until there is almost nothing left. Since the change is gradual you can tell them that it is ""wearing out"".


Wait for them to determine that it is broken and they will throw it away themselves.

Don't waste time being angry.,
Plan for the future!,
Plan meals, including school lunches, several days in advance.,
Set up a support network.,
Don't expect too much of yourself.,
Have time for yourself.,
Be financially stable.,
Have fun!,
If you are separated from an ex, then try your best to put your child first.,
Good luck and keep looking online as there are so many people in the same situation so you can find further advice and help.

",How to Adjust to Being a Single Parent," After relationship breakdown or sudden bereavement it is very easy to be angry to 'be left holding the baby' so to speak. This is unproductive and ultimately not good for you or your child as it feeds your negativity about the situation. This is easier said than done, but if you can avoid it then you can focus more on you and your child.;
, Even if you can only cope with planning next week then try to plan it in mind-numbing detail. Aside from anything else it helps with step one as your attention and time is taken up so that you don't have the time to dwell on the past.


As a single parent it is really important to become organised as you have to cope with EVERYTHING and this is easier with planning. If you are a stay at home parent this is particularly important as you have more time to dwell, become negative and if you stay at home all day you won't socialise with many adults which can lead to becoming depressed and unmotivated.
Try looking for free groups, such as toddler and baby groups at local libraries, churches, etc. If your child is at school then it may be worth looking for a part time job during that period, not just for the extra money, but for the social interaction. You will feel better if you are doing something for yourself every once in a while.
Don't be afraid to say no to things that drain your time and energy, such as volunteering at your child's school or fundraising for the PTA.
Be consistent in your parenting. Establish house rules and stick to them, such as early bedtime on school nights.
If you are a working parent then it is also very important as you need to balance work and home life (try searching articles to help with this) and need to arrange a back up in case you don't reach your child's school etc on time. The following website lists registered childminders, nurseries etc in your local area http://www.childcare.co.uk.

, Shop for groceries once a week. Keep a few frozen or boxed meals on hand for evenings when you're running late. Fast-food meals should be an occasional treat instead of a habit.

, There are many single parent websites where you can get information and advice as well as chat on online chat rooms with other single parents. If your child is at school or nursery then socialise with the other parents. Make friends arrange play dates etc. This is important as it helps your child make friends, but it also helps establish a support network so if you are caught in traffic you can ring another parent to pick up your child from school. Make sure you are prepared to return the favors!

, If you have a meltdown one day and find yourself in tears, don't be upset with yourself. Pick yourself up, accept that everyone struggles occasionally and try again. Be honest with your child; it's perfectly fine to say that you are short-tempered because you had a bad day at work.

, Make sure you can schedule yourself some time, if you can't afford a babysitter etc then get your child in a routine of going to bed at a certain time and have an hour when they are in bed where you don't do any housework or chores and you do something you like, such as a glass of wine and a film, a long chat with an old friend on the phone, etc. You will feel better for it and it stops life feeling like one long chore, which is no good for you or your child.

, You have to deal with everything now so be organised. Write down what is going in each week, what needs to be spent and how much spare money there is. Be aware that there will be many unexpected costs (such as your child suddenly growing out of all the trousers in the house!) and you need to be saving money for that eventuality. Make sure you are getting everything you are entitled to such as tax credits, child benefit, income support etc.

, Make sure you do an enjoyable activity with your child at LEAST once a week, that way you remember the joys of parenthood as well as the stress and worry.

, Make sure you focus on your child's best interest before your anger. If your ex is dating someone, don't pump the child for information about that person.


Focus on what suits your child, if your ex pays nothing and turns up less than once a month then rather than fighting this and trying to make them a responsible parent try to focus on being a good parent yourself and see if your child is happy with the arrangement. If they are, then by all means contact child maintenance, but make sure that you don't contact your ex about money or hassle him to turn up more as this will just become an argument.






If it distresses your child then talk to your ex calmly to explain this. Rather than screaming at him or her 'Josh waited two hours for you to turn up and you didn't even ring to say you wouldn't be there. He was in tears all night all because you are a terrible parent!' try saying something like' this arrangement isn't good for Josh as he wants to see more of you and he gets very upset when he expects to see you and then you aren't there. If things are too busy for you then I understand that but Josh doesn't so you need to decide if you have the time to see him. If not then it's a shame for both of you but I understand and josh will adapt eventually as long you stay away and give him time to deal with being without you. What he can't cope with is the inconsistency. I am leaving it up to you to decide and you can let me know.' If you are calm and reasonable then your ex may consider the situation rather than reacting to your anger.

While some of these things will improve with practice, it's important to talk through and show how to do some of the basics so that they're not left completely adrift. Using a how-to site like wikiHow for explanations on household tasks and lifestyle issues can be helpful if needed.


If you don't know that your children are leaving until the last minute, don't panic. Accept that this is happening and be enthusiastic for them, offering your support at any time it is needed. It is better for your children to know that you support them, love them, and are willing to be of help to them than to see you fretting and worrying.;
, Both you and your children will be better off if you treat this as a big adventure. Your children will be feeling a range of emotions from being terrified to being over the moon about their upcoming new experiences. For children who are frightened at the prospect of leaving, it's important to reassure them by telling them that the unknown is worse than the reality. Help them to understand that once they're into their new routine, it'll be familiar, fun, and successful.


Let your kids know that your home is their permanent base, for whenever they need or want to return home. This provides both you and your children with a very secure sense of belonging and safety.
If your kids are miserable for the initial time they're away, don't be secretly pleased about this. They're going to have to work through these emotions while they're getting used to the new arrangements, and they'll need your active support in this, not a secret wish for them to come running back home. This means not actively offering coming back home as an option, and not sorting out all the things for them – let them learn to do things on their own, including administrative and negotiation tasks. They will make mistakes but equally, they'll learn best that way.

, You'll feel a sense of loneliness and emptiness when they're gone because you can't just turn around and tell them the things as you always used to do. Keeping up constant communications is vital for maintaining a sense of family togetherness and to keep up with the news. Some of the methods you can consider include:


Make sure they have a decent cell phone that can connect easily to networks and will last the year. If they've had a cell phone for a while now, you might need to upgrade or at least upgrade its battery. Buy prepaid phone minutes so that they don't have to be concerned about the cost of calling you.
Schedule a weekly call-in time. While you may feel tempted to call more often than this, it will become a burden unless they choose to do so, so try not to expect too much from them. Be sensitive to their need to grow and become their own adult person.
Use email or texting for all the in-between things you'd like to share. These are great mediums because you can say things without being overly emotional.Be aware as time goes on, though, that your son or daughter may not reply as frequently as they do initially. This is part of their settling in and developing a new group of relationships, etc., and it does not mean they've stopped caring.

, Empty nest syndrome is a psychological condition that affects principally women, producing grief when one or more of the children leave home.Most commonly it occurs when children leave for school, college, or university (usually late summer and autumn), or when children marry and leave home to live with their spouse. Empty nest syndrome often coincides with other major events in life, such as menopause, illness, or retirement.It impacts women in particular because motherhood is viewed as a primary role for both working and stay-at-home moms, and a role to which women dedicate themselves as a principal responsibility for an average of 20 years. A child leaving can precipitate a feeling of redundancy, accompanied by feeling lost, unworthy, and unsure about the future.Feeling sad and crying a little is a normal, healthy reaction to be expected of any parent; after all, it is a big change. It becomes a problem when you have feelings that stand in the way of your life, such as thinking that your life is no longer worthwhile, you're unable to stop crying excessively, and you're unable to resume a normal life of seeing friends, getting out and about, or resuming some activities that get you back into the swing of things.Psychologists consider that the transition from being an actively involved mom to being an independent woman again takes around 18 months to two years.This means that it's vital to allow yourself the time to grieve, work through the loss, and rebuild your life is important. Be gentle on yourself and the expectations that you have.

, If you find that you're really not coping and feel a deep sense of emptiness, sadness, or an inability to get your life back on track after the children leave, it's important to get help. You might be suffering from depression or a similar psychological ailment that is preventing you from enjoying life to its fullest. Talk to a professional. Cognitive therapy or similar types of therapy that enable you to talk through your issues might work well. Or, you may simply need a listening ear and confirmation that what you're going through is real, does matter, and in time, will pass.


Acknowledge your grief. It doesn't matter what other people think or say about getting on with it. Unacknowledged grief will gnaw away at you if you don't face it and let yourself be upset for a time. Allow the grief to work through your system.
Treat yourself. While going through the hardship of grief, don't neglect yourself. Have a regular massage, go to a movie now and then, buy your favorite expensive chocolate box, etc. All sadness and no happy moments is a recipe for continued blues.
Consider having a ""letting go"" ritual. Having a ritual in which you ""let go"" of your children as they turn into adults, and let go of the active parenting role, can be an important and cathartic way to help you to move on. Some suggestions include: Sail a lantern with a candle in it down a stream, plant a tree, bronze something special of your child's, hold a ceremony that reflects your faith, etc.
Talk to your spouse about your feelings. He or she may be feeling similar emotions and will relish the chance to talk it through. Or, they may simply listen and acknowledge what you're going through, which is an important source of acceptance for you.
Consider keeping a journal to document your journey. Prayer or meditation may also help.

, Once you're satisfied that you've set your child on the right path, the busyness will wear off and you'll start noticing the big change in your life. The way in which you choose to perceive this change will color your feelings and approach to it – if you see it as a gaping hole, you'll feel much more miserable than if you choose to see it as an opportunity to revive some of your own interests and pursuits.


Avoid creating a shrine out of your child's bedroom. If they didn't clean it up before they left, throw some of your emotions into removing all that trash! Eliminate some of the clutter, but carefully place your child's keepsakes in safe storage.
Write down all the things you'd promised yourself you'd get around to doing one day. Now is the time to start doing them. Pin this list somewhere obvious and start working through it.

Build new friendships or revive lapsed ones. Friends are an important part of your transition from parent full-time to person-at-home-without-kids. Get out there and meet new people. There will be other empty-nesters like you looking for friendship too. And friends can prove a useful source of information about hobbies, activities, and job openings too.
Take up a new hobby or interest. Or revive an old one that you allowed to lapse while raising children. Anything from painting, photography, woodworking, to skydiving and travel!
Go back to school or university. Select a course that you feel resonates with you at this point in life. Work out whether this is a completely new path you're setting out on, or whether it's to upgrade your existing qualifications. Either way is good.
Restart a career – either pick up where you left off or start a new one. Realize that even though you're ""rusty"", you have the advantage of experience, so after some initial relearning, you'll be off to a much faster start than when you were fresh out of school or college.
Consider volunteering. If you're not quite ready to go back to work just yet, volunteering in potential workplaces can be a good way to transition back into the workforce at a pace that suits you. It also gives you the chance to try things to see if you like them or not.
Try participating in charities. Doing something positive with your free time can be very fulfilling.

, Unless you're a lone/single parent, you'll be left with your spouse or partner. And this can be a difficult time if you discover that there's a problem with your relationship you hadn't faced because having the children around helped to cement together your spousal relationship. Or, it can simply be a case that after being parents for so long, you've forgotten how to be lovers. This is a time to talk honestly and openly about the direction of your relationship together and to decide what happens next.


If your children were the only bonding force in your marriage, you and your spouse may need to work on your own relationship to restore what has been neglected between the two of you, especially if you feel that your relationship is now redundant. Seek couples counseling if you feel this would assist the transition back to being alone together again.
Acceptance that this is a difficult time of transition can allow both of you to forgive the uncertainties and messiness of growing together as a couple without kids again.
It can help if you develop the mindset that you expect your spouse or partner to have changed at least a little. After all, both of you have aged a lot since meeting and you've been through many different experiences during the times of raising your children, experiences that probably neither of you envisaged when you first fell in love. As time moves on, many people become clearer about what they do and don't like, what they believe and don't believe, and these discoveries may now be more evident than when you first married or paired up. Trying to see this as an opportunity to discover each others ""new"" selves can be a fruitful way to revive a flagging relationship.
Spend more time with your spouse or partner and get to know them again. Take a vacation together to help revive the feelings of closeness and reliance on one another for emotional support.
Allow time for your relationship to blossom anew. This can be an exciting time of rejuvenation for both of you.
Sometimes, none of this will patch up the reality that you've grown apart. If you realize that your relationship is beyond repair, talk it through or seek support, to enable you to reach a decision that will enable both of you to move on happily into the future.

, Focusing on some of the positive changes resulting from your children moving out can ease the sense of loss considerably when you weigh up what you've gained. While this doesn't belittle the importance of your sadness and the big transition you and your children are going through, it does help you to try to see the brighter side of your future. Some of the positive points include:


You may notice that the refrigerator does not need refilling quite as often. This means less trips to the grocery store and less cooking required!

Romance with your spouse may increase. The two of you have time and space now to return to being just a couple; make the most of it.
If you used to do all of your children's laundry, there will be a lot less washing and ironing for you to do now. Try not to give in to doing it again when they return home for breaks. Expecting them to have grown up enough to do this for themselves is an important step to letting them grow up.
You've got your bathroom back.
Smaller water, phone and electricity bills will help you save money. And that saved money can be put toward a vacation with your spouse or friends!
Feel extremely proud of yourself for having raised children who are capable of going out into the world and surviving and thriving on their own. Give yourself a pat on the back.

Teach him to wait his turn to speak instead of allowing him to interrupt others during a conversation. You also need to give your son the courtesy of listening to him when he is trying to tell you something.;
, Your son might be a little on the shy side, but even if this is the case, he still needs to know how to be friendly with people who do come into contact with him. At minimum, let him know how important it is to make eye contact with others and to smile when greeting them.


Explain why simple gestures, like smiles and eye contact, hold value. Smiling puts people at ease and eye contact creates a connection between two people.

, In today's world, there are so many bad influences that your son could easily fall prey to one if he is in the habit of being a follower instead of a leader. By teaching him to be a leader, you can help him to do that which he knows to be right instead of doing wrong just to blend in with the crowd.


One way to encourage him to take a leadership role is to put him in that role from time to time. Have him make a decision that will affect the whole family. For instance, you might ask him to decide on what movie to watch or where to eat for dinner. Coax him into considering each family member as he makes his decision and gently guide him into making a smart choice. By the end, though, you need to let him feel that the choice was ultimately his.

, There will inevitably come a day when your son will have to deal with loss or disappointment. The first time this happens, you need to teach him about being a good sport to those who won out over him.


A simple way to encourage good sportsmanship is to have him shake hands with the person he played against.

, Good manners are a physical manifestation of an attitude of respect. Manners can include formal issues, like the use of polite language or proper behavior at the table, but they also include more common issues, like listening to and respecting one's elders.

, A gentleman will be honest with those around him. Encourage your son to tell the truth and, on a similar note, also help him to understand the importance of keeping his word once he has made a promise.


When your son gets caught in a lie, talk to him about why lies are hurtful and why honesty would have been the better option. You should also make sure that the consequences of lying outweigh those that would have followed had your son been honest to begin with.
Make sure that your son is not afraid of telling you the truth. You need to discipline him when he does wrong, of course, but you also need to be understanding.

, Generosity is one of the key components of gentlemanly behavior. Teach him to forgive wrongs committed against him.Encourage him to help others and to care for the weak, even if it means inconveniencing himself.


To build a sense of empathy, talk to him about considering how others might feel in a certain situation. Start with fictional situations by asking him how certain characters in books or on television might feel. Gradually move into real-life situations by asking him to consider the feelings of those around him at specific moments.
Teach him about various forms of generosity. When an elderly person gets on a bus, offer your seat and encourage your son to do likewise. If a friend needs help moving, lend a hand and bring your son along to do the same. When your son is old enough and less wary of strangers, you and he can also volunteer a few hours at a soup kitchen or nursing home.

, Teach your son to try his hardest and to avoid quitting even when things get tough.


Once your son commits to a sport or other activity, make sure that he sticks it out for the season, even if he stops enjoying it halfway through.
If he starts to have trouble in school, work with him on finding new ways to make the material more interesting and easier to comprehend.

, If your son is to have any hope of becoming a gentleman, you need to instill in him the importance of resisting temptation and doing what he knows to be right.


At its earliest stage, temptation can come in the form of losing his temper or taking a playmate's toy. Correct these behaviors as soon as you spot them. The earlier you begin, the easier it will be for him to resist other temptations later on.

, Understand that boys are capable of different behaviors at different ages. Before you get frustrated with what your son can and cannot do, ask yourself if you are expecting too much from a boy who is still too young.


For example, from ages 1 through 3, boys should be able to learn the basics about manners. These basics include simple tasks like saying ""please"" and ""thank you."" Matters that require you to teach your son about being considerate will usually need to wait until age 5 or 6, though. At that point, you can have your son perform tasks like clearing the table or making eye contact as he speaks.You also need to be mindful of your son's personality. If your son is naturally on the quiet side, do not pressure him to be more outgoing than he feels comfortable with. Adding pressure to the process may backfire and cause him to rebel.

, There are learning opportunities around every corner. Whether you are out on the town or at home, when the change to teach him some form of gentlemanly behavior pops up, make the most of it. Do not rely solely on planned lessons.


For instance, if a stranger in a store suddenly starts using rude language within an earshot of your son, ask your son to tell you why that sort of language shouldn't be used and do a quick review on saying polite words like ""please,"" ""I'm sorry,"" and ""thank you.""

, When you son is young, make sure that the lessons you give him can be completed within a short period of time. Do not allow him to put things off until a later time. Instead, insist that whatever you have instructed him to do will be done at that moment.


For example, if you tell your son to put away his toys, make sure that he does so right after you tell him.

, You might be tempted to be a little lax on your instructions in the privacy of your own home, but if you expect him to be a gentleman to the outside world, you must first insist that he is a gentleman at home.

,


If your son has an interest in physical activities, consider getting him involved in sports of some sort. On the other hand, if his energy is more of the creative sort, give him opportunities to stimulate his mind and curiosity.

, When your son acts in a pleasing manner, it is absolutely crucial that you let him know he did well. This is important no matter what age your son is and at what stage of the growing process he's in.


Affirmative words are the simplest form of reward, and in some ways, they can be the most effective. This is true when your son is in his toddler stage straight through to adulthood. When your five-year-old son makes his bed without being asked, tell him how pleased you are and how proud you feel. Similarly, when your 16-year-old son refuses to cave into peer pressure by cheating on a test or bullying a kid who gets picked on by his other peers, praise him and tell him how immensely proud you are of his decision.

, Teach him about the values and behaviors he should honor by demonstrating those virtues in your own life. Be someone positive that your son can look up to., Whether you have a traditional family structure or not, there are probably other caregivers in your son's life. Talk over your concerns with these other influences and ask them to reinforce the values you are trying to build in your son.


The primary influences in your son's life need to be on the same page so that he does not get conflicting messages. This includes both parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles who are heavily involved in his life, and teachers.

, While you cannot protect your son from all bad apples, you can do what you can to make sure that the harmful influences he faces will not gain power over the positive influences he has. Restrict harmful media and encourage your son to make good friends.At a young age, try to network with other parents who have sons of a similar age. Make sure that these families share similar values and are equally committed to raising young gentlemen. In this way, you can make sure that your son's earliest friends will be good influences.
You do not have to prevent your son from viewing or listening to all media that could be potentially harmful. Discern when your son might be old enough to understand why certain things are wrong, though, and talk with him after he views such media so that he knows why certain behaviors should not be repeated.

, Give your son positive role models to look to in books, television, movies, and other media. As sources of entertainment, these influences are appealing and can have a lot of sway.

, Your son needs to be exposed to good role models, and you should make sure that he has both male and female influences in his life. Boys often look at older guys as examples of how they can—or how they should—be. Since there will be older male influences no matter what, you can take the initiative and provide positive ones, regardless of your family circumstances.


Female influences can teach boys about treating girls their own age as any gentleman should. By making sure that your boy treats female friends and family members with respect while he's young, it will be easier for him to look at girls with the same sort of respect upon reaching puberty.

, Start early in your pregnancy as it can be difficult to find good, affordable child care. Sometimes word of mouth is the best way to find the best child care provider.

, Some areas offer a free referral service for licensed child care providers.

, Licensed facilities should have a safety plan including an evacuation plan posted, depending on state requirements. Check for cleanliness and nap facilities. See how other children interact with care givers and other children in attendance.

, Does the caregiver have a back-up care giver, if he/she should become ill? Are you responsible for finding alternate care while your care provider is ill? Will your child care giver take care of your sick child?

, What actions will the care giver take to discipline a child who misbehaves? Does this fit within your views of how your child should be disciplined?

, Will you need to pay any portion of your child care fee while you are on vacation?

, Will your care provider be willing to care for your child outside of his/her normal work hours? Does the care facility offer night and weekend hours? Will there be extra fees charged if you are late for picking up your child?

,


Licensed child care providers, whether in the family care home or large day care facility, can participate in a federal nutrition program. Child care providers follow much the same guidelines as the federal school lunch program and are reimbursed by the federal government for food costs. Finding a child care facility that offers meals using the federal guidelines ensures your child will receive nutritionally balanced meals and snacks. As a parent, you are not required to provide meals which can be a bonus as it's one less thing to worry about before heading to work.

, Allow your child to adjust to the new day care setting before dropping by unannounced. The unannounced visit will allow you to see what a typical day is like for your child. During the visit observe how happy the children are, how clean the facility is, and look to see if the care giver is operating what you consider a good facility for your child.

, Deep down, you know what is best for your child. Trust that feeling. When you walk into a facility what is your first impression? Is it cold, is it inviting, it is a place that you are comfortable leaving your child. What is your first impression of the caregivers? Is there any doubt in your mind that this person to take care of your child. Leaving your child with someone that you do not know is scary, especially for new mommies and daddies, because no one will care for your child better than you, but is this care giver a good second choice. Will they complement your parenting style, are you comfortable talking to them. Do they talk to your child or only you. Every child is different. The the center with the best website or the caregiver for your neighbor's child may not be the right fit for your family. Trust your parental instincts.

, Realize your care giver's job is important and deserves respect.

Family Day Care - Consider a family day care setting: Family day care is probably the most common day care setting.",How to Select a Child Care Giver2," Family day care is usually operated by a woman who opens her home to care for other children. Depending on locality, the family day care home may be licensed. Most states now require some form of licensing if the day care provider cares for more than one family. Family day is usually fairly inexpensive, offers a homey setting and may have more one-on-one care for your child. Family day care providers also offer the chance for your child to interact with his or her peers. Family day care homes are more likely to care for newborns and sick children. Drawbacks for unlicensed family day care include no state requirements to meet minimum care standards. Also, if the licensed or unlicensed day care provider becomes ill, then the parent must find alternative care or stay home from work.


Most states allow child care homes to operate with or without a license. Licensed child care homes or facilities are required to meet specific requirements. Some of the requirements may include a mandated child to caregiver ratio (for example five children per care giver); required posted safety plans, required safety procedures and posted evacuation plans.






Unlicensed child care homes are usually limited to caring for a limited amount of children. Homes such as this do not have to meet state requirements.






Large Day Care Setting - Consider a large child care setting. State licensing and inspections are standard for the large day care setting. Large day care centers are required to offer staff training and most, if not all workers, have some early childhood development education. Care is given in more of a educational setting and children are usually cared for by age groups. Babies are usually placed in a nursery type setting while older children are placed in age appropriate environments. Workers also receive first aid training and usually other forms of in-service training. Drawbacks for the large child care setting include less personalized attention given to a child and access to large child care facilities may be limited. In other words, finding openings at a large day care center are usually limited.






Preschool - Consider the preschool option if your child is 2 1/2 years-old and up to six-years-old. Most preschools will accept potty trained children once they reach the minimum age. Preschools offer age appropriate learning opportunities.






Family Care - Consider a trusted family member such as grandparents, aunts or cousins. Usually state licensing is not required, if a family member takes care of your child. Encourage your selected family member to take first aid and CPR classes to make sure your child stays safe.






In Home Care - Consider hiring a nanny or care giver to come to your home to care for your child. Your child will receive plenty of personal care. Drawbacks include the cost of hiring someone to come into your home. Make sure the person you hire has received first aid and CPR training.

If you’re at home and your older kids are there, let them know that you’re taking time out and do not want them to interrupt you unless it’s an emergency. If you have young kids, relax during their nap or while they are at school.

, If you have a hard time making time for yourself with your kids around, have a babysitter come regularly. If you can’t afford regular care, ask a friend or family member to watch your kids for an hour each week. This will allow you to take some time for yourself without worrying about the kids.


Having a regular babysitter come will help you stick to a schedule of making time for yourself.

, If your children ask about your self-care or demand your attention when you’re trying to take a time-out, let them know what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. This will help them respect your practices. It can also help them recognize that it’s okay to take care of themselves and how that might look.Talk about why it’s important to do self-care and allow them to start a practice of their own.

Work part-time instead of full-time.,
Work at home.",How to Know if You Can Afford to Be a Stay at Home Parent," Use a software program like Excel to track all of your expenses throughout the month. Doing this for two to three months will give you an accurate snapshot of how much money you spend throughout the year. Name the top row of your spreadsheet ""expenses"" and use the rows under it to list the name of the expenses that you accrue every month. In the next column list how much the expense costs.Fixed costs include things like the cost of your mortgage, rent, insurance, and college or retirement payments. Examples of other expenses include utilities, car insurance, or a cell phone bill. If your rent, utilities, and subscription services cost $1000 a month, your insurance costs $400 a month, and you spend $800 a month on food, your fixed monthly expenses are $2,200.;
, If you are on a fast track to becoming promoted and growing within the organization you're working at, you need to take a realistic look at how staying at home will impact your job offers if you decide to re-enter the workforce later. It may be harder to get the same quality job or prospects if you take time off, and you will lose money in potential wage growth. If you haven't started your career or finished your education, however, staying at home will have less of an impact on your earnings over time.For an educated woman making $48,500 a year, taking a five-year hiatus from work makes her lose out on $244,811 in wage growth.

, Staying at home and caring for your child consistently and personally will aid them in their development and reduce their levels of stress and anxiety. Also, you'll get the emotional benefit of seeing your children grow up and you'll be able to witness things like their first words and the first time they stand and walk. Weigh how much this matters to you and determine if it outweighs the monetary or career benefits you'd get with working., If there are two parents currently working in the household, it's not as easy as halving your combined monthly income. Weigh the value of your salary to the other parent's salary and consider the percentage of income that you bring to the table by working. If you make a lot more than the other parent, then you may have to re-consider staying home.


For instance, if you make $65,000 a year and your partner only makes $35,000 a year, staying at home will be much more costly for you compared to the other parent.

, In addition to upfront assets in the form of a salary or paycheck, you also have other assets like a 401k plan for retirement or a pension that you can build up after being employed for a long time. Calculate how much money you'd be losing over the long term and include it in your decision to be a stay at home parent.For instance, if you save $200 a month on health insurance because of your job, that's $2,400 in savings over a year.

, Costs like gas for your car, income tax, dry cleaning, and lunch are all expenses that you can accumulate when you have a job. These costs will be reduced because you'll be staying at home. Track how much money you spend in a month going to work, and factor that into your overall budget.For example, if you have to commute to work and spend $300 a month in gas, you can eliminate that expense on your spreadsheet.

, Not staying home with your child and going to work could also accrue an additional cost in childcare. Sometimes the cost of childcare can be immense and can exceed the cost of college tuition. The cost of childcare is dictated by where you're located, the quality of childcare, and the age of your child.For babies and toddlers, the average cost of childcare in the U.S. is $11,666 per year.
For preschoolers, the average yearly cost of childcare in the U.S. is $8,800 per year., Adding both of your monthly incomes together then subtracting your expenses will give you an outlook for how much money you are making each month, and how much profit you are netting to your savings account. Now go back and subtract your personal income from the combined household income. This will give you a good idea of how much money you'd have, or how much money you'd have to borrow to live off of one person's income.For example, if you make $27,000 and your partner makes $30,000 that's a combined household income of $57,000. If you decide to stay at home, this number will be reduced to $30,000.
If your fixed expenses are $2,200 a month, that comes out to $26,400 yearly. If your income is $30,000 a year it leaves your family with $3,600 before subtracting other expenses.

, Costs that tend to change from month to month can be considered discretionary spending and includes things such as gifts, eating out, or buying new clothes. These are items that you purchase occasionally and not at a regular frequency. Create another row on your spreadsheet called ""discretionary spending"" and make a list of things that you purchased throughout the month. This will give you an estimate of the amount of money that you need each month for discretionary spending.


For example, if you spend $200 a month on dining out and around $200 a month on gifts and clothes, that comes out to a discretionary spending budget of $4,800.
If you have $3,600 after your fixed expenses, adding in discretionary spending reduces your money to -$1,200 per year.

, Now that you have an idea of how much money you'd lose realistically if you stopped working, decide if it's possible for your family to do it. If you've done the calculations and your number is negative, it means your partner may have to find a better paying job or you'll have to make adjustments to your spending habits to accommodate one income. If there is still enough money left over for considerable savings, then you could stay home without it hurting your household.

, After you've calculated your expenses and assets, don't refrain from staying at home because the numbers don't add up. Look for sales when you go shopping and take advantage of special offers and promotions. Use coupons and consider buying second-hand goods. This will cut down on your discretionary spending and allow you more freedom to use the funds elsewhere. Once you lower your monthly costs, calculate your expenses and see if it's viable for you to be a stay at home parent. If you save $30 each week at the grocery store by purchasing generic brands or using coupons, that's a yearly savings of $1,560 per year.
The point of evaluating your budget and expenses is to determine where you can reduce your spending.

, Once you take a look at your fixed monthly costs, locate monthly services that you rarely use. This could include things like a magazine subscription, a website membership, a gym membership, an elaborate cable package, or high-speed internet. Consider your needs and see if you can renegotiate lower prices or downgrade your services to save money every month., If you have a large discretionary spending budget, it's better to put that towards the bills and fixed expenses that you have to pay. Consider changing your lifestyle and cutting back on buying unnecessary things like expensive clothing, shoes, or jewelry. If you have an expensive habit like buying coffee or a smoothie in the morning, consider buying the ingredients to make it at home for a lower cost.

, If you do the math and you still can't afford to be at home regardless of what you cut out, do a calculation and see if you can survive working part-time. Talk to your employer and see if they can reduce your hours so that you can still make money, but have enough time to be at home for your child.You can ask your boss by saying something like, ""As you know, Mary was just born and I want to spend more time with her. I love this job and the atmosphere, but I need some extra time at home. Would you consider cutting down my hours so I can spend more time with her?""

, Go on job boards and look for jobs that allow people to work from remote locations. Search for keywords like ""remote"" or ""work from home."" You can also use your online network on platforms like LinkedIn to find opportunities to work from home. Find a job that lets you set your own schedule so that you can work it around your child.Some of the most popular work at home jobs include writers, consultants, customer service representatives, and engineers."

Spend time together.,
Let the child know you love them.,
Have regular conversations.,
Encourage a child's conversation by using conversation extenders.,
Validate their feelings.,
Demonstrate respect for the child.,
Respect the child's abilities.,
Allow the child to learn from their mistakes.,
Give your children choices.,
Respect their quirks and individuality.",How to Make a Child Feel Valued1," This basic step is a building block for teaching a child to feel you value her as an individual. Find ways to spend special time alone with your child. This will foster respect and closeness, and allow you to learn more about what your child wants and needs.Activities you do with your child don't have to be complicated. Time spent together can be as simple as taking a walk, sharing a picnic snack, or going together to a favorite spot.
Your child is more likely to approach you with their needs if they feel comfortable spending alone time with you.;
, Children need to be reassured that they are loved by the adults in their lives. This love should not be based in conditions. Remember that love is non-judgmental and unconditional. Sometimes children of divorced parents need additional confirmation that they still have their parents' love.
While you may be proud of your child's achievements, make sure the child knows that you love them regardless of whether they bring home a perfect report card or not.

, Talking to a child about daily activities allows them to know that you care about their life. Having conversations with an adult may also give the child a positive sense of maturity. Include a variety of questions to help support your conversation.Avoid rhetorical questions, which your child may not know how to interpret.
Instead, use open-ended questions as often as possible, which will allow the child to know that you're interested in what they have to say. Open-ended questions usually start with Who, What, Where, When, Why, or How.

, Children may not have the skills to express themselves without some help. If you want a child to share her experience with you, help support her by asking questions like, ""And then what happened?"" or ""Tell me more!""Inviting your child to continue to share about her experience will allow her to know you value her individual perspective.
The conversation extenders will also model for her ways in which she can ask for more information with a peer, another adult, or to increase her ability to articular her own experience.

, Treat their emotions as important, even if you don't understand or agree. This lets the child know that you think their perspective is important and worth listening to. Make it clear that it's okay for them to feel the way they do.


You can validate their feelings while not doing what they want. For example, ""I know you don't want to take a bath. It's lots of fun to play with dolls, and it's not fun to be told to stop. You need a bath because it's important to stay clean. You can choose the bath toys, and we can make lots of bubbles if you want.""

, When you listen to your child share the story of their day, or provide special time together, you're showing your child you respect them. Don't rush them through their answers, or make them feel you're too busy for their attention. To teach your child they're valued, allow them to feel that you prioritize time spent with them.Allow your child to answer questions for themselves. Try to avoid ""filling in the blanks"" for your child in conversation. For example, don't answer a question for your child, such as ""No, Jack won't like popcorn. He never likes popcorn!"" Instead, turn to Jack and ask him, ""Jack, your friend's mom wants to know if you want popcorn. Do you?""
Refraining from profanity, and not speaking rudely are other elements of respect.

, Doing things for your child that they can do for themselves is suggesting that you doubt their capabilities. Instead, make them feel that you value what they can do for themselves. For example, rather than putting a coat on a 3-year old, allow her to take the time to do it for herself.Doing things for your child over time reinforce a sense of helplessness in the child's idea of themselves.
Remember that there are cultural differences in typical ideas of child development, and be mindful of respecting these differences. For instance, some cultures teach the use of eating with silverware at a very young age, while others continue to eat with their hands.

, Teaching independence means to allow for a higher possibility of mistakes. This is a natural consequence of learning a new skill. Because young children are concrete thinkers, learning the natural consequences that follow an action is an important part of their learning development.Showing your child that you trust them to make their own choices, and to learn from their mistakes, emphasizes that you value their independence.
Make sure that the consequences of their learning won't have overly detrimental affects on their physical or emotional safety. For example, if your nephew is just learning to look both ways before crossing the street, you'll obviously want to protect him from busy intersections. However, allowing him to practice independently looking both ways before crossing together with you is a good idea.

, Allowing for your child to have genuine choices is an important part of letting them know you value their preferences. The choices you provide should all be equally valid choices—that is, don't present choices that are impossible to meet, or which you're sure the child won't select. Instead, present a range of options whenever possible.You don't want to overwhelm your child with choices. Choosing from 2-3 options is generally enough. For example, ""Do you want corn or sweet potatoes with your ham?""
Providing choices that you wouldn't choose yourself encourages independence in your child.

, Your child is not a blank slate; they are a unique person with their own traits. You can teach your child, but don't try to change them. Instead, let them be who they are.


For example, if your son dislikes organized sports, don't force him into one. Instead, let him choose a way to exercise that he enjoys. Or if your little sister is autistic, don't tell her to hide her disability in public, and let her be herself.

Be consistent.,
Try to spend quality time with your child every day.,
Show that you value your own well-being.,
Set appropriate rules and boundaries.,
Be there for them when they're struggling.,
Focus on negative behavior, rather than saying the child is bad.",How to Make a Child Feel Valued2," Being consistent means that the expectations and rules that are set should be the same from day to day, and place to place. Consistency gives a child a sense of well-being, safety, and security. It teaches a child accountability for their actions, and helps provide a safe boundary for exploration.


If you're inconsistent, you're giving a child the information that their needs are not important to you.
Having regular daily routines at home will help provide a better sense of security for your child. If these routines are based in your child's needs, they'll better understand that they are valued.

, It helps to get into a routine (for example, taking a half hour walk every day after your child comes home from school). This can help ensure that you spend time with them. Set aside blocks of time where you can be with your child.


If you're really busy one day and don't spend much time with them, make up for it by spending more time with them on a later day.

, Modeling self-care for a child is an important aspect of teaching a child what it means to be valued. Taking care of your health, hygiene, psychological and emotional needs are all part of what it means to care for your own well-being.


Don't remain in situations where you're abused, neglected or mistreated.
Take time for yourself when you need it. You don't have to be constantly available at the whims of your child. If you really need some quiet time, say so, and set up the child with something they can do independently.
If you need help understanding more about self-care, ask for help from a friend or professional.

, For a child to feel valued, they must also feel safe. Safety comes from adults having good, healthy boundaries. The adult is responsible for providing structure and support.This doesn't mean that you can't have fun with your child. However, you must be prepared to interrupt a fun game in order to ensure that the child's safety needs are met.
Consider your child's individual personality. Some children need more structure to feel safe than other children. It's important to meet the needs of your particular child.

, If your child is upset, respond with empathy and patience, not judgment. Ask what's wrong, and work together on brainstorming ways to make things better.


Be gentle and firm about rules. For example, ""I know you want the purple car. The rule we set is that you can pick out one toy, and you already chose the pink car. It's your choice which car you get."" You can empathize with the child while still expecting them to adhere to the rules.

, Let your child know that even if their behavior is unacceptable in a given situation, you still care about and love them no matter what. Everyone makes mistakes, wrong decisions, and errors in judgment. If your child is learning that they're valued, they'll be learning to make this distinction as well.Reminding them that they will have other opportunities to make better choices is one way of encouraging them to learn.
If your child repeatedly engages in the same negative behavior, consider what response you are providing. If you tend to engage more frequently with your child regarding negative behaviors, they may be acting out in search of your attention.

Assess the situation as objectively as possible.,

Don't be a snoop.,
Show a united front.,
Ask your child if they want to move out.,
If you make up your mind that your adult child is ready to move out, set a deadline.,
When it gets closer to the date, start going over what the adult child will/will not take with them.,
If the deadline passes, get serious.,
If they have made up yet another excuse about why they aren't quite ready to move out, charge rent for their room.",How to Get Your Adult Children to Move Out," As a parent, you might have mixed feelings about encouraging your child to move out. On one hand, you might enjoy the company, or you don't want them to struggle on their own, or you don't want to feel like you're ""kicking"" anyone out. On the other hand, perhaps you sense that your child is not pulling his/her own weight, and if you don't take action s/he might never become self-sufficient. It's important to sort through all of these feelings before you talk to your child.;
, Be honest-- confront any ways in which having your child live at home makes you feel uncomfortable, and don't allow guilt to make you bite your tongue. Some reasons are obvious, such as if your child blatantly disrespects your privacy or belongings. Some reasons are subtle and somewhat personal and embarrassing, like overhearing your child with their lover(s), or the fact that you seem to be the one who ends up doing their laundry.


Consider whether there is a real reason your child cannot live on their own. Sometimes a parent is reluctant to push a child out of the house if they believe the child simply doesn't have the resources to live independently. In most cases, however, the child is perfectly capable of being independent, but it will require some downgrading -- like moving from a house to a bare bones apartment with roommates. If you determine this is the case, recognize that by allowing your child to stay, you're catering to their comfort, not to real circumstances.

, It's bad enough your child feels unable to live out there as an individual without having parents show a huge lack of trust. Do not invade your child's privacy by going through their belongings. You're all adults, so come out and ask what you want to know.

, It's very common for one parent to want a child to move out and the other parent to be resistant to the idea. But before you can nudge your child towards independence, you've got to be on the same page. See How to Compromise With Your Spouse.

, This is a simple question, but will reveal a lot about why your child is still living at home. Usually the answer will be something like ""Yeah, of course, but..."" followed by a list of reasons why it just can't happen at the moment. Evaluate those reasons objectively, keeping in mind that there are probably other reasons --real reasons - that your child hasn't verbalized, such as that they enjoy having you to do their laundry, or being able to use your car without having to make car or insurance payments, etc. What you want to do is address the verbalized reasons (which, in many cases - but not all - are excuses) one by one, with facts:


""I'm looking for a job."" Is that true, really? How often are they checking classifieds and job sites? In the meantime, are they volunteering so that they can make contacts, and can account for any gaps in their resume? Are they looking for ""a"" job or ""the"" (perfect) job? Are they unwilling to work a minimum wage job until they find something better?
""I can't afford a place."" Is it that your child can't afford a place, or that they can't afford a place as comfortable as your place? Maybe they can't afford a place in your neighborhood and there's a reason for that; living in a nice neighborhood is one of the rewards of having a successful career. Look around: Where do other young adults live? Does your child feel like they're ""too good"" to live there? Do you feel like they're ""too good"" to live there?
""I want to save up for a house, car, grad school, etc."" This is probably the most legitimate reason to stick around at home, but only if your child is accountable to it. How much do they actually have saved up? What is the ultimate goal? Are they consistently putting money away, or do their savings patterns depend on how many good movies or video games are out that week? If they can prove that saving money is a priority for them, it's all good. But don't just take your kid's word for it. If that's the reason for staying home and getting a free ride, you're entitled to see pay stubs and bank statements, just like financial aid offices are entitled to see tax forms before they provide financial assistance. So you need to develop some strategies to establish a new adult-to-adult relationship.

, Inform the child that the deadline stands or rent begins, along with associated requirements for paying a share of the water, the electricity bill, heating costs, service costs, etc. Being forced to chip in can often make living independently seem more viable.


Have your adult child make a plan. For example, get a job, save paychecks, look for an apartment and so forth.
Pick up boxes and get a calendar; start marking off the days with great show.

, For example, furniture, bedding, etc.

, Send bills and part payment demands. If these are not met, start disconnecting services, cable, phone, etc.

, Chances are they are not going to be too comfortable paying rent for a room. This will get them mad and they will want to move out fast!

Allow curiosity.,
Let your child ask “why” questions.,
Value your child’s questions.,
Pose questions to your child.",How to Encourage Children to Ask Questions1," Adults often see the world through well-seasoned eyes, yet children are often seeing and experiencing things for the first time. This fills children with curiosity, wonder, and amazement.Children often ask questions out of curiosity and not as a way to be annoying. Encourage your child to ask questions and be curious by responding with things like ""Wow! Great question — you must be a very curious boy!"" and then answer. This helps the child see himself as a question-asker.


See a child’s questions as an opportunity to engage with the child about something he is interested in.;
, While this question often leads to frustration for adults, it’s often important for children to know why certain cause and effect relationships happen. For example, if you ask your child to do something, she may be curious as to why it’s important to do that task or behave in a certain way. Allow your child the space to ask why.It’s important for children to know why things happen, why they need to be safe, why learning is important. Remind yourself that gaining information is important to your child.
Be okay with saying you don't know the answer. If your child asks you a question you can't answer, it's okay to say, ""You know, I don't know!"" Follow this up by encouraging your child to find the answer, or say ""Let's find out together"" so you can show your child what resources are available to answer her questions and how to use them.

, If you get flustered or annoyed easily by your child’s questions, he may begin to think that you do not want to answer questions or that asking questions feels bad or is not okay. Focus on showing your child that questions matter by giving encouraging responses. This will encourage your child to ask questions freely and feel good about being curious.If your child asks a question during an inconvenient time, promise to look it up and answer the question later. Be sure to follow through later; set a reminder for yourself on your phone if you need to.

, Model asking questions in order to support your child asking questions. If your child asks you a question, ask one back to your child. This can help the child think critically or find a creative response. Asking questions back can help foster better social, emotional, and cognitive development.Initiate questions with your child. Ask questions around specific activities. If you’re playing with trains, ask, “Why do we use trains? What do we use trains for? Where do trains go?”
If your child asks, “Why is that kid crying?” say back, “What do you think happened to make that child sad?” You can follow that questions with, “What things make you feel sad?”

"
"
Create a secure space.,
Reward questions.,
Allow time for children to think of questions.,
Roll with embarrassing questions.,
Avoid offering examples.",How to Encourage Children to Ask Questions2," Make sure all children know that asking questions is okay and that no one will criticize or judge questions. It is especially important for shy or insecure children to know that there is no “wrong” question. Discourage feedback or edits to the questions. Remind children that it’s okay to ask questions they do not know the answers to.Other kids may say, “That’s a dumb question.” Redirect attention and assure the children that all questions are respected.

, Children are often rewarded for having the correct answer, and not for asking questions. Shift the focus to encourage questions. Give rewards for questions, even if the reward is just verbal praise. Children can learn that approaching topics through curiosity is rewarded, and rewards are not only for good test scores or high grades. This can encourage higher-level thinking and comprehension.For example, say, “I love that you’re asking questions. Let’s explore this further.” You can also say, “Wow, what a great question!”

, Children may struggle to come up with questions at first. That’s okay. Allow them time to think and come up with ideas.You can designate specific “Question Times” when children think of questions they may want to ask.


Don’t put a time limit on the process at first and let the children have time to think through their questions.

, Children often ask what adults consider inappropriate or embarrassing questions, especially in public, such as: “Why is that girl in a wheelchair?” or “Why does that man have a different color skin?” Don’t shame or shush your child for asking these types of questions.This can make the child feel ashamed, guilty, or embarrassed for asking a question. Instead, answer matter-of-factly without making the child feel bad about asking the question.


You can say, “Some people look different from you. Have you noticed that some people have glasses, some have curly hair, and some have different colored eyes? Every person is unique. Skin color is one way that people look different from you, but it doesn’t make people any different from you on the inside.”

, While you may think that giving examples may help a child build questions, they can set the child onto a specific path. You want her to come up with original questions without putting up limits. She may struggle to come up with questions, and that’s okay. If she urges you to give guidance, say, “Your questions can begin with what, when, or how.”You can also say, “I want to hear what you come up with. Your questions don’t have to follow any guidelines. Feel free to ask questions you think up.”

"
"
Divide children into groups.,
Encourage questions around new topics.,
Make it fun.,
Discourage children from answering the questions.",How to Encourage Children to Ask Questions3," Group work can encourage kids to work together, bounce ideas off of each other, and increase creativity. It’s okay if groups are moving at different paces. If one group is struggling to come up with ideas, don’t push them. Remind them of the activity and keep them on task.Encourage each child to contribute to the group without putting pressure on the children. Don’t make participation required through participation points. This can cause extreme stress for anxious and shy children., When a new topic is introduced, ask children what questions they’d like to have answered by the end of the unit. Encourage children to engage with materials and be curious about new things.For example, if you are doing a unit on the scientific process, children may ask, “When will I use this?""; ""Will this help me understand science better?""; ""Can I use this in other areas of my life?”

, Children love games, so make question time into play. Allow children to get excited about asking questions. Play around with asking questions. Try to solve a problem with the group by allowing them to ask questions.Some examples include, “Can you make closed questions open questions?""; ""Can you make a statement into a question?""; ""How can you get more information by asking a question?”

, As questions come up, the natural tendency is for the child (or other children) to provide an answer. Discourage these behaviors and encourage collaboration and generation of questions. Gently put the children back on track.Say, “We’re not to the part of answering questions, yet. We are not focused on doing anything but creating questions.”

Have a family fiscal meeting.,
Ask for rent contributions.,
Ask for all-family household duties.,
Expect some resistance and respond with good, hard facts.,
Overcome guilt.,
Be grateful.",How to Get Adult Kids to Pay Their Share," It is definitely time to stop babying now. They're adults and they can take the hard facts. Explain to them the costs involved in keeping them, ranging from food, electricity, gas, maintenance of the home, clothing, cooking services, cleaning to providing a rent-free room. If you have been offering these things free-of-charge, it may well be that your kids just don't see the harsh reality of the costs involved.;
, Make a family agreement that everyone living in the home is responsible for its upkeep and that includes financial upkeep, as well as regular cleaning and maintenance. Set a weekly rent that covers approximately 30% of their pay, to get them to understand what it costs and how it feels to have to depart with a set amount of pay ""just to have a roof over your head"". Put all of this down in writing and draw up a budget if needs be.

, No single person is responsible in a household for taking on all the chores. Everybody who is there must lift their weight to help keep the house in great shape. Allocate cleaning, gardening, shopping, pet feeding, mending/repair and general chores to every family member able to perform tasks. It is probably also a good idea to throw in cooking at least two meals a week as part of the deal. Write all of this up as a weekly schedule and pin it up where everyone can see it. Make it clear that getting out of a task means negotiating with another family member rather than just not doing it.

, They have been living it easy, so they might complain. Be ready for this, armed with visual evidence of the costs for living away from home. This takes step one a little further; rather than just explaining, demonstrate clearly where the costs come from. Show them how much average rents are in your area, show them the grocery bills for an average shopping trip, the electricity costs for an average home, and the costs of things such as fuel, mortgage payments and interest rates. Their awareness will soon increase, and even if they still feel resentful, they will realize that their situation is a good one.

, If one or more of your adult children is living with you, it's probably because you want to help them; perhaps they've hit a rough patch, and more than likely, you enjoy having them nearby. You might feel guilty when you demand contributions, especially if you see your child as being in a difficult position. When this happens, keep the following in mind:


Sheltering them from the harsh reality of life isn't helping them. Your job as a parent is to teach them how to become independent adults who can survive and thrive on their own.Having them pull their own weight in your home will teach them that there's no such thing as a free lunch. It's better for them to learn responsibility from you, than from a boss firing them or a spouse divorcing them.
You're not the only one struggling with these issues. Children who come back home as adults are called ""mammoni"", or ""mama's boys"" in Italy; ""parasaito shinguru"", or ""parasite singles"" in Japan; ""boomerangs"" or ""twixters"" in the US; ""KIPPERS"" (short for ""kids in parents' pockets eroding retirement savings"") in the UK; and ""Hotel Mama"" in Germany. There are parents across the world who will identify with your struggle to give tough love.

, When your adult children do start contributing more, let them know how much you appreciate their contribution to the household and family and thank them. And sometimes, you may need to give them some slack during periods of redundancy, or saving for a big-ticket item such as travel, etc. You'll be able to judge this as the occasions arise.

A warm touch or a caring hug can let your child know how much you really care about him or her. Don't ever overlook how important a physical connection is when it comes to your child. Here are some ways to show love and affection:


A gentle cuddle, a little encouragement, appreciation, approval or even a smile can go a long way to boost the confidence and well-being of your children.

Tell them you love them every day, no matter how angry at them you may be.
Give lots of hugs and some kisses. Make your children comfortable with love and affection from birth.
Love them unconditionally; don't force them to be who you think they should be in order to earn your love. Let them know that you will always love them no matter what.;
, Praising your children is an important part of being a good parent. You want your kids to feel proud of their accomplishments and good about themselves. If you don't give them the confidence they need to be out in the world on their own, then they won't feel empowered to be independent or adventurous. When they do something good, let them know that you've noticed and that you're very proud of them.


Make a habit of praising your children at least three times as much as you give them negative feedback. Though it's important to tell your children when they're doing something wrong, it's also important to help them build a positive sense of self.
If they are too young to fully understand, praise them with applause and lots of love. Encouraging them for doing everything from using the potty to getting good grades can help them lead a happy and successful life.
Avoid blanket phrases like ""Good job!"". Instead provide descriptive praise which lets them know exactly what is being appreciated. For example ""You did great taking turns with your sister while playing"" or ""Thank you for cleaning up the toys after playing with them!""

, Each child is individual and unique. Celebrate their differences and instill in each child the desire to pursue their interests and dreams. Failure to do so may give your child an inferiority complex, an idea that they can never be good enough in your eyes. If you want to help them improve their behavior, talk about meeting their goals on their own terms, instead of telling them to act like their sister or neighbor. This will help them develop a sense of self instead of having an inferiority complex.


Comparing one child to another can also make one child develop a rivalry with his or her sibling. You want to nurture a loving relationship between your children, not a competitive one.
Avoid favoritism. Surveys have shown that most parents have favorites, but most children believe that they are the favorite. If your children are quarreling, don't choose sides, but be fair and neutral.
Overcome natural birth order tendencies by making each child responsible for themselves. Putting older kids in charge of the younger one stokes sibling rivalry, whereas making them take responsibility for themselves encourages individuality and self-reliance.

, It's important that your communication with your children goes both ways. You shouldn't just be there to enforce rules, but to listen to your children when they are having a problem. You have to be able to express interest in your children and involve yourself in their life. You should create an atmosphere in which your children can come to you with a problem, however large or small.


You can even set aside a time to talk to your children every day. This can be before bedtime, at breakfast, or during a walk after school. Treat this time as sacred and avoid checking your phone or getting distracted.
If your child says he has to tell you something, make sure you take this seriously. If the timing is right now, drop everything you're doing to listen properly, or set up a time to talk when you can really listen.
Don't underestimate your children's intelligence. They often have insights to share or a way of sensing when something is wrong (or right). Take the time to hear their perspectives.

, Be careful not to stifle or smother them, however. There's a big difference between protecting someone and imprisoning them within your too unyielding demands. You want them to feel like your time together is sacred and special without making them feel like they are forced to spend time with you.


Spend time with each child individually. Try to divide your time equally if you have more than one child.
Listen and respect your child and respect what they want to do with their life. Remember though, you are the parent. Children need boundaries. A child who has been allowed to behave as they please and had their every whim indulged will struggle in adult life when they have to obey the rules of society. You are NOT a bad parent if you don't allow your children to have everything they want. You can say no, but you should provide a reason for saying no or offer an alternative. ""Because I said so"" is an invalid reason!
Set aside a day to go to a park, theme parks, museum or library, depending on their interests.
Attend school functions. Do homework with them. Visit their teacher at open house/parents evening to get a sense of how they are doing in school.

, You may have a hectic work schedule, but you should do everything you can to be there for the important moments in your children's lives, from their ballet recitals to their high school graduation. Remember that children grow fast and that they'll be on their own before you know it. Your boss may or may not remember that you missed that meeting, but your child will most certainly remember that you didn't attend the play they were in. Though you don't actually have to drop everything for your children, you should at least always try to be there for the milestones.


If you were too busy to be there for your child's first day of school or another important milestone, you may regret it for the rest of your life. And you don't want your child to remember his high school graduation as the time when his mom or dad couldn't show up.

, Enforce rules that apply to every person leading a happy and productive life — not model rules of your ideal person. It's important to set rules and guidelines that help your child develop and grow without being so strict that your child feels like he can't take a step without doing something wrong. Ideally, your child should love you more than he fears your rules.


Communicate your rules clearly. Children should be very familiar with the consequences of their actions. If you give them a punishment, be sure they understand the reason and the fault; if you cannot articulate the reason and how they are at fault, the punishment will not have the discouraging effects you desire.
Make sure that you not only set reasonable rules, but that you enforce them reasonably. Avoid overly harsh forms of punishment, ridiculously stringent punishments for minor infractions, or anything that involves physically hurting your child.

, It's important to try to be as calm and reasonable as you can when you explain your rules or carry them out. You want your children to take you seriously, not fear you or think of you as unstable. Obviously, this can be quite a challenge, especially when your children are acting out or just driving you up the wall, but if you feel yourself getting ready to raise your voice, take a break, excuse yourself or let your kids know that you are beginning to get upset.


We all lose our tempers and feel out of control, sometimes. If you do or say something you regret, you should apologize to your children, letting them know that you've made a mistake. If you act like the behavior is normal, then they will try to mimic it.

, It's important to enforce the same rules all the time, and to resist your child's attempts to manipulate you into making exceptions. If you let your child do something he or she is not supposed to do just because he or she is throwing a tantrum, then this shows that your rules are breakable. If you find yourself saying, ""Okay, but only once..."" more than once, then you have to work on maintaining more consistent rules for your children.


If your child feels like your rules are breakable, he'll have no incentive to stick to them.

, If you have a spouse, then it's important that your children think of you as a united front — as two people who will both say ""yes"" or ""no"" to the same things. If your kids think that their mother will always say yes and their father will say no, then they'll think that one parent is ""better"" or more easily manipulated than the other. They should see you and your spouse as a unit so there's order in your high school, and so you don't find yourself in a difficult situation because you and your spouse don't agree on certain things when it comes to raising the kids.


This doesn't mean that you and your spouse have to agree 100% about everything having to do with the kids. But it does mean that you should work together to solve problems that involve the children, instead of being pitted against each other.
You shouldn't argue with your spouse in front of the children. If they are sleeping, argue quietly. Children may feel insecure and fearful when they hear parents bickering. In addition, children will learn to argue with each other the same way they hear their parents argue with each other. Show them that when people disagree, they can discuss their differences peacefully.

, Your kids should feel like there's a sense of order and a logic to things in their household and in their family life. This can help them feel safe and at peace and to live a happy life both in and outside of their home. Here are some ways that you can provide order for your children:


Set boundaries such as bedtimes and curfews, so they learn that they have limitations. By doing so, they actually get a sense of being loved and cared about by their parents. They might rebel at those boundaries, but inwardly enjoy knowing that concerned parents guide and love them.

Encourage responsibility by giving them jobs or ""chores"" to do and as a reward for those jobs give them some kind of privilege (money, extended curfew, extra play time, etc.). As ""punishment"" for not doing these jobs, they have the corresponding privilege revoked. Even the youngest of children can learn this concept of reward or consequence. As your child grows, give them more responsibilities and more rewards or consequences for completing those responsibilities or ignoring them.
Teach them what is right and wrong. If you are religious, take them to the religious institute that you follow, if they are interested. If you are an atheist or an agnostic, teach them your moral stance on things. In either case, don't be hypocritical or be prepared for your child to point out that you are not ""practicing what you preach"".

, It's important to criticize your children's actions, instead of your actual child. You want your child to learn that he or she can accomplish whatever he or she wants through his or her behavior, instead of being stuck being one kind of person. Let him or her feel like he has the agency to improve his behavior.


When your child acts out in a harmful and spiteful manner, tell him or her that such behavior is unacceptable and suggest alternatives. Avoid statements such as: ""You're bad."" Instead, say something like, ""It was very wrong to be mean to your little sister."" Explain why the behavior was bad.

Be assertive yet kind when pointing out what they have done wrong. Be stern and serious, but not cross or mean, when you tell them what you expect.
Avoid public humiliation. If they misbehave in public, take them aside, and scold them privately.

, Teach your children that it is okay for them to be different, and they do not have to follow the crowd. Teach them right from wrong when they are young, and they will (more often than not) be able to make their own decisions, instead of listening to or following others. Remember that your child is not an extension of yourself. Your child is an individual under your care, not a chance for you to relive your life through them.


When your children get old enough to make decisions for themselves, you should encourage them to choose which extra-curricular activities they want to do or what friends they want to play with. Unless you think an activity is very dangerous, or a playmate is a very bad influence, you should let your children figure things out for themselves.
A child may have an opposite disposition, such as being introverted when you are extroverted, and will not be able to fit into the pattern and style that you choose, and will make his or her own decisions instead.
They need to learn that their own actions have consequences (good and bad). By doing so, it helps them to become good decision makers and problem solvers so that they are prepared for independence and adulthood.
Don't routinely do things for your children that they can learn to do for themselves. While getting them a glass of water before bed is a nice way to make them get to sleep faster, don't do it so often that they come to expect it.

, If you want your child to be well-behaved, then you should model the behavior and character you hope your children will adopt and continue to live by the rules that you set. Show them by example in addition to verbal explanations. Children have a tendency to become what they see and hear unless they make a conscious and concerted effort to break the mold. You don't have to be a perfect person, but you should strive to do as you want your children to do, so you don't look hypocritical if you tell your children to be polite to others when they find you getting in a heated argument in the supermarket.


It's perfectly okay to make mistakes, but you should apologize or let your child know that the behavior is not good. You can say something like, ""Mommy didn't mean to yell at you. She was just very upset."" This is better than ignoring that you made a mistake, because that will show the child that he or she should model this behavior.
Want to teach kids about charity? Get involved and take your kids with you to a soup kitchen or homeless shelter and help serve up meals. Explain to them why you do acts of charity so they understand why they should.
Teach kids about chores by setting a schedule and having them help you out. Don't tell your child to do something, but ask for their help. The earlier they learn to help you, the longer they will be willing to.
If you want your son or daughter to learn to share, set a good example and share your things with them.

, Respect their privacy as you would want them to respect yours; for example, if you teach your child that your room is out of boundaries to them, respect the same with their room. Allow them to feel that once they enter their room, they can know that no one will look through their drawers, or read their diary. This will teach them to honor their own space and to respect the privacy of others.


If your child catches you snooping through his or her things, then it may take him or her a long time to be able to truly trust you again.

, It's important to make sure that your children eat healthy food as much as they can, that they get plenty of exercise, and that they get enough rest every night. You should encourage positive and healthy behavior without harping on it too much or making it seem like you're forcing your children to eat or act a certain way. Be the adviser, not the dictator. Let them come to these conclusions on their own while helping them see the meaning and importance of a healthy life.


One way to encourage them to exercise is to get them to play a sport early on in life, so they find a passion that is also healthy.
If you start over-explaining to the child that something is unhealthy or that they shouldn't get it, they may take it the wrong way and feel like you are condemning them. Once this happens, they may no longer want to eat with you, and they may feel bad eating around you, which could make them want to sneak and hide junk food from you.
When trying to enforce healthy eating habits, start it at a younger age. Giving rewards of candy to children may create a bad habit, because once they get older, some may feel they should reward themselves which can lead to obesity. While they are young, start them out with healthier snacks. Instead of chips, try goldfish (crackers), grapes, etc.
The eating habits they learn as they are younger are the ones they continue to have. Emphasize on finishing their plates, and teach them to take a small portion at a time; they can always take more afterwards, but they can't put food back after it has been on their plate.

, You can start talking about this even when children are young. Explain that they will have to wait until they are old enough to enjoy a drink with friends, and talk about the importance of designated drivers. Failure to discuss these issues early sometimes contributes to sneaking and dangerous experimentation, if they don't understand.


Once your friends get to an age where they and their friends start drinking alcohol, encourage them to talk about it with you. You don't want them to fear your reaction and to end up doing something regrettable, like driving drunk because they're too scared to ask for a ride.

, Don't make decisions for them all the time; they must learn how to live with the consequences from the choices they make. After all, they will have to learn to think for themselves sometime. It's best they start when you are there to help minimize the negative consequences and accentuate the positive ones.


They need to learn that their own actions have consequences (good and bad). By doing so, it helps them to become good decision makers and problem solvers so that they are prepared for independence and adulthood.

, Life is a great teacher. Don't be too quick to rescue your child from the results of their own actions if the consequences are not overly severe. For example, cutting themselves (in a minor way) may hurt, but it's better than leaving them unaware of why sharp objects should be avoided. Know that you can't protect your children forever, and they're better off learning life's lessons sooner than later. Though it can be hard to stand back and watch your child make a mistake, this will benefit both you and your child in the long run.


You shouldn't say ""I told you so"" when your child learns a life lesson on his own. Instead, let your child draw his own conclusions about what happened.
Be there for your child when he makes a mistake, whether big or small. By not preventing every little issue but providing helpful guidance to let them work through the effects, you can help teach them problem-solving and coping skills. Throughout this process, be supportive and helpful; just don't do it for them or isolate them from the real world.

, Gambling, alcohol and drugs can jeopardize your child's financial security. Smoking, for example, almost always introduces health hazards to your child's environment. Second-hand smoke has been linked to several respiratory ailments in children. It could also contribute to the early death of a parent. Alcohol and drugs might also introduce health hazards or violence to your child's environment.


Of course, if you enjoy having some wine or a few beers now and again, that's perfectly fine, as long as you model healthy consumption of alcohol and responsible behavior while you do it.

, There's a difference between wanting your child to be a responsible, mature individual and forcing your child to be perfect or to live up to your idea of what perfect should be. You shouldn't push your child to get perfect grades or to be the best player on his soccer team; instead, encourage good study habits and good sportsmanship, and let your child put in the effort that he is capable of.


If you act like you only expect the best, your child will feel like he or she may never measure up, and may even rebel in the process.
You don't want to be the person that your child is afraid of because he feels like he will never measure up. You want to be a cheerleader for your child, not a drill sergeant.

, Though you may think you have already molded and raised your child into the person he or she will become by the time your child dons his or her graduation cap, this is far from true. Your parenting will have a life-long effect on your child and you should always give your child the love and affection he needs, even if you're hundreds of miles away. While you won't always be a constant daily presence in your child's life, you should always let your children know that you care about them and that you'll be there for them, no matter what.


Your children will still turn to you for advice, and will still be affected by what you say no matter what age they are. As the years go on, you can not only improve your parenting techniques, but you can start to think about how to be a good grandparent!

Try to invest in an artificial tree, as there is little to no maintenance and you don't need to clean up needles from your car to your apartment, and then from your apartment to the disposal each year.;
, Ask friends and family if they would be willing to take any decorations that take up too much space, whether it's in your apartment or any extra storage you have. There might be a chance that when you visit their place during the holidays, your things may be placed around there.

, Every house-owner with string lights always dresses up the outside perimeter of the house (typically the outlining of the roof and sides), as well as any trees in their front yard. Being an apartment tenant, string any lights around the inside wall perimeter with them slightly draping. You can use clear adhesive tape on the wires to hold them up to avoid drilling unnecessary holes.

If you have a balcony, use it to your advantage and wrap lights around the bars. Remember that power extension cords are a must if there are no electric outlets near the doors.
Encourage your kids to draw holiday pictures and hang them around the walls and refrigerator.







, Always drape a festive tablecloth and add decorations on it. They can be anything from small snow globes to peppermint scented candles. If there's other people living with you, consider placing a small bowl of Christmas related candy in the middle.

, Use an adhesive hook that can be removed easily and hang wreaths from them. If you're concerned about security or someone stealing it, consider placing it on the inside of the door or on the inside of your window.

Prepare to be grandparents.",How to Celebrate Being an Empty Nester," Raising children is an enormous, life-defining and intense job. Now is the time to revel in the fact that you “made” it and produced an independent child (or children), ready to taken on the challenges of the world. You have now entered a group of human beings who have made an enormous contribution to society by responsibly and consistently raising children to become fine young adults.


Think about what your child has accomplished. One of the best ways to celebrate your empty nest status is to celebrate your child’s accomplishments. Remind yourself about how far you’ve come and how far your child will go. Even though your child has left the house, he or she will need your continued support and love for the rest of your life––the journey doesn’t end here. Take out the awards, certificates, report cards and other memorabilia that attests to your child's milestones and accomplishments. You had a big part to play in all of these––be proud.;
, Be happy that although your nest may be a little bare now, celebrate that you’ve taught your child well and have produced an individual who will go forward as an independent, well-rounded individual.


Remember that the ultimate goal was to raise your children so they could leave without needing you. After years of diapers, homework supervision, dance recitals and football games, parents tend to forget that the ultimate goal was to raise your child in order for them to leave home, holding forth their accomplishments to help them thrive in this world. While this is a bittersweet moment for most parents, instead of thinking of it as sad, take a celebratory attitude and know that you did your job well and that all those endless hours of being mom's taxi or dad's listening post have now paid dividends.

, Celebrating your empty nester status doesn't mean putting on a brave front and denying how you're feeling inside. Indeed, it's important that you acknowledge the feelings and deal with them gently, as well as finding the upbeat path to your new future. It's possible that you're experiencing a whole gamut of feelings, including sadness, guilt at the relief you're suddenly feeling, a sense of loss, feeling lost about your next steps, exhilaration, worry, and so forth. All such feelings are normal and unless they cause you to withdraw or sit on the sofa endlessly wondering what to do next, working through them at your own pace will set them to rest. Above all, let go of guilt, especially if it's caused by thinking you should be feeling sad but you're not; you have done your best and you now deserve this time back to yourself.


Many empty nesters find that the time after children is a renewal period in which their marriages or relationships with others improve dramatically, mainly due to the fact that not having children around allows for relaxed responsibility and increased freedom.If you feel yourself dipping into despair, anxiety or deep sadness, talk to your doctor immediately. It is not uncommon to experience depression or a sense of helplessness after children leave home, especially if you chose to stay home or work part-time to be with them. Suddenly the world can seem like a very large, bewildering place after child-raising and its associated activities, so getting help to make this transition makes good sense.

, In the early days of parenthood, parents may long for the days of extended romantic dinners and being intimate without worrying about having the kids in the house. After years of getting used to being parents first and lovers last, it's not surprising to have forgotten about the days of being an intimate couple or even single, and all the wonderful things associated with this such as lack of responsibility and freedom to come and go as you please.


Tap into passions or hobbies you put on hold when the babies arrived. What were your interests before becoming parents? Perhaps you were an avid painter or a vintage car restoration expert; maybe you simply liked hanging out at pubs or cafes and watching life go by. In some cases, the demands of parenthood, coupled with a career and community roles, consumes every waking hour, leaving no additional room for passions or hobbies. With the kids on their own, now is the time to re-embrace your original loves.
Revel in the fact that you can finally have some “you” time. Ever feel as if your needs were last on the list when the kids were in the house? Remember that an empty nest means that you have more time to focus on what you want and need.

, In a two-parent household, often one parent will scale back in his or her career in order to be home or to work part-time so as to be more available for the kids. Now that the kids have fled the household, you might be keen to turn your focus back to furthering your career or developing your talents in a different area by returning to studies or a bridging course. A lot of nonsense has been touted over the years about the aging brain; nowadays, science has shown that our brain is wired for continual learning no matter what our age and that it really is true that with age comes wisdom, as older people draw on the wealth of their life's experience and what they lack in speed, they make up for in sound judgment. Don't let your age hold you back; we live in an era where changing ourselves every decade is now normal.

, Celebration includes having fun and living it up, so mark this life change with an event that will go down in history. Action beats moping, and there are plenty of exciting opportunities open to you now, such as:


Travel. Since you're no longer a slave to your child’s school and after-school activity schedule, book a European cruise in the fall or check out a remote island in the Caribbean in January. In fact, traveling during off times can not only be more enjoyable due to less crowds, it can also be financially less painful. If you're retired, consider road tripping in an RV––the sky (or at least, the very long road) is the limit. If you are retired, be sure to get proof of your age and any welfare status, as many countries will now accept this evidence for giving you reduced entry fees and other specials; make the most of these savings!
Try a new adventure. For example, if you’ve wanted to skydive, ride in a balloon or try zip lining, go for it. Perhaps in the past you held back, worried that if something happened to you, your children would be orphaned. While there are risks associated with everything, you're entitled to “you” time to go for the out-of-the-ordinary adventure.
Throw a party. Most likely many of your friends are experiencing the same phenomenon and some may be taking their empty nest particularly hard. Instead of wallowing, have a party, invite your friends and dedicate the party to your new-found freedom. For an added bonus, invite all the kids too––they may be just as thrilled to have their freedom as you having yours.

, Now that your life doesn’t demand that you own a four-bedroom home and drive a minivan, make some changes that will save you money and time. After a few months or even a year, pursue your dreams of independence by making distinct changes that reflect your situation now. Maybe these changes include a hot red sports car, a jacuzzi, a small apartment in a swank part of downtown near the cafes, a trek across the Himalayas or a new business to indulge something you've always wanted to do. Whatever it is, plan well and get going with it. At the very least, stop cruising around in an empty minivan! Here are some common empty nester to-dos:


Downsize. Has living in the ""burbs near the good school districts"" lost its charm? If that quaint beach house or condo-in-the-city has been calling your name for the past decade, go for it; if you purchased your home because the local school facilities were so great, there will be another family crashing down your door to get into the neighborhood. And when buying your new home, don’t forget to choose a place with a guestroom, so that your adult child can visit (if not, sofa beds work a treat).
Move interstate or even overseas. Perhaps you've always dreamed of living somewhere much, much warmer than your current location. With the children gone, this possibility opens up. Depending on your financial resources, you might consider a vacation home in the warmer place, or perhaps a permanent home. Whatever you decide, even reticent children will grow to accept the change, especially when they realize they can have sunny vacation visits.
Trade your vehicle for a very “un-family friendly” ride. Unless your family “truckster” is new, you may want to consider dumping it for a vehicle that’s made for someone single or a couple. Not only will a zippy new car help you assert your independence, it may save you a few bucks on gas versus the van or SUV you’ve been hauling kids around in for years. Another bonus is that you'll no longer be called on to ferry around everyone else's kids who haven't yet left their nests!
Embark upon a new career. Have you been working at the same safe-but-unfulfilling-job for years simply because you needed the cash to support your children? Or have you been home the entire time to raise children and finally want to go to work? Now that the kids have found their independence, consider “going for” your dream job. However, do your research and have a concrete plan before switching careers––especially one you’d been in for several years. You might find that things have changed dramatically and you'll need upgrading too; don't feel threatened. See this as a fantastic opportunity to improve your knowledge and skills and to be at the front of the queue again.

, Economic conditions and the demands of life have made young adult independence a murky area. During a tough job market, some young adults end up moving back in with mom and dad due to economic downsizing or the scarcity of jobs.


Understand that they could move back in. Especially during the early years, young adults may find it economically advantageous to live at home for a few years. If your child is graduating from college, working in a low paying job or simply trying to save money, he or she may ask if his/her childhood room is still available. It's up to you as to whether or not this situation can be accommodated but know ahead of time what your answer is likely to be, so that you can plan accordingly. After all, if you've since downsized, having your adult child live on the sofa for a year might just end up driving you all crazy!
Your child and his or her family may need to move back in with you. No matter what age, from job loss to divorce or home repossession, your child may find him/herself in dire straits and need a safe haven. After a divorce, job loss or if your child has experienced a catastrophic situation, he or she may seek solace at your home. Of course, this may never happen, so it's not a reason to hold up your life's plans but do be conscious that if something does happen, you may be called on to lend a helping hand.

, Not all children will go on to be parents but most do, so it's probably on the cards for your life eventually. Being grandparents can mean the restoration of the busy, noisy household but this time, on terms that you define well in advance. While grandparents are considered to be ideal caregivers, this doesn't mean that you have to assume this role, especially not daily or long-term. Weigh up what sort of a life you want to be leading now and how much of this includes your grandchildren; don't over-extend yourself or you may resent having to do a second parenthood role.


With the two household income being more of the norm just to make ends meet for many people, some young parents will ask grandma and grandpa if they could provide childcare duties while they are at work. In fact, some young parents simply assume that the grandparents will be fine with this. For some grandparents, the opportunity provides another chance to help raise a child and is taken up with glee. For others, they’d prefer to just be grandma or grandpa in the background, sharing sporadic play dates (and keeping their nest completely empty). Do not feel you have to oblige if it doesn't work for you; your children will work out other arrangements.

Realize that a father's job is never done.",How to Be a Good Father," Your children don't care if you've just had a big promotion at your company or whether or not you own the most expensive house on the block. What they do care about is whether or not you'll be home in time for dinner, if you'll take them to the baseball game on Sunday, and if you'll be around for movie night that week. If you want to be a good father, then you have to set aside time every day for your children -- or at least every week -- no matter how busy you are.


Plug this time into your schedule. Maybe your best nights for your children are Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. Take the time to put in extra care during those days, and don't let other commitments get in the way.
If you have more than one child, then you should make time to see each child individually, so your unique relationships can develop.
If you're so tired that you can't possibly make yourself get up to basketball with your son/daughter, do something else with him/her instead, like watching a basketball game or a basketball-themed movie. It's important that you're there in some capacity.;
, Though planning ""daddy time"" for your kids each week is a great way to strengthen your relationship, you should also try to be there for important milestones in their lives. Arrange your work schedule so that you can be there for your son/daughter's first day of school, your son/daughter's first big sporting event, or your son/daughter's high school graduation.


Your children will remember these moments for the rest of their lives, and having you be there will mean a lot.
You may be very busy when one of your kids is about to hit a milestone, but if you miss out, you'll regret it later on.

, You should also be present to teach your children how to complete the basic tasks of life. You can help your son use the bathroom, teach your children to brush their teeth properly, help them learn how to ride a bike, and teach them to drive when the time comes. You can also teach your sons how to shave and maintain good hygiene. Your kids will need you to learn the big life lessons as well as the small everyday tasks.Split these lessons with your wife. You should both teach your children the important things they need to know to grow up.
Help your children learn from their mistakes. If they've done something wrong, you should help them see why and talk about how to avoid the behavior in the future instead of simply punishing them and moving on.

, Being present for the important moments in your children's lives is very important, and so is being able to communicate with your children when you're there. You don't always have to do something exciting with your kids for them to enjoy hanging out with you -- you just have to focus on being able to communicate with them, to understand their concerns and struggles.


Make sure to check in with your kids every day, so that you know what they're worried about, what they have coming in that week, and what's on their minds.
Don't just superficially ask, ""How was your day?"" without really wanting to know the answer.
If your children are teenagers or busy college students, then they may not want to discuss the details of their days with you. Just make sure to check in often enough that they know you care without feeling smothered.

, To be a good father, you should take the time to go trips with your kids -- with or without their mother. You can take a yearly fishing trip with your daughters, a trip to the beach with your son, or a camping trip that your kids will never forget. Whatever you do, try to make it special, memorable, and something that can be repeated at least once a year so that you've developed a fun daddy-centric routine.


If the children's mother is present during the trips, take some time to bond solo with your kids when you can.
Planning these trips a few months in advance will give your kids something fun and different to look forward to.

, Though it's important to be there for your kids, you should try to get some ""me time"" when you can, whether it's spending Sunday afternoon doing your own thing, or taking half an hour to run every morning or winding down with a good book every night before bed. You should put your kids' interests before your own most of the time, but don't completely neglect yourself, either.


If you don't make time for yourself, you won't be able to relax, recharge your batteries, and give your kids the time and attention they deserve.
You can have a special room or chair in the house where your kids know that you should not be disturbed. Help them get used to the idea of ""me time"" and explain that you're going to be doing your own thing for a little while -- unless they really need you.

, Being a disciplinarian isn't all about punishing your children when they've made a mistake. It's also about rewarding them when they've done something good so that they're encouraged and want to repeat the behavior. Whether they've gotten straight As, helped a younger sibling with a tough task, or were mature enough to walk away from a fight, you should let them know how proud you are of them, take them out to their favorite restaurant, or just do whatever you can to let them know how much you appreciate their good behavior.


When your children are younger, rewarding them with affection can go a long way in helping them see how proud you are.
Though giving your children a treat or a new toy when they've behaved well occasionally can reinforce good behavior, you shouldn't have toys or treats as the only incentive your children have for acting well. They should be motivated because you've taught them to separate right from wrong.
Don't reward your children for something that is expected of them, like doing chores around the house or cleaning up after themselves. If you do, then they'll feel like they're doing you a favor.

, To be a fair disciplinarian, you'll have to punish your children when they've made a mistake. This doesn't mean getting physical or psychologically cruel -- it just means letting your kids know when they've made a mistake and showing that there are consequences for their actions. Once your child is old enough to reason, he should know when he's made a mistake.Make sure that you and your wife agree on the punishment for the children. The consequences should be the same, whether Mommy or Daddy witnessed the action. This will help you avoid going into ""good cop, bad cop"" mode.

, Being consistent is just as important as having a system of punishments and rewards. If your child is misbehaving, the consequences should be the same every time, even if it's inconvenient or you're tired or out in public. And if your child does something great, don't forget to make him/her feel special, no matter how tired or stressed out you are.


If you don't act consistent, then your children will know that your reactions can be influenced by your moods.

, Though you may feel enraged by your children's behavior, yelling is not the solution. If you have to yell, try yelling when you're alone, in the shower, or into a pillow. But don't yell at your children, no matter how bad the urge is. You can raise your voice slightly to let them know they've made a mistake, but if you yell or scream, they'll be afraid of you and won't want to communicate.


Though it may be tough, you shouldn't let your children see you lose control.

, No matter how angry you are, you should avoid hitting, hurting, or grabbing your children. This will hurt them physically and emotionally and will make them want to avoid you at all costs. If your children think that you may get violent, they will shut down and won't want to be around you. You should avoid being violent around your children, or around their mother, if you want to gain their respect., It's important that your children know that you're a strict disciplinarian and that they can't pull a fast one on you, but it's equally important that they want your love and affection and have an amazing time bonding with you. To be a good father, you need to toe the line between enforcing tough lessons and also making your children feel loved and appreciated.


If you're too concerned about being feared, then your children may not feel comfortable enough to open up to you.
If you're too concerned about being loved, then your children may see you as a pushover who won't lay down the law.

, If you want to lead by your example, then your motto should be, ""Do as I say and as I do,"" so your children know you're not being hypocritical when you teach them right from wrong. If you want your children to act in a way that meets your expectations, then they should see the positive behavior from you first. Here are some ways that you can lead by example:


If you don't want your children to smoke or drink excessively, for example, then you shouldn't do these things in front of them -- or at all.
If you want your children to treat people with kindness and respect, then they have to see you treating people, from the waiter in your local restaurant to a telemarketer, with basic respect.
If you want your children to not pick fights, then don't pick a fight with their mother right in front of them.

, If you want to be a good role model, then you have to treat the children's mother with respect. If you're married to her, then you should let them see how much your love her, help her out, and enjoy her company. If you're mean to your own wife, then your children will see that it's okay to be mean to Mom or other people because Dad does it.Part of treating the children's mother with respect means sharing childcare and household duties with her.
Let your children see you praising their mother and giving her the love and affection that she deserves.
You should not only treat the children's mother with respect, but love her and work on maintaining a loving, fun, and nurturing relationship. If the children's mother is happy, then everyone is happy.
If you and the children's mother are divorced, then you should never say a bad word about their mother to them, even if you're not on the best terms. Letting them see your less-than-ideal relationship with their mother will make them stressed and confused.

, You don't have to be perfect to be a good role model. In fact, it's better if you're not perfect, because then your children will see that nobody's perfect and that everybody makes mistakes. If you've made a mistake, like forgetting to pick your child up from school at the right time, or losing your temper, you should apologize and say that you know you've made a mistake.


If you can swallow your pride in front of your children, then they'll see that it's okay for them to admit when they've done something wrong, too.
Admitting when you're wrong builds more character than ""doing the right thing"" every single time.

, If you want your children to help out around the house, then you should help out around the house, too, no matter how all-consuming your job may be. Let them see you doing the dishes, cleaning the counters, and vacuuming the carpet, and they'll want to help out too. If they think that cleaning up is just ""Mom's job,"" then they'll be much less likely to help out when the time comes.


Helping out around the house will not only make your wife happy, but it'll help your children see that you and your wife work as a team and that they should join in.

, Respect is earned, not given, and you should do what you can so that your children respect you as a father. If you're not around a lot, yell at their mother, or are only occasionally in the mood to discipline them, then they won't respect you just because you're their father. You should act in a way that is admirable, honest, and consistent so that your children see that you're a model father and a person worthy of their admiration.


Your children shouldn't worship you and think you're perfect -- they should see that you're only human and want to do well by them.

, Though you may think being a good role model means being slightly distant but always doing the right thing, it actually means being connected enough to give your children kisses and hugs, and to let them know how much they mean to you. Don't let a day go by without saying ""I love you,"" giving your children physical affection, and letting them know how much they mean to you.Your children long for love and affection from you, no matter what age they are.
Praise your children and let them know that your life wouldn't be the same without them.

, Though you may have wanted your children to keep running the family business, attend your alma mater, or be a high school soccer star like you were, you have to accept the fact that your children are their own people with their own needs and desires, and that they may not align with yours. You may think that your path is the only way to happiness, but to be a good father, you have to accept that your children may have a different idea of how to run their lives.


Though you may think that you're doing your best by telling your children what to do or how to live their lives, you're actually hurting their independence by trying to control them.
It takes time to accept your children's desires. If you don't immediately understand why your son/daughter wants to be an artist when you are a doctor, ask for him/her to explain it to you and take the time to listen and understand.
If you try to control your children too much, they'll resent you and will stop opening up.
Let your children make their own decisions by letting them be independent and open-minded. You may want them to play baseball, but sign them up for a variety of activities and let them decide what they like best.

, To be a good father, you have to understand that your children aren't growing up in the same environment that you were raised in -- even if you're raising them in the same time. With globalization, the influence of social media, and the changing politics in today's society, it's likely that your children are less sheltered than you are and are more aware of the problems and changes in today's society.Therefore, be aware that things like body piercing, premarital sex, and world travel are more common today than they were in your time. Accept that your children are a product of the times and that they may want to explore the world more than you did.
You may feel like you know exactly how the world should work, but you should let your children express themselves and share their perspectives with you.

, If you want to be an understanding father, then you have to accept that, like you, your children aren't perfect, and that they're bound to make mistakes. Life is full of mistakes that help your children learn, and you should accept that many lessons are necessary -- whether your son gets into a minor car accident, fails a test because he didn't study, or made a foolish purchase with his savings.


If you don't let your children fail once in a while, then they won't learn anything. Though you may want to shelter and protect them, letting them make their own mistakes will help them make more-informed decisions.
You should still discipline your children appropriately when they make a mistake, but you should also talk about what they did wrong and let them see the error of their ways instead of just yelling at them.

, If you want to be a good father, then you have to be aware of when your children are having a particularly hard time and be attentive to your needs. Maybe your little girl is struggling because you moved to a new town and she doesn't have any friends, or maybe your son is going through his first break-up and is emotionally wiped.


Though you can't completely excuse your children's distant or emotional behavior, you should be aware of what's going through their heads so you can be more understanding and talk to them when they're struggling.
Just saying, ""I know you're having a hard time. Want to talk about it?"" will help your children see how much you care.
Try putting yourself in your child's shoes. If you're frustrated, understanding where your child is coming from will help you understanding his behavior.

, A child's life can be filled with pressures, from siblings to kids at school to teachers to coaches. Help your child understand their desires and assess their capabilities and limitations. Help them set achievable goals. Encourage them to meet their full potential but avoid living vicariously through them by expecting them to achieve what you had achieved or hoped to have achieved.

, Do not assume that once your children turn 21, or they have a college degree, that your work raising them is done. Although it is important to encourage your children to become financially and emotionally independent, it is also important to let them know that you care and are always there for them and that they are valued.

Take inventory of your Christmas light stock.,
Stock up on hangers.,
Wind each light strand around the hanger.,
Store neatly.",How to Store Christmas Lights Around a Coat Hanger," Whether you're working with brand new sets or you're fishing lights from storage, take stock of how many strands you currently own.


Unplug strands that have been plugged in together. If you made one extremely long strand, it will need to be undone, as it will be far too long for storage. Separate the strands so that the end strand has a male and female end.






Untangle each strand if necessary. Put the kids to work and see if they can unravel tangled strands. Note—–test the light strand before spending time trying to untangle the ball of lights. No use untangling lights that don’t work.






Re-evaluate your decoration scheme. Whether you’ve moved or have changed your home décor, you may be in the market for new lighting. If last year’s multi-colored lights aren’t doing it for you this year and you want to go all white, think about whether you want to keep the old strands and/or reuse them in other ways. Donate lights that you no longer want.





;
, You’ll need heavy-duty hangers to hold each light strand, so flimsy wire hangers won’t cut it. Think about how you plan to store your lights too—–hanging them is an option with this method, so you may want to go with a more decorative hanger.


Purchase or find enough hangers to accommodate each light strand. Unless you want to purchase new hangers each year, consider investing in a stronger hanger.






Buy or gather enough hangers to hold each, individual light strand. For the neatest storage system, dedicate one hanger per string.
Consider using wooden or heavy-duty plastic hangers. Wooden hangers may cost a little more, but they'll withstand the test of time and keep light strands in place.







, While there’s no specific technique, there are some tips to ensure ease of winding:

Tape one end of the light strand at the lower right or left hand corner of the hanger. Use duct tape to ensure the strand stays in place when beginning your project.






Wind the strand around the hanger, pulling tightly to avoid slack. The more slack in the strand, the more likely it will be to either fall apart of become tangled.






Duct tape the tail end to the hanger. You can also wrap a rubber band around the bottom if you don’t want to use tape.







, Place the wound-on lights inside a box that has plenty of space for the lights without squashing them. For layering, consider tearing off sides of cardboard boxes and placing on the top of each layer before adding the next layer––this will prevent any entanglement between layers and helps ease any crushing of the lights. Don't have too many layers per box––additional boxes is better than one large one (easier for you to handle too).


Store the light sets in a cool, dry area, preferable in an individual box or storage bin.

Do this after Christmas.,

Create an inventory sheet.,

Add each item to the inventory.,

Be as descriptive as you need to be to make the item leap into your mind when you read it.,

Get your digital camera out.",How to Create an Inventory of Christmas Decorations," It's the best time because all of your decorations are out and as you pack them up to put back in storage, this should be the same time that you create your inventory.
, Use Excel, Word, or some other similar program capable of making up a table that accepts both text and images., Develop a system that works for you, so that you know how to find each item quickly. Try to find a main heading, a subheading and then the descriptive heading. For example:
Tree decorations - baubles -

24 x red baubles;
12 x green baubles;
6 x kitty cat baubles


Tree decorations - glass ornaments -

Santa x 5
Cottage x 4


Tree decorations - fabric ornaments -

Mary Claus and Santa Claus
Reindeer x 5
Patchwork gingerbread houses x 8


Tinsel - metallic -

Gold lengths x 2
Green lengths x 1
Red lengths x 10


Tinsel - bead -

Silver x 2
Blue x 1


Mantelpiece decorations - ceramic village pieces -

Lighted house x 1
Lighted skating pond x 2


Garden decorations -

Glowing reindeer x 1
Polar bear with moving parts and lights x 1



, Also note where it is stored - for example, ""in the boxes under the stairs"", ""in the garden shed"", ""in Mary's old room,"" etc., so that you know where to lay your hands on the items quickly and easily. Make any notes of special arrangements too, such as when items are stored in separate pieces and need reassembling, or when special wrapping must be maintained for storage etc. It can also be a great way to make a note of heirloom items by noting such things as ""came from Grandma May's house,"" circa 1897 etc., Take a photo of each item that you will be placing on the inventory. Slot this photo in next to its description so that you can quickly assess what each item is as you scroll through the document. Not only will this alert you to what you have but it can be a fantastic way of finding themes from colors to animals to angels etc. that you might wish to use on any particular year."

Choose your thread.,

Add the garland after the tree's lights.,

Add ornaments.",How to String Popcorn on a Christmas Tree," While you can pop it using any method you prefer, it’s easier to work with unsalted, unbuttered popcorn, so an air popper usually works best. If you don’t have one, you can also pop your corn in a pan or skillet on your stovetop.To figure out how much popcorn you’ll need for your garland, keep in mind that 1 cup typically covers 3 to 4 feet of thread.
If you pop the corn in pan, you’ll need to add a little oil to the bottom to help the corn cook. To prevent it from becoming soggy, place the corn on a paper towel-lined plate or dish when you remove it from the pan, so some of the oil will be absorbed.
When you’re in a hurry, you can use microwave popcorn or a pre-popped bag. Just make sure that it has no salt or butter.;
, After it’s cooled off, go through the kernels to find the best candidates for the garland. You’ll obviously want to eliminate any burnt pieces, but you may decide to remove broken or misshapen kernels from the batch as well. The best popcorn for garland has a full, almost flower-like shape. Set all of the best pieces of popcorn in a bowl so it’s easier to work when you start to string the garland.







, Freshly popped corn can break easily, so it’s usually too fragile to thread. If you allow it to sit out for a day or two, it becomes less brittle, making it easier to string your garland.








For a more festive look, you may want to color your popcorn after it’s sit for a couple of days. Powdered food coloring works well to give the kernels a bright tint of color. You can go with the traditional Christmas colors, red and green, or custom color the popcorn to match the theme of your tree., You can use any sturdy thread that you like, but some work better than others. Heavy embroidery floss is a good choice because it’s strong and comes in a variety of colors. However, you can also use clear fishing line, which is even stronger and won’t show up if there are any gaps in the garland.








If you don’t have any thread or fishing line on hand, you can even use dental floss to string your popcorn. In fact, using a waxed variety can make the task even easier because the kernels will easily slide along the floss.If you’re using thread for your garland, consider using red, green, or a shade that matches the decorating scheme for the rest of the tree in case it shows in any gaps between the popcorn.

, If you're making a garland longer than 5 feet, it's best to leave the thread attached to the spool so it's easier to work with. However, cutting the thread in lengths of 5 feet or less makes them more manageable, and you can always connect them later by tying the ends together for longer garlands







, Thin needles typically work best when you’re making a popcorn garland. Choose one with a large eye too, so it’s easier thread. Make sure to tie a knot at the end of the thread to ensure the kernels don't fall off when you begin to string them.







, You’ll want to push the needle directly through the center of the kernel and pull it through to the end of the thread. Continue adding popcorn until the garland is full. There shouldn't be any gaps between the pieces of popcorn, so push the kernels all the way down to keep them tightly strung on the thread as you go.








Get creative with your garlands by mixing the popcorn with other items, such as fresh cranberries, dried orange, lemon, or lime slices, and cinnamon sticks. You can create striking patterns by alternating the other items with the popcorn. Fresh cranberries start to go bad after a couple of days, though, so you’ll want to spray the garland with shellac before putting it on the tree.You can also dress up your garland by dotting the popcorn kernels with craft glue and sprinkling colorful glitter across them. Allow the glue to dry fully before placing the popcorn string on your tree., You'll need to leave enough thread at the other end of the string so you can tie another knot to keep the popcorn in place.








If you plan to connect several shorter garlands, make sure that there is enough thread at the end of each so you can tie them together.
If you're making a long garland and left the thread attached to the spool, you'll need to cut it when you finish the string. Then just tie off the end with a knot as you would with a shorter garland to secure it.

, While your popcorn garland might seem like the finishing touch to your Christmas tree, it’s actually easier to hang it when there aren’t ornaments in the way. You should add your lights before the garland, though., The best way to hang popcorn strings on your tree is to softly drape them over the branches rather than firmly stuffing them in gaps. Start at the top and carefully work your way down.For a formal look, make sure to drape your popcorn strings in even, uniform loops.
For a more casual look, allow the popcorn strings to drape unevenly.
If you want your popcorn garland to stand out on your tree, consider doubling up the strings and draping them together over the branches.

, Once the popcorn strings are in place, you can hang your ornaments on the tree. However, you should take care when placing them among the garlands because you don’t want any large, heavy ornaments to rest on the popcorn and possibly break it.

",How to Create Fruit Christmas Tree Displays," Determine the tree size before purchasing the Styrofoam cone at a local craft store. Consider either one large statement or several cute trees, located around the table or your home.;
, While this recipe suggests using certain fruit, you can use your favorite fruits or what is fresh and available. However, one aspect of the tree that you may want to be sure to use is the pineapple. You can go fresh or canned, but you will use the pineapple to create the star that goes on the top of the tree.


Choose a wide variety of colors, but fruit that will be appropriate for being served on a toothpick and mounted on the Styrofoam cone. Avoid fruit that turns brown easily or is mushy.







, Since this is an “edible” project you want to make sure the cone is free from debris and is clean before you begin the project.

, The amount of fruit pieces you will need depends on the size and number of trees you want to create. Cut pieces in a uniform fashion so they fit together on the tree.


Consider using the melon ball scoop for some fruit, especially if you plan to encircle the bottom of the tree with something festive. Scoops of melon balls may look lovely along the bottom or as an accent.







, Stab the first piece of fruit with a toothpick and then insert the toothpick into the Styrofoam cone. You want to make sure the toothpick goes into the Styrofoam all the way so it holds the fruit.


Begin at the bottom of the tree and work your way up to the top, encircling the cone with fruit.






Add the star at the top. Cut a star shape from the pineapple and place the toothpick into the top peak of the cone.

Complete the circle.,
Add embellishments.,
Finish with a hook or piece of yarn.",How to Crochet Christmas Ornaments1," Making a crocheted wreath is one of the easiest types of Christmas ornaments that you can crochet, but you will need a few things to complete this project. You will need:


A ball of green yarn (medium weight).
A size J (size 10) hook.
Embellishments of your choice, such as pompoms, sequins, buttons, ribbon, etc.
A pair of scissors.
White glue or hot glue.;
, To start your wreath, make a single chain of 10 crocheted loops. Then, connect the first loop with the last loop to form a circle. This will be the base of your wreath and you will build on it by crocheting around the outer edges.To connect the first and last loops, insert the crochet hook through the first and last loops, and then loop your yarn over the hook and pull this loop through.

, To begin building your wreath outwards, you will need to crochet around the outer edges of your circle using the hook.Use a double crochet stitch to expand the wreath outwards.


You can make the wreath as wide as you like, but you should only need to stitch one to three times around the circle.

, When you have made the circle as wide as you want it to be, you can connect the ends and close it off. To do this, take your hook with the last loop you created still on it and insert it into a nearby loop. After you pass the hook through this loop, wrap the yarn over the needle and then pull it through.To secure the last loop, crochet one more loop from the free end of the yarn, cut the end of the yarn, and then pull it tight to make a knot. You can sew this end into the edge of your wreath with a darning needle.

, To embellish your wreath, you will can add buttons, sequins, pompoms, ribbon, or any other embellishments that you want to add. Use a white glue or a hot glue gun to secure the embellishments on the wreath.You can use any color of embellishments that you like. Try

, To hang your wreath on a Christmas tree, you will need to add an ornament hook or a piece of yarn. If you are using yarn, then tie together the ends of a 6” to 8” piece of yarn. Then, use your crochet hook to loop this yarn through the top of your wreath and then pull it through itself to secure the yarn. You can use the loop to hang the wreath ornament on your tree."

Secure the coils with a piece of yarn.",How to Crochet Christmas Ornaments2," Before you start your candy cane Christmas ornament, get everything together that you will need to complete the project. You will need:A ball of red yarn and a ball of white yarn (Caron Simply Soft is a good choice).
A size H (size 8) hook.
A pair of scissors.
A darning needle.

, To start your candy cane, you will need to create a chain of 40 stitches. This may seem like it will result in a large candy cane, but your final result will be small enough to hang on a Christmas tree.You will need a coil of red and a coil of white yarn, but you can create these one at a time. Start with the white or red and then do the other coil after you finish the first.

, After you have your 40 stitches, you will need to count back to the fourth stitch from the one that is currently on your hook. Insert your needle through this loop and then wrap your yarn over the hook and pull the yarn through both loops.Then, chain three loops and repeat the double crochet stitch on the next stich.

, Then, move to the next loop, and continue to chain three and double crochet down to the bottom of the chain. As you do this, the stitches will form a coil. You do not have to do anything but continue to double crochet and this coiling effect will happen.After you finish your first coil, pick up your other ball of yarn and create the second coil.

, To create the candy cane stripe effect, you will need to intertwine the coils you have just created. Carefully line up the ends and then swirl one coil around the other. The coils should fit together easily.The coils will form a candy cane shape when you hang them on the tree by the part of the coils that will be the curve of the candy cane. Try shaping the cane into the position that you want it to be in when you hang it on the tree.

, To hold the coils together and create a loop to hang them on your tree at the same time, take a 6” to 8” piece of yarn and tie the ends in a knot. Then, use the hook of your crochet needle to pull the loop through the top of the curved part of your candy cane.Pull the loop through itself to secure it. Then, hang your candy cane ornament on a Christmas tree!

Gather your materials.,
Crochet a triangle.,
Add a stump at the bottom if desired.,
Glue or stitch on embellishments.,
Attach a hook or string.",How to Crochet Christmas Ornaments3," You may already have everything you need to make a Christmas tree ornament, but take a moment to check. You will need:


A ball of green yarn (medium weight).
A size J (size 10) hook.
Embellishments of your choice, such as pompoms, sequins, buttons, ribbon, etc.
A pair of scissors.
White glue or hot glue.

, One of the easiest ways to make a Christmas tree ornament is to crochet a triangle first. There are a few different ways that you can do this, and the method you choose depends on how you you’re your tree to look.For example, you could create a circle and then crochet outwards to make a rounded triangle shape, or you could create a foundation chain and then crochet in rows, decreasing with each row until you have created the shape you want.

, When your triangle is complete, you can stop there and just add some embellishments, or you can crochet a square to use as the tree stump. Use some brown yarn to create your tree stump.To crochet a square, create a foundation chain of four stitches and then crochet across the chain suing a single crochet stitch. Continue crocheting back and forth until the square is the size that you want it to be.
Secure your tree stump to the bottom of the triangle using a darning needle and some brown or green yarn.

, Next, you will need to decorate your tree. You can use any kind of embellishment that you want, such as pompoms, ribbon, sequins, or buttons. Use some white glue or a hot glue gun to attach your embellishments to the crocheted tree.If you are using white glue, then make sure that you let the glue dry overnight. You may also want to place a book or other heavy object over the tree to press the embellishments into the yarn and improve the bond.

, To complete your project, attach an ornament hook or a piece of yarn to the top of your tree. You can loop an ornament hook through the top of the tree or thread some yarn through the top and tie it in a knot.


Hang your crocheted Christmas tree ornament on your Christmas tree, and you are all done!

First calculate the budget that you will spend on your Christmas Tree Decorations.,
Reuse, Reduce, Recycle.,
When you collected all the ornaments or decorations that can be repaired do the following:


If a decoration is slightly cracked, consider painting over it, or putting a light coat of glue on it, then sparkles on top to cover it and the glue will harden it.,
After you fixed all the broken ornaments, put them on the tree and organise them properly (spread them out evenly).,
Seek out deals on decorations before Christmas.,
Make beautiful ornaments by hand too!,
Look around the house for things that can be transformed into some awesome ""Christmas tree decorations"".,
Usually, before Santa comes, the bottom of the tree looks pretty empty, so consider putting a beautiful large cloth at the bottom (usually a dark colour with Christmas images), or wrap up empty boxes neatly to make it look filled.,
Choose a theme.",How to Choose Ornaments for Your Tree when You Are on a Budget," Note that the actual cost of buying the tree should not be included in this budget. If you already bought your tree (or have one from last year), then you can move on.;
, Gather all your previous Christmas tree decorations. You should not just throw them all out. Divide them into three groups, the good ones, the ones that need minor fixing, and the ones that must be thrown out (damaged/broken ones). It is important to reuse the good ones AND the ones that can be repaired.

, (this does not work well on paper ornaments)
If a decoration has a fading colour, repaint it, or put the fainting part faced to the centre of the tree so it does not show. If a large part is fainted, consider covering it with paper mache (glue and newspaper)
If a decoration is missing the string part, cut a piece of string or elastic, tie it in a knot, and hang it on the tree!
If an ornament is missing the part where you attach the string, you can tape the string directly on the ornament, or see if you can take that part off of an ornament you threw out.

, This way it would be easier to recognise what you need on the tree.

, Usually decorations go on sale even 2-3 weeks before Christmas, which would be a good time to snatch 'em up! 1 week before Christmas decorations are more costly because of a greater demand. Saying this, you should not aim for very expensive decorations. Most big ""Dollarama"" stores have aisles on Christmas decorations, even as low as $1. They are not very costly, and they look just as beautiful! Also, consider second hand stores like ""Goodwill"" and ""Value Village"". These stores also might have great decorations that are not as expensive as the ones in the original stores.

, wikiHow has lots of great articles on how to make your own Christmas decorations! Using paper (even from your recycling, some glue, glitters, rhinestones and sparkly paper!

, Consider the following:


Little Christmas theme dolls
Tiny Styrofoam balls
Wood Blocks (you can colour them in)
Pencils (covered in paper to look like candy canes or icicles)

, Make sure you put some sign on the empty boxes so you don't waste your time opening them on Christmas.

, When making the decorations (especially with paper), make sure the colours have some kind of theme, or pattern. Green, Red and Gold are pretty common, but Blue and Silver look very nice too. If you cannot find sparkly paper, check to see if you have any ripped sparkly Christmas gift bags that you do not use anymore. You can make paper ornaments out of this too! It would be good if you have at least 3 ornaments of the same colour. If you choose to make all your ornaments the same colour, consider making different sizes to give more variation.

, Aim for evenness and rounded shape overall.

, Thread through the various pompoms and when you have 2 to 5 or so pompoms on a line, cut and knot the line with a hanging loop. Make sure that there is space between the pompoms – the idea is to suggest the effect of the snowflakes falling, and bunching them up would look less effective.

, Use the end without the hanging loop to wrap around the centre of the snowflake and knot in place.

,, They can even be hung outdoors from real trees to give the effect of falling snow for those living in a climate without snow.

Bible verses are good way to help your children understand Christmas and special messages acknowledging your child are a good way of showing your love and care for them. Alternatively, you could write down a fun activity to be done on that day, such as decorating the Christmas tree, making the Christmas cookies, or writing Christmas messages to friends online.

, Take the first strip labeled December 1, and using the glue stick, glue the ends together to form a ring. Make sure the date is clearly visible on the outside of the ring. Take your second piece labeled December 2 and run it through the ring you have just created and glue the ends together. Keep doing this with the remaining string strips until you've formed an entire chain.

",How to Make a Christmas Stocking out of a Sock," Clearly, the larger the better—so pick Dad's if at all possible, or the ones your teen has stretched beyond all recognition. If all the socks are on the smallish side, make a series of stockings for each child to be hung all in a row, adding to the festive ambiance.


Woolen socks or socks made of natural fibers work best. But in a pinch, any sock that is clean and free of holes will do.
Do not use ankle socks—not unless Santa's only leaving a gift card and a stick of chewing gum.
Plain colors are best. It's hard to make fluorescent pink socks with bright green polka dots seem season-appropriate—for Christmas, anyhow.;
, The best you can do for the socks is to brighten them up and make them look like a festive object. This can be as simple or as complicated as you like, but the following steps offer a few easy ideas.


Use a darning needle and strong thread to stitch trim or decorations onto the sock. Because it's bigger than a regular sewing needle, the darning needle will make your work easier.

, Use a fabric that complements the style of the sock and adds something festive, such as tartan prints, red and green prints, Christmas prints, etc. Trim can be added in any of the following ways:


Simply sew a ribbon around the top of the cuff. Choose a wider ribbon for the best effect.
For a cuff, turn down the sock a little way and blanket stitch around it in traditional Christmas colors such as red and green.
Add a cuff: Cut out enough fabric to form the typical cuff seen on Christmas stockings. Stitch into place. To help it stand upright and stiff, you could insert thin cardboard and fold the cuff fabric down over this prior to stitching to the sock.

, This means quick embroidery, not the elaborate, time-consuming sort. Take care to secure the stitches well at both the start and end of the stitching.


Sketch out very simple designs, such as the recipient's name or a basic outline of a reindeer head or an angel. You can trace around cookie cutters using a fabric marker if you need a quick design to follow.
Then simply stitch around the design you've made using thick embroidery thread, silk ribbon, yarn or pearl cotton. Use thread that contrasts clearly with the sock colors, and—where possible—use green or red. Back stitch is your best option for sewing.
Stitching will be made a lot easier if you insert a cardboard liner into the sock to prevent catching stitches onto the other side of the sock.

, If you don't have the time or ability for embroidery, start gluing. Rummage through your craft odds and ends and find whatever will jazz up the stocking. Some possible design methods include:


Draw Christmas designs or names using fabric markers.
Draw patterns using fabric markers, such as skinny stripes, wide diamonds, small squares, big circles, etc.
Glue on all manner of things, including fabric patches, beads, bells, sequins, lace, ribbons, etc. (Of course, you can sew them on instead.)
Tie bows using ribbon, then glue them in place.
For a pet's stocking, glue on fake mice, biscuit bones, etc.

, Use googly stick-on eyes, a pom-pom for a nose, pipe cleaners as antlers, etc. Give it a name to make your child giggle when you hand over the stocking—something like ""Ollie"", Santa's elf on vacation.

, This can be stitched, stapled or knotted into place. A neat way to knot it onto the stocking is to cut enough ribbon for the loop, thread both ends of the ribbon through the darning needle so that a loop sits one side and the two ends the other side. Insert this needle into the sock at the middle top and pull the two ends through. Knot them into place and the loop will pull up for hanging, the knot catching on the sock.

, Put all kinds of small Christmas toys and candy into your stocking, as is the tradition. An old English custom is to add an orange––citrus is great in the middle of winter (or summer if you live Down Under).

, Screw a hook into a mantel or other suitable area. If you've opted for lots of small stockings (due to the small sock size available), arrange them so they hang evenly spaced along a ribbon or rope that is then attached to the hanging space by either end. Pull taut!

Strap the floral foam brick to the saucer using the floral foam tape, which sticks when wet.,
Press 4 small branches of blue pine (approximately 25cm or 10"" long) horizontally into the base of the foam, parallel with the saucer.,
Place the berried ivy in between the blue pine.,
Wrap around the middle of a cone and twist the wires together, leaving two prongs sticking out of the cone.,
Tie 30cm (12"") lengths of cinnamon into bundles of three with cord, feeding it in between the sticks and around a couple of times to secure the bundle.,
Push the stub wire right through the fruit.,
Cut the rose stems on an angle and split the stem vertically to approximately 20cm (8"").,
Make a double loop with the ribbon, bunching the bottom together between thumb and forefinger.,
Place your Christmas centrepiece and ask the guest of honour to light the candle.
",How to Make a Christmas Centrepiece," You may need to cut your floral foam block into a shape that will fit snugly in the saucer. Leave room for the candle by taping diagonally over the corners and around the bottom of the saucer. Place the candle in the middle of the foam and push it down 4cm (1.5"") into the foam.;
, Remove the last 3cm (1"") of needles either by hand or scissors. Place the next layer of blue pine at 45 degree angle on both the sides and top of the oasis. Be careful not to place anything too close to the top of the candle. You wouldn't want it to catch fire!

, Ensure everything points toward a central point just beneath the candle, allowing all the foliage to radiate outwards from the centrepiece. The larger sprigs should be at the bottom of the arrangement. Check for any gaps. Fill them in if necessary.

, Once three cones have been individually wired, bunch them together by twisting all the prongs to form one. Snip any wires longer than 10cm (4""). Place the bunches of cones at even intervals on the centrepiece.

, Tie with a bow. Wire the cinnamon bundles by feeding one piece of stub wire under the cord on the opposite side of the bow. Twist the wire three times, leaving two prongs. Cut the wire to 8cm (3"") lengths. Place one cinnamon bundle with each group of cones: one above, one below and the third on an angle.

, Pull both ends of wire together and twist together 2 or 3 times, again leaving two prongs to feed into the foam. Ensure half of the apples show the bottom and the rest show the top. Place the apples in groups of three around the three bunches of cones. Repeat until all 9 apples are wired and placed..

, Remove all the thorns and leaves, too. Place in groups of three beside each bunch of pine cones. Cut the roses shorter if they are going into the top of the centrepiece.

, Wrap the wire around the base, leaving some sticking out, and cut off any excess ribbon. Place a bow on two sides of the centrepiece underneath and a third at the base of the candle. Tug the loops apart gently so that it looks more like a bow.

Select the cookie cutters.,
Prepare the cookie cutters.,
Measure a length of string or ribbon that is being used for the garland.,
Tie a knot in one end of the string or ribbon.

,
Beginning at the unknotted end, thread through the first cookie cutter to just before the knot.

,
Next, make a knot about 2 inches (5cm) from the cookie cutter.,
Slide on the next cookie cutter.,
As before, make a new knot about 2 inches (5cm) from the next cookie cutter.,
Continue in this same way until you have exhausted your supply of cookie cutters and beads, or the length or string, or both.,
Hang the Christmas cookie cutter garland.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Christmas Cookie Cutter Garland," You'll need enough cookie cutters to cover the length of the garland you're making, with even spaces between. The size of the cookie cutters should be taken into account when assessing this. As for the shapes, choose cookie cutter designs that fit with Christmas, such as angels, trees, gingerbread people, candies, Santa, reindeer, stars, etc.


Cookie cutters can be purchased from stores that sell kitchen and baking wares, as well as from online stores. Or, you can make your own cookie cutters from scratch.





;
, You'll be threading the cookie cutters onto the garland, which means they need holes poked in them. Choose a spot about a quarter of the way from the top of each cookie cutter (so that most of the design hangs below the garland) and pierce holes in each side of the cutter, at an even alignment. Continue until all cookie cutters have been pierced.


Use strong scissors, a screwdriver, a drill, tin snips, or similar, for making the holes. Wear heavy duty gloves to protect your hands from slippage, or consider using a vise to hold the cutter in place while you pierce. Watch fingers and hands!
In some cases, to ensure balance, you may need more holes. For example, a cookie cutter shaped like a candy cane will require holes to be pierced in both the hook and the stem of the cane for the entire cutter to remain stable on the garland.
Gingerbread cutters, angels and other humanoid shapes are usually best pierced just under the arms.

, Cut to size. Always err on cutting the garland length longer, as you will lose some of the length when tying knots and it is simply easier to make it shorter than to make it longer. However, if you do need to lengthen it, more can be discreetly knotted in later.

,,, (This measurement may vary, depending on how long your garland is going to be.) Thread a medium bead, then a large bead, then a medium bead into position next to the knot. Tie another knot as closely to the last added bead as possible. You will now have a trio of beads stuck between two firmly tied knots forming the design change between cookie cutters.

, If you're using different shapes, mix them up, such as one snowman, one Santa, one angel, one gingerbread man, etc. Space it an even distance from the bead break, with plenty of string or ribbon showing.

, Thread on three new beads and knot off.

, Tie off the end with a knot.

, Place on the Christmas tree, over a window, on the wall, or anywhere else suitable.

Symbolize the passage of Advent with an Advent wreath.,
Decorate a church with a Christmas tree or Chrismon tree.,
Display fresh greenery throughout the church.,
Display a nativity scene in the church.,
Hang banners to decorate a church for Christmas.,
Decorate a church with candles and lights.,
Decorate a church with poinsettias during the Christmas season.",How to Decorate a Church for Christmas," An Advent wreath is an evergreen wreath featuring 4 candles. Often, a fifth candle is placed in the center of the wreath. The Advent wreath is used during the 4 weeks of Advent, just prior to Christmas, as Christians prepare for the coming of the Christ child.


Light 1 candle of the Advent wreath each Sunday. The candle lighting is commonly accompanied by prayers, Bible readings and/or songs. Some Advent wreaths include a fifth candle, which is called the Christ candle and is lit on either Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. Advent wreaths can be made using fresh greenery or artificial greenery.;
, Churches can utilize live or artificial trees to decorate their worship spaces.


Display a traditional Christmas tree. Decorate a live or artificial tree with lights, ornaments, garland and/or tinsel. Decorations can be those made by church members, or they can be simply store-bought ornaments.
Display a Chrismon tree. A Chrismon tree is a live or artificial evergreen tree decorated with Chrismons, which are ornaments that are symbolic of the life of Christ. Chrismons are usually white and gold, and often are made by members of the local church.

, Evergreens, including conifers, holly and ivy, are symbolic of eternal life in some Christian traditions.


Hang fresh evergreen wreaths on the front doors to welcome people to the church. The wreaths not only look festive but wreaths made with conifer branches typically emit an evergreen aroma. Add bows, ornaments or natural materials to add interest to the evergreen wreaths.
Decorate with pine boughs and other evergreen materials on the altar, window ledges, or tables in the church. Fresh magnolia also is an alternative to traditional conifer branches in warmer climates.
Add decorative greenery to the pews. Fresh greens hung from the end of the church pews adds a festive look to a worship space.

, Also called a manger scene or a creche, a nativity scene depicts the birth of Jesus, as described in the Bible. A nativity scene can be 2- or 3-dimensional and usually includes characters from the nativity story like Mary, Joseph, an infant Jesus, shepherds, wise men, angels, camels and barn animals. Some churches display a nativity scene on the altar, while others display the Biblical characters where people can touch them and use them to retell the birth story, such as at the entrance to the church.

, Because wall spaces typically are much bigger in a church than in a house, it can be difficult to find decorations that are large or impactful enough to fill large wall spaces. Christmas banners can be made or purchased in any size to fit the wall spaces of any worship center. Banners come in a variety of colors and include various design elements, from traditional to modern, that share the Christmas story.

, Christians believe that through the birth of Christ, light overcame darkness in the world. Many churches use candles to symbolize Jesus as the light of the world during the Advent and Christmas seasons. Some churches display lit candles during worship services, while others decorate the altar and other areas of the worship spaces with strings of electric lights.

, The plant with red and green foliage is native to Mexico and is widely used in holiday floral displays. The plant's association with Christmas began in the 16th century, when a poor, young girl gathered weeds to place on the church altar as a gift for Jesus at Christmas. The weeds sprouted into poinsettias, and thus began a Christmas tradition.


Utilize poinsettias to decorate the church altar, welcome worshipers at the entrance of the church or build into large tree-shaped displays.

Bake/buy unfrosted cupcakes.,
Create/buy frosting.,
Place one sugar cone on top of the cupcake.,
Pipe the green frosting over the sugar cone.,
Cover with sprinkles or decorations.,
Finished.

",How to Create Christmas Tree Cupcakes," The holidays are busy so don’t beat yourself up if you don’t have time (or energy) to make homemade cupcakes. Store bought cupcakes will be just as fun and your guests will still appreciate the treat.


If you purchase pre-frosted cupcakes, make sure they have white frosting, which will become the snow underneath the tree.;
, You’ll need two colors--white and green. The white frosting will be slathered on top of the cupcake, whereas the green frosting will be piped over the sugar cone.


Spoon green frosting into the piping bag and add a small tip. If you don’t have a piping bag at home, no worries--use a large, re-sealable plastic bag instead. Spoon frosting into the bag and then smooth out air pockets before sealing. Snip a small hole on one corner and twist bag until you’ve created a piping bag.






Frost the top of each cupcake with the white frosting (if you don’t purchase pre-frosted cupcakes).







, Position the cone upside down with the wide-mouthed area secured into the frosting. Be sure you center the cone in the middle of the cupcake.

, Begin at the base of the cone and work you way upward with the frosting. Add small peaks throughout the frosted cone to resemble tree limbs. Make sure you don’t see any evidence of the sugar cone.

, When you decorate these cupcakes, think about how you approach decorating a Christmas tree and place decorations/sprinkles in strategic areas.

Your parents or the parents of a child you're staying with will probably give you a certain job.,
If you are going to have to have a job to do on Christmas Eve, try to find out as far beforehand as possible.,
If you do have time to prepare, this is what you should do, depending on your job:

Job 1: No preparation necessary






Job 2: Get the kids to bed at least a few times beforehand.,
Get to know the kids you will be with.,
Make sure you know your jobs hazards and the good sides.","How to Be a ""Santa's Helper"" on Christmas Eve1"," Here's a short description of the most common ones.

Job 1-The Santa Jr. The job is usually to actually arrange the gifts and presents.



 


Job 2-The Sandman/woman. The job is to get the kids to sleep A.S.A.P.






Job 3-The Night guard Elf. The job is simple, keep watch of kids room, and make sure they don't come out and look, even though the kids are most likely(and should be) asleep. This is often paired with Job 2.






Job 4- Stocking Stuffer. The job is to fill the stockings. Often this is paired with Job 1.






Job 5-The Gabber. The job is to keep the kids in bed and keep them from finding out you're helping Santa this year. This is often paired with Jobs 2 and 3.





;
, This will give you time to prepare.

, This way when Christmas Eve comes you know their bedtime routines and what to expect, and it won't seem as strange to them if it's you putting them to bed instead of their mom or dad.






Job 3: No preparation necessary.






Job 4: No preparation necessary.






Job 5: Think up any questions the kids might ask and how you will answer them. If one of the kids says to you ""If all the reindeer get sick on Christmas Eve, how does Santa get anywhere?"" how will you answer it?







, Are they light or deep sleepers? Do they go to bed quick or make excuses to stay up?

, See the Tips and Warnings for more info

"
"
Know what time to perform your job.,
Perform your job.","How to Be a ""Santa's Helper"" on Christmas Eve2"," If you're doing Job 2, what time do the kids need to be in bed by? How long do their routines take? Though jobs 1 and 4 should only be completed once the children are in bed, what time can you expect the children to be asleep by? How soon after that do you start?

,

Job 1: Get all the presents from where Santa hid them and arrange them around the tree. Don't just clump them all in one corner, actually spread them out under the tree. If there are different types of wrapping paper, mix it up. The gifts in snowman paper don't all have to be together, and it looks better with a mix.






Job 2: Get the kids through their evening routine. Every family has a different one, but typically you'll need to get them a bath, have them brush their teeth and hair, use the bathroom, and tuck them into bed. You may want to or have to read them a story. Twas the Night Before Christmas is the classic Christmas Eve story, but it can be any story. See this article for advice.






Job 3: You will probably want to be either in the childrens' room or just outside. You can set up a chair before they're asleep so you don't have to stand. You can read by flashlight or play a handheld game with no sound, or do any quiet time passer. If the kids try to sneak out of the room or start asking questions, move to Job 5 or call the person in charge of it.






Job 4: Gather all the stocking stuffers for the first stocking. Put something small and round, square, or soft in the toe. This could be balled up socks or scarves or doll clothes. Adjust it to fill the toe out. Add another similar shaped item to the heel of the stocking and a small handful of sweets or small toys. Put anything longer or rectangular, such as a book, in next, coming up the leg, and arrange the other items in around it. It looks nice to have something sticking out of the top, such as a candy cane or stuffed animal. Once you are done with the first stocking gather the supplies for the next.






Job 5: This job sometimes carries over to Christmas morning, too. If the children ask questions about Santa or try to leave their room on Christmas Eve, have an answer. If the kids wake up and want to peek, tell them that Santa hasn't come yet, or that he's still downstairs but will take away all their presents if they try to peek.

Take advantage of you being on the road.,
Think ahead.,
Remember!",How to Christmas Shop While on the Road," If you're travelling, be it on holiday or for work, or you're just nomadic, take advantage of this. You could find something unusual that isn't available in the location the person/people you're shopping for can get. If you're going somewhere iconic or with an interesting history/culture, get something special, made in the town/city/country that you're in. Don't just buy an average 'quick-fix' present or a souvenir made in China- while you're wandering around, see if you can luck out at the local markets or shops. Is your friend or really a food lover? Find a local yummy that you can only get there. Little sample jars of preserves/jams/marmalades make a cute, interesting and unique present.;
, When you're travelling, it can be hard remembering to find presents. Let alone remembering you might need to post them in time to reach your loved ones. So think ahead- make a list of the people you're intending to give gifts to. Jot down a couple of ideas or maybe just things they always like (i.e. Joyce loves crafty things and jam, Henry loves sci-fi stuff and little Jess adores animals, while John's been looking for some new tunes). Just like most people prefer picture postcards while you're away to a flood of photos when you're back, your loved ones will probably appreciate that little bit of thought more than an average, get-it-anywhere present. Knowing the type of things you want to keep an eye out for means you can see if your next location has some awesome markets you'll be there for, or is renowned for its food/wine/chocolate/teddy bears/fossils.

, You might need to post your pressies to have them arrive in time. Or, you may need (or choose) to carry them back with you. If this is the case, and you'll be flying, remember to make sure you're not buying anything that's prohibited on the planes. You also need to ensure you're not buying anything that's prohibited through customs, if you're on the road overseas. Otherwise, don't leave shopping until the last minute- gander around, but remember your postal due dates (check average postal times- the local PO will be able to help). Don't forget- if you're posting, pack well! There's nothing more disappointing than sending an awesome treat to have it pulverized in the mail and unrecognisable on arrival.

Add the base trim.,
Either sew or glue the white trim around the base of the hat.

,
Finish up by sewing or gluing on the pompom, tassel, rolled up yarn ball or whatever else you've improvised, to the top of the Santa hat.,
Try it on.",How to Make a Santa Hat1," These are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"".;
, Use a strong piece of paper to avoid tearing. Draw a triangle on the paper. The dimensions are best as follows:


Child Santa hat: Draw a height and base width of 13""/ 33 centimeter (13.0 in)
Adult Santa hat: Draw a height and base width of 14""/ 35 centimeter (13.8 in)
Super large head: It's advised that you measure first!

, Do this by attaching a pencil to a piece of string and taping the string to the top point of the triangle. The pencil should just touch the center of the base of the triangle. Simply draw across the circle with taut string and paper, and you'll create an arc.

,,, Use pins if this helps you to keep the template in place. Keep one edge of the template along the folded edge of the felt.


You can either double over the felt and cut both pieces at once, or cut two distinct pieces from two different pieces of felt. Do whatever is easiest.

,, These are the straight edges, not the curved edge that forms the base. If you don't want to sew the two pieces together, then glue them in place using a suitable glue for felt.


If you cut a folded sheet, you'll only be sewing or gluing one side.
If you cut two separate sheets, you'll have to sew or glue two sides.
If gluing, leave to dry before proceeding.

, The hat will appear like a cone.

, You have several choices here, depending on your preference for the final look:


Cut a band of white felt measuring about 2""(5cm) in width of enough length to wrap around the hat base.
Cut a band of white fluffy fabric to the same measurements. Be aware that cutting fluffy fabric can be a little messy but the end result is really good.

,, If gluing, leave to dry before use.

, It's now ready to wear.

Gather the materials needed to complete the project.,
Fold the material.,
Flip the material over.,
Cut the material.,
Take the string and measure where you want the hat to sit on your head.,
Cut some more.,
Stitch the seams.,
Turn the hat to the other side and fold the white over the red so that it's showing.,
Add finishing touches.",How to Make a Santa Hat2," See the ""Things You'll Need"" below.


The color doesn't have to be red and white. You can choose other colors, such as green or royal blue. Make it festive!

, With the square of felt lying flat, first fold it into a cone shape. Bring the upper left corner over to the right lower corner. Pin the edges in place.

, The pinned edges are now on your left rather than pointing right. Fold these pinned edges to the right side. Fold this into a complete cylinder shape.

, Start cutting where the corner meets the folded red felt. This should be about 60 percent below the top point of the cone.


You will be cutting four layers in total, right corner to left, straight across.

, Take the red felt and measure that length across the bottom, starting in the lower left corner, and mark it.

, Hold the back of the white fur against the red felt material and trace the shape of the red material onto the white material. Cut approximately six inches (15cm) high, starting an inch below the traced line.

, Matching the two materials, stitch a seam, attaching the white fur to the red material.

, Pin in place inside and sew a seam. Make sure that all of the edges are aligned and stitch them together, all the way from the top of the hat to the base at the bottom.

, Use the shears to snip off extra material. Turn the hat inside-out.


Get creative! Customize the hat to a person's liking by adding their name. A fun idea is to let a child decorate it with craft supplies such as non-toxic paint and glitter glue.
Make sure the hat is thoroughly dried before wearing it; this may take a while.

, There is a wide variety of stationery available with pre-printed themes on the paper that you can use to print your newsletter onto. Alternatively, you can make a colorful Christmas theme on your computer program that will print directly onto plain paper.

, Using a program such as Open Office, Microsoft Word, Pages or Wordpad, start preparing your newsletter. If your program already has pre-set newsletter layouts, you can use these for a very professional result. Choose a pleasing and elegant font, in a fairly large typeset to make it easy for the young and the very old to read beside the firelight.

, Most importantly, don't fill it with tales of how many amazing achievements you and your family have had -- that just sounds like bragging! Similarly, don't be morose and fill it with tales of woe about all your hardships that you've confronted all year. This is Christmas time, when love, warmth and the overcoming of adversity are considered key elements of the season. Remember that you are just updating people, not giving a sermon!

, You might also wish them a safe, prosperous and happy New Year.

However, that doesn't mean that you can't celebrate His birthday on December 25th. Just keep this in mind in case anyone tries to put you down for celebrating a religious Christmas.;
, Buy a wreath with only branches, and not decorations in it. Place inside the 4 corners of the wreath, 4 candles. 3 of them should be purple, and one of them pink. Light the first candle on the first Sunday of Advent; two candles on the second Sunday of Advent; etc. Light the pink candle on the third Sunday during Advent. This is all in anticipation of the Birth of the Messiah.,, You could read it once on Christmas Eve, by yourself or aloud to your family, once a week in December, or every day in December! Do whatever makes it feel right for you.

, Try to go to church on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. If you have the time and ability, go both days! However, don't limit yourself to those days. Everyone's extra busy in December but try to make room at least twice more than usual to go to church. If you have children or are a child or teen yourself, also see if your church is doing a Christmas pageant!

, Set it up wherever you like. On the mantel is popular, because it's a very prominent place. You can set it up all at once, or you can add everyone but baby Jesus, and only add him on Christmas Eve. Some people even put baby Jesus on the other side of the room and move him closer to the Nativity every evening, like a countdown, until he's in the manger on Christmas Eve., Are you buying twelve presents for each of your children, plus $100 gifts for each aunt and uncle? Do you think this is showing the Christian's Christmas spirit? If not, try to tone it down. Let relatives know you won't be giving expensive gifts, or even any gifts if you chose, this year. Or you could suggest a drawing and everyone only buys one other person one present. For your children, perhaps include something religious in their gifts. Send a letter to Santa, suggesting that he leave a bible in each child's stockings.

, If you have older children or teens and haven't celebrated a very Christian Christmas before they aren't going to understand the change. Tell them and any other family members it may concern that you want to celebrate Christmas for Jesus. Explain why it's important to you in a calm fashion.,, Not just Christmas ""songs"" such as ""Frosty the Snowman,"" and/or ""Jingle Bells,"" but, actual carols, such as ""Silent Night,"" ""Joy to the World,"" ""What Child is This?"" etc.

, Remember, Christ always taught that we are to love our neighbours & help them whenever we can.

Focus on Christmas Eve.,
Spend the holiday with your beloved.,
Decorate.,
Eat KFC.,
Check out the light displays.,
Look forward to New Years!",How to Celebrate a Japanese Christmas," Christmas Eve is the real day of celebration in Japan, not Christmas itself, so put an emphasis on December 24th.;
, In Japan, Christmas is seen as a romantic holiday more than anything. Men take their girlfriends out for fancy dinners on Christmas Eve, and couples buy each other gifts. (Children, on the other hand, typically don't.) If you have a lover, Christmas is a great time to make them feel special.


Sometimes Christmas is a time for people to confess to one another. Inviting someone out on Christmas has strong romantic implications.
On that note, avoid talking about Christmas with single women. They often feel a bit sour around that time of year, just as singles in the West might feel on Valentine's Day.

, Japanese families often have a Christmas tree, and hanging lights outside of houses is also becoming popular.

, It might sound bizarre to foreign ears, but KFC is a big part of Christmas in Japan - so much so that you'd need to make reservations months in advance to get in! The explanation for this is simple enough, though. KFC company leaders found that Westerners wanted turkey on Christmas, but struggled to find any. Hence, they advertised KFC as an alternative, even offering champagne to go along with meals, and were immensely successful.


Popular Japanese favorite foods at KFC for Christmas are shortcake and fried chicken.
KFC lets you reserve fried chicken as early as the end of October!
Buy a strawberry shortcake, plum cake, and buttercream cakes as well. Popular bakeries and hotels start taking reservations in October!

, If you're in Japan for the holiday season, you'll find most cities decked out with elaborate light displays. Stores and restaurants go all out decorating. A walk around will probably increase your Christmas spirit tenfold!

, New Years in Japan is more similar to Western Christmas. Families spend time together, and the dinner is a big deal. If you're a Westerner longing for the Christmas you're used to, the New Year might help.

Prepare ahead of time.,
Kick up the makeup a notch.,
Party hair.,
Just because it’s cold outside, doesn’t mean that you can’t wear pretty heels.,
Dresses.",How to Achieve Your Perfect Seasonal Party Look," If you are intending to try something new for the Christmas or New Year party, a trial ""night in"" will allow you to assess chosen colours and ensure that they work with your skin tone. This is great to test your hairstyle to see if it will last the night, and will give you some practice with your overall look. Why not invite a friend over for a ‘party dress rehearsal’? You can have great fun together and avoid last minute panic on your big night out.;
, At this time of year, you can really have fun with your makeup by adding glitter and shimmer to your look. Brights are strong this year, and really take your look to the top. Include red hues on the eyes for an ultra-festive look! Try smoky eyes and nude, glossy lips or go for festive gold or seasonal silver. The options are limited only by your imagination. If you feel uncomfortable outside your usual look, why not add a dot of shimmer and it blend into the middle of your upper eyelids. This highlight will really open up your eyes. Likewise, a dab of shimmer in the centre of your bottom lip will emphasise your pout. Have fun with your makeup by trying something new, but don’t go too far and end up looking like a drag queen (unless that is the look you’re going for).

, Your hair can really add to your image so make the most of it with plaits, quiffs or a fabulous up-do. Ask a hair stylist for ideas when you go for your next cut or colour and try something new. Pick up some of the pretty accessories that brighten your hairstyle. Do not try a last minute home dye, it may result in disaster. If you are toying with the idea of a colour change always think it through and try it ahead of time or go to a professional colourist.

, Just be sure that you have lifts organised both to and from the venue and do not forget to break in your new shoes well before your night out. This season’s trends include buckled and laced shoes, kitten heels and wedges. A favoured look for party shoes plays on the recent obsession with velvet. If you can find a pair of velvet heels, they will really add a touch of modern glamour to your outfit. Embellished shoes always look pretty for Christmas and New Year parties too.-- Think gemstones, mirrors, crystals, and even feathers and bows.

, Gold and red dresses work really well over the Christmas season, but if these colours aren’t for you, try anything with some sequin detail, or dress up your look with gorgeous jewellery or an artificial fur wrap.

Assess the reasons for cheating.,
Fall on your sword.,
Apologize.,
Apologize often.,
Answer questions honesty.,
Be an open book.,
If it hasn't happened already, break off contact with this other person on the telephone, in front of your spouse.,
Recognize that you might be experiencing a sense of deep loss when ending your affair.,
Allow time for recovery.,
Provide support and assurance.,
Prepare to be insulted or attacked - often.,
Take temperature readings.,
Let your spouse call most of the shots for the time being.,
Remember that you must deal with the consequences of this decision forever.",How to Mend a Marriage After an Affair1," You must internally examine your motivations, your reasoning, and your rationales. These things don't happen in a vacuum. What caused you to stray? Were you lonely in your marriage? Was it laziness in your marriage - were one or both of you becoming complacent and bored? Were you flattered by the attention of the person you cheated with? Why would you risk everything for an affair with that person? Honestly appraising your own actions will help you avoid these triggers in the future.

, Once it's out in the open, do not defend yourself. Take full responsibility and don't try to deflect any of this back onto your spouse. Saying things like, ""If you had just tried harder to understand me,"" or other stuff like that will not help you now. The time to examine the roots of your infidelity and explore it with your spouse is later. But in the first moments of discovery, the best thing for you to do if you truly want your marriage to survive is simply accept all blame.

, Sounds pretty simple, but do remember that just mumbling ""Sorry"" is not a good apology. Your spouse is going to be shocked beyond belief, hurt, angry and frightened. Make a sincere, heartfelt, and serious apology, right away. Ask for forgiveness, and vow never to repeat the behavior. Understand that your apology probably won't comfort your partner, but the absence of a sincere apology will do damage.

, No, this is not an erroneous repeat. When you confess an action like this, your spouse is going to need a lot of time to process the truth of your betrayal. That's right - let's call it what it is. You had a lot of chances to make different decisions, but the one you made to become emotionally or sexually involved with someone else is the one you are dealing with now. Your spouse, for the first several days, weeks, or even months, is going to need to hear your apology many times, and each time needs to be as sincere and heartfelt as the first. If you truly want to repair your marriage, you will need to accept your spouse's need to hear you express your sorrow and regret many times, and in many ways.


Saying, ""I've said I'm sorry a million times - what does s/he want? Blood?"" will not mend your marriage. But saying, ""I would give anything not to have been so stupid, and seeing how much pain I've caused, I am so very sorry and I know it will take time for you to believe me that it will never happen again"" will help. Even if you're saying it for the millionth time.

, Your spouse will have a lot of questions to ask you. Be willing to answer all of them candidly, with the exception of the details of your sexual behavior. Describing these details to your spouse can imprint painful images in their mind, that are seldom useful.

, Don't hesitate to show phone records, texts, emails, Facebook chats, etc. DO NOT erase them ASAP to ""save"" your spouse from hurt feelings. This will only increase the fears that you are ""hiding something.""

, Make it clear to this person that your spouse is present, but you are, in no way, feeling ""pressured"" to terminate contact with them. This is your own choice. Assert your dedication to healing your marriage. Be clear that you will not have contact again, or if this is impossible (if they are a work colleague or relative), spell out the boundaries you will put around this contact.

, This is not a ""negative sign"" about your feelings toward your spouse. If the affair was ongoing, you may have strong feelings toward this person, even a sense of loyalty to them, or even feelings of betraying them (!) by ending it. This is not unusual, and it is part of the process of mending things in your marriage. Your feelings are your feelings. Recognize them, and move on.


If your feelings for your affair partner are strong, and your spouse's negative feeling are equally strong, you may be tempted to seek comfort by ""just talking"" to your affair partner about what you are going through. This will not mend your marriage. Talk to a counselor instead, to talk out your feelings.

, If your spouse is not inclined to forgive you immediately, you will need to accept that. Professionals compare an affair to PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). Your partner may be experiencing intrusive thoughts and images, high anxiety, panicky feelings, confusion, etc. Your spouse is going to need time to process the information, and get through all of the emotions and pain you've caused. It takes time - you wouldn't expect someone with a broken leg to get over it and go water-skiing with you the following weekend. Just the same way, your partner is going to need time and space and support in order to come through this ordeal whole.

, If you were a rather absent spouse before, you will need to change your behavior. Being present in the relationship will be key to restoring your marriage to health.

, S/he will take a lot of shots at you. You will need to allow your partner to take those shots and not fire back, at least not in the first couple of volleys. However, don't allow this to continue for more than a couple or three remarks per episode, or to escalate. Do understand the anger and try to defuse it with nonviolent communication. If that doesn't work, say ""I want to work things out. I don't want to fight. Your words are hurting my feelings,"" and walk away for the time being. Your spouse may think s/he feels better after having attacked you, but verbal abuse is not healthy to either of you. You don't want to reinforce the idea that you will forever be the ""bad guy"" if you want to marriage to heal. Just be patient, and don't be surprised when those insulting remarks surface. Turn the tides in a positive direction, if you can, by trying to hear the hurt beneath the words, or don't respond.

, Instead of making a big deal of having constant ""sensitive chats,"" just reaching over at the breakfast table, putting your hand over his or hers and saying, ""How are we doing?"" and motioning at both of you can let your spouse know that you are interested and concerned with whatever feelings are being processed today. If the response is, ""Not that good today,"" just pat the hand or try to put a little kiss on the cheek with an understanding nod and say, ""Okay. Let me know what you need and I'll do my best."" If the response is, ""Good today,"" then smile broadly and give your spouse a little kiss on the lips. Say, ""Yay!"" and suggest a date, like a walk, a trip to the beach, a picnic. You know - romantic stuff that you used to do when you were first courting. That's what you need to do again, because just as you did in the beginning, you need to win the object of your love again.

, Giving him or her a lot of leeway is important right now. Don't press for sex. Don't insist on a football party for Super Bowl Sunday. Don't bug him or her if s/he just wants to sit in the yard and meditate, even if you're bored to death. Go with the flow for the immediate future.

, Trust is given easily - we fall in love and give our hearts, and we don't question whether or not the person we love is worthy of our trust. We simply trust that person with all our heart. But once this trust is broken, rebuilding it will take time, and is likely to have many set-backs. Think of trust as a beautiful, delicate, vase made of crystal clear blown glass. It is a marvel that something so delicate and lovely holds water, can be the vessel for the stuff of life itself, and that it can last forever if lovingly cared for. It can be broken, however, if you are careless, and though you may be able to glue it back together, you will always see the cracks. It may be able to stand on its own again, hold water, and be all it once was to both of you, but there will always be visible reminders of the break. These cracks can serve you if you let them. They can remind you why it is best to remain faithful and keep your vows. However, you may want to try not to rebuild the same fragile relationship. You can never go back to this fragile, fully trusting state. Accept this. Now is the time to rebuild a container that may not be like the original, but can be stronger, more resilient, if you do the hard work to heal.

Resist the temptation to leave.,
Evaluate brutally.,
Process the anger, grief, fear, distrust, and shame.,
Choose to love again.",How to Mend a Marriage After an Affair2," Once you know you've been cheated on, you want to flee. If your spouse is truly sorry, and if you want, in any way, to repair the relationship, you need to try to work it through together.;
, It won't be useful to simply blame your spouse and hate the person s/he cheated with. If there were problems or signals before the infidelity, they will probably come sharply into focus now. If your marriage is to truly mend, you will need to examine whether or not your behaviors contributed to the loneliness in your marriage. This is not to say that you are responsible for your partner's decision. It is only to say that what is most useful now will be an honest and unsparing evaluation of your entire marriage - including your own behavior. There are a lot of things to consider in the wake of this awful revelation:


Did you behave in ways that could be considered ""unlovable""? Not occasional grumpiness. We all do that. But real, unkind, uncaring, unlovable behavior could cause, even someone who loves us, to go look elsewhere for kindness, compassion, and a tender touch. If you're cold and withhold yourself from your mate, realize that your spouse got into this relationship for your companionship. If you withhold kindness, tenderness, or sex from your mate, s/he may seek it elsewhere, or end the relationship. It's not reasonable to believe your spouse would take a vow of celibacy indefinitely. Being kind, tender, and/or sexy with your mate can make a real difference in your relationship.

Trust your judgment. This is very hard to do after you've discovered your spouse has been involved with someone else. When you find your spouse has been unfaithful, it makes you feel embarrassed, foolish, ashamed, and afraid. It undermines your confidence. It rattles your ability to make even the smallest decisions - where to eat, what to wear. You second-guess every little thing. It's a terrible time for most people in your situation. You wonder if your whole relationship has been a lie. The good news is, it probably hasn't been. Think about your relationship and the person you believe your spouse really is. If you believe in him or her, rely on your judgment; believe in yourself and your own ability to make a good decision. Recognize now that you will be unlikely to trust him/her at this point. They have just proven themselves through this action not to be worthy of trust. But in time, this trust may, again, be earned.



, If necessary, get a therapist to help you through it. Understand that you can't fix ""normal"" - the normal response to learning of a spouse's affair is all of the aforementioned emotions. It takes time to sift through and make sense of all of it. You'll need to talk it out. You'll need a partner willing to allow you that space and time.

, If you can forgive your spouse, you will also need to see effort to demonstrate that s/he is really trying to show you that you are loved, that s/he is remorseful, and that they sincerely want to rebuild a trusting relationship with you again. While it is natural to feel that you can't fully trust him or her, you don't need to feel stupid for loving your spouse - allow yourself to love your partner, even though you still feel hurt.

"
"
This is a private matter.,
Take your time.,
Act normal, even if you don't feel normal.,
Find reasons to stay.,
Rejoice.",How to Mend a Marriage After an Affair3," Keep it private. While it is tempting to try to get support among your friends and family for ""your side of the story,"" don't. The last thing you want is for well-meaning friends and family to ""take your side,"" while alienating or demonizing your spouse. If you must, choose one friend who you know will be supportive to both of you, and talk discreetly about your feelings. Better yet, talk to a professional, who can provide you with sound advise.

, There is no magic bullet. There will not be a magic moment when suddenly all is forgiven, all tears are dried, all wounds are healed, all anger is gone. You're both going to hurt for a long time. It can take years (2 - 5 years is the general opinion) to really feel like you've made the right decision, and that your marriage can truly recover. And after you have given it some time (this will vary, depending on the two of you)...

, Oh horrors! Does this suggest you should pretend to be okay, even if you aren't? Actually, yes, to a certain extent. Does this mean you should never pout, sulk, act petulant, snap at your spouse, make snarky, snotty remarks - even if you're still feeling hurt, angry, etc.? Does this mean you're not entitled to an authentic response to your pain? No. You're entitled to your pain. But that response will not serve the restoration of your marriage. Does this mean that you should act like you want to be there, even if you want to run like the wind? Absolutely. You may feel like leaving every single day - heaven knows it may sometimes feel easier than going through all of this. But just put one foot in front of the other. Be polite. Act warmly. Be kind. When you want to make a snotty remark, instead, reach over to that person you were just about to snap at, and give him or her a little back rub without saying anything at all. When you feel lost or embarrassed, reach out and pat his or her hand. Doing things like this helps to rewire your responses, and redirect bad thoughts to doing good things. If you just act like everything is normal, one day you will realize that everything really is normal. It's a quiet realization - it won't come with fireworks.

, There are a million reasons to leave. After infidelity, life gets real hard for a long time. And there's really no obligation on the part of the injured party to try for reconciliation, so it can be doubly difficult to find reasons to stay. Still, whatever your choice is, whether it is because you have children, or because you choose to believe that your spouse had a regrettable incident, and is otherwise worthy of your love and devotion, once you have found the reasons to stay, cling to them, and remind yourself what they are any time you find yourself wanting to bail out. Every marriage has troubles, and goes through trials. This one is yours right now.





Let it go. The injured party will want to hang onto this longer than the one who cheated. The anger and the reactions that ensue are understandable, but verbal abuse is still unacceptable, and will do nothing to heal the marriage. After a certain amount of time, you must let it go, or else the person who had the affair will simply resent your behavior, and become sullen and hardened to this form of punishment. If you continue to berate him, recognize this as contempt, a behavior only seen in troubled marriages. It is now you who is in the wrong. Seek therapy from a skilled marriage counselor or help from clergy, to help you leave this in the past, or else all of your efforts will fail. Nobody will volunteer to be flogged daily forever, even after s/he accepts all blame for doing wrong. If you attempt to turn the punishment phase into a life sentence, your marriage is doomed.



, If you wake up one day and realize that you have accepted the incident, forgiven (or been forgiven for) what happened, and are glad you decided to stay with your partner, you've survived infidelity, and your marriage is intact, vital, and healthy once more.

Assess the need to discuss weight.,
Wait for a good moment to bring it up.,
Tell your partner that you are concerned about them.,
Make it clear that you are still attracted to your partner.,
Make love and health the centerpieces of the conversation.,
Leave criticism out of the conversation.,
Keep your opinion in perspective.",How to Talk to Your Partner About Their Weight1," If your partner remains within a healthy weight bracket and only loses or puts on a couple of pounds, there is no need to bring up the issue. Also, some medications and/or hormonal changes (e.g. pregnancy or midlife hormonal changes in men and women) can result in weight change that your partner has little control over. If your partner is gaining or losing an unhealthy amount of weight for a reason that is within their control, it might warrant a discussion about their health and happiness.


If your partner is within normal weight range, encourage healthy eating and fitness, but don’t push them to lose or gain more weight. Instead, aim for maintenance of good habits as a lifestyle approach to health.
You might also consider if your partner's weight has affected their ability to participate in certain activities, such as playing with your kids, going out on dates, or keeping up with simple household tasks.
Consider how quickly your partner's weight has changed as well. If your partner has suddenly gained or lost a noticeable amount of weight, then you may want to bring this up. If your partner gained or lost weight over a period of years, then it might not be a cause for concern if they are healthy otherwise.;
, The very best moment to begin talking about weight loss or weight gain is when your partner complains or mentions being unhappy about their weight. They might comment that they are having trouble putting on an old pair of pants or are unhappy with how they look standing in front of the mirror. This is a clear indication that they have acknowledged the weight change, and they are unhappy with it.Keep in mind that most people who are over or underweight are very aware of this fact. They do not necessarily need to be told that they have a weight problem, but might need a supportive dialogue to help them stay motivated to stay healthy.
Instead of saying something like “Your pants are tighter because you’ve gained some weight,” you should keep the conversation focused around their health and happiness by saying something like “It doesn’t matter which pants fit you, what matters is that you are happy with yourself. Do you feel like you need to change your weight, or are you content?”

, If your partner’s weight appears to be unhealthy to you, you might decide it needs to be discussed. Once you bring up the discussion, you need to make it clear to your partner that you are concerned about their health and happiness. Mention the things that the two of you enjoy, and how those things would be affected if your partner’s health was to take a hit.


For example, you might say “I want to see you stay healthy. I know that you love our hiking trips during the summer, and we both need to stay healthy enough to continue those trips.”

, Most any person would be hurt if they believed their partner was no longer attracted to them. When you discuss your partner’s weight, you need to be certain to reassure them that you are attracted to them. Knowing that you still love them and find them attractive will help your partner stay confident and give them the strength to make healthy changes.


Make a point to say things like “I am only bringing this up because I love you, and want you to stay healthy. It doesn’t change how I feel about you, or how attracted I am to you.”

, Telling your partner that they are unattractive or lazy will only drive a wedge between the two of you, and hurt them emotionally. This kind of language has no place in a loving conversation. Instead, you should focus on how much you care for your partner and want them to remain healthy.Do not use health as a way to guilt your partner. Saying things like “If you really loved me, you’d take care of yourself,” is damaging to the relationship, and simply untrue.
Use “I” statements to keep blame off of your partner. Say something like “I want you to be happy and healthy well into our old age, and I think that you want the same thing. What can I do to help?”

, Criticizing a person for their weight will leave them emotionally hurt, and damage your relationship. This kind of criticism also makes it harder for the person to confide in you, and can lead to secret binge eating or purging. More often than not, the criticism becomes yet another roadblock to losing or gaining a healthy amount weight instead of motivation.Saying something like “You keep gaining weight because you won’t stop eating pop tarts,” will only make your partner uncomfortable with you knowing their food choices. Instead, you could say something more constructive like “If you’d like, we can each make a healthy snack in the morning, and take it with us in case we get hungry.”

, Your partner is likely to be aware that their clothes don't fit as they used to but may not treat the issue as seriously as you do. It could be a wake-up call for your partner that you do see this as a major health issue. Be careful not to shame or embarrass your partner when bringing up your concerns.For example, if your partner mentions that they can’t wear their favorite pair of jeans anymore you could say something like “If you’d like, we can start going for walks and see if we can both fit back into our old clothes.”

Consider obstacles at home.,
Examine the household schedule.,
Cook healthy foods together.,
Invite your partner to exercise.,
Encourage a home-based lunch initiative.,
Celebrate victories.",How to Talk to Your Partner About Their Weight2," Part of being supportive is acknowledging ways that you may have contributed to the weight change. If you're encouraging your partner to be less active, this can be contributing to their weight change, too. Buying a lot of junk food or being slothful can sabotage your partner’s weight, even if your weight isn’t noticeably affected.Remove all obstacles at home like junk food. This helps remove the temptation to eat excessive amounts of unhealthy foods.

, Are each of you making time to sit-down and eat home-cooked family dinners? Are each of you exercising every single day? Is health a priority for your entire family or is everyone running around too busy to make time for their own health? Answer these questions, and rearrange the schedule so that healthy meals and exercise become a priority.

, Make it your priority to get healthy too. If you already eat a clean, lean diet and exercise at least five days a week, share your habits more obviously with your partner by engaging them in the cooking, shopping, or other elements that will help bring about a better understanding healthier eating.Learn about portion sizes and what is a healthy, normal amount and what is outrageous. In the USA, MyPlate is a great place to start and similar initiatives are available through many other government health departments around the world.
Instead of having three big meals, consider preparing six or seven smaller meals to keep blood sugar levels even and cravings at bay. This doesn't work for everyone but if it helps your family, then it's a great way to stretch out healthy eating during the day. If diabetes or other health problems are an issue, talk to your doctor before changing your diet drastically.

, Exercise outside or at the gym by walking, jogging, or taking up another sport. You might also consider team sports leagues in your area if you and your partner prefer a more social exercise routine. Introduce your favorite fitness routine to your partner––they may love it as much as you.


If you have a mobile electronic device, download a fitness app and a food diary. These can be easy and fun ways for you and your partner to track your food and exercise. Plus, you can offer to do the same activities and share results and updates regularly.

, Have the whole family sit down and select favorite healthy lunch options that can be made at home and taken to work, college, school, etc. Then ensure that the ingredients are always available and have a shared lunch-making session every morning to speed things up. This will spare everyone from the temptation of fattening take outs at lunchtime.


Cut back on eating out. While convenient, eating in restaurants more than once a week can contribute significantly to unhealthy weight since you don’t know how the food is being prepared or the exact nutritional value it holds.

, Don’t forget to celebrate even the smallest victories. If your partner gains or loses two pounds toward their goal weight, go to the movies together or treat your partner to a manicure or massage. Mark each victory with a celebration so that they know that you're truly rooting for their success. Other ways to celebrate include:Take the family to the beach or the park for the afternoon.
See a play or go to a concert.
Write your partner a love letter telling them how proud you are of their success. Or simply tell explain how much you love them.
Purchase a new piece of (smaller sized) clothing for your partner from a favorite brand.
Bring them home flowers, a favorite author's new book or other non-food treats.

Suggest a medical evaluation.,
Consider your partner’s mental health.,
Ask for a referral to a nutritionist.",How to Talk to Your Partner About Their Weight3," If you and your partner are unsure about what a healthy weight range is, you should suggest consulting a doctor. The doctor can evaluate your partner’s BMI (Body Mass Index) and give you health related information based on the BMI. Being above or below a normal weight range can put someone at risk for different medical conditions.Some medications and conditions such as hypothyroidism and PCOS can cause excessive weight gain or loss.
If you are unsure how to suggest this, try saying something like “We’ve discussed weight a few times now, and neither of us seem to be sure what a healthy weight would be. Maybe it would help if we asked your doctor.”

, Sometimes weight changes may result from challenges like work pressures (stress), depression or anxiety. Weight changes can also be associated with sadness and loss, such after the death of a loved one or the loss of a job. Talking to a health professional can help sort out mental health issues as well as physical ones.If your doctor determines that the weight change is related to mental health, they may recommend therapy with a counselor. There are many counselors that specialize in weight related topics.

, Whether your partner’s weight changes are related to a medical issue or a lifestyle issue, a change in diet may be in order. A nutritionist can suggest exactly what changes to make, and how to implement them slowly and effectively. Your partner’s doctor can refer them to see a nutritionist if they think it will be beneficial.Radical changes in diet should only be considered when medical professionals deem it absolutely necessary. Otherwise, slow consistent changes are more likely to stick in the long run.

Build self-worth.,
Pursue your own interests or hobbies.,
Allow your spouse to spend time alone.,
Match your partner’s level of affection.,
Seek professional therapy.",How to Be Less Needy with Your Spouse1," Perhaps the most important step in becoming less needy with your spouse is becoming more confident in yourself. In practicing these exercises, you may realize that although you love your spouse, you don’t have to spend every waking moment with them, and that it’s natural to want to do things on your own.


Work on self-love to boost your self-confidence. Identify the qualities you like about yourself and that you are proud of. For example, perhaps you are an awesome cook. You can emphasize these qualities by going out and providing support for others in your community. In this example, you can take or teach cooking classes.
Tell yourself every day that you are worth it, you are smart, you are attractive, and you are capable. If you have trouble doing this yourself, seek the help of a therapist.
Other ways to build self-worth include challenging yourself more often and learning new things. When you overcome a difficult obstacle or develop a new skill you build self-efficacy, which in turn boosts your self-worth.;
, Developing your own life outside of your spouse’s is another way to gain your independence. A hallmark of a healthy relationship is both partners being able to have both separate and mutual interests. Due to your clinginess, you probably already join in on many of your spouse’s activities. So, now you need to consider what you like doing and cultivate some hobbies of your own.


Do not be afraid to reinvent yourself by identifying interests that you’ve been considering but have held back from because of fear or self-doubt.
You may also want to go back to school, join a club or group, or find additional ways to meet friends so that you have others to spend time with besides just your spouse., The truth is, everyone needs a little alone time. This doesn’t mean that they don’t necessarily want to spend time with you; rather, they just want to spend some time with themselves. Give your spouse the space and trust they need to be happy and your relationship will likely benefit as a result.


It may be difficult to give your spouse some room to breathe, but remind yourself that doing so may save your relationship. This clingy behavior isn’t good for you, or for your spouse. Resisting the urge to keep tabs on your spouse at all times and allowing them to have time alone or with friends and family will show your partner that you trust them, which may improve the marriage overall., When you think about it, most people give out the amount of affection they are comfortable with receiving. If your partner isn’t very affectionate, but you are constantly giving hugs and kisses and demanding it in return, you may start to make them uncomfortable. Instead, mirror their level of affection and attention.


For example, if you text your partner throughout the day, but only receive one or two from them, start sending out that same amount. Rather than smothering them with affection when they walk through the door, allow them to make the first move. Holding back a little bit may present a challenge initially, but it will likely be worth it in the end., Clinginess in relationships is often a hallmark of codependency, an unhealthy and one-sided relational dynamic.If you are unable to overcome your neediness, it may help to see a mental health therapist.


A therapist can work with you to examine your relational patterns, find the origin to clingy behavior, and learn healthier relationship skills. You can find a therapist by asking your family doctor for a referral or by searching for counselors experienced in relationship issues online

Get honest with yourself.,
Find ways to stop “suffocating” your partner.,
Show your spouse that you trust them.",How to Be Less Needy with Your Spouse2," Those who are clingy often feel insecure, jealous, and lonely. When it comes down to it, these emotions can make the needy person feel simply awful and ultimately, unhappy with the relationship. When they are unhappy, they tend to project this onto their partner. This may cause the more secure partner to leave because they are tired of the way their spouse is treating them.


Ask your spouse if they think you tend to exhibit these behaviors towards them. For instance, you could say, “Do you think I act jealous or insecure about our relationship? If so, how does that make you feel and why do you think I behave the way I do?”
Opening up the lines of communication with your spouse helps them to understand that you believe you may have a problem and value their opinion regarding it. You can also work together to brainstorm solutions., In new relationships, it is common for those involved to want to be around each other all of the time. After a while, though, it is natural for that initial spark to begin to fade and those in the relationship start to become more independent.


If one spouse begins that normal tendency while the other continues to want to spend lots of time together, the other may begin to feel “suffocated.”You can overcome this dynamic by spending more time apart. You might say to your partner, ""I think I have been suffocating you, and I'm sorry. I didn't realize. I think it will be healthy if we start spending more time with friends or family to give each other some space.""
If being apart from your partner frightens you, fill your social calendar. Schedule gatherings with friends. Pursue your education or complete goals that have been left unfinished. Take up a new hobby or skill.

, When needy spouses are constantly checking in with their spouses, forbidding them to go anywhere without them, or berate them with questions when they come home, the more secure spouse may think the clingy spouse doesn’t trust them.Overcome the trust issues associated with neediness by using language that demonstrates faith in your partner and the relationship. When your partner goes out with friends, say ""Be careful, sweetie. Have a good time."" rather than berating them about calling you every hour on the hour.
Trusting your partner to be away from you and still uphold the values of your relationship is important. Avoid texting or calling them nonstop when you are apart. Don't check their call logs or emails.

Look at your childhood.,
Determine your self-worth.,
Look at your past relationships.",How to Be Less Needy with Your Spouse3," When people grow up feeling unloved, they often look for the affection and acceptance they didn’t get during their childhood, from their spouses. If the affection isn’t met, they often believe that the other person doesn’t care about them. Even if it’s something as small as not answering the phone right away, the needy person often becomes paranoid about the relationship and becomes even more clingy.


If you have siblings or other loved ones who experienced the same type of childhood you did, look at how they behave in relationships. If they are also clingy with their spouses or significant others, you likely are the way you are because your emotional and physical needs were not met as a child., Needy people tend to have low self-esteem, just as secure people are typically very self-confident. Often, those who are clingy with their spouses are because they are trying to validate themselves. When they don’t receive the love and affection they seek, they often feel even worse about themselves and become even more clingy.


It’s normal to feel good when your spouse shows affection or tells you they love you. However, if you become crushed or think bad about yourself when they give you less than what you want, it could be because you don’t have enough self-worth., A common trait among those who are clingy in marriages is that they have had failed relationships in the past. Perhaps they were cheated on or were treated poorly. As a result, they become desperate for the love and affection they didn’t receive in the other relationships.


If a person doesn’t have high self-esteem or didn’t have a loving childhood and are needy with significant others, their clinginess could be the reason why their relationships failed. Then in the next relationship, they display the same type of behavior, and may fail in that relationship, as well. Until the problem is resolved, the person may continue to experience the same types of situations."

Consider alternative kinds of families.,
Think about your partner's preferences.,
Don't let money alone sway you.,
Keep in mind that a Marriage is different than a Wedding.,
Take comfort in the idea that your decision doesn't have to be final.,
Break it to your partner (if you have one) gently, without being harsh or pointing fingers.,
Accept your decision.",How to Be Certain That Your Choice to Not Marry Is Sound," Try not to read about celebrity couples, as those marriages are hardly realistic. Find blogs, vlogs, or advice articles. Find things written by people who don't want to get married, and why they chose not to get hitched.;
, Remember, though, that they will probably be biased one way or another. Ultimately, your decision is the only one that matters.

, Ask yourself why you think marriage is not for you. You may not want to marry for financial, religious, moral, or family reasons, or you may just not feel like you are ready to commit fully to your partner (if you have one).

, Many people don't want to marry because then they will be expected to have children. Remember: marriage does not always have to lead to children. Centuries ago, humans were only meant to get married and have children. That has changed, but your family and friends may still pressure you to do so.


Parents will sometimes pressure their adult children to get married and have kids of their own. This can be for many reasons. Maybe they found joy in their marriage and children, or they want grand kids, or perhaps they think that you need kids to take care of you in your old age. Whatever the reason, it doesn't matter. All that matters is that you choose what's right for you.

, Your partner may want to get married, even though you don't. Respect their standpoint, but don't give in to guilt or persuasions such as ""If you really loved me, you'd marry me."". If they truly loved you, they would respect your decision to stay unmarried.

, If you can't afford to get married, don't worry. First of all, a big, expensive wedding isn't necessary. If you want to get married, you could just do so cheaply. It's your wedding, you can get married in your pajamas if you like.

, Marriage = lifelong whereas Wedding = One day. If you're nervous about a ceremony, then look at the big picture and spending the rest of your life with someone you love. Conversely, if you just want to throw a big party, it's not a good idea to get married. Plan a big celebration for your birthday or another holiday.

, Remember, if you choose not to marry, you can always change your mind later. Your decision is never set in stone.

, If he/she gets angry at you, leave the room and let them calm down for a while. If they ask questions, answer to the best of your ability. Remember, it is your decision not to get married, not theirs.

, If you have concluded that marriage is not for you, then recognize that. Don't feel guilty or pressured just because someone else wants you to get married. It's a very personal decision.


Friends and family may try to sway your decision, but just remember that marriage isn't for everyone, and what makes one person happy can make another miserable, and vice versa.

Steal back those monopolized sheets and covers.,
Be prepared for difficulties, however!,
Purchase a bigger flat sheet and cover, or even multiple covers.,
Alternatively, buy separate covers.,
Try clipping the sheets securely on either side of the bed.",How to Deal with Someone Hogging the Sheets1," Try to pull the sheet or covers back onto you gently but firmly. A few tugs back toward your side of the bed might suffice. If not, perhaps getting out of bed and lifting up the entire sheet and covers and draping them back over both of you might be all that's needed. If your partner is well asleep, they may simply subconsciously rearrange their sleeping position to cope with the restored covers arrangement.;
, There are several potential downsides to attempting this ""gentle shift"" of the covers back toward you:

Depending on how they have managed to end up with all the sheet and covers, you might find out that they wrapped themselves in a ""burrito wrap"". Unfurling this is probably about as easy as unwrapping a mummy, only weightier. Unless you're strong and gentle in just the right balance, this could end up in a tangle, with a grouchy awoken partner alongside you.






You may also find your partner stealing the sheet and covers back after you've shifted them. This can go on repeatedly, ending up in a ""gimme back my covers"" struggle throughout the night. Hardly conducive to a good night's sleep!







, Discuss the issue with your significant other first and explain what has been happening at night; be kind, as many people don't realize their strength when asleep and cold! Buying flat sheets and covers that are larger than your mattress size is not unusual by any means and is an excellent way around the problem of both bed users wanting to snuggle into lots of the cover. Indeed, bedding suppliers often stock separate flat and fitted sheets, just for this reason, to allow you to fit the mattress correctly but use a larger flat sheet on top.


For example, if you have a queen size bed, purchase a king size flat sheet and duvet/blanket/other bedding covers. All that extra length at the sides turns into separate snuggle zones!

, This solution means that both of you will have your own covers, even if the sheet is hogged. Extra covers ensure you that the other person won't be able to steal the entire amount of warm bedding and you will still have something left to cover yourself with.

, There is an increasing range of ways to secure the sheets and duvet covers on either side of the bed to stop your partner from pulling the covers to their side. There are a number of products available for this purpose, generally with clips on either side of the bed that attach to the covers and are connected by an elastic strap which passes under the mattress or bed frame. Try searching for ""cosy cover hugger"", ""duvet clips"", ""cosy grips"", or even ""bed sheet holder"" or ""sheet fasteners"" to find a potential solution. If all else fails, see if you can create your own makeshift bed sheet clips."
"
Snuggle up with your partner.",How to Deal with Someone Hogging the Sheets2," Try to wedge yourself inside the sheets behind them, so that you can actually get some cover. This is great for free heat exchange, and it'll keep both of you snug. Be sure to pull your pillow close too, so that you're not pushing your partner's head off their pillow.


If your partner is in a deep sleep, be careful! They may not realize you're so close and might accidentally elbow you when shuffling in their sleep.
Overheating, pins and needles or difficulty with breathing can ensue if you're stuck in an awkward position or up too close with your partner under all those covers! Shuffle back to your spot if you're uncomfortable.

"
"
Wake up your partner, but not in a way that disturbs their sleep.",How to Deal with Someone Hogging the Sheets3," You may give them a gentle nudge, just to help shift them out of their deep sleep. Then, quickly take your chance at getting the sheet and covers back while they're shuffling and drifting back to sleep.

"
"
Push two smaller beds together.",How to Deal with Someone Hogging the Sheets4," As the very last resort, if you're both experiencing severe bed issues, this may be the way to go to solve it. Each one of you will be guaranteed the same bed area needed for a perfect night's sleep and you'll each successfully have the exact amount of sheet and covers without having to worry about any more hogging.

Ask your spouse to turn off lawyer mode.,
Talk about the issue in more depth.,
Brainstorm ways to reduce pressure.,
Suggest coping strategies.,
Recommend professional counselling.,
Talk about moving to less stressful law work.,
Expect questioning.,
Don't question back during an argument.,
Don’t over explain.,
Keep your emotions out of the conversation.,
Walk away from the argument.",How to Stay Married to an Attorney," A good attorney is trained to hide emotions, never admit she's wrong, and attack any hole in the opposing argument. If any of this sounds like what your spouse does during a domestic argument or a dinner conversation, she's having trouble leaving that training at work or law school. Pick a moment when both of you are calm, and talk to her about this. Here are some polite ways to bring up issues:


""When you're stressed at work, you come back in 'lawyer mode.' If you can just be part of the family while you're at home, we would both have an easier time.""
""When we fight, you sometimes argue like you're in a courtroom. Remember that at home, the goal is often to compromise or to find out what's really bothering us, not to win the fight.""
""Sometimes I'm emotionally vulnerable, and I need my spouse to understand that and support me. Using another person's emotions as leverage might be a good attorney tactic, but I know you don't want to fall into that pattern at home."";
, If your spouse doesn't accept that he's in lawyer mode – or worse, tries to cross-examine you on why you think that – back up and explain what you're looking for in a spouse and conversation partner. If you knew your spouse before he started practicing law or working in a stressful environment, remind him of early moments that demonstrate the behavior you're looking for. Here are a few reminders that people in ""lawyer mode"" often need to hear:


It's okay to doubt your position or your decision, and to tell each other about these doubts to get advice and support.
People in a relationship should trust each other to protect and comfort each other, not be on guard or suspicious of each other. A relationship is about cooperation, not competition.You don't need to examine conversations or events from a serious, logical perspective. A complaint about your spouse's day is really looking for affirmation and support, not a method for solving the problem or a logical reason why there's no reason to be upset.

, Law students and lawyers at big firms often work insanely long hours, many of which may not even be billable. This high stress, competitive, often hostile environment takes its total on emotional well-being, and requires effort from both you and your spouse to mitigate this.Have a conversation about changes you can make that can help your spouse cope, and prevent it affecting your relationship. Consider the following options:


Give your spouse time alone to unwind after she gets back from work, or at least have a policy of ""no work talk in the first hour at home"" – which includes your work as well.
If domestic chores are an issue and you can afford it, hire someone to help out around the house and/or garden.Ask your spouse to let you know when she expects a tough time at work, such as when she's litigating a big case or falling short of her billable hours goal. Agree to go easy on her during these times. (And have her reciprocate when you have your own stressful days.)

, Attorneys are short on time, but putting work ahead of marriage, family, and personal time can lead to more stress and unhappiness. Here are a few items your spouse should consider to restore this balance:Learn to prioritize your relationship and emotional health over non-time-sensitive work, and over less important activities.
Recognize that mistakes are part of life and opportunities for learning, not disasters.
Practice setting realistic and obtainable goals, based on how you've previously handled similar situations. Don't jump at a larger workload without first considering the effect on your life.
Schedule time to relieve stress and treat it as just as important as your scheduled work time. Depending on what works for you, this could be exercising, socializing, picking up a fun hobby, or spending time with your spouse.

, Law practice has one of the worst rates of depression and anxiety disorders among all professions, but lawyers often have trouble admitting to these issues or connecting them to their work.A personal therapist or a marriage counsellor could help identify whether your spouse is depressed, and suggest ways and methods for overcoming the problem. While counselling is highly individual, there are some issues that are more highly correlated with lawyers than the general population, which are worth discussing with a professional:A pessimistic or fatalistic attitude
Not enough ability to make decisions or control one's life
Guilt over not spending time with the family (especially among female lawyers)Excessive use of alcohol or illegal drugs

, If your marriage is falling apart, and marriage counselling doesn't give you the tools to strengthen it, you and your spouse face a difficult decision. If the attorney's work is a major source of stress and disagreement, have an honest talk about the following options:Some areas of law are less stressful and competitive than others. Could your spouse consider specializing in intellectual property, internet, estate planning, employment law, environmental law, immigration, health care, bankruptcy, or in representing educational institutions, students, or the elderly?
Small firms and government firms tend to be less stressful than large private ones, while solo practice is even better. Solo practices are easiest to establish in rural areas, and/or if you rent a desk or office from an existing law firm, accounting firm, or insurance brokerage.
Non-attorney workers that will still make good use of law education include magistrates, court commissioners, agents for artists and athletes, alternative dispute resolution mediators, PR representatives, legal instructors, law librarians, and many others.

, Attorneys are trained to question, question, question, until they pinpoint a hole in the argument and tear it all apart. Even when he's not actively aiming to do this, the questioning habit taught in law school dies hard.Try not to take it personally when this happens, but you can point out to your spouse that he's ""lawyering"" again if he's previously agreed to avoid it.

, Your attorney spouse has a black-belt in handling incoming questions. She will often be six steps ahead of your own line of questioning, and figure out exactly how to turn it back on you while dodging anything uncomfortable.If you need to ask a question while the two of you are angry at each other, rephrase it as a statement. Instead of asking ""Do you want to come to Beth's dinner party?"" say ""I'm going to Beth's dinner party. You can come if you want to.""

, Let your “yes” be “yes” and your “no” be “no” and keep your statements simple. A long or complicated justification for your reasoning can be torn apart more easily. If you are being badgered over the same point repeatedly, just continue to say ""yes"" or ""no."" This ""broken record"" approach often promoted by cognitive behavioral therapists may sound repetitive (because it is) but it will clarify that you mean what you're saying and that you're not straying from it for any reason.

, Someone in ""lawyer mode"" will do the same, and may even hurt you by treating your emotional reactions as vulnerabilities. Of course, this is easier said than done for the person without professional training, but that's what the next step is for.

, At the end of the day, you're trying to argue with someone who spent years training in how to win arguments, and who may even be paid to construct arguments in her professional life. Does that sound like a productive move? Say ""I'm walking away and we can talk once we've calmed down"" and take a few hours apart from each other.

Leave if you feel unsafe.",How to Act When You Discover Your Spouse Has a Drinking Problem," Some people start drinking to get away from their problems, some drink because they have poor impulse control, and others get hooked simply because they never learned healthy ways to relax. Identifying the reason your spouse drinks will help you know how to support them in their recovery., You might feel confused or angry that your spouse would try to solve their problems by doing something as destructive and illogical as drinking excessively. Understand that addiction is usually a reaction to emotional problems and is not based on reason.As addiction takes hold, it hijacks a person’s brain, giving them a warped sense of priorities. These warped priorities cloud an addict’s judgment in a way that non-addicted people often can’t understand. To an alcohol addict, obtaining and drinking booze is the most important thing in life, whether they admit it to themselves and others or not.

, Think about how you may have unwittingly played a role in your spouse’s addiction. Before you realized your spouse had a drinking problem, did you ever lie for them when they were drunk or take care of them when they were hungover? Actions like this enable alcohol abusers to persist in their unhealthy habits.If you drink with your spouse, it may exacerbate the problem. If you often drink with your spouse, make a commitment to ending this behavior so that it does not look like you are endorsing their drinking behavior.
If you think your spouse has a drinking problem, it’s best to stop protecting them from the consequences of their own actions.

, Alcohol abuse almost always gets worse if it’s left untreated, and it can have devastating consequences on the addict as well as the people close to them. Alcoholism routinely destroys marriages, families, and relationships. It can also lead to serious health problems and an early death.People who drink excessively are more likely to become abusive towards their spouse or children.
Alcoholism is linked to alcohol poisoning, liver disease, cancer, and heart disease. It’s also a major contributor to fatal car accidents.

, It’s important to talk to your spouse right away when you discover their drinking problem. The consequences of alcohol abuse can be serious, and the problem will not go away on its own. Ignoring it now will only make it harder to deal with in the future.Some people say that an alcoholic has to hit rock bottom before they decide to get better. However, many people can and do stop drinking before they get to this point. Alcoholism is a progressive disease, and the earlier your spouse gets help, the easier it will be for them to quit.

, If you try to have a conversation with your spouse while they are drunk, you probably won’t get far. Both of you need to be clear-minded and fully present to have a productive talk.Try talking to your spouse when they are hungover and regretful. They may be more willing to listen to you when they are feeling the negative consequences of their drinking.

, Start the conversation by telling your spouse how their behavior makes you feel. Avoid lashing out at them or blaming them for making bad choices. It’s natural to feel upset or hurt after you find out your spouse has been hiding an addiction from you, but speaking in anger can make them shut down and refuse to cooperate with you.For instance, you might say, “It really bothers me how you stay out late at bars so often. I worry about where you are and whether you’re okay. Even if you text me, it hurts me to know you’d rather get drunk than be at home with me.”

, Talk to your spouse as if the two of you are a team and alcohol abuse is your mutual enemy. You might not feel united with your spouse right now, but if you make them feel defensive, they may shut you out and start drinking even more. If they feel like you are on their side, they may feel guiltier about hurting you and be more motivated to recover.Make your point by saying something like, “I hate what your drinking is doing to our relationship. It’s driving us apart, and that hurts both of us.”

, The goal of this conversation should be to bring your spouse’s drinking problem out into the open. Both of you will probably experience intense emotions during and after the talk. Give yourself and your spouse time to cool down and think the situation through before either of you decides what to do next.You might close the conversation by saying something like, “This is hard to talk about, and it’s going to take some time to come to terms with it. I think we should both let our emotions settle and do some research before we decide what to do next.”

, Maintaining strong personal boundaries is the best way to prevent an addict from manipulating or walking on you. Decide what behaviors you can tolerate and which ones you’re not okay with. Let your spouse know about your new expectations in the relationship.For instance, you might tell your spouse, “If you shout at me again when you are drunk, I am going to take the kids and leave the house.” Another example might be, “I am not going to call in sick for you anymore if you are too hungover to go to work.”

, People recover from addiction more easily if they feel like their spouse is on their side. Talk to your spouse about what they need from you. Do your best to be patient and compassionate with them as they start down the road to recovery.You can’t make someone recover from addiction if they don’t want to. Consider what you will do if your spouse refuses to seek treatment. Some spouses of addicts consider this as grounds for divorce.

, Nagging your spouse to go to AA meetings or trying to watch their behavior all the time won’t do any good in the end. Getting better is something only your spouse can do. Your support can make a difference, but in the end, recovery has to be their decision.Instead of trying to control your spouse’s behavior, focus on what actions you will take if your spouse doesn’t try to get better.

, Living with and supporting a recovering alcoholic can be exhausting. You may find that you need to distance yourself a little for the sake of your own emotional health. Focus on eating right, getting enough sleep, taking time to relax, and finding social support.Consider attending a support group like Alcoholics Anonymous, where you can meet other people who understand what you are going through.

, If your spouse yells at you, threatens you, or hits you when they are drunk, get out as soon as you can, especially if you have children. Arrange to stay with a family member for a while, or find a shelter in your area. You never need to feel guilty about putting your own safety first."

Sit down and talk about house, kids, college education for the kids, a healthy emergency fund, nice cars, travel each year, nice clothes, gadgets and computers, etc.,
Remove emotions from financial talk.,
Come up with a plan to meet your goals.,
Develop a system for finances that works for both of you.,
Decide who will be handling the ""administrative"" aspects of your finances.,
Have weekly financial meetings.,
Adapt as needed.,
Above all, stay positive and be honest.",How to Take a Healthy Approach to Finances in Your Relationship,"


Then prioritize, and see if you can come up with things in common. If you want different things, it is important that you talk about why, and consider the other person's desires. If that's what makes the other person happy, you should want to make them happy - that's the basis of a good relationship. But relationships aren't one-sided, either, so you should be able to be happy too. The point is that both sides should be considered, and you should look for a win-win solution or compromise so that you can both be happy.
Discuss how you will handle assets and debts that were accumulated before the relationship began. If you are married in the U.S., your spouse's creditors can hold you legally responsible and pursue your assets if you don't keep your finances completely separated, or if you ever get divorced. Plus, your spouse's credit score will affect your ability to get joint credit, which is often necessary for large purchases (such as a home). So if you're married, the best route is to work together to pay off debt as quickly as possible, avoiding late payments. If you're planning on getting married soon, a pre-nuptial agreement can help protect one person's assets from the other person's creditors.If you're not married, you may choose to treat individual debt as a shared expense, or you may not - the choice is yours as a couple.;
, From your first meetings about financial goals to your subsequent weekly talks (addressed in a later step), it's important that the two of you stay calm, don't get hurt or angry over any of the issues, and try to look at these issues objectively. Often financial issues are tied up in all kinds of emotional issues, stemming from childhood, from issues of security to feeling like your way is better, to feeling hurt if your way of spending is criticized in any way, and much more. These emotional issues are all tangled together with financial issues, and it's important that you untangle them and just deal with financial goals and habits:


Don't use emotional, accusatory, or inflammatory language. Use nonviolent communication.
Don't blame the other person or even be negatively critical.
Simply talk about your financial goals, developing a plan for getting to those goals, developing a system for dealing with finances, and so forth.
Also, try not to feel like you're under attack if the other person talks about your goals or habits — let this be an open discussion, and if you feel under attack, stop and take a breath and remember that this isn't a discussion about you personally but about how the two of you are going to meet your goals. Again, think of this as a team effort, not as a you-vs-me effort.

, Once you're able to come up with common financial goals (a huge step - celebrate!), you will need a plan to get you there. This will take into account your joint income, your debt, your savings, how much you can put towards debt and/or saving each month, whether you want to cut back on certain things in order to meet your savings goals, how long you want to give yourself to meet financial goals, and so forth:


Start by having a definite time frame for each goal, and then figure out how much you need to save (or pay towards debt) each month to get to your goals. Try to get into the habit of paying yourselves first.
Create a spending plan (if you haven't already) for each month, and see if you can adjust it to meet that monthly goal. You might need to cut back on some things, or earn extra income, or both. Or you might discover that your goals aren't realistic and you need to cut back on them, reprioritize, or push them back a bit in order to meet them. This plan to meet your goals is how you will align your daily and monthly spending with your long-term goals. It's also a great way to resolve minor short-term disputes - for example, ""you should definitely buy fewer shoes, and I should buy fewer video games, so we can buy that house in three years and travel to Europe in two years"". Spending plans will evolve as time goes by -- this is inevitable; be prepared to adjust and adapt to your changing situations (promotion at work, unexpected expenses like constant car repairs indicating an upcoming major expense, etc.) as needed.

, It may take some trial, error and tweaking before you get it right. Keep in mind that no one arrangement is in any way ""better"" than the other. The best arrangement is the one that creates the most harmony in your relationship.


Use the communal approach if you have very similar spending styles and saving goals. All of the income received by the couple goes into a single account, and all expenses come out of that single account. If you're not on the same page about spending, like if one person tends to make money decisions that the other person tends to disagree with, this approach can lead to frequent arguments. Communication, trust, and discipline are essential for this arrangement to work smoothly.
Use the individual approach if you have different spending styles. Keep separate accounts to which your individual incomes are deposited. Put money into a joint account only for shared expenses. Decide what those shared expenses are going to be (usually rent or mortgage, utilities, etc.) and what proportion each partner will pay. You can each put in half of the expenses, or you may decide to contribute a percentage that's relative to your individual income (e.g. one person makes twice as much per year as the other, so one person puts twice as much towards the shared expenses as the other). The remainder of the money in each person's account is theirs to keep and spend or save however they wish.
Use the allowance approach if it fits. This is a hybrid of the previous two arrangements. Put everything into a joint account, but then give each person an allowance to spend as they wish. The allowance can be in cash, or it can be transferred to individual accounts. Decide as a couple how much of an allowance each person should get. This works best for people who tend to spend money on different things, but who still want to pool their income.

, In order to put your financial plan into action, you'll need to figure out how you're going to pay your bills, pay debt, deposit into savings, have money for various spending needs (like gas and groceries and eating out), and so forth. Someone will have to take responsibility for each part of the system (it's better if you're both involved, but you should find what works best for you as a couple). Usually there's one person who's more inclined to do the bookkeeping, and sometimes he or she doesn't mind carrying this responsibility. Otherwise, you'll need to define and assign responsibility. One person might go to the bank while the other updates your financial program (like Quicken or Money) or your checking register to make sure you're in balance, for example.


If one person will be handling the finances more than the other, what is his or her responsibility in consulting with the other before, say, moving money into the savings account or IRA?
If the person who normally handles these tasks can't do it (e.g. medical issue, away on a trip, etc.) does the other person know enough about the process to step in?

, This is very important, and it's a step that many couples overlook. Just because you have common financial goals and a plan and a system doesn't mean that everything is fine. If one person takes responsibility for the finances, for example, and the other is out of the loop, there will likely be problems down the road. You don't want to be in the situation where one partner took care of the finances and the other was blissfully ignorant...until it was revealed that they were way behind on payments and would soon have to file for bankruptcy. That isn't a good time in a relationship! To prevent problems like this, have a weekly meeting where you sit down and talk about finances. You can review your accounts, your spending plan, what is coming up in the next few weeks that you'll need to budget for, any problem areas, what to do with your annual bonus, where you are with your goals, and so forth. Make sure you're both caught up on everything, and that you're working well as a team.

, You may need to adjust the allowances or proportions if a big expense arises, like one person loses a job, or suffers from a major illness or injury, or even takes up a new (and expensive) interest or hobby. For instance, let's say a couple uses the communal approach, and then one partner decides to take up golfing again. The couple may decide that the best way to accommodate this is to designate a ""golfing allowance"" so that one partner knows exactly how much the other partner is going to be spending on this hobby, and there are no surprises (""You spent how much on that golf club?!?""). (In the golfing example, additional expenses could be drawn from the person's personal allowance.) Many couples modify their arrangement significantly as their circumstances change. A couple may, for example, start off with the individual approach, then transition into the communal approach when they start a family or make a large investment together., Remember: you're a team. You have the same goals and you want each other to be happy. Team members can help each other out and encourage each other, or they can rip the team apart by being negative, by blaming, by working against common goals. If you always stay positive, you'll succeed as a team. Be encouraging, stay focused on solutions not blame, and make sure love is the foundation of everything you do.

Set expectations with your loved one.,
Plan what to say to children.,
Schedule your conversations.,
Plan extra activities for yourself.",How to Cope With Separation1," If you are going through a temporary separation, you will need to redefine the ways you handle your shared life.You will also need to understand what the other person thinks of the separation.


If your separation is deliberate, make sure you both agree on what the goal of the separation is. Take the time to sit down with a third party mediator if possible and discuss what you each want out of the separation. For instance, if one of you wants to consider permanent separation, while the other wants to take a break and come back, you need to reconcile those differences!
Communicate about shared responsibilities. If you have children, pets, or share a car or home, you will have to rise above any animosity and talk about those needs.
If necessary, hire a mediator to help coordinate your schedules and ensure that all responsibilities are covered.;
, If you and your partner have children together, you will want to discuss how you are going to talk to them about your separation. Again, it is important you put aside any conflict with your partner and focus on making this transition as easy as possible for your kids. Make a plan with your partner about how you want to tell your kids. They will benefit from open, honest communication about the upcoming changes.Try to give your children time to adjust to the separation. Try to wait a few weeks before moving them to a new home or before your partner moves out or is deployed.

, Whether you and your partner are taking a break or are separated by circumstance, you will feel better if you know when you are going to talk next. Make a schedule and keep it. Make sure the communication does not eat up your private or social life, however.If you are doing a trial separation, space the talking out. You might go a few weeks without communicating, then introduce meetups at neutral locations, then gradually move to seeing each other more frequently.
If you are separated by necessity, make regular dates to talk.
Your talking should not make other socializing or responsibilities impossible! Set firm limits — don't talk for hours, and don't cancel other dates to talk to your loved one. It is important to still have a life beyond these conversations.

, When you are temporarily separated, holes open in your schedule. You might spend less time eating meals, or not have a date for the events you normally attend in a pair. Connect with your friends and plan special dates with them.


Plan solo activities that you will enjoy doing alone, such as seeing a movie or cooking an elaborate meal.
Sign up for a class or a club that meets regularly to meet more people in a low key way.

Practice positive affirmations about your husband.,
Avoid framing the future in a negative way.,
Avoid comparing your husband to other men.,
Laugh with your husband!,
Consider the personality traits of your partner.,
Refrain from “always or never” thinking.,
Stop replaying the past.,
Make a positive thoughts jar.",How to Avoid Harboring Negative Thoughts About Your Husband1," Stop when you catch yourself dwelling on negative thoughts. Repeat the mantra, “It will work out” over and over again until you feel better. Visualize creating a barrier around your mind where no negative thoughts about your spouse are allowed entry.Then replace a critical thought with something true and positive about your husband. It might be ""I'm so glad I found someone who shares my sense of humor,"" or ""I am thankful for the support he provides this family."" Anything that is positive and affirming.


Be patient with this process as you are literally changing the way that you think. It will take time.;
, Recognize that your current thoughts about your husband do not necessarily mean that the future will turn out badly. The future is uncertain and unknowable. Instead of looking for future pitfalls, think about what you can do now to improve your life with your spouse.For example, instead of thinking, “We will always be broke because he doesn’t make enough,” you might look for ways to add a bit of income yourself.

, Everyone does this to some extent, but it can get to be unhealthy if it occurs too frequently or if you dwell on it. These types of comparisons are not productive and take energy away from the relationship that you are currently in. Instead, think about how others may perceive your husband as desirable. What traits does he project that are admirable?For example, does your husband smile all the time? Would other people consider him to be a nice person? Does he take great pride in his appearance, but not to the extent of being vain?

, Look for moments that are funny and cut loose a bit. If you just can’t seem to find something humorous, create a situation in which you both will be forced to lighten up. Go to comedy club or watch a funny movie. It’s hard to be negative when you are busy bonding over something funny or interesting.


Be willing to laugh at yourself. And, when the situation warrants it, laugh at your husband as well. Humor is a great way to break the ice if you need to talk about something more serious too., Remember that, first and foremost, your husband is human. He is going to have faults, as we all do. Avoid trying to make him perfect. Look for what is unique and exciting about his personality as an individual.Think about those moments when your husband behaved in a way that was uniquely suited to his personality and why you appreciated him in that moment. Do you admire the fact that he volunteers at the local food bank? Is that because he is a caring person?

, If you find yourself heading into absolutes, visualize a stop sign and pause your thinking. Try to consider how your thoughts should actually be more complex in order to be accurate. For example, instead of thinking, “My husband never makes me laugh anymore,” you might consider, “How often do I laugh now anyway?”Watch for words that signal exaggerations such as “always” or “never.”, If you’ve been together for some time it is quite possible that you’ve identified some things that you wish your husband did differently in the past. Make your best effort to offer forgiveness for past transgressions in order to move forward in a healthy way.


If you are worried about the past repeating itself, decide what your personal boundaries will be for the future. For example, if you resent the fact that you've never taken a vacation with your husband, now may be the time to plan a trip.

, Get a mason jar and some small scraps of paper. On each piece of paper write down a positive thought about your husband. Fold each scrap in half and place it in the jar. Every time that you feel negative, go to the jar and pick out at least one piece of paper. Read it and then place it back in the jar, along with at least one more positive thought.


This is a more active version of making a list. It will push you to recognize all of your husband’s small and large positive actions. For example, “I appreciate the fact that Michael takes out the trash every day.”Another version of this activity is to write down all of your negative thoughts on pieces of paper and toss them away. This reflects you letting go of the negativity and embracing a positive future."

Give yourself time to grieve.,
Let go of your regret.,
Don't go through it alone.,
Accept that it's over.,
Take it easy on yourself.,
Cut off communication with your ex -- if you can.",How to Cope With Divorce1," If you want to cope with your divorce as best as you can, then you need to give yourself time to grieve. You can't just expect to move on fully as soon as your ex moves out or as soon as the divorce is finalized. Even if the relationship had gone sour a long time ago, you'll still need time to deal with the emotional pain of ending a relationship with someone you once deeply loved. Instead of being in denial about how much you're hurting, you should tackle your feelings of confusion, pain, and sorrow head on.


It's okay to just let yourself cry for a while. This will be therapeutic and will make you feel better -- it's better than keeping these feelings in and letting them build up.
If you don't want to be social, talk to your friends, or be out and about for a while, that's okay too. Though you'll feel better once you engage with the world and settle into a comfortable routine, you can't expect to do it overnight.
You can keep a journal for writing down all of your thoughts of confusion and pain. This will help you heal as you figure out your feelings.;
, Though you may have a number of regrets about the end of your marriage, whether you regret deeply hurting your loved one, not being around enough, or not taking the time to do the little things that might have helped the relationship grow, you can't waste your time asking ""What if..."" all day long. This will only make you feel more upset as you try to change things that are out of your control.


Try making a list of all of the things you regret and then tearing it up. Once you write down all of the things that you regret, you'll be able to deal with them more easily.
It's likely that your ex is filled with regret, too. But remind yourself that this feeling won't lead you anywhere.

, Once you're ready to talk to your family and friends about the divorce, you should take the time to open up to a few close friends or family members, or even just one close friend or sibling, so you don't have to face all of your hurt feelings by yourself. Talk to your friends on the phone, meet them for lunch, or even just invite them over to help you heal. You should also consider getting help from a mental health professional.You don't have to talk about your divorce if you're not feeling up to it yet, but you can't keep all of your pain and hurt to yourself forever.
Your friends can also offer a nice distraction in your time of need. Having a good friend around can help you take your mind off of your pain. Even if you're suffering incredible heartache, you may be surprised to find that your best friend can still make you laugh.

, You may not be able to accept that your relationship is really over, even if your divorce has been finalized. It takes time to accept the fact that your life with your former partner won't turn out as you expected, but that doesn't mean that the rest of your life won't go on without your ex. Take the time to see that it's really over and that no amount of talking, self-improvement, or compromise will change that.


You'll only be able to begin to move on if you accept that your marriage is truly over. Until you do, you won't be able to enjoy your new life.
Reminding yourself of all the reasons that the marriage ended, and all of the unhappiness you felt, will help you appreciate the fact that it's over more.

, While you're starting the healing process, you should avoid being hard on yourself or raising your expectations for how you should behave. Now's not the time to lose those pesky twenty pounds you've wanted to lose forever, or to start working overtime at your job to try to impress your boss. You can try to achieve your goals once you're feeling a bit more mentally sound -- until then, just focus on keeping your head above water.Don't berate yourself for eating too much, waking up late, or forgetting a friend's birthday. Though you can't use the divorce as an excuse for less than desirable behavior forever, you can't hold yourself to the highest standards in a time of grief.

, If there are no kids in the picture and you and your ex have separated and split up your things, then you should avoid talking to, texting, or even using social media to communicate with your ex. And though you may think it's ""mature"" of you to hang out with your ex to show that you're hanging in there, you shouldn't grab coffee or chat with your ex on the phone until you really feel like you've moved on. This could take years, so be patient.


If there are kids in the picture, then you obviously can't ignore your ex completely. You should still talk when you need to and be as polite and cordial as you can, but don't use the kids to have a long, deep conversation about how much you miss each other.

File for divorce or legal separation.",How to Choose Between Separation and Divorce," You need to make the right decision for you, so you should begin by taking stock of what you want from the relationship. Do you want to try and reconcile? Or do you believe that the relationship has permanently broken down? If you are unsure about permanently ending the relationship, then a trial separation might be better. You can always reconcile later on.You should also think about what is best for your children. People used to routinely stay married “for the children.” That may not be the best option if your marriage is full of anger or betrayal.;
, What has kept your relationship from flourishing? Try to identify those obstacles. In doing so, you can assess whether or not you think that the relationship can be improved.


For example, you may have trouble communicating with your spouse, which is a common problem in marriages.However, you could try to address it by separating temporarily but attending couples therapy together.
Your marriage may also be stressed because of financial difficulties.Credit card debts, a large mortgage, and health care expenses are not easy to manage. Nevertheless, you may be better off trying to tackle them together by staying married.
Some obstacles might not be easy to fix. For example, if your spouse has a drug or alcohol problem, then this is not an obstacle you control. Although you may want to help your spouse get the treatment they need, you can’t force them.

, Before choosing between separation and divorce, you should check how a divorce would impact your finances. Meet with an accountant or financial planner to discuss the following:Do you receive health insurance under your spouse’s plan? If so, you might want to stay married if you do not think you can readily obtain affordable coverage on your own.
Are you close to receiving spousal Social Security benefits? If you have been married at least 10 years, then you can qualify for a spousal Social Security benefit even if you are divorced. If you have been married only eight years, you might want to wait a couple of years before divorcing.
Do you benefit from filing taxes jointly? For example, you might have to file in a higher income tax bracket if you divorce.
Do you receive military or other benefits because you are married? Can you replace that income? If you can’t replace it, you might want to separate instead of divorcing.

, In many states, you can get what is called a “legal separation,” also called “limited divorce.” Legal separation is like divorce in many respects. For example, you can get child support or alimony. A court must approve support, alimony, and child custody arrangements.


With a legal separation, you and your spouse also agree how to divide assets and debts.A court then approves the division. With an informal separation, you and your spouse can agree how to divide debts, but you would ultimately still be liable for debts.
To consider which type of separation is better, assess your finances. If your spouse has large debts you don’t want to be responsible for, then a legal separation could be better for you.
You might want a legal separation if you know you will no longer live together but one of you has a religious objection to divorce.
Unfortunately, legal separation can take almost as long as a divorce. If you are unsure about whether you want to permanently separate, then a short, informal separation might be best.

, The purpose of talking with your spouse is to find out whether he or she prefers to separate or divorce. Divorce or separation can be difficult when one spouse disagrees with the decision to split, so you need to find out your spouse’s preference. You need to break the news gently, but you also need to get his or her perspective. You should come up with a list of topics or questions to discuss:


Do either of you have religious objections to divorce? Would your families oppose the divorce?
Does your spouse want to divorce? Does he or she think a trial separation would help?
Is your spouse willing to address the obstacles in your relationship during the separation? If not, can your spouse see how the relationship has broken down?

, You should schedule a time to talk to your spouse. Tell him or her that you have something important you want to talk about and estimate how much time it will take. Say, “I would like to discuss our options for separation together.” Set up a mutually agreed time to talk.You should try to meet in a place where you have privacy, such as at home when the children are gone.
If you fear your spouse’s reaction, you might be tempted to meet in a public place, figuring that your spouse will control him or herself in public. However, if you are that afraid of your spouse, then you should think about leaving first and talking by phone.

, As you think about how to discuss your marriage with your spouse, it is important to take responsibility for your feelings. You can do this by using “I” language.


For example, “I am unhappy and think we should separate” signals that you are taking responsibility for your emotions. Saying “You make me miserable” is a form of blaming. You should avoid blaming your spouse as much as possible.
On the other hand, you should always point out what acts or conditions make you feel the way you do. For example, saying “When you drink, I spend all of my time worrying” conveys that the drinking is the trigger for your emotions.

, You may feel fear or intense nervousness, but you must remain calm—even if your spouse lashes out at you. One way to remain calm is to deliberately slow down your responses. Instead of immediately snapping back with a comment, you should count to three or four, taking a deep breath, before responding.


If you feel intense anger, then try to release that anger before sitting down to have the conversation. You could talk with a friend or express your angry thoughts in a journal.If your spouse is angry, you can say, “I know you are upset, but this is important. Would you like to meet in a couple days to discuss this further?” By giving your spouse some time to cool off, you can have a more productive discussion.

, The purpose of talking is to feel out whether or not your spouse wants to separate or divorce. If you choose an informal separation, then you do not need to decide a division of assets or a child support schedule. Even if you choose to divorce, you can meet at a later point to work out the details of the divorce.


Try to tackle issues one at a time. For the moment, coming to an agreement about separation or divorce is sufficient. When each of you has gained some perspective on the decision to separate, then you can meet again to discuss child care and money issues.
You can say, “I know you want to decide child support issues right now, but I need some space to think. I’ll be better able to make those decisions when I can reflect on our living situations.”

, Even if you only want to separate, you should talk to a legal professional who can help you understand the consequences of divorce and separation. For example, some states require that you be separated for a certain amount of time before you can get divorced. In those states, it makes sense to have a trial separation. You can also get the attorney’s advice about which is better for you: separation or divorce.


To find a good divorce attorney, you can ask other trusted professionals for recommendations. Ask your accountant, therapist, or doctor for a referral. Other attorneys are also a good source. If you used a real estate or personal injury lawyer for something previously, then reconnect and ask if you can get a recommendation for a divorce lawyer.For more tips, see Choose the Right Divorce Lawyer.

, Once you have the name of a divorce lawyer, you should call to schedule a consultation. These usually last a half hour. You should ask about the fee. Often, lawyers will charge a reduced fee for the consultation (or even meet for free). To prepare for the consultation, be sure to do the following:


Get financial documents ready so that your lawyer can understand your situation. Bring evidence of all sources of income for you and your spouse (such as pay stubs, retirement benefits, Social Security benefits) as well as proof of major expenses, like a mortgage and car payments.
Write down any questions that you have.You will want to understand the different legal consequences in your state for both separation and divorce.
Commit to being honest. In order to help you adequately, the lawyer needs to understand your situation. Be prepared to share potentially embarrassing details, such as drug or alcohol addiction, infidelity, or problems parenting. Anything you share with the attorney will be private.

, Not every state allows legal separation. You should ask the lawyer during your consultation if this is an option for you.


The legal separation agreement is legally binding and filed with the court. It lays out the following:a division of assets
a division of debts
any alimony or child support
child visitation schedules


You can also informally separate, but you won’t have the legal protections of a separation agreement. For example, you could still remain liable for your spouse’s debts.

, You might not want to pay the expenses of having a lawyer guide you through the divorce or legal separation process. Nevertheless, it is a good idea to have a lawyer during divorce or separation proceedings when any of the following is true:your spouse has hired a lawyer
there has been abuse in the relationship, whether abuse of your children or of each other
your spouse is vindictive

, You have the choice to take an informal, trial separation. However, if you want a legal separation or a divorce, then you must file a petition with the court asking to be granted one. Your lawyer can handle this for you.

, If your siblings or step-siblings do not know, wait until your parents have had time to discuss it with each of them.


Make sure your parents inform your other siblings as soon as possible. You don't want them finding out the wrong way from the wrong person. You will need to work on this as a family and that means the family being informed.

,


Consider how far you live from your parents, siblings and other relatives. If they are at risk from learning this information from another relative or family friend you should make time to have a family meeting and share the news.
Explain to your children that you will be helping your parents as much as possible and your attention may be divided.
Explain that it doesn't change who their grandparents are, they will still be grandmother and grandfather. Encourage them to still speak and interact with them individually.
Consider the maturity of the child and their closeness to their grandparents.

, Maintain a solid line of communication with them. Agree to discuss things openly and honestly.


Agree to not take sides but to share information and help each other and your parents get through this tough time.

, It will be natural for everyone to take the side and look out for the best interest of the birth parent. At least try to be objective and keep the lines of communication open with your step-siblings. Try to be supportive and let them know you are available should they need anything.

, However, make it clear that you don't want to feel pressured to take sides.


Ask your parents to refrain from making disparaging comments about your other parent. However, since you are older and less impressionable, this may not be as big of an issue. You'll need to work this out for yourself.
Discuss this approach with your siblings.

, Remember that previous divorces, especially where there were custody battles, may have made your parents bitter and offensive about the divorce process. They may have experienced divorce as children, and therefore have certain worries and fears about their own divorce based on that childhood experience.

, Ask your siblings to do the same. Ask that everyone remain calm and accepting of what is happening; remind people that this intimate relationship is between two people and as much as all of you might want things to be different, it is inappropriate for any of you to goad your parents into legal spats.

,


You may be needed to help sort and move property.
You may be needed for moral support.
You and your siblings may need to help a parent arrange for lawn care, help with laundry, etc. if that was something your other parent maintained.

,, After divorce, the status of these documents changes and they must be updated for the protection of all concerned.

, Your parents may have avoided that conversation with you since you were the child and assumed the spouse would take care of those arrangements.


Find out where your parents want to be buried.
Ask if there are family burial plots that have been purchased. If the divorce will exclude a parent from the plot ask the parent where he/she would like to be buried.
If either parent has medical problems you should try to attend a doctor's appointment with that parent. Get an understanding of the condition, the medications and make sure the doctor's office changes the next of kin listed on the file.

, Make sure you spend time with each parent and do your best not to exclude the other parent from holiday plans or other events.


Perhaps move family gatherings to your home or siblings house instead of your parents' home. If you do visit a parent who doesn't cook, offer to cook something there or make it potluck.
Consider having your mother over for lunch on a holiday and your father over for dinner.

,, As you are very close to the situation and trusted by both, it will be very easy to get sucked in too deep. It's alright to let them vent but make sure you aren't letting a parent's negativity damage your quality of life.


If a parent becomes too co-dependent, you may need to back away and become less available.
You may need to declare that the discussion of divorce is off limits for a particular day or event. Encourage them to talk about other things and get their mind off the subject for a while.

, Your parents may start confusing your role as a child with a psychologist or attorney. Let them make their own decisions. Offer advice and even suggest professional help but try not to preach or become too involved.

, This could be volunteer work or social activities; anything to keep them busy and prevent loneliness.


Help them find hobbies and activities that involve other older adults with similar interests.
Encourage them to explore interests they never tried when they were married.

, Just because you're an adult, doesn't mean you won't feel emotional about this. When your parents break up, memories of the family years together are automatically brought to the fore and it will be hard to face the fact that your parents are no longer together. Take the time to grieve and to process this information as best you can. After all, this is the end of your childhood world, and the loss doesn't go away easily.

File legal papers.",How to Choose Between Civil Annulment and Divorce," Both civil annulments and divorces are formal legal proceedings that must be filed with, and granted by, a court with jurisdiction over your case. To have jurisdiction to file for civil annulment or divorce in a particular state, you must meet their legal residency requirements. Most states, for example Delaware, require that you live in the state for at least 6 months immediately preceding the filing of divorce or annulment.However, some states do not have a residency requirement for annulments. For example, in Nevada, you can file for an annulment so long as you were married in Nevada. Neither person needs to be a resident. On the other hand, to get a divorce in Nevada, you or your partner need to be a resident.;
, If you meet your state's residency requirement for either a divorce or civil annulment, the next consideration is whether you have a valid marriage at all. In most states, marriages that take place under certain circumstances are not recognized at all. For example, in California and Massachusetts, a marriage is automatically ""void"" if it took place between two close relatives (e.g., brothers/sisters), or if the marriage took place when one of the partners was already married to someone else.If you have a ""void"" marriage, you are usually not required to file for annulment because your marriage was never properly entered into. However, to be on the safe side, a lot of states will recommend that you file for annulment regardless.Doing so will help ensure that the marriage is never recognized as valid on accident.

, If your marriage with your partner is not void, you and your partner will next need to consider whether your marriage is ""voidable"". A voidable marriage is one that qualifies for annulment. However, unlike a void marriage, a voidable marriage is not invalidated until the court declares it so. Therefore, in order to get out of a voidable marriage, you must file a petition with the court. In general, voidable marriages occur when:One spouse lacks the mental capacity to marry (e.g., one spouse is not of legal age to marry)
One spouse is impotent (e.g., one spouse is physically unable to have sex)
There is fraud involved (i.e., one spouse entered into the marriage to avoid deportation when the other spouse did not know about it)
One spouse is under the influence of drugs or alcohol during the ceremony, and it impaired their ability to consent

, If your marriage is neither void nor voidable, you will usually not be able to get a civil annulment. If this is the case, you and your partner will have to get a divorce. In order to get a divorce in most states, you will have to have a valid reason for doing so. Valid reasons usually include irreconcilable differences, abuse, adultery, impotence, nonsupport, desertion, and going to prison.If you have a valid reason to ask for a divorce, you will have to file a petition in court and have the court grant your divorce.

, If you believe an annulment is the right choice for you and your partner, you will have to file your annulment petition within a certain period of time. If this time period has passed, you will no longer be able to file for annulment. At that point, divorce may be your only choice. If divorce is the best option for you and your partner, you will not have to worry about time limits. You can ask for a divorce at any time because there is no deadline. Examples of annulment time limits include:Four years after reaching the age of 18 if you were married while under the age of 18
Within four years of discovering the fraud that led to a voidable marriage

, Divorces and annulments can be contested or uncontested. If you and your partner choose to go down a certain path together, your petition will usually be uncontested. When a divorce or annulment is uncontested, you and your partner will file a joint petition, or one partner will agree to not file an answer. Either way, the petition will lay out whether you want an annulment or divorce, why your request should be granted, and how the legal separation will take place.


If you and your partner can not choose a path together, you will have to ask the court for an annulment or divorce on your own. In this scenario, you will choose what you believe is the best option and petition the court by yourself. Your partner will likely file an answer asking the court to do something else. At that point, it will be up to the court to decide which option is best suited to your situation., Civil annulments and divorces are granted for very different reasons. Before you talk with your partner and determine which route to take, you need to think about the source of your relationship problems. For example, civil annulments are usually only available when your marriage was in some way invalid to begin with. This could be the case because you or your partner entered into the marriage fraudulently, or because you or your partner are already married to someone else. On the other hand, divorces are available when a marriage is valid but you or your partner do not want to continue the legal relationship. Your reasons for wanting a divorce might include infidelity, abuse, or desertion, to name a few.Think about the reasons for wanting to go to court before you sit down with your partner. Write down your thoughts so you can remember them later. For example, if you look back at your relationship and determine your partner is actually your brother or sister, a civil annulment might be the bet route. However, if you look back at your relationship and determine you and your partner are simply incompatible, you might want to seek a divorce.

, The financial consequences stemming from divorce and annulment are very different and need to be considered before you talk with your partner. If you need financial support from your partner even after the relationship is legally ended, you need to ask for a divorce. When a court validates a marriage and ends it (i.e., grants a divorce), the court can use certain laws to require ex-spouses to support you financially. These laws generally include spousal support (a.k.a., alimony) and property distribution.


When you ask the court to grant an annulment, marriage and divorce laws generally do not apply. Therefore, if an annulment is granted, you will not be able to ask for financial support from your ex-partner, because it will be as if no legal relationship ever existed., After you consider your reasons for wanting to end a relationship with your partner, take some time to brainstorm how you want a talk with your partner to go. Be prepared to take charge and lead the discussion. Doing so will allow you to discuss what you consider to be important. To prepare for a talk, write out a list of questions you want your partner to answer. Some good questions might touch on the following:


Your partner's feelings about not being together
The financial support you or your partner may be willing to provide the other
What choice your partner prefers (e.g., divorce or annulment)

, When you feel prepared, ask your partner if they have time to discuss your future. Do not get into details at this point but simply tell them you want to have a serious discussion. Be honest with your partner, however, so they have time to prepare as well. For example, consider telling your partner, ""I would like to sit down and discuss options for ending our marriage. I would like this to be a mutual decision so do you have some time to talk?"" The more prepared both parties are, the better the conversation will be. When you schedule a time to talk, make sure you do it in person. Choosing to annul a marriage or divorce is a serious decision to make and you do not want to do it over the phone or through an email.


However, if you are afraid of how your partner might respond during your talk, think about meeting at a public place or having the discussion over the phone. You do not want to jeopardize your safety.

, When you sit down with your partner, be respectful but confident. Take control of the conversation and be honest. If your partner is doing something in the relationship that has caused you to consider ending it, let them know. Tell them how you feel. For example, if your partner is physically unable to have sex, which is a valid ground for an annulment in some states, tell your partner how this makes you feel.You might say, ""I am sexually frustrated and was not aware when we got married that you would not be able to have sex.""


While these conversations may be tough to have, they will lead to an honest discussion and may even help you and your partner avoid the choice between civil annulment and divorce altogether. For example, once your partner knows about your sexual frustration, they might open up about the source of their issue. This might lead to you and your partner working to fix the issue as opposed to ending a marriage.

, When you talk with your partner about annulment and divorce, do not blame them for the situation you are in and do not get angry. When anger becomes a part of the conversation, it leads to irrational discussions that lead nowhere. If you feel as though you are getting angry during the talk with your partner, tell them you need a second to step away. Go for a walk or take a moment for yourself and come back when you are ready to continue.


Just like anger, blaming your partner for everything will not allow for an honest and open discussion. When you blame your partner for something, they get defensive and react emotionally. Keep the conversation factual and calculated.
If you feel the conversation starting to go downhill, tell your partner that you will have to finish the conversation another time.

, The initial conversation between you and your partner does not have to resolve every issue you both have. This initial talk is supposed to allow you and your partner to open up and discuss options for ending the marriage. Use this first discussion to make a choice about annulment or divorce. Once a choice is made, set up another time to talk about specifics.


For example, focus your first talk around what an annulment is, what a divorce is, and what the best choice between them is given your factual situation. Discuss how your marriage was entered into and whether it may have led to a marriage that is void or voidable. Talk about your reasons for wanting to end the marriage and whether your state will allow a divorce for those reasons.

, Use what you learned while evaluating your choices, both alone and with your partner, and come up with an informed decision. If you qualify for annulment and you and your partner think that would be the best choice, file for annulment. If you do not qualify for annulment, or if you think getting a divorce will offer more benefits than an annulment, then you will need to file for divorce.


Remember to try and file a joint, uncontested petition whenever possible. Doing so will make finalizing your arrangements with the court much easier. However, in some circumstances, a contested petition for divorce or annulment may be the only option. This usually happens when one partner disagrees with the choice made between getting an annulment or divorce.

, After you talk with your partner, you will have a pretty good idea of whether you want to ask for an annulment or divorce. Regardless of that choice, and regardless of whether the choice was made independently or as a couple, it is always a good idea to hire a lawyer. A family law lawyer will help you through the legal process of filing for divorce or annulment. In addition, a lawyer will counsel you on whether your choice was a realistic one.


For example, you and your partner might decide that an annulment would be best, but a lawyer might be able to tell you that an annulment will not be possible in your situation.

, To find a qualified lawyer, start by asking friends and family if they know anyone. Chances are, at least one person you know will have someone in mind. Even if those close to you do not know a family law lawyer, ask if they know any lawyers in general. Chances are, even if you contact a criminal defense lawyer, they will know a family law lawyer to refer you to. Lawyers rely heavily on these recommendations and referrals. They can be a great way to find well-qualified representation.

, If you cannot get any good referrals or recommendations from people you know, visit your state bar's lawyer referral service website. After answering a few general questions about your legal concerns, you will be put in touch with various lawyers in your area.

, Once you have a list of three to five qualified lawyers, contact them and set up initial consultations. During an initial consultation, you will have an opportunity to discuss your case with the lawyer to determine if the lawyer will be a good fit. On the other side, the lawyer will be able to assess the strength of your case and determine whether they want to represent you. When you attend an initial consultation, bring all the paperwork you have regarding your marriage and the circumstances surrounding it. This might include a marriage license, birth certificates, videos, letters, and anything else you think might help.


Once you arrive for your meeting, answer the lawyer's questions about your case. During this period, assess the lawyer's understanding of your situation and whether you think they can help.
Do not be afraid to ask questions back. In addition to asking questions about your case, you should also ask about the lawyer's professional background, history of legal troubles, and ability to practice law where you need them to practice.
Initial consultations can be free or the lawyer can charge you for them. Check with the lawyer's office prior to the meeting to determine if the lawyer will charge.

, Before you leave the initial consultation, make sure you talk with the lawyer about their fee structure. Most divorce lawyers, who will also handle annulments, charge by the hour. In an hourly fee structure, your lawyer will charge you for the amount of time they work on the case, usually in fifteen minute increments. The average hourly rate for a divorce lawyer is around $250. A lawyer's fee may go up or down depending on the complexity and amount of work you require.In some circumstances, a lawyer might charge you a flat fee for doing some divorce or annulment work. For example, some lawyers may charge a flat fee of $2,000 to file a joint petition for annulment.
In other circumstances, a lawyer might accept property in lieu of cash. If you do not have enough cash to pay your lawyer, they may take real estate, cars, or even paintings, in order to recoup the expense.

, Once you have interviewed possible lawyers and compared their strengths and weaknesses, you will need to make a decision. Call the lawyer you are most comfortable with and let them know you would like them to represent you. Before the lawyer starts working for you, make sure you sign a representation agreement, which will set out the type of work the lawyer will do and how much the lawyer will charge.

, Once the lawyer starts working for you, they will assess your choice between a civil annulment and divorce and work to accomplish your goals. If you want to Get a Civil Annulment, your lawyer will assess whether you qualify and will file the proper paperwork. If you want to Begin a Divorce, your lawyer will help you choose the best path and will help you file the proper paperwork.

Flip through your old photos.,
Initiate frequent physical contact.,
Go out on a date.,
Learn to do something new together.,
Spend time alone together.",How to Avoid Harboring Negative Thoughts About Your Husband2," Pull out your albums and look through them. Focus on the emotions captured in the photos. Connect these emotions back to the choices made by you or your husband. You will find that your photos often depict positive moments that you created with your spouse.


For example, your wedding photos might remind you of how happy you were before the ceremony. Or, you might see a photo of you and your husband laughing as you drove away at the end of the night. Acknowledging the past can help you look forward to the future.

, If you are feeling negative, you may avoid being physically close to your husband. Try to reach out in small ways. Give him a quick hug or a small kiss on the cheek. Reach out and squeeze his hand. The goal is to get back to a state where you enjoy physical contact., It is tempting to get so caught up in day-to-day life that you rarely plan anything ‘special’ with your spouse. Rekindle the affection in your relationship by setting up a date night each week. Let those close to you know that this is your time to go out.Reserving the time and making it a priority is just as important as the date itself. Don’t worry too much about the details of what you will do. When you are out, try to focus on what you are enjoying about your husband and the date.

, Challenges help people bond and tackling a new task will help you once again view your husband as a partner. Enroll in a cooking class. Take a course on ballroom dancing. Study together at home in order to learn a new language. You are building positive memories with each action.Try to find an activity that interests you both and neither one of you have much experience doing. It is best if you both start off as beginners so you don’t fall into a teacher/student situation and instead work together as equals., Reserve at least 15 minutes each day for one-on-one interaction with your husband. Take a bubble bath together, listen to music, or just sit on the couch and talk. Some couples find it especially helpful to wind down each day by ‘pillow talking’ about what happened and what tomorrow looks like.Put away your electronic devices and silence your cell phone during these times. This will let you focus your attention on your husband and he will, hopefully, return the favor for you.

Identify stress in your life.,
Learn healthy ways to deal with stress.,
Ask for help when you need it.,
Eliminate stress when possible.,
Take an honest look at yourself.",How to Avoid Harboring Negative Thoughts About Your Husband3," If you are feeling stressed out in other areas of your life, it can be very easy to become irritable and take this out on your partner. Taking some time to check in with yourself and evaluate your stress levels and the source of your stress (which may or may not have to do with your husband) can help you have more positive interactions with your partner and you can take steps to change or deal with whatever is causing you stress. Stressors may be internal or external. Some things that may be causing you stress include:


Major life changes (change of job, moving, pregnancy, death of a loved one)
Workplace stress (an overly demanding job, upcoming deadlines, a difficult boss or coworkers, a toxic work environment)
Social stress (issues with friends or not having social support)
Fears, insecurities, or feelings of uncertainty or lack of control
Lack of balance (having too much on your plate, doing a disproportionate amount of the housework)

, There are many constructive ways to manage and minimize stress one you have identified the cause. Exercise is one of the most effective ways to deal with stress. It releases endorphins and boosts mood while improving your physical health. Try to incorporate 30 minutes of physical activity into your daily life (you can break it up into 10- or 20-minute segments to make it more convenient). Try dancing, taking the dog for a long walk, jogging, taking the stairs instead of an elevator, playing a game with your kids (like soccer), or taking an exercise class at the gym.Other ways to positively manage stress include:


Meditation
Yoga
Spending time with your friends/support network
Writing in a journal
Taking a bath

, You may find that you are stressed or feel resentful toward your husband because you feel like there is an uneven balance in your responsibilities. Learn to be assertive and respectfully ask for help when you need it.For instance, you might find that you have too much on your plate trying to work, pick up your kids from school and take them to their extracurricular activities, clean the house, and get dinner ready. Try saying to your husband: ""I have a lot going on right now and I could really use your help. Can you make dinner and clean up the kitchen tonight?""
Being assertive doesn't mean being mean or aggressive. It means recognizing what you need and want and asking for it, while respecting the other person. Be willing to compromise and have a calm discussion about how to better share responsibilities.

, One way to reduce stress in your life is to cut out things that cause you stress or to stop overextending yourself. Learning to say ""No"" to things when you have reached your limits for what you can take on can have a major impact on your stress levels. Look at your commitments and ask yourself what things you ""must"" do and wha things you feel you ""should"" do. Try to cut out some of the ""shoulds"" to avoid taking on too much.Consider if your environment is stressing you out. If the news is making you anxious and stressed, turn it off.
Try to avoid people who stress you out. If you have friends, acquaintances, co-workers, or family members who cause you to feel stressed, limit your time around them as much as possible, or end the relationship. If it's someone you can't complete avoid, minimize your interactions as much as possible. For instance, if you have an annoying coworker who stops by your desk, you can say, ""Excuse me, I need to use the bathroom,"" or ""I'm in the middle of a project, I can't talk right now.""

, You need to consider the true sources of your negative thoughts — are they really just about your husband or something/someone else? For example, do you have a tendency to view things in a negative light anyway? It might be helpful to consider exactly what you want out of marriage and out of your husband in particular.Write down a list of qualities that you require from your partner. Then, see how many of those traits you possess. For example, if you listed ""funny"" but you haven't been laughing lately, you may need to work to rediscover your own sense of humor.

Keep communication open with your partner.,
Ask questions.,
Say thank you.,
Confide in a trusted friend.,
Talk to a marriage counselor.",How to Avoid Harboring Negative Thoughts About Your Husband4," Even when you are experiencing negative thoughts, try to start up a conversation with your husband. Begin by discussing trivial matters like the day’s plans, etc. Keeping the conversation lines open will allow you to develop additional trust in your husband.


In addition to the small things, make sure that you talk about important matters such as finances. Being the sole financial planner in a relationship can foster resentment. To begin a conversation, you might say, “Tonight after dinner let’s talk about what our bills look like for the next month.”If you feel yourself about to say something negative and potentially harmful, count to five in your head. This will usually give you time to cool down.

, Misinterpretation and miscommunication is a problem in many marriages. It is possible that some of your negative feelings stem from communication errors between you and your husband. Make sure to ask what your husband means if you are unclear. Don’t just assume the worst.You might say, “I’m not sure what you mean. Explain it a bit more.” Ask how he feels and what he thinks about various scenarios. Tell him how you feel/what you think.

, Practice gratitude on a daily basis. Make a point to say “thank you” at least once a day to your husband. If you recognize his efforts, he will start to appreciate you more as well. Express gratitude for even the little moments. If he helps you find a book you were looking for, say “thank you.” , Go to someone you trust and who will keep private whatever you tell them. Explain your negative feelings, giving specific examples. Discuss possible solutions and ways to improve your situation. You may find that your situation is not all that unusual.


Try to be specific about the issues if you can. Instead of just saying, “We don’t get along,” you might explain, “We don’t go out and do things together like we used to.” Your friend might suggest more outings as a possible solution.

, Going to see a counselor by yourself or with your husband is a great option if you need a safe space to discuss your feelings or need an unbiased party to mediate discussions. Find a marriage counselor in your area by searching online for “marriage counseling.” Read online reviews to find the best fit for you.


Counseling is particularly helpful if you and your husband experienced a traumatic event. A counselor can help you move forward from the blaming process.

Prepare for a long process.,
Admit your shortcomings -- and work on them.,
Don't rush into a new relationship.,
Don't drag your kids into it.,
Avoid making big decisions right away.,
Find your own path to healing.",How to Cope With Divorce2," Once you've begun to heal, you can start to wrap your mind around the fact that it's going to take a long time to get over your ex. This isn't just an ordinary high school break up, or even the end of a relationship that lasted a few years. A marriage required a bigger commitment and likely left you with more baggage, whether it's deciding who should keep the house or deciding how the kids' visits should go.


The sooner you accept that you won't be able to get over the divorce in a matter of weeks, you'll be able to deal with it more quickly.

, Though you may blame your ex for the end of the marriage, it's likely that you weren't completely blameless in the process. There must have been at least a few occasions where you could have acted differently, and you must have a few character traits that you'd like to work on to ensure success in your future relationships.


Make a list of all of the qualities you'd like to change about yourself and make a game plan for addressing them. This will give you a positive way to occupy your time and will make you feel less anger about the end of the relationship.
Don't make yourself even more overwhelmed. Addressing your shortcomings doesn't mean feeling like you're an unworthy person full of negative qualities.

, Though you may think that rushing into a new relationship will help you take your mind off of your ex, it will actually make you feel worse to jump into a new relationship when you're not nearly over the old one. Dating someone new will make you constantly compare that person to your ex, and to use up a lot of emotional energy for dating the new person while also trying to deal with your failed relationship.


No only will rushing into a new relationship make it harder for you to get over the old one, but it will also cause pain for the other person you're trying to date.

, Though you may have strong feelings of regret or even hatred toward your ex after your divorce, but dragging your kids into it will only make things worse and will cause great pain and confusion for your children. Even if you and your ex are at each other's throats, you should keep the tension away from your kids and not let them see it, or they'll feel like they're caught in the middle and won't be able to enjoy their time with either you or your ex.Don't say anything negative about your ex to your kids. This will make them feel confused and hurt.
When you see your ex to drop the kids off, try as hard as you can to at least be cordial.
Kids will have an intuitive sense that things aren't going well between you and your ex already, so you should try as hard as you can to make things seem normal.

, You may have been thinking about going back to school, moving across the country, or quitting your job to pursue a new career already, but you should put the big decisions on hold for a little while until you feel a bit more stable. Wait at least a few months before making a major, life-altering decision to make sure that it isn't just the divorce talking.If you make a major life decision right after your divorce, then you may have to deal with too much adjustment at once. Wait until you feel a bit more level-headed about the divorce and then consider the other decision.

, When people hear that you're getting a divorce, your ears will immediately be filled with a flurry of well-intentioned advice, a lot of which will be useless or won't apply to you. You may be told to have a romantic fling, stop believing in love, try to move on immediately, or to try to stay so insanely busy that you won't have time to breathe. However, you'll have to find your own path instead of following all of the advice that you'll hear.Every relationship is different, and so is the end of any relationship -- therefore, you'll have to decide which advice is helpful and to find your own path to happiness.

Be attentive to your own needs.,
Develop a solid routine.,
Be healthy.,
Explore new interests.,
Change your environment.,
Avoid alcohol as a coping mechanism.,
Pamper yourself.",How to Cope With Divorce3," It's important to check in with yourself and to make sure that your mind and body are as reasonably healthy as they can be during this time of crisis. Though you may feel that all you can do is lie on the couch and cry, you should make sure to eat even when you aren't hungry, to get out of the house and take a walk when your body needs the exercise, and to look away from the television when your eyes need to rest.And if you're craving an ice cream sundae or if you're really longing for a night out with the girls but won't admit it, give in to that, too. Do what your mind and body are telling you to do instead of ignoring your true needs.
The sooner you start eating, sleeping, and doing the things your body and mind need regularly, the sooner you can get back to your normal life.

, Though you shouldn't pack your schedule so much that you can't even come up for air, you should make sure to keep yourself as busy and occupied as you can so that you don't have hours on end to think about your divorce. Once you're ready plug at least a few social occasions, workout routines, or times carved out for the things you loved into your schedule so that you have enough things to keep you on your feel and to give you something to look forward to.You should try to have at least one thing each day to look forward to, even if it's just a phone date with a close friend or some time to watch that old Katherine Hepburn movie that you haven't seen in a decade.
Setting goals can help you develop a routine. For example, if you want to run a 5K, then you'll have to fill a few hours a week with time for training.
Try to mix it up. Don't fall back into the routine you had when you were married, or you'll miss your own life even more.

, Though you don't have to go on a health kick right after your divorce, working on maintaining healthy life habits will help you start to feel mentally more stable and physically stronger. Work on eating three healthy and balanced meals a day, getting 7-8 hours of sleep at around the same time every night, and working out at least a few times a week.


Don't overdo it. Don't take your divorce as a reason to lose fifty pounds or being a health food nut. Just be healthy -- in moderation.
Exercising will make you feel more energized and positive.

, Use your divorce as the opportunity to try the things you never got to try when you were married. Maybe you always wanted to take an art class but never had the chance, or maybe you never had a chance to expand your cooking repertoire because you didn't have the time. Now, spend some time finding a love for Italian cuisine, pottery, or foreign films and enjoy the feeling of expanding your mind and body and finding new things to care about.Check out the classes at your local gym and take one that appeals to you. Don't be afraid if you're an absolute beginner -- you won't be alone.
Exploring a new interest will also expose you to a wider variety of interesting, engaged people.

, If you ended up staying in the home that you shared with your ex, then you may need a change of pace. Though it may not be financially or practically possible for you to move out of the house, but you can move things around so your ex's presence isn't haunting the place. Move your furniture around or buy new furniture, paint the walls, or even splurge on a new bed so you can slowly remove the presence of your ex.


If you want to take a little vacation, go for a weekend trip or a getaway across the country to visit a friend. Though taking a vacation won't be a permanent solution for your divorce, it can help take your mind off of things.
You can also change your environment by avoiding the bars, restaurants, or old haunts where you and your ex used to hang out.

, Though you may think that drinking will relieve your pain and make it easier to deal with your divorce, it'll actually make your troubles harder and will bring you more physical and emotional pain. Though it may be fun to forget your divorce for a few hours and let loose, don't drink so much that you don't know where you are, lose control, and end up embarrassing yourself and hurting others in the process.


If you want to take it easy on drinking for a while, let your friends know. This will make it harder for them to pressure you to have a crazy night.

, You're going through a hard time and deserve to be spoiled once in a while. Spend a day at the spa, get a massage, or take a relaxing hot bath and watch your stress levels go down. You can even splurge on an expensive haircut, manicure, or a new outfit that makes you feel amazing.


This isn't the time to be hard on yourself or to punish yourself -- instead, let your body feel relaxed and cared for.

Have a time frame in mind.",How to Ask for a Trial Separation," You don't want to blindside the person out of nowhere. Alerting your spouse that you want to have a discussion can help him or her mentally prepare for what's ahead, even if they're not aware of exactly what you're going to say.You could say, ""I'd like to discuss where our relationship is headed. Can we sit down and talk about it soon?""
That helps clue your partner into the fact that something's up.
Also, pick a good time to sit down in person. This conversation isn't one you want to have over email or the phone. This conversation needs to happen in person, when your spouse has the time and emotional space to deal with it. You don't want to be distracted by other things. It might be a good idea to have someone babysit for you if you have kids. While you don't want to put it off, timing is everything. For instance, if your spouse's parent died last week, you may want to wait a little while.;
, You may want to circle around the topic, but it's best to just get it over with, though you can be gentle about it. In addition, you need to take responsibility for why you want this separation. That is, you need to tell your partner why you feel the need to separate.Lead with what you want the discussion to be about. You could say, ""I don't think we've been in the same place lately, and I feel us growing apart. I'd like to discuss the possibility of a trial separation.""
Don't be afraid to talk about what you're feeling. ""I am afraid that if we go on like this we will fight and argue our way to divorce, and I hope that spending some time apart will help us see what our options are without ruining each other in the process.""

, Now that you've broached the topic, you need to let your spouse know what you expect to happen from the separation. Though it can hurt, being in the same page is important because it helps to guide your expectations through the separation.For instance, if you think the separation is a stepping stone to a divorce, you could say, ""Right now, I'm really just trying to figure out what I want. However, if things don't change between us, I could see this leading to a more permanent separation.""
On the other hand, if you want the separation as a time to think with the hopes of reconciliation, you might say, ""I know asking for a separation is hurtful to you. However, I don't think things have been right between us for a while, and I think we need some time apart to figure out how to move forward in our relationship. I really do want to work it out, though, and hopefully get back together after our time apart.""

, This conversation may come as a hard blow, even if your spouse realizes you've been having problems as a couple. Let your spouse have a chance to react, as his or her first reaction is probably going to be emotional. Give your spouse a chance to talk through it before you start trying to evaluate whether it's a good option for your both.Once your spouse has gotten over the initial shock, start asking questions to determine what your spouse is feeling and thinking, such as, ""So what do you think? Do you think it's a good idea?""
It may be that your spouse is on the same page, thinking time apart would do you good, but your partner may not want that all.

, That is, you both have things you'll need from each other to make your marriage work. If you've done you're homework, you already have some ideas of what you need from your partner, but your partner will also have some for you.Remember, these goals need to be concrete and specific. For instance, ""Be less distant"" is not concrete enough. ""Check in with me at least 2 times a day"" is more specific.
Be open to hearing what your partner needs, as well. Each of you should have 3 to 4 goals for the other person.
Agree that both of you will work on the goals without resorting to looking over the other person's shoulder. That is, you can't blame not achieving your goals on the other person not achieving theirs.

, Once you've had the conversation about the separation, you need to have another about the rules of the separation. You need to decide whether you're going to live apart, how the bills are going to get paid, and who's going to do what with the kids.You should also discuss whether dating is allowed and how far you can go on a date. For instance, if you expect to get back together, you may decide to rule out dating or sex.
These rules will need to be very specific. For instance, if you're talking about who gets to spend what time with the kids, you need to lay out what days and nights of the week the kids will spend with each party.
Remember that the ground rules you set for a separation may affect what happens if you get a divorce, such as custody arrangements. For instance, if your kids are mostly living with one parent or the other, that parent may be granted primary custody. Talk to a lawyer to make sure that your ground rules are fair to both of you and your kids.
You may need some help laying out these ground rules. If you expect to get back together, you're going to both need to compromise on the rules. Also, put your rules in writing. Doing so can make sure everyone is on the same page., Together, set a time limit for your separation. It could be 3 months, half a year, or a full year. After you've set a limit on how long your separation will be, you can decide to let it go for longer. However, you don't want to keep dragging it out. If you keep asking for more time over and over, it may be that it's just time to end the marriage. If neither of you are willing to fight for the relationship anymore, it may not be worth it., If you're having enough trouble to want a separation, a third party mediator, such as a therapist can help. A therapist will help you to discuss your problems without getting so heated and hopefully work on finding common ground. A therapist will expect both of you to be emotionally present, working hard to put your relationship first.Ask around for recommendations for a couple's therapist from friends you trust. More than likely, some of your friends have had problems, too, and may have seen someone who's good for you and your spouse, too.
A therapist can be objective about your relationship, whereas it's harder for the two of you to be objective about something that you are both so emotionally invested in. Therefore, suggest to your partner that you consider going to a therapist.
Another option for a mediator is a pastor.
You could say, ""Given all I've said about a separation, I think it's important that we talk to a mediator. I was thinking we could talk to a couple's therapist once a week to see if they can help us sort out some of our problems. I really want to make this work, but I do think we could use some outside help.""

, A lawyer is also important when you're separating. Once again, it's good to ask your friends who've been through a divorce if they have any recommendations for lawyers. A lawyer will go over the legal ramifications of your separation so you know what to expect if you do get a divorce. In addition, your lawyer can act as a mediator for you if you need one.You can also look up reviews of lawyers online to find one that most people have been happy with. Meet with the lawyer before deciding to engage him or her as your personal lawyer. Ask the lawyer if they're willing to act as a mediator if you need it and how often they've worked with people on a trial separation. Plus, you want to make sure you connect with your lawyer and trust him or her as a person.
As noted in the step about laying out ground rules, it's important to remember that what you do in your separation can affect your divorce. What you decide about who takes care of the kids now, for instance, can be used to decide who gets custody of your kids.

, If you have a trial separation without spending any time talking, you won't be able to work through your problems. If you really want to get back together, you're going to need to spend time talking through your problems, preferably with a third party.For instance, you could try talking on the phone twice a week. Consider addressing specific issues each time you talk. Talking on the phone cuts out some of the emotional charge in the situation. If you're really emotional, you may want to start with emails and the move up to phone calls.
If you've engaged a therapist or you're visiting with a pastor, that can be one way you can continue to connect with each other.

, Of course, telling your close friends and family that you've separated is appropriate. However, now isn't the time to post a huge announcement on social media. You are trying to decide if things will work out, and having the whole world (or at least all your friends, including the person you never liked from high school) weigh in isn't going to help. What happens going forward should be between you and your spouse, and possibly a good therapist., You're obviously feeling like something is wrong with the relationship. However, you need to be able to put your finger on why, not just put it in general terms. That needs you need to spend some time thinking about what you think has gone wrong with the relationship.Some areas you can think about are whether you still have fun together and laugh and whether you still have similar goals. Sex is also an area that can cause problems.
Another area you can look at is the way you communicate. Has communication broken down in your marriage? Can you identify where it started breaking it down?
Also, consider the ways you care for each other. Happy couples enjoy doing things for each other. If you find you are doing all the work in the relationship, both the emotional work and the physical work of living together, that could a large part of the problem--your spouse isn't holding up her or his end of the marriage.

, That is, you have figured out why you're unhappy. To be fair to your spouse, you need to be able to lay out in exact terms what's not working for you. The best way to do that, once you figure out what's wrong, is to give concrete goals and ask for the same in return.For instance, maybe you're unhappy because you don't feel like your spouse pays attention to you anymore.
A concrete goal would be to spend alone time together at least twice a week.
Come up with 3 to 4 concrete goals that you can discuss with your spouse., That is, are you almost certain you will get a divorce after the separation? That's something you need to be up front about. However, if you really want a separation to help you decide if you still want to be in the relationship, it's okay to bring that to the table, too., In many cases, couples who have a trial separation set a certain time frame. When that time frame is up, the couple either decides to get back together or to divorce. One therapist recommends 3 months as a good time frame, but you should have a time frame in mind when you talk to your spouse, along with a good justification for that amount of time.For instance, you might feel like half a year is better to figure out your feelings.
Alternatively, you may want to separate for 3 months to give your spouse a chance to go through rehab. If they don't, you may choose to divorce at the end of that period.
Of course, you can reevaluate after the time period. If you're both still unsure, you can agree to another length of time.

Listen to your partner.,
Stay positive.Your spouse fell in love with a happy and emotionally balanced person.,
Be flexible.,
Keep up appearances.,
Practice healthy communication.,
Balance your time.,
Stay loyal to your spouse.",How to Avoid Getting a Divorce1," Open and honest communication is crucial for a good marriage. Listen patiently when your partner comes to you with problems or concerns about your relationship. Being attentive in conversation will help you understand what makes them unhappy and give you a chance to take action. If you have questions about what you can do to make your partner happier and more satisfied, you should feel free to ask them.
Expect your partner to listen to you with an equal amount of respect.
If your partner is verbally abusive, belittling, or refuses to engage in conversation, let them know how their behavior makes you feel – hopeless, alone, and dejected.;
, If you have become exhausted by conflict in the relationship or no longer feel your marriage is salvageable, take a step back. It’s natural to feel down about conflicts in your relationship, but try to focus on the big picture. When you feel depressed about the state of your relationship, think back on all the good times you’ve had with your spouse.


Your happiness should not be dependent on the other person. Focus on being the best you can be, even if your partner is not.
If you expect the worst from your partner, you’re more likely to see and focus on your conflicts and problems.Try to be attentive to subtle, positive changes in how you and your partner interact. Share these positive changes with your partner.

, Don’t demand that everything be done your way. Marriage is a cooperative partnership. Neither of you will get your way all the time. If you and your partner have different goals and ideas -- whether its about where to move or where to dine -- hear each other out.


Have conversations, not monologues. Listen to your partner and expect that he or she will listen to you.Let certain things go. Imagine that you wanted chicken but she made soup, or you wanted to see a play but he insists on going to the ball game. In either case, and with either decision, life goes on. Pick your battles and let the trivial stuff go.
Being flexible doesn’t mean your spouse should walk all over you. There are times when the decision not to make concessions is the right one.

, While physical attraction is only one part of love, in our visual culture, it plays an important role in how we think about and relate to our partner. When you go out with your spouse, dress nicely to show that you consider your time together special. Take care of your health, too. Eat a nutritious, balanced diet with lots of fruit and vegetables. Aim for thirty minutes of exercise each day. Dressing well and taking care of your appearance will keep your partner attracted to you., Only speak to your partner when you are in a mood and state appropriate to do so. Do not yell at your spouse. If you feel anger building on your side or your spouse’s, suggest that you both take some time out to cool off and resume the conversation later.Avoid trigger topics, the issues and problems which lead you and your spouse to bicker.
Communicate only while sober and rested.

, Healthy couples should spend time together as well as apart.Catch a movie, play mini-golf, go bowling – whatever it is you both enjoy doing, do it together. Try new things and have adventures that you can bond over. But when you need some alone time to recharge, let your partner know. You and your partner are not clones, and won’t be interested in all the same activities. Give each other space to pursue the hobbies and interests you each enjoy.Try to set aside specific days or time periods for date nights.
In addition to spending time alone, spend time with your friends.

, It might seem tempting to have a brief fling or an extended affair with someone who gives you the attention and affection that your spouse won’t.But remember, your spouse, not your fling, is your family. Violating the bond of marriage can propel you toward divorce and leave you feeling guilty.


Identify situations or individuals you know may lead you to infidelity and avoid them wherever possible.

Try to offer constructive listening space in which he can bounce off thoughts without being criticized by you. Feel free to give advice if he asks but don't be hurt if he doesn't take it. It's the non-judgmental listening that counts most. Let him talk until he’s said everything he wants to say instead of interrupting him with questions or opinions. Right now, the thing he may need the most is a listening ear.


Hold back your judgment as much as you can. Maybe he didn’t act admirably during the marriage, or maybe his ex-wife got off-track. You’re not there to make him feel worse about his behavior or to say bad things about his ex-wife. That will only make him feel worse about the whole experience.;
, Men are very vulnerable after they go through a divorce, and may feel very isolated, disappointed, and unhappy with themselves. Be prepared for the man to feel very vulnerable and open to being hurt, and understand that he needs you to be kind, loving, and sensitive. However, you shouldn’t take advantage of that vulnerability by trying to solve his problems by telling him how much you love him; focus on helping him heal as an individual before you start a relationship.


If the man is vulnerable, it may mean he’s not open to jokes about his divorce, or even just gentle teasing about any old thing. He may be questioning himself a lot and may not get that you’re being sarcastic or that you don’t really mean what you say.

, Let’s face it. You may be dying to know all of the gory details of the man’s divorce, especially if you’re dating him or thinking about him romantically. However, he may not be ready to reveal a whole lot to you, or to talk about all the pain he felt. Once your relationship deepens, he’ll owe it to you to let you know what happened, what financial issues he faces, what his relationship with his ex is like, and so on, but if you just want to help him get over the divorce, then you should let him do the talking.


Prying too much can lead him to open up wounds that haven’t healed yet. He may tell you something he doesn’t really want to talk about just to be nice, and that will end making him feel worse. Don’t worry so much about satisfying your curiosity just yet.

, One thing you can do to help a man get over the divorce is to try to do something completely new and different with him. He’s more likely to be thinking of his past if he’s going to the same bars and restaurants he frequented with his ex, running around the same old lake, or watching the same TV shows he and his ex used to love. If you want him to get over his divorce, then you should do new things together, from going hiking to learning how to make enchiladas. Though distracting him won’t be a good long-term solution, giving him something new and exciting to be passionate about can make him feel like he’s moving forward.


Ask him what he’s always wanted to do but never had a chance to do. It could be going snowboarding, cooking a steak, or writing a novel. Encourage him to try something new and even support him when he does it. He’ll slowly feel his focus shifting to something he really cares about and will become more focused on the present and future than the past.
He may be so upset about the divorce that he really won’t want to go out of the house or try new things, so you can encourage him to try new things without pushing him too much. If he’s really not ready to go rock climbing, then you may need to back away.

, You may think you’ve found the one and feel like you want to hold hands in public, introduce him to your fifty closest friends, tell your parents about him, and get him to go on a weekend trip to Tahoe with you the first chance he gets. However, he may not want to make that kind of a public commitment to you until he’s ready. Don’t rush him, or you may be putting the relationship in jeopardy or making him do something he’s not ready for. If you really want to make it work, then be respectful of of the fact that he needs more time than you may need.


If you’re constantly complaining about why he hasn’t met all of your friends or kissed you in public or even said “I love you,” then it’s not going to speed up the process. Putting pressure on him to do something he’s not ready for will only make it harder for your relationship to develop naturally.
Of course, the things you’re asking for, like a bit of PDA and some more signs of commitment, are perfectly natural. However, because you’re dealing with a man with a heavy past, it’s going to take longer for these things to happen. That’s what you signed up for.

, If you’ve been with the man for a few months and still feel like he’s extremely sad, vulnerable, and emotional when it comes to his divorce, then it may not be the time to pursue a serious relationship with him. You may be on different pages, and you may want him to fully commit to you while he’s not ready. If you really care for him, then you have to make sure that he’s really ready for a commitment to you, or that you’re okay with having a very lighthearted relationship with a man who is figuring things out. If you can’t spend half an hour with him without the marriage coming up, him getting sad, or getting in a fight about why you can’t meet his kids, then this may not be the time to start the relationship.


If you really think you have serious potential with the man but it’s not in the cards right now, then it may be best to see if you can pick things back up later instead of ruining what you have now when he’s really not ready for it.

, The man may need more time than the average man to do some of the usual boyfriend-like things with you, such as meeting your friends, showing affection publicly, being in a relationship on Facebook, or going on vacation with you. While you may want to bring him to your work functions, family vacations, or just a party at one of your friend’s houses, he may not be ready for that level of commitment yet. This doesn’t mean that he doesn’t care for you, but that he wants to take things slow.


If you’re constantly asking him to come to things with you, then he may oblige you, but his heart won’t be in it. Wait for him to suggest that he’d like to meet your friends, colleagues, or family.

, Don’t be mad or hurt if the man isn’t ready to introduce you to his friends or family. Remember that they were there during the worst and best of his former relationship and that they’ll need some time to get used to the idea of your relationship. If he has children, don’t ever ask to meet them until he’s ready to introduce you to them. Remember that he doesn’t want to confuse them about who you are or make them feel like his personal life is always changing. Wait until he’s ready to take these steps with you.


Don’t get angry with him if he doesn’t invite you to family Thanksgiving, have you meet his buddies at happy hour, or introduce you to his younger sister quite yet. If he hasn’t chosen to do this yet, then he must have a good reason for doing so. Of course, this can’t go on forever, but you should wait until he feels fully over the divorce before you can take these steps with him.
If his ex-wife and children are in his life, try to develop a relationship with them. Be friendly to the ex-wife and be helpful and kind to the children, if they are ready to accept you. Approach them slowly at first and wait for your relationship to grow. If you’re serious about the man, then you have to try to integrate into his life, when he’s ready for it, without pushing too far.

, His wife may have been anything that was too much for him, from being too involved in everything to being too boring. Either way, make sure you two are an equal balance. You should complement each other like peanut butter and jelly. If he's boring, show him fun, take him out, and introduce him to the hobbies you like. If he's too exciting and is out too often, calm him. Get him to stay in with you a couple of evenings, take him to a movie, and show him that you can have fun inside as well as outside. Be great for each other.

, There are things to overcome in every relationship. Outside influences can create problems. The main influences, if any, would be family and friends. They could place a wedge between you and your partner. Partners often want to respect their family's opinions, so you should as well. When he sees how respectful you are, he will eventually put them in their place. The important thing is that you two sit down and agree to overcome any obstacle that may be thrown your way. There will be many. Keep a positive mind for one another and you will prevail.


There will be obstacles in any relationship you’re serious about. Though the divorce will present an extra set of challenges, the important thing is that you tackle them together.

, Maybe you have some skeletons in the closet. His ex-wife may have cheated on him and now he has trust issues. This now places you in a position to be afraid to be honest about your past relationships, and how you were the heart-breaking cheater once. It's perfectly fine to be honest. The best way to gain trust is to tell the truth. Letting him in on your old dishonest ways assures him that you are ready to make a change and start over fresh in the relationship you're in. Just be honest, one-hundred percent.

, Show the man some love. Look him in the eyes when you converse. It shows honesty and respect. Hold his hand in public, when he’s ready, to let the world know you're happy to be with him. This will give reassurance and boost his confidence in all aspects. Compliment him every so often to let him know that you like everything about the person you're with. Re-establish the man he was before the divorce. Give him back the joy and happiness you feel that he deserves to have. Love him unconditionally.


His confidence may not be at an all-time high after the divorce. You can help him feel good about himself again.

, Keep him on his toes. Men like surprises. They like to know that you put forth effort to show your love. If you're not a ""dress up"" type of woman, take him out to do something fun. If he's a busy man, then you have to put in a little more time when you’re with him. Put your phone away, get a babysitter so you can have a date night, or a quiet night relaxing. Random massages, baths, cards, gifts, or anything that makes him feel special can keep the relationship going strong. It’s important to keep any relationship feeling fun and fresh.


Even when you feel settled and completely sure that he’s over his divorce, you should continue to do new things together while also deepening your love for shared hobbies.

, While it may be tempting to Google his ex-wife or to Facebook stalk her, in the long run, this will only bring you more pain and lead you to feel insecure about your relationship. You may think you want to know what she looks like, what she does for a living, or where she went to high school, college, or pre-school, knowing these details will only make you feel worse instead of satisfying your curiosity. If there’s anything you really need to know about his ex-wife, he will tell you, and becoming obsessed with her will only make you feel worse, like you can’t compete.


If you really try to stalk her, you may even stumble across photos of your man and his ex-wife together, and that is guaranteed to make you feel worse.

, You may think that making fun of his ex-wife or calling her names will somehow make the man get over her faster and will make you look better. Unfortunately, the opposite is actually true; talking negatively about his ex-wife will only make you look insecure, and will weaken your relationship, because he may get defensive and actually get on his ex-wife’s side. While he may call her names, you don’t have the right to do that, and you should steer away from judging someone you don’t really know.


If he’s mad about something his ex-wife did, you can agree that it was disrespectful, but you should never call her names or curse her out.

, For better or worse, you and his ex-wife are not on the same playing field. He may have loved her, and he may love you, but he hopefully wants to keep the relationship feeling separate. If you compare yourself to her and ask him if she acted like you, if she looked like you, or even — God forbid — what she was like in bed, then he’s only going to get upset, angry, or annoyed. If you want him to get over the relationship, then you should treat your relationship with him as a fresh start, not as a better version of his marriage.


Plus, if you start comparing yourself to his ex-wife, it may scare him off, because then he’ll start thinking of your relationship in more serious terms. He may not be ready for that, and even comparing your relationship to his marriage can set off warning bells in his head.

, You want the man to be beyond 100% over his first marriage before you even say the “M-word.” This can take many, many years, unfortunately, and you may have to prepare to wait for that. If you bring up marriage too soon, talk about wanting to have kids, or asking him to move in with you before he’s ready, then you’re going to doom the relationship. Of course, if you’ve been together for several years and he shows no sign of getting over his divorce or moving forward with you, then you may need to cut your losses, but if you’ve only been dating for a year or a little while, then you may have to be patient.


When you do bring it up, make sure you do it thoughtfully. You don’t want to catch him off guard and make it feel completely unexpected.

, Be careful about never getting to the point of pushing him to cut off his ex, especially where there are children involved. He needs to remain in touch to run the partnership of responsibility he and his ex still have for their children. And it isn't for you to make the decision about the finality of who he does and does not interact with. If you have suspicions about anything, now is the time to find out or to leave, before you're too seriously into him.


You don’t want to come off as controlling or he’ll feel smothered. If you’re secure in relationship, then you won’t care about him seeing his ex to settle routine matters. As for his kids, if you can’t accept that they’re a part of his life, then you’re not ready for the relationship.
Avoid insisting that he do this, that and the other about his ex. He knows what he needs to do. All you have a place in saying is how any of his matters with his ex impact you personally; in that case, express it totally in how you are impacted and what you are worried about in terms of yourself. Being honest will help him to see your real worries, rather than assuming you're trying to put a wedge between him and his ex.

Seek a support group.,
Spend time alone.,
Retrospect and reflect.,
Take your time.,
Build your self-esteem.,
Understand where your fear is stemming from.,
Focus on communication.,
Have fun!,
Acknowledge that forever may not be the case, but self-discovery can be.",How to Face the Fear of Rejection After a Divorce," If you have the opportunity to connect with others who are experiencing the same things, you will find a valuable tool to help you maintain grounding while exploring the dating world again. While a support group may not be for everyone, many have found them to provide security and comfort that helps boost their confidence as individuals and as a group.;
, Spending time alone allows you the ability to be comfortable with yourself. When you take the time to become content with your own company, you will be less likely to rely heavily on another person. You can learn to be alone, but not lonely, and to bring a sense of stability into a new relationship. Spending time alone allows you learn to value your own individuality and this results in being less needy of another individual.

, Divorce can be grueling and painful. Sometimes, it is easy to put all the blame on one person, either yourself or your ex. However, most of the time the painful truth is that both people contributed to the relationship in both positive and negative ways. In the unfortunate case of being abused in different ways by an ex, you may be able to consider how you can learn to rebuild some of what may have been damaged. If you have been an abuser, there is hope. Finding out what causes the abusive tendencies is a great step for healing. It's worth it in to seek counsel in this area. Often times, people have areas in their lives that have been long buried and yet still somehow hurt them and interfere in their relationships. Discovering for yourself what ways you aided or damaged the relationship -and why- can help prepare you for a healthier future relationship and a healthier inner self.

, A common philosophy that is taught in divorce care classes is that an average person takes four years to heal from a divorce. This means that while you are pursuing new relationships, you may still be experiencing some mental feedback from your old one. This is okay. This is normal. Just take your time. If you are not ready for a full out relationship, aim to keep things casual, or take a step back altogether. There is nothing wrong with waiting until you are ready. Rushing can make you feel boxed in or scared, which can increase the abandonment fear you experience. Rushing can also have the unintended consequence of making emotional ties very strong very suddenly, which can make the fear of losing them spike quite suddenly, as well. Remember to enjoy your time getting to know another at a comfortable pace.

, Focus on loving yourself and understanding that your value is not decided by the notions of another being. Your value is inherent and beautiful, not tarnished because another could not recognize that. Be sure that you are developing your self-esteem before, during, and after building a new relationship.

, Not all fear is nonsensical. If you've lost a deep connection with another person, it is logical to be concerned about losing another connection. While you are working through the root of the fear, it is ok to acknowledge and discuss it with another prospective partner. While some people may be intimidated by that fear, others will understand and provide support. Learn to accept where you are while learning to keep stepping forward in recovery. If you are building up self-esteem and staying honest with yourself, a failed attempt with a new person will not mean ending your joy. It will be another chance to love yourself despite another. It will be another chance to grow as a person.

, The more you can develop healthy communication, the more you will be able to relate with yourself and others. This allows you to work through issues, discuss concerns, laugh with others, and explore new concepts. All, which will help you, develop as a person and become more stable. More stability, less scary relationships.

, Try new things, stay active, develop hobbies, take a class, or do anything. Everything you can think of to stay alive, not just breathing. In the end, our relationships are meant to enhance our lives, but to enhance our lives, we must already have lives. Part of living your own life means that you are able to share it with others, and that others can share their lives with you. Forming passions and hobbies helps prevent you from becoming dependent on others, because, hey! Your life is already pretty great!

, Each failed attempt at forming a new relationship can be some of the best success stories of discovering what you like and don't like, and who you want to be and who you don't want to be. Don't let the fear of what may happen keep you from experiencing some of the most wonderful parts of living. The unknown is what makes us feel alive, isn't it? The difficult times are some of the best learning experiences, are they not? So be brave, be happy, and let things happen. Just make sure that you are building your own self-esteem and hobbies, and don't let your support group and other connections fade as you step into a new relationship. Life is short. You got hurt. Healing takes time. Take things slowly, enjoy the moments, and be strong enough in your own beliefs to let things pass on if they need to.

Talk with a therapist.,
Consult a lawyer.",How to Ask for a Divorce," Don’t leave a voicemail message, send a letter through email, text a “Goodbye,” or ask your parents to do it for you. Asking for a divorce is an adult decision that demands you behave as an adult in the asking. Sit down with your spouse face-to-face.;
, The tone of this initial conversation will likely set the tone for all future divorce negotiations and proceedings. You can gain short-term satisfaction by yelling and pointing fingers, but if you keep your conversation calm and rational, you stand a better chance of protecting your long-term interests.


Don’t play the ""blame-game."" Don’t accuse and attack. You don’t need to score points or compare lists of wrong-doings. It’s not productive and the victories you win from it are short-lived. Instead, be respectful and sincere.

, Your goal is to make this conversation with your spouse go as smoothly as possible. Will your spouse prefer a private discussion at home? If you fear an outburst of violent anger, would you feel safer talking to your spouse in a public space? Is there a large project at your spouse's work coming up that is already stressing him or her? Is there a time when children can be at school, with friends, or with other family to allow you and your spouse privacy? You probably already know the time and environment that would be most appropriate for this conversation. Go with your gut.

, Your spouse will likely want to talk about your reasons for wanting a divorce. Rather than rattling off a list of painful occurrences, it might be better to keep your rationale clean (e.g. “I don't feel romantically attracted to you anymore.”). However, don't lie. If you can answer a question, do. If you can't answer (either because it's too emotionally difficult or because you don't know), explain that you can't answer. Note, however, that this is not the best time to talk about any new people you may have met. Bringing an affair into the conversation will throw the discussion into a tangent and it will be hard to bring it back to the topic of the relationship between you and your spouse.

, Your spouse may make promises of better behavior, may ask for marriage counseling, or otherwise try to sway your position. If you have not previously considered alternatives to divorce, ask yourself now if you would be willing to give them a try. Go into your conversation with your spouse knowing how you feel and whether you would be willing to postpone your request for divorce depending on their reaction.

, It is a very good idea to go into your conversation with your spouse knowing about the family finances. What do you have in savings? Is your health insurance through your spouse's work? Do you have life insurance naming your spouse as the beneficiary? How is your children’s school or childcare paid? In whose name is the house? Who is listed on the rental agreement, the utility bills, and other household services?


You do not necessarily need to start cancelling services and transferring titles to assets away from your spouse before you’ve even asked for a divorce, but you should go into the conversation knowing what your family assets are.

, Despite previous advice, if you anticipate your spouse reacting poorly, it might be a good idea to cancel jointly-held credit cards and apply for your own credit cards. Further, it can be a good idea to move half your jointly-held savings into a separate account. As much as you can, avoid touching or spending that savings until the divorce proceedings are finalized.


Many assets are not as easy to protect. For instance, perhaps your family has stock or bonds that would incur a penalty or loss to sell or transfer. In these cases, be sure to discuss with your spouse what you'd like done.
Even if you anticipate a more collected response from your spouse, there are still a number of issues for which you should have a rough plan. What happens to the children? Who keeps the house? Should the car be sold? Remember that you've known in advance that you would be asking for a divorce, and that this may come as a shock to your spouse. It is therefore appropriate that you have some initial thoughts and plans for the aftermath.

, If you think it can help, talk to a therapist. During your conversation (if not before), let your spouse know that you are seeing a therapist. It might be a good idea to recommend they also find someone to talk to. However, be clear with your spouse about whether you are going to a therapist with a goal of eventually reuniting with your spouse, or not.

, There are a multitude of issues to consider, assets to transfer, and papers to file. A lawyer can help you navigate it all.

You may have done your utmost to save the marriage, only to have it result in a definite end. If you're finding it difficult to work through the changes and sense of emotional loss, it is vital to seek counselling from a neutral party, as this will help you deal with the loss of trust, respect and affection within the relationship. Learning coping strategies will help you to survive the pain and losses. Emotional problems you may encounter include:


It may become very traumatic to accept that you have been rejected or replaced. It leaves you feeling as though you have been rejected and affects your self esteem, especially where you're the partner who has been left behind.
Feelings of anger and resentment need to be diffused to allow you to reclaim your life as a single person again.
A sense of emptiness when looking into the future can overwhelm you. Worries about ever sharing your life with someone again are naturally pervasive but can blur your ability to recover.
Feeling wounded, sometimes very deeply and not wanting to open up to anyone else about any of your emotions. Your sense of trust can be shattered.;
, While this part of divorce proceedings may be stressful, once over this does provide some tangible benefits to the divorce process. Partners are now legally separated from their duties to be responsible for one another. Moreover, the certainty as to assets that arises from the legal process can settle the messiness that emotional attachments create. As part of coping with the legal aspects of divorce, the following considerations will help a more peaceful process for you:


Know your legal rights. It is important to know your rights and how to enforce them in relation to property settlement, maintenance, and custody. Knowledge can help to keep you calmer and more at ease about what is happening to you.

Find a lawyer you click with. Don't settle for the first one if that lawyer doesn't feel right. Sometimes the strain of divorce can be more than matched by your irritation with your lawyer's antics, so be sure you're happy with this person before agreeing to retaining them. The more aggressive and ""take-all"" the attitude of your lawyer, the less amicable the settlement process will be, so bear that in mind when choosing one.
Consider a mutually lawyer-free divorce. Recognize that a bad divorce lawyer's interest lies in smoothly, calmly sucking you in to a war. Divorces are largely boilerplate; a Google of ""divorce for"" returns ""divorce for dummies"" as the first hit.

Unfortunately if you have children divorce may be too complicated for the ""do it yourself"" approach. Good divorce lawyers are not interested in sucking you in to war. They make more money in the long term by providing fast, quality service that leaves you happy with them and willing to refer them to your friends, family and even total strangers. While reading up on how divorce works is a good idea remember that book like ""divorce for dummies"" are written for a national market. They are not State specific. If you and your spouse are able to reach an agreement on every single aspect of your divorce you can draw up your own paperwork using a form found on the internet but you should at least pay for an hour of an attorney's time to have them review it. This could save you time by having them point out minor mistakes that could prevent the judge from signing your decree. If you have children the situation is even more complicated as there are numerous additional requirements that the State may impose on you that a lawyer can make sure are there and done property. Paying a lawyer for an hour of their time to review your document makes more sense than spending 2 hours at the courthouse just to have the judge tell you there is a flaw in your decree and that she isn't allowed to tell you what it is because that would be giving legal advice and she can't do that.



, This creates major unhappiness as each partner feels robbed and this generates arguing as to who is entitled to what. Most couples struggle to agree on who should get what. Couples ideally should focus on creating a new life, new environment with no lasting memories of the cancelled marriage. This notion will help them not to fight over items that will bring back memories and pain of the once held marriage.


Have all the facts and figures in hand to assist your lawyer in building a sound financial case and to convince your spouse without arguments and assumptions being involved. Use receipts, documented evidence, and other reliable sources of information to back up your wishes. This could include writing out a complete financial history of your marriage that reflects the resources you have, estimated value of shared property, individual assets, and liabilities. While this may sound calculating, it is no more than being factual and facts are your best approach in keeping emotions down.
Give your spouse the option of what to take from the house. You may be extremely surprised at how little discussion is required to divide a household when you free up the taking. For many couples, it becomes clear that there always were ""his and mine"" or ""hers and mine"" divisions in the house and it is only when arguing that these evident divisions are used as weapons to wound one another. Take away that chance by simply offering your spouse the opportunity to take what they please. Their own sense of responsibility and guilt will do some of the sorting for you!
Toss a coin for items you have each paid half for. It will even out in the end. Are your belongings so worth the angst otherwise?

, ""Who has custody"", ""How can visiting rights of the access parent be arranged"", "" How can parenting responsibilities be shared between two parties"", are all important issues that need to be resolved. It is not healthy for the children when parents use them as weapons against each other. Children are not protected from the conflict and bitterness that rages between angry parents. Put the children first and avoid creating situations whereby children become emotionally trapped by their loyalty to both parents.


Watch out for transference of emotional abuse from an abusive parent onto the children. Neither do this yourself nor allow the other spouse to do it. Signs include ""You'd choose to live with me if you loved me."" That is classic manipulation and when done to children, it is unkind and places the children in a bind they can't win whatever they say or choose.
Use a consultant or mediator to assist with determining custody arrangements if you don't feel you're able to do this yourself. If the custody arrangements have to be agreed to by a court, or you end up in court anyway, a court that can see the parents already trying hard will be impressed by the teamwork and consideration given to the children's needs first of all.
Be prepared to trial a few systems before settling on the one that works for both of you. You can't possibly know what will work out best until you've given different arrangements a chance. Take into account the children's impressions too.
For the greatest peaceful transition, both of you should be prepared to share the major decisions about the welfare of children and to continue to interact with one another in relation to the children's lives.

, Most often divorcing couples have to leave a community of friends and colleagues to join another. Shared friends from the former marriage often need to choose whose ""side"" they are on. Deal with losses in a mature way, knowing that some of these friendships, like the marriage were never meant to be. This can be a huge loss for many people who had valued the relationships formed and a sense of belonging that they once shared. However, being realistic about the relationships can help smooth the path for you.


Avoid expecting your friends to take sides. If you don't speak ill of your ex-spouse, they have less ground to do so either. If you reassure them that the divorce was amicable and that the two of you are still friends, sometimes this may ease the tension with friends (provided what you say is true). Equally, don't bring up your spouse at all; this breaks the connection for both you and your friends and allows everyone to move on.
For more ideas about how your friends see the situation, read How to be a good friend to both parties in a divorce.

, This part is marked by seeing yourself as an individual again rather than being a part of an intimate couple. The intense reactions of denial, anger, bargaining and grief need to replaced with feelings of acceptance.


Give yourself time. Initially you will probably feel fragmented, vulnerable, broken, low in self esteem, and various other emotions depending on your gender, whether you initiated the divorce or not, and what has happened through the course of the divorce. For some, there may be an absolute sense of relief! Whatever the feelings, coming to terms with your new life requires time and the formation of new routines and habits.
In order to keep your own inner peace, avoid self-blame. Relationships require two people and the consent and involvement of both. If you try to blame yourself for what has happened, then you will feel guilty, angry, and helpless. Blame is a useless emotion and when it is related to the end of a marriage, it simply causes you harm. Accept that the marriage has ended and that there are new things to do in life now, including finding a new sense of purpose.
Take up yoga, meditation, or a martial art to give you the chance to develop your inner focus and as a source of relieving stress.

, Move on to rediscover your own individuality. This is referred to as the central separation, the stage when the person starts to feel whole again. At this stage, you need to have clearly defined rules in your head about any further interaction with your spouse, in order to continue maintaining the peace. Some of these rules could include (they're up to you):


Treating future interactions in a professional, business-like manner. You still need to talk for the sake of the children? Act like you're in a business meeting at work, with the well-being of the children being the business at hand.
End any conversation with your ex-spouse that turns into a shouting match or where you're constantly interrupted. Explain that you'll talk again when everyone has calmed down. Make it clear in future meetings that should your spouse interrupt or explode, you will end that meeting too.
Never use children to relay information to your ex-spouse. Use emails or the post for this. Avoid texts; they're too personal, intimate, and too connected.
Depersonalize all of your communications. Keep your points simple (it can help to write down points of discussion first) and keep everything neutral.
Cut the ties. Don't talk to your ex-spouse for advice, help, expertise, or anything of the sort unless you have no choice in a work context. Find new places for advice, such as your accountant, doctor, lawyer, paid home handy-helpers, or someone else in your spouse's profession or line of work.
If you need more money for the children, work it out as a business proposal with your ex-spouse and do not beg, cry, manipulate, or show yourself as a victim.

Do the things you couldn't do before.",How to Cope With Divorce4," When you're moving on from your divorce and starting to feel like your old self again, you should take the time to appreciate your friends and see how much their help and support has meant to you. Take the time to have a heart to heart with your friends, to have a fun night out, or to take a yoga class or go on a hike with your close friends. Your friendships will grow as you feel like you're becoming a more stable person.


Use this time to reconnect with long-lost friends and to see if you can build a friendship again.
You can also turn acquaintances into friendships. Don't be afraid to invite your friend crush out for a cup of tea or a movie.

, Take your divorce as an opportunity to reconnect with your family and to spend more time with your parents, siblings, and your children, if you have any. They'll know that you're struggling and they'll be there in your time of need, and you can rely on your family no matter what. If your loved ones are across the country, plan a trip to see them, or just spend more time talking on the phone with them, emailing, and connecting with your family members when you can.


If you have kids, spend more time than ever bonding with them. They'll need you during this difficult time, too, and you can help each other.

, After a while, you'll be able to enjoy the benefits of being single. You don't have to be accountable for anyone, you don't have to tell anyone (except your children) what you'll be up to that night, and you can make decisions for yourself instead of factoring another person into where you'd like to eat, what movie you'd like to see, and who you'll hang out with that weekend.

This can mean starting an online dating profile, asking your friends to set you up with any cute single friends they may have, or just to make yourself open to meeting someone new when you're out and about.You don't have to jump into a serious relationship right away. Just going on a few dates with the same person can get you into the swing of things.
Take things slow. Take the time to get to know a new person instead of opening up about your divorce right away.

Maybe your ex hated hiking though you've always wanted to try it -- take this as a chance to become a hiking enthusiast. Maybe your ex hated classic movies -- now, you can watch every Cary Grant movie ever made. Maybe your ex hated traveling -- now, you can take your own vacation.

See them as they are.,
Focus on your partner’s good qualities.Think back to when you first met and fell in love with your spouse.,
Empathize with your partner.,
Think about the big picture.Nobody is perfect.,
Accept yourself.",How to Avoid Getting a Divorce2," There are always two versions of a person: the person they are, and the person you see them as.Sometimes these two identities are closely in alignment, while other times they are not. It is important to recognize your partner’s faults and flaws, but also to recognize their good qualities. When you find yourself obsessing over their deficiencies, remind yourself of how sweet, thoughtful, and affectionate they can be. Give your partner a fair hearing when they insist they can and will change, and be open to the possibility of their doing so.


Demanding that the other person change will not make them or you happy. They will feel trapped by your demands, and you will feel frustrated by the lack of change.
Do not compare your partner with anyone else.

, Reminiscing about these good times will help you see their good side more clearly in the present. If you’re constantly on the lookout for your partner’s flaws, instead of their positive qualities, you will see them in abundance.

, Put yourself in your spouse position. Do you treat them with the same level of respect that you expect for yourself? How do you feel when someone wants you to make a drastic (or even a minor) change to your personality? Most of us resist hearing that we are doing something wrong or irritating.We become defensive, hurt, and angry.


Understanding how and why your spouse reacts to criticism will help you soften your approach. Explaining that you feel attacked or hurt by their demands will, in turn, help them soften theirs.

, You and your spouse need to be honest with each other and with yourselves about what qualities, habits, or idiosyncrasies are truly grounds for divorce, and which are merely irritating or inconvenient. You may think your spouse snores too loudly; walks like a duck; makes too many grammatical errors; or is a shabby dresser. But these things don’t have to mean an end to your marriage. Understanding your partner’s limitations and flaws, as well as your own, is an important step towards recovering a happy marriage.

, Often, our judgmental attitude of other comes from a feeling of disappointment with ourselves.Search your feelings as to why you have such high expectations of your spouse, or why you demand so much of them. Is it because you are not completely content with yourself personally or professionally? If so, it will be difficult for you to accept others as well.


Lower your expectations of yourself to a realistic level and recognize that you and your spouse are both flawed in your own ways.
Do not expect your spouse alone to provide feelings of fulfillment.

Reinvigorate your sex life.,
Talk about your dreams and desires.In addition to communicating about everyday needs and situations (“We need to do the laundry”), it is important to share your deepest fears, hopes, and dreams with your partner to build emotional intimacy.,

Strengthen your connection with your spouse.,
Let go of the past.,
Be open to change.,

With the possibility of divorce close at hand, it may be difficult to have a good sex life.But physical and emotional intimacy go hand in hand, and both are equally important if you hope to stave off divorce.


Make time for romance.Everyone is busy, but scheduling date nights will give you time to set the mood. Try a romantic candle-lit dinner (either at a restaurant or at home), see a movie, or just go bowling. Before you head to the bedroom, though, it is important to give your spouse the love and attention they have been missing. Tell them you love them and enjoy spending time with them.
Place scented candles and flowers around the bedroom. Massage your partner’s hands, feet, and shoulders prior to intercourse. Arousing the senses can be an important first step toward reigniting your partner’s libido.
If you feel your sex life is stale, try new positions or try wearing lingerie. You could try reading erotica to one another, or watching porn. Take turns leading the session on alternate nights to ensure maximum variety., Use phrases like “I believe...” or “I hope...” when presenting your vision of your and your spouse’s future. Thinking about and sharing these thoughts and feelings can help you both realize that there are possibilities for your marriage beyond divorce.


Ask questions of both yourself and your spouse such as:

What great things do I think my spouse is capable of? How can I empower them to achieve their best?
Where would I like to travel to with my spouse?
What am I looking forward to doing with my spouse when I retire?


Invite your spouse to share his or her dreams and desires as well. Thinking and talking about your future together helps rectify it.
Do not use these conversations to complain or engage in negative thinking.

, If you’re considering divorce, it’s likely there are real problems for which both of you are partially to blame. Don’t blame your partner for all the problems in your marriage. Have a dialogue with your spouse so you can come to a mutual understanding of what has gone wrong, and how it can be fixed.


Express the problems you perceive with “I” statements, as in “I wish we spent more time together,” as opposed to “You never want to spend time with me.”These are less likely to be perceived as critical and will produce more positive results.
When blamed unfairly, defend yourself, but don’t counterattack when criticized. Try to see the conflict from your spouse’s point of view., Be generous with your partner in your affections and compliments. This will help rekindle the love you once had together. Fulfill their emotional needs first as well as their material ones. Love your partner the way you want to be loved.


Tell your spouse you love them every day.
Surprise your spouse with little gifts that they’ll enjoy. Make dinner for them, buy them flowers, or take them shopping.
It may take time to rebuild trust and affection for your partner. Be patient and continue to work at it.

, Talk with your partner about occasions when they hurt or upset you. If you wish, write the list down. This should not be a complete list, but it should include the most painful memories or experiences that you and your partner have held onto, and which have inspired mutual resentment. You and your partner will likely have different lists. Talk about each incident in turn. Each of you should acknowledge how you contributed to the misunderstanding and apologize. Practice forgiveness even if your partner will not.

, Agree to make changes in your routines or interaction if you feel it will help. Make it clear that you will try your best, but it might take you some time to get used to them. Then, really try your best in implementing the promised changes and show that you are sincere. Ask the same in return.

, Couples counselling with a therapist will help you work through the problems with a neutral mediator. The therapist provides an objective point of view and can offer advice on communication strategies, conflict resolution, and general guidance on improving a problematic marriage.Couples counselling usually lasts one hour, once a week. Working more often with the counselor might yield more results.
Group therapy is another useful type of counselling, and introduces couples going through similar periods of stress to each other for an extended discussion about how they are working through their issues. Group therapy provides the opportunity to gain new understandings and ideas about your own relationship.

Suggest a trial separation.,
Decide how long to separate.,
Set the terms.,
Think about your kids.,
Use your time wisely.,
Arrive at a decision.",How to Avoid Getting a Divorce4," A trial separation is an informal period of separation during which the couple temporarily separates. This gives each party a chance to examine their feelings and lives away from the constant influence and presence of the other.Trial separations could help you and your spouse remember how much you miss and need each other. “Distance makes the heart grow fonder,” as the old saying goes.


Your spouse may not be open to the idea of trial separation. Explain to them how beneficial it would be to mutually “take a break” and have some time to think through what you both really want from the marriage.

, Between three and six months is the ideal trial separation period.A longer period may make it difficult to reconcile with other person as both you and your spouse begin to settle into the single life.

, When you move forward with a trial separation, there are a number of financial and lifestyle questions you both need to agree upon. Put the terms of the separation in writing so as to avoid any confusion between you and your spouse.Important questions to ask include:


Are both of you moving out? Or just one?
Where will each of you go?
Will bank accounts need to be divided or shared? Credit cards?

, If you have children, make sure you are open about the process with them. Help your children understand the situation and let them know that despite the conflict between you and your spouse, both of you still love them.Children may react badly to the trial separation. They may become clingy or refuse to go to school. Older kids and teens may become withdrawn or angry. Talk to your child’s teachers about your home situation so they can look for signs that your child may be acting out.
Children may believe something they have done caused the separation. Let them know that the situation between you and your spouse is not their fault and nothing they have done could cause it.
Arrange appropriate care and visitation schedules for your children. Try not to ship your children back and forth from one household to another more than once a week, and ensure that their schooling is not interrupted.

, Whatever was causing your domestic problems initially, it will not fix itself simply because you and your spouse are separated.Whether you proposed or opposed the trial separation, talk to a therapist about how and why your marriage ended up in its current state.


Ideally, you would continue attending couples therapy even while you live separately. A trial separation should not be a complete shutdown of communication between you and your spouse.Work on sorting out your differences with the help of a counselor.
Do not use the trial period to pretend you are single. Do not date other people or engage in romantic flings. The goal of the trial period is to find a new perspective on your relationship that only distance can bring.

, As the end of the trial period approaches, evaluate your experience. Are the problems in your relationship really insurmountable? Or did the trial separation demonstrate that you miss and love your spouse so much that divorce would be disastrous?Talk with your spouse about your feelings and elicit theirs.


It may be that you and your spouse do not reach the same conclusion about the state of your marriage. Be prepared to move forward with a divorce at the end of the trial separation if either of you deem it necessary.

Tell them both that you will not choose sides.,
If you do find yourself siding with one, limit contact with the other.,
Reveal no opinion on who is right or wrong.,
Expect anything you say to one to get back to the other.,
Resist answering emails from either of them.,
If all else fails, detach from both for the duration.,
Listen.,
Pray.",How to Be a Good Friend to Both Parties in a Divorce," Be honest with both of them, letting them know that you will accept all calls, emails, etc. from their ex, and will do your best to remain neutral. If there's a problem with that, you'll have to decide then, but don't pretend you're not in contact with the other spouse. Instead, it's best to be honest, but say, ""I'm not taking sides. I'm Switzerland."" This way neither will be surprised to find out you've heard from the other.;
, Once you've heard both sides of the story (don't pre-judge!), if you realize you are more sympathetic to one (for example, adultery was involved, and you are siding with the spouse who didn't cheat), you will have to decide if you care to continue your friendship with the ex. Clearly, you will at least need to limit your contact to bare minimums to prevent yourself from lecturing or scolding the offender.

, Unless you know for a fact that something is factual, do not take a position. Each person will have his or her own filter and will be playing back every incident through that filter. He said/she said is never accurate, both perceive the same incidents in completely different ways. Simply listen, be a sounding board, and ""reflect"" each spouse's feelings back to them.


Example: Him: ""I just can't believe she'd do this to me, I mean, do you think she is having an affair? How could she?""
You: ""I don't know, man. I can hear how upset you are, though. It's hard to believe it could go so wrong between you, isn't it?""
In other words, don't buy into his wild suppositions, despair, or anger. Simply be there for him.

, There's rarely a mutual and simultaneous parting of the ways. One spouse decides to leave the other. Sometimes it will seem sudden and without warning, but more likely, if the spouse being left is honest, the signs have been there - s/he's just been denying it. Your first compulsion will be to commiserate, and a lot of times, this takes the form of you assuring (for example) the sobbing partner that you can well believe her husband's acting this way - you've seen it with past girlfriends, or whatever. In her frustration, rage, and fear, she will use this validation of her very raw feelings to prove some point to her formerly dearly beloved, and eventually, you will suddenly find yourself on the pointy end of a finger as he accuses you of betraying his secrets.

, Although emails are quick and convenient, they're also impersonal and non-retractable. And they are in print. You don't want to put things in writing to either one of your friends right now, you just want to be a good friend. They can't see your sympathetic face, and they also can't put a tone of voice to it. They're going through a very tough time right now, and their nerves are on edge, rubbed raw with emotion - any little joke you make or bit of irony you add in an email is likely to rub them the wrong way, so don't compound an already tough problem by doing this. If you get an email, IM or text from them, call them back. All they need is to hear your voice. It'll help.

, This is a last resort, to be taken only if you find yourself being taken to task a second or third time for ""betraying a confidence,"" etc. Remembering the previous step, you must know that each of them is feeling pretty much like they've been chained to a pickup hitch and dragged for awhile. Each of them is looking for any little thing they could seize upon to use as a scapegoat - something, anything, to blame for their present difficulties. If you find you present too tempting a target to them, make a polite exit. Tell them both, perhaps via email with each of them in the TO: line, that you love and value the friendship of each of them, but find yourself too far in the middle of things for your comfort. While you want to remain friends with both of them, you are no longer able to continue at the moment, that you want to be sure you do not intrude upon their private hell. Let them know that when it's all over, you'll be there for them both, and that they know how to reach you, but that for the time being, you want to give them the time and space they need to work out their issues once and for all - without you. Even if they try to get you involved, resist temptation.

, Anyone going through a divorce needs someone to listen and not judge. This involves silence when you may not want to be silent. This involves keeping the information you hear confidential even when you are asked by someone what the person said. This involves paying attention when you may have heard the same story more than once.

, Pray for both parties. It will be difficult for them to make it safely to the other side in one piece. Let them know you are praying for them, if they and you are religious.

, Clean away any pieces of furniture that sit in that particular area and vacuum the area to kill all the dust mites and spider webs that may have accumulated there.

, Some stands come already in one piece, while others require a little assembly. If the Christmas tree stand comes in multiple pieces, you'll need to attach piece by piece, making sure they are all facing downward the same way in the radial direction. Typically, these pieces/legs slide onto the main base easily, as long as they're facing the right direction.

, Most newer trees come in two or three sections, ready to be easily connected. Start with the bottom piece, slotting the bottom of the pole into the top of the base. Then tackle the second and third sections, one by one. For each one, you'll see a connection point in the interior of the tops and bottoms of each section, where two poles slot into one another. The instructions on the box for your particular tree can also offer further help. With pre-lit trees, you'll have to connect the pole and the electrical cord for each tree piece.

,, Most artificial Christmas trees are stored ""bunched up"" and can look very sparse when you unpack them. Push some of the branches into a more-realistic looking place instead of having them be tightly folded up. If your branches are the wire variety, you can bend them into your desired position, spreading out the branches and angling them slightly up, ready for decorations.

, Add lights (if the tree isn't a pre-lit tree), tinsel and ornaments to the tree. Try to hang heavier ornaments only on the bottom (if they hang near the middle or top, they could fall off and break, or even break a branch which could lead to an uneven tree the following year, which could lead to having the user buy a brand new artificial tree). Use the top area for light ornaments and the bottom for medium weight and those too heavy or too expensive (too cherishable). Decorate the tree just as you would decorate a normal real tree.

, Most people stick with a traditional angel or star, but feel free to be creative and do something different, too.

, Tighten the screws and make sure it's sturdy. The screws don't need to screw into the tree, but they must not move.

, It will be a thirsty tree to begin with.


Have water touching the base of the tree at all time. If there's not, a layer of sap will form. If that happens, you'll need to make another cut, as the tree can't drink through the sap layer.

, Place a tree bag around the base of your tree. This not only catches the needles and makes for super easy clean up when you're done with it, but you can just remove all the decorations, then grab the bag, give it a tug, and the tree is bagged and ready to go.

, For the first week or so, a 7-foot tree could go through about 2 quarts of water a day. Make sure it doesn't run out of water. If you take good care of this tree, it could last for over a month.

, Before you even think about doing anything, make sure you have the right tree. Generally, you want the tree to be fresh because trees that are too dried out are more prone to accidents. You also want a tree with branches that are sturdy enough to hold up the candles. A good choice is a Blue Spruce

, Make sure you leave space near the end of the branch for the candles.

, The trick is to make sure there isn't anything directly above any of the candles. To be really sure you're doing this right, cup your hand over each candle and then move your hand up and keep going until you are positive its there isn't any thing the fire can spread to. This is important.

, You may want to record the amount in your journal or put the number in picture captions. You may just want to brag about the event later.

, Before you even think about lighting those candles, make sure you have a fire extinguisher, buckets of water, and a hose handy just in case.

Stake your tree to keep it upright.",How to Plant a Living Christmas Tree," Move the tree gently side to side and be sure the root ball moves with the trunk as you do this. The base of the trunk should not move around inside the root ball, which is indicative of damaged roots.If this is the case, you should not attempt to plant your tree because it is unlikely to survive.;
, Buy your living Christmas tree as close to Christmas as possible, and plant as soon as possible afterwards. The longer your tree stays inside, the more it’s exposed to drying conditions that will weaken it.


7-10 days is about as long as you should keep your tree inside., Near a window is best so it can still receive light and cool air, but keep it out of direct sunlight. Avoid putting it near a heating vent, fireplace, or stove.

, Daily watering is necessary to keeping your tree healthy. Try putting ice cubes on top of the root ball daily to achieve a more gradual and steady watering as they melt., Allow your tree to acclimate back to the cold after spending 1-2 weeks inside your warm home. Place it outside, in a cool sheltered spot like a front or back porch and leave it there for about a week.Continue watering it daily during this time.

, Research the type of tree you have and its growth potential. Make sure it won’t outgrow the spot you choose for it. Look for a sunny spot that’s several feet from your house or any fencing since roots and limbs could eventually cause problems for these structures., In colder climates, the ground will freeze if you wait until Christmas to dig the hole, so plan ahead and do this in the fall.If you’ve waited too long to dig and the ground is already frozen, try pouring boiling water onto the spot and then digging.

, Using a shovel, dig a hole twice as wide as the size of the root ball to give the roots a chance to spread.But don’t go any deeper than the height of the root ball, since you don’t want it too far below the soil level. Having it slightly higher than the soil around it will help with drainage., Don’t dispose of any of the dirt you dig out of the hole. You’ll be using this later to fill the hole back in. It can be left outside under a tarp or placed in a garage or shed.

, The root ball of your tree may have been wrapped in burlap or plastic, so be sure nothing remains wrapped around it when you’re ready to plant., This may require two people depending on the size of your tree. Try to get it as close to centered as possible inside the hole you dug. Hold it upright so it doesn’t fall over before you can fill in the hole.

, Shovel the soil you dug out of the hole back into the empty spaces around the root ball of the tree. Tamp the soil gently, but don’t pack it in tightly., Moisten the soil around the tree with a hose or watering can. You do not need to use any sort of fertilizer – just plain water will do.

, Add a couple inches of mulch around the base of the tree as an insulating layer.You can also gather old leaves and place them on top of the soil for a similar effect.

, Observe the tree for the rest of the winter season. If your winter conditions are dry, occasionally water the tree to keep moisture near the roots. Once the spring growing season begins, water the tree regularly if you aren’t getting a lot of rain., Place one or two stakes around your tree – away from the roots but still within the mulched area. Tie the tree to the stakes using a flexible material like canvas straps.The stakes can be removed after about a year.

Measure the height of your ceiling.,
Choose a tree with an appealing shape that fits where you need it.,
Check for freshness by one of the following methods:


When trees are cut and shipped, they undergo a lot of stress.,
Make a fresh cut in the trunk of at least 1"".,
Get the tree into water as soon as possible after the fresh cut.,
Give the tree as much water as it needs.,
Keep the tree out of harsh sunlight and warm drafts from vents.",How to Pick out a Christmas Tree," If the tree is too tall, you won't be able to fit a star or an angel on it, or you may have to trim the top. Don't forget to account for the height of your stand and the area in which you plan to put your tree.;
, Some people prefer short fat trees, others long, skinny trees, still others prefer the ""perfect"" cone shaped tree. Most people prefer fat trees or ""perfectly"" shaped trees. Retailers know this, so they will charge more for these trees. So make sure you know your price and desires before you buy it.

, Losing needles is normal. Most retailers will shake trees to remove these loose needles, but some do not. Yes, loss of needles can be a sign of an old tree, but this is not a sure-fire method.






For Frasier and Douglas firs, a better way to test freshness is to remove a firmly connected needle and bend in it half. The needle from a fresh tree should snap. A needle that does not snap indicates that the tree has been cut for some time.






An even better way to test freshness is by weight. After the tree is cut, it no longer produces sap. It will continue to use this sap until little remains. It takes an experienced tree-chooser to be able to tell this. Most tree lot assistants do not work on commission. If you offer the assistant a tip, he or she will help you pick a long lasting tree (he or she might also tell you which trees were received most recently). Another way to tell if the tree still is giving sap is that parts should be sticky with it. As long as you do not mind, give your tree a hug. If you come out sticky and covered in sap then it's probably still fresh.






On firs and some types of pine, the branches of a fresh tree should be flexible. This is not the case for all trees. However, trees that fail this test are likely to be very old and would not be found on a reputable tree lot. Be careful this method is risky and may harm your tree.

, Try to mount and straighten the tree before you get it home.

, Otherwise the trunk will scab over, preventing the tree from being able to absorb water.

, Ensure that there is always water in the basin. Tree water additives, such as sugar, vinegar, or even specially designed additives, are not effective. Do not give it too much water, or you will drown the tree.

, This will discolor your tree and shorten its lifespan.

"

Choose a healthy tree.,
Choose and clear a location for the tree.,
Cover the floor where the tree will be placed.,
Prepare the base of your tree.,
Mount your tree within eight hours of cutting the base.,
Make sure the tree is straight.",How to Put Up a Christmas Tree2," If at all possible, buy a Christmas tree from a tree farm, where you can purchase your tree while it's still in the ground. A freshly cut Christmas tree will last longer than one that's been cut weeks ago and shipped to distant retail outlets.

, It should be kept away from open flames or heat sources, which may dry it out prematurely. Trees do sometimes burn so be careful (see Warnings below). Corners are good places to put trees because this placement keeps the tree safe from knocks and bumps.


If you'll be using lights to decorate your tree, place the tree close to an outlet. If this isn't possible, you'll need to use an extension cord. Be sure that if you use an extension cord, it runs along to wall and doesn't create a trip hazard.

, You can use a properly sewn tree skirt or be budget savvy and use Christmas-themed paper or a piece of satin fabric as shown. This will not only serve decorative purposes, but it will also help protect the floor in case any water splashes out.


If you have a skirt that goes over the cradle, you can still place a barrier underneath the cradle and apply the decorative skirt after the tree has been mounted. Not only does this make the tree more presentable but it prevents pets from attempting or wanting to drink the water in the base.

, Using a small handsaw, cut about a half inch to an inch (1.3cm-2.5cm) off the bottom to aid water absorption.


Note: It is recommended that you don't cut the base at an angle, in a V-shape or drill a hole in the base. None of these methods help water absorption and they may make it more difficult to hold the tree safely in the stand.
Do not cut the tree with a reciprocal saw or any blade that moves so fast that it will create friction. If the cut gets hot enough, the sap in the tree will seal the end and make water absorption impossible. A chainsaw or manual saw will work.

, That is how long a fresh tree can go without water before absorption is jeopardized. A Christmas tree should never be mounted dry. It is much better to place it in a container of water that is replenished on a regular basis. You can buy special tree cradles or stands which screw into the base of the tree and provide watering space. Or, you can go for the rougher but tried-and-true method of using a bucket filled with small rocks (put the tree in, fill the bucket with rocks around the trunk). The tree should be provided with 1 quart (950ml) of water for every inch (2.5cm) in trunk diameter.


Note: ensure that whatever you use, the tree is stable. Don't whittle down the bark of the tree just so that it can fit in the stand - that outer layer is the part that absorbs the most water.

, It is a good idea for at least two people to put up the tree, one holding it stable while the other fixes the base. Always stand back to check that the tree is straight before you get busy decorating. Obviously, it is easiest to fix at this stage.

Fraser, Douglas, and Balsam Firs are all good choices. They have shorter needles, so look to the ground to see how many have fallen. The needles should snap crisply if the tree is still fresh.
Scotch and Virginia Pine are also ideal Christmas trees. The needles are longer, so the dead ones often get stuck in the branches. Run your hand loosely down a branch -- how many needles fall?
A Spruce (blue or Colorado) is a beautiful tree, but the needles are so pointy they aren't good for homes with small children.
A Cypress is a beautiful addition to any Christmas, but the branches aren't very sturdy and won't keep large ornaments up.Consider this tree if you're only working with lights and ribbon.;
, Knowing the dimensions of the room you're going to put it in (you do know them, right?) is important for setting up your tree successfully. Which tree speaks to you? You'll need one that's the right height and the right width. Make sure you don't pick one that fits in the doorway but takes up half the room!


It's best to buy them early. They're freshest and you get the pick of the lot. Also, a lot of places pre-cut their trees and then leave them to fend for themselves. The tree you pick is probably better off under your care for a week or two than it is at the farm.As for your stand, the tree farm can help you with this if you don't already have one. You want one that is adjustable to pretty much any size and isn't a small circle that will only accommodate certain trees. And it should hold at least a gallon of water.

, When the tree is all netted up, it's going to be hard to tell which side is the side you want displayed. Before the netting goes on, tab the center of the nicest side. That way when you put it up, you won't have to do any needless rotating and manhandling to get it how you want it.

, Since it's best to get your tree early and you want to give Thanksgiving its proper due, store your tree in the garage or a similar place until you wish to put it up. Put 'er in a bucket, give 'er some water, and make routine checks every day or two.


If you leave your tree out on the porch and it gets sunlight, it may start drying out (the last thing you want to happen). You want as humid, yet cool, as possible, too.
If you do store your tree (any more than 8 hours, actually), you'll need to cut 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) off the base prior to set up. This revitalizes it and allows it to take in more water, just like you would flowers in a vase.

, Regardless of your type of tree, you don't want the bathwater coming in with the baby, if you will. Get rid of the dead needles by shaking it (outside!) before you set it up. No use starting off with a needle-y floor before the decorations even go up.

, Apart from needing the ceiling height and the necessary width, you want your tree to be away from heat sources. Simply being on a heat vent can dry out your tree much faster than it would otherwise.


Those are the two main things to consider. However, you may also want to consider how pets and children might get at it, how it might fall over (or what it might fall onto), and if it proves an obstacle. But heat access should come first!
Did we mention not putting it too close to the fireplace? Definitely not the most wonderful time of year when your house burns down because of poorly thought-out Christmas spirit.

, This part all depends on your stand. You'll probably be tightening screws and maybe slightly leaning your tree to make it appear upright. However you do it, make sure it's sturdy! The screws don't need to screw into the tree, but they do need to be unmoving.

, That cut you just made (or the guy at the farm, whichever) is going to cause some serious thirst. It'll slow down soon. You bought a stand that holds a lot of water, right?


Always make sure there's water touching the base of the tree. If there's not, a layer of sap will form. If that happens, you'll need to make another cut, as the tree can't drink through it.

, Pro tip, for sure. Place a tree bag around the base of your tree. This not only catches the needles and makes for super easy clean up when you're done with it, but you can just remove all the pretty doodads and then grab the bag, give her a tug, and your tree is bagged and ready to go. Tada!

, As much as the tree bag is convenient, it's not very Christmas-y, so cover the tree bag with a tree skirt (that's one of those decorative wraps that goes around the base, under your presents). Until tree bags come Rudolph-themed, this'll be a step.

, Your first step in decorating should be stringing the lights. For artificial and real trees, the key here is (might not be the way dad did it) to string along the branches. Not across the branches like Christmas neophytes do.


First, mentally divide your tree into tall sections -- the same number as the amount of lights you have. Ideally you'll have at least 5 strings of lights. Another tip? LEDs are better for the environment and will keep your fuses from blowing.With your first strand, string it up the top, wrap it along the topmost branch and work your way down, going up each branch and back down it. This minimizes exposed cords.
Repeat for each strand of lights. When you're done, step back and squint. Do you see any dark holes? If so, adjust as necessary., This can be a family free-for-all or can be a highly coordinated, themed look. Heck, you can just have lights if you want, or lights and ribbon, or the whole shebang. Just make sure to take a step back every few minutes to make sure the ornaments and decorations are spread out evenly.

, For the first week or so, a 7-foot tree could go through about 2 quarts of water a day. And like discussed before, make sure it doesn't run out of water! If you take good care of it it could last over a month.


Don't worry about those fancy additives people try to sell you. Plain ol' water is all your tree needs. Just make sure there's enough of it. And if Fluffy likes to drink out of the base, be extra diligent!

Get some pine cones.",How to Make Christmas Tree Pine Cones1," You can buy them at your local craft store if you're not near any pine trees. Alternatively, you can pick up pine cones from your backyard, the local woods or at a park. Just check that it's okay to take them from wherever you find them––always ask permission before going onto private land.


Gather up however many pine cones you want to turn into ornaments.

Tie the ribbons together into bows.",How to Make a No‐Sew Ruffled Tree Skirt," You can use any type of fabric for the base, but a thicker type of fabric, such as canvas, felt, or linen, would work best. The fabric won't be visible in the end, but it might still be a good idea to match it to your ruffle fabric as much as possible.;
, Take a piece of string and place it on the floor, with one end against the trunk. Make a mark on the string, 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) below where you'd like the tree skirt to end.


You are making the base smaller because you will be extending the outermost ruffle past the edges by 2 inches (5.08 centimeters).

, Pin one end of the string to the middle of your base fabric. Tie a dressmaker's chalk or pen to the other end, where the mark is. Swing the chalk/pen around in a circle, pulling the string taut as you do., Find the center of the circle. Use a 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) long piece of string to draw smaller circle inside it., Discard the inner circle or save it for another project. You will have something that looks like a giant doughnut.

, Fold the doughnut in half, matching up the edges. Cut along one of the folded edges, leaving the other one intact. Unfold the circle when you are done.

, You can use all one color for a simple tree skirt, or you can use different colors for a fancier one. You could even use varying shades of the same color for an ombre skirt.


You will need a lot of fabric for this, about 5 to 7½ yards (4.57 to 6.86 meters).

, You can cut the strips as wide or as narrow as you'd like, but something between 4½ to 8 inches (11.43 to 20.32 centimeters) wide would be ideal.If you want to hem the ruffles, cut the strips twice as wide as you want them.

, Turn a strip so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold the narrow ends down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) and press them flat with an iron.Do this step for all of the strips.

, Fold a strip in half lengthwise, with the wrong sides together. Press the strip flat with an iron to hold the crease.Do this step for all of the strips.


If you are using ribbon, or prefer a rustic look, you can skip this step.

, Set your base one the floor and choose one side of the slit to work on. Set your first strip on top of the base, close to the slit. The bottom/folded edge should extend 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) past the bottom edge of the base.

, Draw a short line of hot glue along the slit on the back of the skirt base. Fold the end of the strip over the edge of the slit, by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Press the end into the glue., Draw a 2 to 3-inch (5.08 to 7.62-centimeter) line of hot glue along the edge of the skirt base. Press the top/raw edge of the strip into the glue.


Make sure that the bottom edge of the strip is extending 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) past the bottom edge of the skirt base.

, Pinch the next section of the strip between your forefinger and thumb. Make a drop of hot glue on the base, right where you left off. Quickly press the pinched fabric into it, and wait for the glue to set.

, Glue down another 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) of your strip to the base fabric. Pinch another section of fabric, and secure it with a drop of glue.

, At some point, you will run out of fabric and will need to start a new strip. Unfold the strip that's already on the base. Draw a line of hot glue along the folded side hem. Slide the next strip inside by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Close the glued strip over it.If you made a rustic strip without a bottom hem: unfold the first strip's side edge. Draw a line of hot glue along the edge. Press the next strip's folded edge into the glue, overlapping it by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).

, Trim the strip down to 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Fold the edge under by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Draw a short line of hot glue along the back edge of the slit. Fold the strip by another ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and press it into the glue., Let the ruffles overlap by about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters).This will give your tree skirt a nice, full look. It will also prevent any of the base fabric from peaking through.

, This will make the inner hem and hide the raw edges. You can use matching fabric or coordinating fabric. You can also use a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) wide ribbon instead.It needs to be long enough to wrap around the inside edge of your base, plus 1 inch (2.54 centimeters).


If you are using wired ribbon, be sure to pull the wire out.

, Turn the strip so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold both of the side edges down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) and press them flat with an iron.

, Fold the strip in half lengthwise with the wrong sides together, and press it flat with an iron. Tuck both of the long, raw edges inside, aligning them with the crease. Press the strip again with an iron. Your strip should now be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide.

, Unfold the strip so that is it 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wide and the raw edges are still tucked against the crease. Draw a squiggle of hot glue inside the strip, from edge to edge, about 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) long.

, Align the strip's edge with the slit's edge. Fold the strip over the raw edge of the skirt base, sandwiching it inside., Work 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) at a time. When you are done, you should have a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide border on the inside rim of your skirt base.

, You will be using these to close your tree skirt, so make sure that the colors work well with your ruffles. Wider ribbons will look best for this.


If you have a large skirt, cut eight lengths of ribbon.

, Turn the skirt so that the back is facing you. Find the top, middle, and bottom of the slit. Hot glue the ends of the ribbons accordingly. Make sure that they are evenly spaced, and right across from each other.


If you have a large skirt, glue four ribbons to each side of the slit.

, Turn the tree skirt over so that the front is facing you. Wrap the tree skirt around the base of your tree. Tie each set of ribbons together into a big bow.


Consider trimming the ends of the bows down into notches or angles.

Firs grow best in cooler climates or at higher elevation. There are several types of firs, all with their applicable zone growth areas.Fraser Fir: Found in the Appalachians Mountains at high elevations (zones 4-7)
Douglas Fir: The most popular Christmas tree species in the U.S. (zones 4-6)
Concolor Fir: Also known as the White Fir (zones 4-7)
Balsam Fir: This is the best fir for colder climates (zones 3-6)
Noble Fir: This is the largest native fir in North America (zones 4-5);
, Pines tend to grow quickly and can reach a height of 6 to 7 feet within six years as long as they have good growing conditions. There are several types of pines, including:White Pine: This is the tallest native pine species in North America (zones 3-8)
Virginia Pine: This pine does well in poor soil and has sharp cones (zones 4-8)
Scotch Pine: This pine has a high reseeding ability and can thrive in poor soil (zone 3-7)
Sand Pine: This pine is ideal for hot climates (zones 7-10)

, Spruce trees are bright and colorful, but they have prickly needles and tend to lose their needles after a week or two once they are harvested. Spruces grow well in climates that are cool. There are two main types of spruce:Norway Spruce: This spruce can be found throughout North America but is native to Europe (zones 2-7)
Colorado Blue Spruce: This spruce type is known for its blue-green needles (zone 4 to 7a)

, A non-traditional tree species like the Leyland cypress can create a unique Christmas tree for your home. Leyland cypresses also require very little shaping and can reach 6 to 7 feet tall in four years., To grow a Christmas tree successfully in the ground, you will need to plant the seedling in a pot in a greenhouse. You can also buy a young seedling at a tree nursery. You will then transplant the tree to the planting site so it grow tall and strong in the ground. You usually want a 2-2 ratio for a tree, which means it spent two years in a seedbed and two years in a transplant.You will need to plant the seedling in a potting mixture in a pot. The potting mixture should be made of equal parts peat, vermiculite, and perlite. Add 1/4 tsp lime per gallon of potting mixture but make sure the pH of the soil is around 7(or neutral). Once the seedling is in the mixture, add fertilizer to the mixture to help the seedling grow.
You will also need a fluorescent lamp to heat the seeds. Use a white bulb made for plants so you do not burn the plants with the light.

, Christmas tree species do not need a lot of water after their first year of growth. Make sure you water the seedling from late spring to early fall once a week during its first year of growth.2-2 transplants are best for spruce and fir seedlings. This means the seedling spends two years in a seedbed and two years in the transplant site. 2-0, where the seedling grows for two years in a seedbed, is best for pine seedlings.

, The first step in preparing the planting site is to get the soil tested. You need soil that drains well and that does not contain heavy clay. The soil test will dictate if the site is good for a specific seedling.The soil test will also give you a pH for the soil. Some species do well in certain soil pHs, such as Fraser firs, which grow best in well-drained soil with a pH of 6.5 to 6.8.

, Christmas tree species do not do well with wet feet or excess moisture in the soil. Having a planting site with a 5% to 20% slope will ensure there is good water drainage and good air for growth.You should also ensure the site gets full sun. Some seedling types, such as pines, grow well on south and west slopes. Spruces and firs do well on north and east slopes.

, Prepare the soil for the seedling by removing any existing vegetation with a mower.You may also need to take out any stumps or rocks in the soil with a pickaxe or a shovel. The planting site should be smooth, with no excess vegetation, stumps, or rocks.

, Once the planting site is ready, you can plant the transplant seedling on the planting site. Hand plant the seedling using a shovel or an auger.Dig a hole that is the same depth as the hole the seedling was grown in at the nursery or in the greenhouse. To determine the correct depth, check the trunk of the tree for a noticeable color shift, as this will make the surface level where the seedling was originally grown.
Place the seedling in the hole and spread the roots carefully and gently. Avoid twisting or screwing the seedling into the hole as this will tangle up the roots, which can kill the tree. Cover up the hole with soil. Give the tree a good watering after the planting.
If you are planting more than one transplant seedling at a time, make sure the trees are planted in rows eight feet apart, with seven to eight feet between each seedling. This will ensure the trees are not at risk of disease or pest issues.

, Christmas trees require relatively low maintenance after the first year of growth. After the first year of growth, the tree will become established and only require watering during dry months or drought.

, You will need to use a mower to remove any weeds around the tree. You will also need to do careful weed-eating techniques around the trees. Weeds and grasses around the tree can starve the tree of water and nutrients.You may want to invest in a weed-killing solution to spread on the soil around the tree. You can use organic weed killers or chemical pesticides.

, Pruning and shearing the tree is very important. Do this every year, around mid-summer, after the tree has flushed out its new growth.Use pruners or garden shears to shape the tree. Remove any imperfections, such as double tops and any misshapen branches.
You should limit any pruning during the year you are planning to harvest the tree, as you want to avoid any visible cuts to the exterior branches of the tree.

, It is normal for Christmas tree species to shed their needles, usually about 30 percent of their needles every year. But if you notice excessive needle shedding or yellowing needles, these may be signs of a disease or a pest issue.You will then need to take steps to eliminate pests that are eating the tree or treat diseases on the tree before you harvest the tree, as you do not want these pests to kill the tree or to enter your home once the tree is harvested. Though it is rare for pests to appear on Christmas trees species, it can happen. The most common pests found on Christmas tree species are the Cinara aphid, the spruce spider mite, and the praying mantis., Most Christmas tree species will reach six to seven feet within six to nine years, depending on the growing conditions. You can harvest the tree by cutting it down with a chainsaw or a handsaw.For more information on how to cut down or fell a tree, see: How to Fell a Tree


, You should cut the tree when it is full of moisture, usually during the late fall, so the needles stay green and supple when the tree is displayed indoors., Make sure you place the tree in water once it is cut to prevent the cut from resealing. If the cut reseals, the tree will not be able to take in water and may not have a very long lifespan.You can also harvest the tree early, before Christmas, and then cut a thin slice off the trunk and stick it in water when you are ready to display it for Christmas.

Plug the lights in to make sure that each bulb works.,
Make sure that you have enough lights to reach an outlet and light your entire tree.,
Get an extension cord or power strip.",How to Hang Lights on a Christmas Tree1," If a few don’t, try tightening them – they may not be broken after all. Once you’re confident they work, unravel them. This way you don’t spend minutes unraveling what you don’t use.


Spend a couple of minutes tinkering with them, and then if they still don’t work, throw them out. If you don’t, you’ll just give yourself a headache.;
, You’ll need one 100-light set for every foot of your tree’s height, not accounting for the distance away from the outlet. That number is for a moderately-lit tree; if you like the sparse look or want to go more ""sunshine explosion,"" you may need fewer or more lights.


You should only plug two or three sets together, so make sure to account for that in your length, too. As always, it's better to have more than you need than not enough. Has anyone ever muttered the words, ""There are just too many lights on that Christmas tree?""

, Let’s say your tree is 7 feet (2.1 m) tall. If you need 100 lights per every foot, that’s 700 lights, or 7 100-light sets. As mentioned above, you should only plug in 2 or 3 sets to each other (for safety). If your extension cord isn’t enough, consider getting a splitter or a power strip to accommodate all your strings.


We'll be wrapping your tree from top to bottom (or bottom to top, depending on your method) instead of the standard around and around. This generally makes it easier to place your power strip or extension cord in one place and not worry about it.

Mentally divide the tree into three triangles.,
Take the first string of lights in your hands.,
Start weaving the lights back and forth.,
Work your way down to the bottom.,
Repeat on the other two sides.,
Plug in the lights into an electrical outlet once you are done applying them to the tree.",How to Hang Lights on a Christmas Tree2," Back in the days of yore, parents and children wrapped their tree around and around, passing the cord from one set of hands to another. While you’re more than welcome to this method to keep tradition alive, a more efficient way is to wrap from top to bottom, only tackling one side at a time.


For the record, this works best if you’re only dealing with one main color of lights. Otherwise, you may need more strands of your second color to balance your tree's overall look.

, Nestle the very last bulb at the top of the tree. Pick a side of the tree that you’re going to work on, and mentally map out the triangle in your mind. This is where you’ll be weaving the lights back and forth, left and right.


This is generally easier to do starting at the top. This way if you run out, you can easily connect it towards the bottom nearer your outlet, and camouflage it in the thickness at the bottom of your tree.

, Make a zigzag pattern starting from the top, weaving as tightly as you see fit. Make sure each section is nestled in the tree and unmoving. Try to keep the same distance between ""layers"" of lights so the tree is evenly lit.


You may want to sort of wrap the lights around the branches, putting the branch through the loop in the strand (most light sets are made up of several different strands you can separate). This ensures the lights stay in place and don't get camouflaged behind the shrubbery.

, When you hit the end of a strand, plug in the next set and continue weaving. However, it’s best to not connect more than 3 sets or so, mainly for safety purposes.


If you run out, you have two options: start back up at the top and make a looser weave, or just connect another strand. If you have extra at the bottom, you can start on the next side of the tree (the second triangle you mapped out) and cover the bottom on that side that will inevitably be formed with the next string of lights.

, Now that you’ve got some practice for this new and improved method, sides two and three may be even better. Repeat going from top to bottom, weaving left to right in the same manner as before. Try to keep the weave similar on all sides.

, If you plug them in beforehand, they’ll heat up and be too hot to the touch. Take a look at a job well done. If it’s not perfect, adjust it as necessary.


You can now add other decorations, like ornaments, to the tree and place any presents that you have under the tree. Et voila! Not only is it beautiful, but it'll be easier to take down later, too.

If you have an artificial tree, take it apart.,
Put in the very bottom row of branches and light them up and down on each branch.,
Assemble the middle of the tree, using the same method.,
Keep moving up to the top, lighting up and down and back and forth to illuminate the tree.,
Step back, take a look, and modify as necessary.",How to Hang Lights on a Christmas Tree3," This method is much easier to do with an artificial tree as you can disassemble it and get at the “roots” of the branches. However, if you want a more illuminated tree and you have a real tree, it’s possible – it’s just more work.


Put all the branches in front of you, categorized by where they go on the tree. You'll be starting with the branches that line the bottom.

, Putting in only the bottom row makes it easier to line each branch with lights. Start at the base of one branch, wrap up to its tip, and back down to its root. Keep doing this around each branch on the bottom.


Make sure the lights stay on the sides of the branch by really nestling them in there, or taking the strand and forming into a loop that you can place around the greens. Make sure the strands are snug on the tree and press them together if need be. The beauty of the artificial tree is that it's totally mold-able.

, Once every branch on the bottom is lined up and down, assemble the next level of the tree. Then, take your strand and move it up to the next set of branches, weaving back and forth like you just did, up and down, moving around and around.


If you notice the lights are coming loose, you can wrap them around the branch, too. However, this takes a bit more of the length of the set, and you may be short at the top (unless you have plenty of lights to spare).

, As the tree gets smaller and smaller, you’ll need fewer lights. Unless you want it brighter at the top, make sure you’re using the same ratio of lights as you did on the bottom.


As the tree gets thinner and thinner, your lighting work will be more and more visible. Take extra time toward the top to make sure your tree is as beautiful as possible.

, If some branches seem dimmer or brighter than others, adjust the lights as necessary, bringing them out to pop or nestling them in to be a bit dimmer. You may need to adjust the placement of the branches, too – the one obstacle of the artificial tree.


Make sure to test your lights in all different forms of lighting. Turn your house lights off and look at the tree; then, turn the house lights on. Experiment with all the settings on your strands if applicable, and take a minute to refine it to your tastes. It'll be worth it – this is the centerpiece of Christmas after all.

Select your bottle brush.,
Trim the bristles into a desired shape of the tree, if desired.,
Remove the handle and & adjust the length of the ""trunk"" (optional).,
Mount the tree.,
Add small lights (optional).,
Wire garlands to tree (optional).,
Place your ornaments on the tree (optional).,
Add a tree topper (optional) with a bow of fabric.",How to Make a Christmas Tree Out of a Bottle Brush," Purchase some in the cleaning department of stores or in a place that deals in restaurant goods. Long tube cleaners also be purchased in a science lab company catalog. These can vary in size and shape greatly, depending on what size or shape the container the brush is normally used to clean. The best ones are in cone shape that also come in a spiral bristle arrangement already in the cone shape of a tree which will eliminate the need to really trim the bristles.


The longer the bristles the better. The shorter ones are good if you are not using thick wires or heavy decorations on the tree.
The bristles can be made of natural hairs like from a pig or synthetic like nylon or plastic. Ones with copper or metal bristles are sharp! These metal ones also aren't good to have around lights for the fact that metal conducts electricity causing shock. These cleaning tools also come in many colors and can be easily spray painted if desired.;
, Using scissors trim the top bristles shorter than the lower bristles. This will give the brush a lovely pyramid shape that echoes an evergreen Christmas tree.

, If your going to stick the ""tree"" into a base like a flower-pot the handle of the ""tree"" will come in handy to help give it some support. If the tree is to become part of the center of a wreath or you want to shorten it. Use some wire cutters to cut the wires down to size so it can be stuck into the wreath without the trunk sticking from the bottom

, If you're doing this on a wreath use a grapevine wreath. Press the tree firmly into the wreath form the tangle of vines will hold it in place. You might want to add tacky or hot glue to the trunk to help keep it secure.


If mounting in a container, you can get what is called Smoothfoam or Wet Florist Foam ball the circumference that fits the container inside; then press the trunk into the foam.
Alternatively, pour Plaster of Paris or concrete in a suitable container and set the tree into the base container; let cure following instructions on the packages of the product.
Heavy items like rocks, glass marbles, glass pebbles etc. will allow you to just place the tree into the container. How you mount it in a container will depend on how heavy the tree is or how thick its trunk is.

, It's best to use lights with tiny wires. Also try to opt for the lowest number of lights possible and the shortest wire length. Use lightweight light sets as heavier ones will slide off the tree. LEDs are good candidates. Some LED sets come with very pretty clear, gold or silver wires. Also some lights are too hot for use with the plastic bottle brushes. Small LED lights operated by batteries, rice lights, or a small LED regular sized set with thin wires can work. When installing lights, start with the end of the set on the top and loosely wrap the lights tightly against the trunk of the tree spacing the wire evenly as you go up in a spiral pattern. When you reach close to the top stop and wrap on the way down. Fluff out the bristles when you're done wrapping the lights to help hide the wires. If there is a plug connector on the end start wrapping at bottom going up.


If you're using the thicker, heavier wires use thin wires or twist ties covered in plastic to hold the wires in place you can also use a garland or ornament with wires to hold the wire in place. You can also loosen up the light wire twist in between the bulbs carefully.
If you're wiring the tree on a wreath with lights, start at the tree first. Using the same method as above, wrap the lights going up wrapping evenly and tightly up first in spiral pattern and going down if the end is a bulb. If the end is a plug, start at the bottom of the tree making sure the plug is in the back of the tree and not seen and wrap up to top and around again. This can be tricky with some of the thicker wires and you might want to wrap the wire only in a single wrap and move on.

, This can be done with dental floss, twine, thread, or maybe mono filament wires. For heavy things, consider any jewelry wire or florist wire.


If you don't like the clasp or don't want a clasp on the tree, or to shorten the garland cut the string, cord, that holds the necklace at a knot. If you cut at away from the knot you'll loose beads or the garland! Thread the twine through the loop/ring part of the necklace gather the ends of the twine and make a knot (like tying shoes the first knot) and once the knot is started position the thread loop and garland in desired position and pull tightly until the string is tight against the trunk of the tree. You can always fluff brushes out so the twine string isn't showing.
OR If the clasp is large enough to fit over the treetop find the desired place and clasp the necklace to the center ""trunk"" of the tree and wrap the garland around the tree.
Wrap the garland on the tree tightly like you do the lights lifting bristles as you go so the garland is up against the trunk. When you come to the end of the necklace attach the clasp to the trunk. If the garland slides out of position tie several locations between beads with the twine the same fashion as mentioned above to secure it in place.
Look around for other alternatives to use as garlands. A decorative fabric braid, trimming or sparkling yarn.

, Many ornaments can be purchased with wires already on them. You simply gather the two wire ends or the one wire end and wrap it tightly against the trunk. Ornaments or beads that hang can again be tied to place with twine or dental floss. You can also tie ribbons, twines or roping into bows for the tree easily. Brooches can be used with a little tacky glue or tape and can be latched against the trunk of the tree. With these however, it's better to go with smaller ones or ones with lacy designs or stars as the larger ones will distort the tree.

, Alternatively, if a large brooch suits your taste take a sturdy piece of a heavy gauge ( thick) wire that's strong enough to support the weight of the brooch and a strong glue. After the glue is dry, stick this wired item's stem either against the trunk in the back or in the front using the beaded garland as a support or the wires of the light. Be careful not to poke the wire into the light cords. Also being careful not to cut the garland threads or wires in the process.

Know your target weight gain for pregnancy.,
Plan your weekly diet.,
Obey cravings in moderation.,
Eat around 300 extra calories per day.,
Eat and drink frequently.,
Drink plenty of water.. You should have about 10 cups of fluids a day while you are pregnant.",How to Avoid Gaining Baby Weight1," Knowing how much weight you need to gain while you are pregnant will help you monitor your progress. If you are gaining too much or too little weight, you can make some changes to your diet or physical activity habits. Your doctor can also help you stay on track.


For women at a healthy weight pre-pregnancy, doctors typically recommend gaining 25 to 35 pounds. Underweight women should aim for 28 to 40 pounds, overweight women should aim for 15 to 25 pounds, and obese women should shoot for only 11 to 20 pounds.If you are pregnant with twins or multiples, women at healthy weights should gain 37 to 54 pounds, overweight women should gain 31 to 50, and obese women should gain 25 to 42 pounds.Aim to gain only 2 to 4 pounds during the first trimester, and about 1 pound per week thereafter depending on your total weight gain needs.If you are very overweight, your doctor may want you to lose weight during your pregnancy. Losing weight during pregnancy should always be supervised by a doctor. Note, most women should not be losing weight while they are pregnant.;
, Taking the time to think through a sample menu for the week will help you incorporate foods with important nutrients for a balanced diet during pregnancy, such as whole grains,lean protein,and a variety of fruits and vegetables. Buying groceries with a weekly meal plan in mind can help reduce the chances you will opt for fast food or load up on unhealthy junk foods.


Avoid fish that is high in mercury such as swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish, and shark.Restaurant and fast food versions may contain significantly more calories than their homemade counterparts, so ask for low-calorie menu options if available when eating out.Alternately, by preparing foods yourself you can cut out the extra fat, salt, and sugar that many pre-packaged and restaurant foods contain. This will allow you to eat a greater quantity of nutritious food and help save calories and fat that can add unnecessary and unhealthy baby weight.

, It is not clear why pregnancy cravings happen. Some people think cravings may be your body asking for nutrients that it needs.Your pregnancy cravings are normal, and you can learn the best way to satisfy them.


If you simply can’t resist a calling for chocolate cake, ice cream, cheese fries, or another unhealthy food, have a small serving size to satisfy your craving without mindlessly consuming the entire serving.By measuring out a small portion and putting the rest out of sight, you can reduce the chances of reaching for a second helping. Often, a few small and mindful bites can be just as satisfying as an entire serving, without the eventual guilt or weight gain.

, Eating for two does not mean you need to eat twice as much food. You do not need to eat extra calories during the first trimester. In the second trimester, you should eat an extra 340 calories per day. In your third trimester, you should eat about 450 more calories per day.. You may need more calories if your are very physically active while you are pregnant.


Make sure your extra calories come from healthy foods to avoid empty calories and unhealthy amounts of fat, sugar, and salt. Similarly, keep your diet balanced by avoiding a focus on any single food group. Get your calories from a variety of healthy sources such as whole grains, lean protein, fruits, and vegetables.
If you constantly feel hungry, choose foods that are bulky and filling but low in calories, such as popcorn, rice cakes, raw vegetables, salads, soups, yogurt, oatmeal, and fresh fruits. Being able to eat a large quantity of a healthy and low-calorie food may help satisfy your urge to eat without piling on extra pounds. Eating protein also helps with this problem because it is slower to digest so it keeps you feeling full longer. Simple carbs get digested the quickest so will leave you feeling hungry sooner.
Sample foods to add 100 calories are a spoonful of peanut butter on fresh celery sticks, a cup of non-fat yogurt with a drizzle of honey, a 1/2 cup of sweet corn with seasonings and a small smear of butter, or 10 tortilla chips.
Examples of snacks and meals of approximately 300 calories include a scrambled egg with buttered toast and fresh strawberries, a turkey sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes plus 1 cup of vegetable soup, or a bowl of low-fat granola with 1/2 cup skim milk and a handful of berries.

, Eating small meals throughout the day helps with pregnancy related heartburn, nausea, and indigestion. As your baby grows, you will have less space for big meals as well. Eating smaller meals throughout the day will help you meet your nutritional needs.


Plan on eating about 5 or 6 times per day, spreading your calorie consumption over several small meals and a few healthy snacks.Eating every 2 to 3 hours can help keep you energized and keeps your metabolism active and your blood sugar stable, which will keep you from overindulging and may reduce your risk of gestational diabetes.
Keep healthy, pre-measured snacks on hand at home and on the go. By making it convenient to grab a healthy snack in appropriate serving sizes, you reduce the likelihood of purchasing fast food or vending machine options or finishing an entire bag of potato chips when you need a snack.

, Water carries nutrients to your baby and can help prevent constipation, hemorrhoids, and excessive swelling, and urinary tract and bladder infections. Your 10 cups of fluid does not have to be water only.Avoid sugary and fatty drinks such as flavored coffees, sports drinks, sodas, and whole milk. Opt instead for skim milk or non-dairy alternatives, decaf coffee you flavor or sweeten yourself, a small glass of 100% fruit juice, plain decaf tea, or water."

Consult with your doctor.,
Get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.,
Consider prenatal yoga.,
Avoid lying on your back after the first trimester.,
Be careful with certain activities.,
Listen to your body and make adjustments.",How to Avoid Gaining Baby Weight2," Before you begin an exercise program, make sure your doctor approves. This applies if you were exercising before you were pregnant or if you are starting a new routine.Benefits of exercising while pregnant include prevention of back pain and discomfort, improved sleep, prevention of excess weight gain, increased endurance and muscle strength, and improvements in your mood and energy levels.


Your doctor will help you develop a personalized exercise plan that takes into account your previous exercise habits and any other medical problems you may have.
Exercising could be harmful if you have a low placenta, a weak cervix, a previous history of miscarriages, or a history of early labor., Walking, low-impact aerobics, swimming, and cycling on a stationary bike are recommended. You should be able to talk while you are exercising. If you are unable to talk, you may be exercising to vigorously.If you exercised regularly before getting pregnant, you should be able to continue the exercise for most of your pregnancy. Exceptions to this may be those who participated in dangerous, high-intensity, or very strenuous activities. If you previously jogged, swam, danced, biked, or practiced yoga, chances are it will be safe and beneficial for you to continue.
If you were inactive before pregnancy, it is still advisable to begin light forms of exercise, such as taking regular walks or swimming a few laps. You should start with 5 minutes of physical activity a day and build up until you can do at least 30 minutes a day.You should always warm up and cool down and drink plenty of fluids while you are exercising., Prenatal yoga incorporates many exercises that will help you with strength, flexibility, relaxation, and breathing.Yoga is a nice compliment to aerobic exercise and is a great way to meet other pregnant women.


Look for instructors who are trained in prenatal yoga. If your instructor is not trained, let them know that you are pregnant. You may need to modify poses as your pregnancy progresses.
Avoid hot yoga which will cause your body temperature to increase too much. If you are new to yoga, you should avoid power yoga., This position puts pressure on a major vein, your vena cava, and can decrease blood flow to your brain, heart, and uterus.. This can make you feel dizzy or have shortness of breath.

, Scuba diving, contact sports, activities that may cause injury to your abdominal area, and activities with a high risk of falling should be avoided. Strength training is fine, but you should not be lifting extremely heavy weights (nothing over 20 pounds).


Avoid exercising outside on extremely hot and humid days.

, Pay attention to how you feel during exercise. If anything does not feel right, you should stop immediately. Your body is constantly changing and requires more oxygen and energy than before you were pregnant. You should never exercise until you are exhausted.Keep in mind that extra pregnancy weight puts more stress on your joints and changes your center of gravity. Pregnancy hormones also cause your ligaments to loosen which increases your risk of injury.
Make sure you are eating enough because exercise burns calories. The recommended 300 extra calories per day may not be enough if you are exercising regularly.Monitor your weight gain and make adjustments to your diet.
Stop exercising if you have any of these symptoms: pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, chest pain, abnormal vaginal fluid, muscle weakness, irregular or rapid heartbeat, abdominal pain, feel dizzy or lightheaded.Contact your doctor if your symptoms continue after you stop exercising.

Speak with your doctor.You should make an appointment for preconception counseling.,
Lose extra pounds if you are overweight.Being at a healthy weight before you become pregnant is important for your health and the health of the baby.,
Engage in regular physical activity.,
Have healthy diet.Your pre-pregnancy diet should include all of the necessary nutrients: lean protein, complex carbohydrates, dairy products, and 5 to 9 nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day.",How to Avoid Gaining Baby Weight3," Your doctor will discuss your medical history, current medications, family health history, your weight, exercise habits, your home and workplace environment, and other lifestyle factors. This visit will help you become as healthy as possible before you become pregnant.

, You should talk to your doctor to determine how much weight you should lose. Even if you do not meet your weight loss goal, losing some weight will still be beneficial.


You should lose pre-pregnancy weight in a healthy manner. A good diet and exercise program are recommended., Moderate aerobic activities (i.e. walking, jogging, dancing, and swimming), Pilates, yoga, and weight training are good exercise options.Your exercise routine should increase your endurance and build strength. Having strong core muscles and pelvic floor muscles will help you when you are pregnant.


Talk with your doctor if you have any questions about a safe exercise routine. Be careful of extremely vigorous exercise such as marathon training or super intense exercise classes. Exercise puts stress on the body. Vigorous exercise may make it more difficult for you to conceive.You should aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity cardiovascular exercise each day.

,


Your daily caffeine intake should not be more than 200mg a day which is equivalent to 12 oz. of coffee.
You should have a sufficient daily iron intake. Iron rich foods include eggs, nuts, green vegetables, and dark meats. Vitamin C will help your body absorb plant sources of iron.Omega-3 fats and omega-6 fats should be in your diet as well. Walnuts, spinach, and flaxseed are good sources of these fats. You may also take a fish oil supplement 1 to 2 times a week.
It is also a good idea to stop drinking alcohol when you are planning to conceive.
You should begin taking prenatal vitamins as well. These vitamins will provide your body with any nutrients that your diet does not provide. The most important vitamins and minerals are folic acid, iron, iodine, and calcium.Your doctor may prescribe you a specific type of prenatal vitamin.

Keep your tree away from a heat source.,
Place it near a semi-sunny window.",How to Keep Your Christmas Tree Fresh Longer," Go to your local Christmas tree farm and cut the tree down yourself. This is the best way to ensure that your tree stays fresh all season long. Many trees that are sold in lots are cut down one to two weeks prior to making it to the lot, thereby guaranteeing that they will begin to brown and dry out one to two weeks earlier than you would like. Not to mention, precut trees are generally not watered until they are set up and decorated., Needles on firs, pines, and Blue Spruces last the longest, with or without water. If possible, opt for one of these Christmas tree varieties—especially if you must buy a precut tree., Whether you cut down the tree yourself, or whether you buy a precut tree, always buy the freshest one available. Start by checking each tree for brown needles; the ones with the least amount of brown will be your top contenders.

, Once you’ve eliminated the trees with any brown needles, run your hands through the branches of the freshest looking trees. The freshest trees will retain their needles even through the disruption.


To shake out remaining dead needles, pick up your final selection and drop it on its trunk (obviously, you can only do this if you visit a precut farm). Very few, if any, green needles should drop to the ground.

, Examine your tree carefully for beetles, mites, and aphids before taking it home. Many precut trees are transported from the tree farm to the city in truck loads, and acquire unwanted bugs and pests along the way. Many of the pests found on Christmas trees suck the nutrients right out of the tree as fast as you can put them in.


Look for odd needle discoloration, needle feeding (where parts of the needles appear to be eaten), injuries to shoots or branches, shoots that are webbed together, shoots that are more than one color (red, yellow, and brown), pitches or holes in the bark, places where bark is missing, and small “blisters” on shoots or branches., If you brought your own saw, go ahead and use it. However, Christmas tree farms generally have saws designed for the best cut on a Christmas tree; use theirs if available. And remember: when cutting a tree down yourself, always be sure to wear the proper safety gear. This includes a helmet, earmuffs, and safety glasses.


Be sure to estimate the “felling zone,” the zone in which the tree is likely to fall. In order to do this, use the ax handle trick. Hold an ax at arm’s length away from you, close one eye, and back away from the tree. When the top of the ax is even with the top of the tree, stop. Where your feet are at is where the top of the tree should land.
Begin cutting the trunk low to the ground—as low as you can go. Cut straight across. If you do not like how the bottom branches look, keep in mind that you can always trim those off. However, you cannot add length to the tree trunk, and if it does not fit inside the stand, you will not be able to display your tree for the holidays.
If possible, have someone hold the tree as high up as they can reach. This will prevent the tree from falling, and therefore, prevent any damage to the limbs and needles.
Once the tree is cut, have someone help you carry it. You do not want to drag it through the mud. Again, this will damage the branches and needles. Not to mention, it will collect dirt, mud, and pests that you do not want in your home.

, If you plan on placing your tree inside of your vehicle, opt to have it bailed. This will make it easier to fit inside of your vehicle, and prevent any branches from bending or breaking in the process of trying to get it in and out.


If you choose to put your tree on top of your vehicle, lay down a blanket (to protect the paint) and lay the tree butt forward. This is very important, as it will keep the branches from catching any wind and blowing off the needles.
If you have a luggage rack, tie the tree twice to both sides.
If you do not have a luggage rack, wrap the twine or rope through the windows or doors at the front of the vehicle and again at the back., Cut another ½ inch to an inch off the bottom of your tree when you get it home. Once a tree is cut, sap will start to seal over the base and therefore hinder the tree’s ability to receive water.Once you make the cut, immediately place your tree in a bucket of water until you have the tree stand set up.

, Like most plants, Christmas trees typically require a continuous water supply to stay fresh. Most Christmas tree stands hold about a gallon of water; at the very least, keep the water level above the base of the trunk.


Check your tree daily to make sure that it does not run out of water.
If your tree still ends up getting dry despite your best efforts to keep it watered, drill some holes into the base to allow for a direct entry point for the water.

, If you have one, run a humidifier in the same room that your Christmas tree is in. Though not necessary, a humidifier can keep your tree from drying out, and therefore, help it stay fresher longer.


You can also choose to spray your tree with an anti-transpirant so that it will retain moisture better and thus stay fresher longer.

, Measure the space where your tree is going to be located to determine just how big of a tree you can actually get. Many families, when they get their tree home, find that the tree they picked is far too big for the location they had in mind for it. In order to accommodate their tree, they cut branches, bend branches, and trim the tops. But if not done properly, pruning and trimming can actually kill your tree.Take the tape measure and measure the height, width, and depth of the space. To determine the maximum height that will work for the space, remove one foot of height to allow for the tree topper, and another six inches to allow for the tree stand.
Because Christmas trees tend to be symmetrical, use the smaller of the width and depth measurements to determine how round of a tree you can get., Keep your tree away from any source of heat to keep its needles fresh longer, as well as to reduce the risk of starting a house fire. The quickest way to dry out a Christmas tree is to place it directly near or above a heat source.


If you place your tree next to a fireplace, be sure to douse the fire before leaving the room. Never leave your tree next to an unattended lit fireplace.
If you place the tree near an independent heat source, shut off the heat source whenever you are not using the room.
Lightbulbs and fairy lights are heat sources too! When decorating, use LED (light emitting diode) lights, which burn cooler and are also much more energy efficient.

, Place the tree near a window with optimal sunlight—such as one facing the east, so it gets sunlight in the morning and shade in the afternoon. Like all plants, too much sunlight can quickly dry out a Christmas tree, but not enough sunlight can cause it to wither and die.

Have your invitees call in or email their RSVP to you, to avoid relying on the mail in the postal service's busy time of year.;
, Buy or chop down the tree and place it up for display, so that all that needs to be completed for your helpers to do is to decorate it.

, Keep things light and airy and dedicated to the topic at hand - decorating your Christmas tree.

, Talk amongst the group of family and relatives. Collaborate on what needs to get done around the house to spruce things up for the holiday season, but try to switch gears shortly thereafter to get the real party started.

, Show people the tree, along with the boxes or ornaments, tinsel, Christmas lights and whatever stuff the tree will need that have been put to the side. Keep them nearby as that's part of the plan.

, One person can work the lights in the back of the tree, while the other can help with those lights when they reach into the front.


Start with stranding the lights from bottom to top (unless your outlet is near the top of the wall and out of the way of the tree).

, Have a few people work on adding ornaments to the tree. With ornaments, always work from top to bottom, never bottom to top, and definitely don't stagger from random places on the tree. Decorate the back of the tree with ornaments as well as the front. Skip a random branch or two to avoid making the tree off-balance.


You can try setting up a ""production line"" or ""factory line"" for passing on decorations when adding ornaments to the tree, but keep in mind that too many people and things could get confusing, and you can easily end up with uneven branches, or worse yet, ornaments on every branch of the tree or broken ornaments.
As people finish their side of the tree, they can settle back and snack on some chips, cookies or cake and collaborate.

, But don't just sit back and relax, get in there and help out.

,, Jazzy the tree up with decorative items.

, Let those dedicated to decorating the tree take a final look around the tree, to ensure that no single branch is out of place and the tree looks spiffy. Take some photos of your hard work, and be sure to get a shot of everyone who helped, posing with the end result. If you have the technical know-how, why not film the whole thing with a camera on a tripod facing the tree. The completed film can then be 'time lapsed' to create your own short film.

Remember that milestone development is relative.,
Avoid turning parenting into a competition.,
Let your friend feel that she’s won her self-initiated contest.,
Surround yourself with other like-minded moms.,
Keep in mind that your child’s development is not a direct extension of your parenting skills.",How to Stop Competing With Other Moms," Keep in mind that Einstein didn’t speak until he was four years old, so the fact that your friend’s daughter is forming sentences at 10 months should be meaningless to you. The only reason you want your children to hit certain milestones is to ensure that he or she is developing on schedule, a schedule that has fairly wide margins. As long as your pediatrician is confident with your child’s development then relax and instead enjoy the stage he or she is currently in. Remember––you don’t always want what you wish for. You could be green with envy that your friend’s toddler walked at an early age, but only realize that early walking means early running... and more chasing for you.


Listen to experts before your friends. Moms like to boast about how quickly it took to potty train their children or how quickly their child learned to read. In some cases it's a backhanded way of saying that the mom is smart; in other cases, it's about proving that the child is smarter than the other children. Try to put the earplugs in when discussing children with other mothers and focus only on what your pediatrician or educators tell you about your child’s individual development.
Instead of being jealous, try to gain knowledge from friends whose children are at a different milestone. These are the friends who can tell you what to look for or how to tackle certain challenges with a stage––equally, they can tell you what not to worry about (plenty!). For example, friends can recommend certain types of books or a great strategy for coping when your child hits a certain stage. And they can help advise you about all the seemingly odd or unusual things that kids do, to reassure you that it's okay.
Don’t get too involved in parenting books. While parenting books are ideal for preparation and to let you know what may be coming up next, don’t rigidly adhere to the book, as you may end up competing with the book. Unfortunately, children don’t come with directions––parenting books are designed to help us what we may (or may not) expect during certain milestone stages. But they're no more than a reflection of one person's opinion about raising children and they are as human as you. Indeed, sometimes a parenting book is a useful gauge for how you will not treat your child if you disagree with the author's approach!;
, Remember that being a parent is not a competition––it's a vocation, an act of love and a responsibility but it isn't a sprint to the finish line (actually, there is no finish line!). Your goal is to raise a healthy, happy, confident child so despite what your friends are doing, you have to do what feels right in your mind and in your heart. Children are resilient and forgive most things when there is love in abundance; for example, missing out on the extracurricular craziness imposed on your child's peers in the name of competitiveness isn't going to break your child and may actually improve your child's resourcefulness.


Stop yourself when you start comparing your child to your friends’ children or the children in your mother's group. When you see yourself measuring your child up to everyone else, take a breath and back off. If need be, count to 10, practice deep breathing and clear your mind. You will be a freer person if you can stop making comparisons and your child will be better off too. Realize that you will be teaching your child by example how to handle such social pressure.
Remember that every child develops at a different rate and has different gifts. While your friend’s child may be talented in sports, your child may develop into a gifted painter. Don't try to shove your child into a box in an effort to “one up” your friends. Allow him or her to develop talents naturally and intuitively, while providing love and support along the way.
Keep an open mind in situations where moms may be more inclined to make comparisons. Certain environments such as some “mom and tot” groups or children’s sports may produce some boastful parental behavior about childhood milestones. Go into such environments keeping this in mind and take what other moms say with a grain of salt. Always bear in mind that nothing binds you to such groups either––if you really hate going to them and having your child up for comparison, call it quits and do something much more constructive with your time.

, Decide to stop competing in order to put a halt to the comparisons. Remember––once someone has “won” a competition the race is over. The quickest way to stop the mommy contest is to not respond when a friend boasts about her child’s developmental milestone. Or simply say, “That’s great, congratulations"", or ""Good for your child.” Don’t add to the conversation or try to tell her what your child is doing––most likely she doesn’t care and would only want to hear about it in order to use as a metric for her own child’s development. With the fuel removed, you'll also get a good indicator of whether you're really friends with this mom or you were just useful to have around to help make her feel more secure about herself; you'll soon know by whether or not it remains easy to spend time together.

, Not all moms want to compare milestones, in fact some moms “compete” to see which child makes goofier (or the most embarrassing) mistakes, instead of which child is further ahead. You’ll find that when you're in a group of moms who are rooted in reality, comparing stories will actually be a lot more fun and remind you that your child is normal. Finding such moms after a bad experience can be a little daunting though. Try using meet up sites online, either looking for a new mom's group or starting one of your own, with clear parameters that the meet-ups are not about being competitive.


Talk openly to other moms. When you click with a mom who feels the same way that you do about parenting not being a competitive sport, get her contact details and stay connected. By slowly increasing your pool of non-competitive mom friends, you'll build up the confidence to repel competitiveness in parenting.

, Some parents take their child’s development far too personally, believing that the way the child performed on a test or if he or she walked early has something directly to do with the parent’s abilities, time input and how many Baby Mozart CDs were purchased and religiously listened to. While you can support, encourage and nurture your child’s development, whether he or she becomes a doctor or a professional football player (or whatever your dreams are for your child) should not be an extension of you and what you wanted from life. Moreover, as a guide, you should set limits to ensure good behavior and wise choices but you cannot determine how your child's personality will eventually shape itself and what choices your child will end up making later in their life. If you believe that you are judged by how your child turns out, instill good manners in them and respect for others, but don't measure your child against the children of other people or you will live a life in which you feel constantly afraid of not meeting arbitrary and often changing socially set standards. That's not living––it's conforming and barely enjoying life.


Avoid comparing your success to your child’s. If you regret not going to Harvard, avoid projecting that regret onto your child. Keep his or her dreams and your dreams completely separate so that your child can grow into the adult with a fulfilling life.
Stop yourself from bragging to friends about your child’s milestones. If you want to get off the milestone bragging wheel, you have to stop gabbing about what marvel your child has achieved to other moms. While you should be able to tell close friends and family members your child took his/her first steps (who are truly happy for your child and don’t want to compete), don’t throw the information into the mommy ring. Doing this may only set you up for another round of “one upping.”
Take care when praising your child. Telling your child that he or she is smarter, better looking, cleverer, etc. than other children can create a praise monster who feels totally entitled. It is better to be honest about shortcomings and teach your child early on that effort, determination and continually trying will win over innate talent and looks.and that's true

Be prepared.,
Reduce or cut down on your TV viewing.,
Help your kids to understand your need for a little space and some time out now and then.,
Adjust your sleep patterns such that you have a clear 30 minutes or one hour to write before everyone else gets up.,
Get the children involved.,
Carry an always-ready notebook.,
Use multiple writing tools or resources.,
Persevere.",How to Find Time to Write when You're a Busy Mom," Set up one area of the house that is your writing space. It's easier to maintain a routine and to have others accept it if there is evidence of a ""space where mom goes to write"". However, even if you don't have your own desk, you can make a small box of materials such as writing paper, pens, pencils, board for leaning on, etc., that is easily accessible at a moment's notice and can be used anywhere.


If you don't have a desk, consider buying a used one online; alternatively, if you lack the space for such an indulgence, designate one area of the house that is pleasant and away from everyone where you can write without feeling bothered by the household activity.;
, Watching the television can easily suck away many hours without you even noticing and it's productive time that you can't redeem. If you use these hours to pursue your writing passion instead, you will be amazed at the additional time available.


Many moms use TV as a form of relaxing. If you can train yourself to use writing as a form of relaxing, you'll be able to remind yourself that it is still restful for you.

, While helping toddlers to understand this will be a little harder, this is precisely the age during which it is important to show your kids that mom takes out time for herself now and then. Not only is this not a selfish thing to do but it is a good lesson for them in time management and in taking care of oneself rather than totally sacrificing one's own needs for others. Your example is a healthy one.


Talk to children of any age about why you enjoy writing, the benefits that come from it, and the importance of having a little quiet time now and then to achieve your objectives.

, Writing before everyone else gets up in the morning can be a sanity saver as it's quiet, peaceful and you'll often feel very energetic because it's the start of the day. This can become a really treasured and special time if you get into the routine. The only thing to accept is that this time is limited and you need to be disciplined so that you don't feel disappointed when the household starts stirring and you need to stop writing for the day. Perhaps set an alarm so that you write within the time and then begin the daily routine before everyone gets up.

, Younger children can sit down and read or draw while you write. Older kids can be encouraged to write with you! Give them a space to sit down and ask them to brainstorm writing ideas. Encourage them to write away and suggest that you will read their writing when it is finished. It is a great opportunity to encourage their love of writing and to help them learn about constructive feedback.


Encourage them to write their own journals, novels, cookbooks, stories or comic books.

, This should be small enough to tuck into your handbag and to tote around anywhere that you go. Take it out when you have spare moments, such as waiting for transport, standing in a queue, eating lunch, keeping yourself awake during a tedious meeting where concentrating isn't essential but looking alert is!


Jot down ideas and thoughts that you know will be helpful in informing more substantial writing later. This is a great discipline for keeping track of great ideas that might otherwise be forgotten.

, Although a computer might be easy for writing on, it's not necessarily the most easily accessible item when parenting children, or when out and about. Moreover, computers cause us to write and think differently from writing on paper. Give yourself the luxury of writing in both paper and digital media, and transfer any handwritten efforts to digital at a later stage. If you need inspiration, consider J.K. Rowling who is renowned for taking a notebook to cafes to write, rather than relying on using a computer all the time.

, Children grow up and so will your writing skills. Over time, both develop in incredibly wonderful and creative ways that you probably never imagined. Achieving a balance between raising your kids, juggling the household, working outside the house (if relevant), and pursuing is a hard task but with good organization and clarity of goals, you can achieve this combination in small and gradual ways. Be tenacious, be focused, and you will continue writing away, even as a busy mom.

Develop and implement a schedule that includes your daily routines.,
Connect with a local mom's group for mothers with children of similar ages.It is helpful to meet other moms who understand your experience, and with whom you can exchange tips and resources.

,
Stop trying to do everything.,
Refuel.,
Lighten up and have fun.,
Remember that you have value.As a SAHM, you have chosen to take out time to teach your children your values and morals in a more hands-on and directed way than might happen if you were working as well.In doing so, you will be helping the next generation carry on what you consider important, and that's as valuable a role as any in this world.

",How to Enjoy Being a Stay at Home Mom," For example, common routines are breakfast, class, snack, lunch, nap time, and afternoon snack, and it is important to leave time slots open for flexibility, such as for special events and activities. While you might be tempted to see more freedom without having a schedule in place, you'll find it benefits both you and your children to know what is coming up next throughout the day, and it helps remove that feeling of ""where did that day go?!"".,, There are only so many hours in a day and no mom is a superwoman. Outsource routine tasks that are important to complete, but keep you from focusing on your children, such as cleaning or ironing (realizing that this ""outsourcing"" can be to other family members!). If that's not affordable or achievable, sort out a way to get it done so that it won't stress you out. For example, it is a good idea to lower high expectations of a perfectly maintained home and it helps to find clothes that don't need regular ironing or repairs.

, If you are a stay-at-home mom, you are in ""give"" mode the majority of the time. Serving your children and family when your tank is on ""E"" is dangerous for everyone. Schedule ""mom time"" on the calendar at least once a week. This could be catching up with friends, going to the movies, having a facial or massage, or taking a hike on your favorite local trail.

, Children are a ton of work, but they are also loads of fun. Don't allow yourself to get so overwhelmed by the work that you forget to enjoy your children. Watch how they have fun and join in - they'll love having mom share in their games, coming down to their level.

Begin nursing your daughter in the hospital.,
Try to breastfeed for at least 6 months.",How to Nurture the Mother Daughter Relationship from Infancy1," Women have the most success with breastfeeding when they try to start exclusively breastfeeding in the hospital.


If you would like assistance or tips to make it more comfortable and to make sure you are producing enough milk, ask for help from a nurse or breastfeeding counselor while you are in the hospital.;
, The bonding benefits of breastfeeding continue as long as you keep nursing your baby.

Consider nursing through her entire first year to maintain a routine of cuddling and holding your baby so that she associates you with food, comfort, safety, and love.

Make grooming a mother-daughter experience.,
Let your daughter try to be like you.,
Bring your daughter along for your favorite activities.",How to Nurture the Mother Daughter Relationship from Infancy2," Share the bathing, hair combing, tooth brushing, dressing, and other grooming routines with your daughter.


Showing her how to care for herself and establishing a routine during which she can count on your personal attention teaches her from a young age that you are there to take care of her.

, Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and it also indicates that your daughter is trying to learn her cues for behavior from you. If your daughter tries to mimic your body language, activities, or routines, invite her to participate and to learn from you. However, keep in mind that she is an individual. Encourage her to participate in activities with you, but let her explore her own interests.


Set good examples. If you have negative feelings toward your looks or body shape, you risk passing on these same issues to your daughter. Learn to embrace your size and your imperfections and teach her to love herself regardless of the often unrealistic media images presented on the ""perfect body"".
Always talk to your daughter openly about body image issues. Be honest about your own feelings and avoid being judgmental of how she looks. If you find it hard to talk about, there are excellent resources available in books and online for helping you approach body image and related issues with your daughter.

, If you love to jog, bring your daughter with you in a jogging stroller; if you love to shop, people-watch, garden, cook, or read, find ways to bring your daughter with you or help her to be a part of the action at your side.


Involve your daughter in chores early on, as a way to develop personal responsibility rather than enforcing an ""expected role."" If you have sons, include them as well, doing the same amount of chores, so that your daughter and sons learn that chores are the shared responsibility of all householder, to ensure the smooth running of a household.

Tell your daughter you love her often.,
Give your daughter physical tokens of affection.,
Listen and stay engaged.",How to Nurture the Mother Daughter Relationship from Infancy3," Raising a daughter who is in no doubt of the fact that you love her accustoms her to a loving, supportive relationship with you; if she gets used to hearing and saying the words “I love you” from a young age, she will know that your love is one thing she never has to worry about losing.

, Especially while your daughter is an infant, cover her with kisses, embrace her on a regular basis, and incorporate cuddle time into your regular nap time routine. As she grows older, never stop hugging her, in both the good times and the bad. The power of touch remains important throughout your lives together.


These physical expressions of love not only teach your daughter how to show and accept affection, but they also accustom her to a relationship with her mother that values regular hugs and kisses.
As a bonus, physical affection will release more oxytocin, cementing your mother-daughter bond with chemical reinforcement.

, Your daughter will know the difference between attentive listening and making a pretense at listening. If you cannot set aside time to listen to something she has to say at a certain moment, suggest making a time when you will be free to sit down and talk, and then make good on that. Let her know that what she has to say is valued and that you will always make the time for her.

Make your daughter feel special.,
Share your life with her.",How to Nurture the Mother Daughter Relationship from Infancy4," Even if you have other children, it is essential to spend alone time with each child on a regular basis so that they know how much you value them as an individual.


Carve out time to play one-on-one with your baby girl however she likes, as often as possible, and treat her to little surprise kisses or signs of affection.
As your daughter ages, take her on mother-daughter shopping days, haircut days, or other activities that allow the 2 of you to spend time in just each other’s company on a regular basis.

, When something good happens at work, dance with your daughter to celebrate. If someone passes away in the family, talk to your daughter and grieve with her.


Sharing your emotions and experiences with your daughter teachers her that you value her in good times and in bad, and shows her that your mother-daughter bond is strong enough to share in triumphs as well as in sorrows.

Wear loose-fitting clothing for the ride to the hospital.,
Know that you will be asked to change into a nightgown.,
Try to wear undergarments suited to pregnancy.,
Consider bringing your own nightgown.,
Make sure your hair is comfortable and out of the way.,
If it's hot, wear loose, light-colored clothing, and nothing on your feet.",How to Dress for When You’re in Labor1," Wear a long dress, a long skirt, or pajamas. If it's warm out, you don't need pants. If it's cold, wear a pair of sweatpants. Try to find something that buttons down so that doctors can quickly remove your clothing if necessary. Once you arrive in the maternity ward, most hospitals will provide you with a nightgown to wear through the birth.


If your water has already broken, you may just want to wear a long dress or skirt. Your pants will become soaked with amniotic fluid before you get to the hospital. Alternately, wear a loose-fitting top and loose-fitting elastic pants, and use a sanitary napkin.
If your water has not yet broken, you should be fine wearing sweats or pajamas.;
, In the end, if you are having your baby in a hospital, it does not matter what you are wearing before you arrive at the hospital in active labor. You will be asked to change into a hospital gown upon your arrival. By this point, what you are wearing will be the last thing on your mind!, Cotton is best. Try to avoid underwiring and harsh straps in bras; you will be more comfortable if you wear elastic straps instead. It's best not to wear anything underneath a long dress.


If you are expecting to go into labor at any moment, make sure that you are wearing old underwear. When your water breaks, your underwear will be ruined.

, The hospital will provide you with one of their gowns to wear during labor, but you have the option to bring your own nightgown. You do not have to use the one the hospital provides for you. There are pros and cons to both options, but ultimately the choice is up to you.Some women prefer to use the gown that the hospital provides because they don’t have to worry about getting it dirty. The gown will be stained with blood and other fluids during labor, and these may not come out in the wash.
However, some women don't worry about this, and prefer to wear their own gown. You may feel most comfortable in your own gown, even if you buy it new and only wear it this one time. Consider whether your peace of mind is worth the price of a nightgown that you will only wear once.
For long or stalled labors, your physician may ask you to walk the halls of the hospital to hurry things along. If you overheat easily, be sure that your nightgown is long enough for you to comfortably walk the halls without donning a robe. Some women become overheated during labor.

, A small ponytail, a simple braid, or even a messy bun should do the trick. You can also just keep your hair down, if you don't mind it being in your face. If your hair is long, bring an elastic ponytail holder to tie it back. If your hair is short, an elastic headband can help keep hair out of your face. Most women sweat during heavy labor and delivery, and keeping the hair off of your face will make you that much more comfortable.

, It's okay to go barefoot in the hospital. You should be in light, loose, light-colored clothing that will keep you as cool as possible. If you start to get too hot, ask for cool water or ice chips.

Form your own ideas about where the tendency to overdo parenting comes from.,
Change your perspective.,
Stay away from Alpha moms.,
Stop being a helicopter mom.,
Let your kid get muddy, dirty, wet, and yes, pooey even.,
Ditch Baby Mozart.,
Cull the toy collection.,
Restrain yourself from overloading the kids' after-school curriculum.,
Expect self-responsibility from your children and trust that they'll be OK.,
Expect your husband or partner to pick up some of the slack.,
Chill and stop feeling guilty.",How to Be a Slacker Mom," While your personal reasoning for overdoing your mom role will be very unique to you, it can be helpful to understand some of the theorizing behind why it is thought that hyper-parenting has arisen in recent years:


Some commentators say that many moms transfer the zeal they applied to a career to their parenting, treating motherhood as another form of profession and social competition.Sometimes it's a case of needing to define one's own worth by feeling better than the mom next door whose choices are different from yours, rather than accepting that each mom is an individual who is making good choices.For other moms, it's just about trying to keep up with the Alpha mom model developed by the marketing industry, where educated woman meets super mom in applying corporate-style organizational skills and technological agility to parenting.And for some moms, it boils down to being afraid of what might happen to their children and to their mothering role, in a society where fear is a constant via media messages.
Whatever the reasons behind super intense parenting, if it's not working for you and you spend a lot of your time feeling stressed, guilty, and unhappy about maintaining this level of socialized competition, then it might be time to call time out for mom and start looking at alternative, less stressful ways to parent.;
, There are a number of ways that you can perceive motherhood and all the tasks accompanying it and that's really the key message - you make the choices on how to parent. If you're a mom who wants to step out of the fast lane and start parenting with the same amount of love but a lot less competitiveness, you can get off to a great start by:


No longer viewing motherhood and parenting as a form of competition. Your mothering is not subject to a performance review, and your children are not the end product of a project.
Allowing yourself to make mistakes.
Lowering your expectations. Today's generation of moms have been raised to believe that they can do and have it all. Unfortunately, such a sweeping expectation places a lot of pressure on moms who translate this into meaning that they must literally ""do and be everything"".Cutting down on digesting other people's mothering advice, especially the advice from people who have very little to do with your own lifestyle. From talk show gurus to self-appointed parenting experts in mommy blogs, you don't need it if it doesn't resonate with you. Getting a guilt trip just because someone else has a foolproof mommy plan is a waste of your life and an unfair burden to place on yourself. Remember the adage that parenting doesn't come with a manual – there's a good reason for that saying as it's based on the reality that we're all unique and we all have to discover our own parenting journey.
Allowing yourself to be more laid back and less ""in control"".

Avoiding judging other moms. If you're tempted to judge another mom according to your own standards, switch it to supporting her choices instead.

, If your normal personality style is to take it easy, or you've simply worked out that all this crazed effort isn't producing the results it is supposed to, hanging around Alpha moms who spend a lot of time convincing one another of the need to hyper-parent and serving as a source of stoking the competitive fire is going to make you feel worse. The answer is very simple – keep away from them if they can't keep their competitiveness toned down around you. There is absolutely no reason on Earth why you should accede to their standards and even less for you to judge yourself according to them. Realize that much of what Alpha moms support is gleaned from popular media and is probably accepted by them without question.


If you do have to spend time around Alpha moms, try to view their expectations with compassion and be grateful that you're not stuck in the same mindset. This is a far healthier reaction than taking on board all the unrealistic expectations and beating yourself up for your own imperfections as a mom.
Find like-minded slacker moms and form your own haphazard meet-ups and chill-out sessions, with lots of unstructured play going on as you chat and relax together.

, A term coined to described moms into hyper-mothering, helicopter moms hover around their kids all day long and well into the evening too. It's a phenomenon that is particularly noticeable among the professionally educated middle class.Helicopter moms are so afraid that their child might harm themselves or come to harm from some other person, TV program, website, or activity, that they can't abide for the child to be out of their sight and spend a lot of time present with their child, directing and commenting on every moment of the day. For some moms, this goes so far as to necessitate homeschooling for their kids (as opposed to homeschooling parents who value this for ideological reasons). Helicopter moms are in denial of their child's right to grow through testing. It's your role to create sensible boundaries but not to be that boundary 24 hours a day.


Several studies have shown that children of helicopter moms at college age are more dependent, more neurotic, and less open than other college students.Surely that's not something you're keen to impose on your children!
Helicopter mothering is time-consuming and emotionally draining on you as a mother. Interestingly, mothers have been investing more and more time in at home child-care activities since 1965 despite their increased labor force participation; this trend is especially prevalent among educated women, a sign of trying to ""do it all"".If you're juggling work, helicopter parenting, and a marriage, the marriage tends to suffer first. Having an intense relationship with children can serve as a form of blocking out other people in your life, including other relatives and your local community.That isn't giving your children a healthy role model, including the essential one of involving them in volunteering.
Realize that sometimes being your child's best friend isn't a good idea - it's harder to set boundaries, it smothers the child, and you neglect your own friends and remaining family.

, Kids need to touch, test, push and pull stuff around. If you're always there stopping them from touching what nature provides us, they'll grow to fear nature, dirt, and getting all gooey. They can also learn how to deal with hazards like dog poo and the immediate, common sense need to wash it off rather than feeling grossed out all the time. Don't scare them away from their backyard. Instead, do some reading about the good that being in nature can do for children, or better still, get out there and see the results on your children's faces.


Read Richard Louv's book Last Child in the Wood to learn about the benefits of nature and dirt for kids. There are more and more sites devoted to getting children ""back into nature"" if you don't have any ideas of how to go about this,and you can also check out wikiHow's article on How to help children appreciate nature.

, No child ever suffered from a lack of Mozart being played to them in the belly. Nobody is yet sure if the same can be said about playing it though! The belly comes perfectly equipped with its own lovely woosh woosh sounds, along with the added bonus of mom's voice. What more does a baby need? Not Mozart. Hang on to your money and put it in a college fund instead.

, Kids don't need the latest gizmos of this, that, and the other. To overload their lives with toys is to teach them early on that materialism matters. The only materialism they need to know that matters is a good roof over their head, healthy food in their stomachs regularly, and an ability to appreciate the hot and cold running water and internal temperature controls. Toys can be made from anything and indeed, most kids start off preferring the packaging anyway.

, Kids don't need all those extra activities to grow into fulfilled human beings. They need to know they can play freely and use their imagination. Kids need the freedom of doing nothing so that they teach themselves how to do something with nothing.


If their entire lives are filled with activities and the need to achieve, you might just be perpetuating office clones that a work-driven society too easily succumbs to facilitating.
Be kind to your kids and don't overdo the extra activities. Listen to their messages about what they're enjoying and not enjoying and keep the after-school activities balanced with time for play, rest, and genuine homework.
Stop doing your child's homework. They'll never learn self-responsibility while they have you to do it, and it's taking more time out of your day than you have to spare. They'll thank you later for the lesson in self-discipline.

, Doing everything for your children is not a healthy way to bring up children as you're setting them up to be adults with an expectation that there will be someone else to do it. Even when they realize that isn't the case, they can suffer a lifetime of resentment at being ""made"" to do anything, from housework to finding work.


Have children learn to be responsible for making their own lunch from an early age.
Allow unstructured play. Let the children get bored and learn how to get themselves out of that state, or at least cope with feeling that way.
Do a search online for ""free-range"" kids or parenting.You will find a lot of resources and forums for moms who want to raise their kids on a looser leash, and who are letting go of the fear messages and trusting their instincts instead. Free-range parents trust their children to develop a sense of responsibility early in life, making everyone's life a little less fettered and raising more self-reliant kids. Read the stories of other mothers tired of the fear and worry messages about parenting and find some relief!

, If you're trying to do it all yourself, hand some of the responsibilities over. Dad has a role in raising your kids too and in keeping the house in some form of tidiness. Dads can feel sidelined if you insist on doing it all – don't allow yourself to get into that bind in the first place. It's also good for your kids to see both parents handling household responsibilities equally.

, Your kids don't need the latest designer gear, they don't need the best 101 kid's TV channels, they don't need all those amazing electronic gadgets. They need your love, they need your company in small doses and they need the company of a lot of other people too, like their dad, their brothers and sisters, their cousins, their neighbors' kids, their granny and pops. You don't need to feel that you're not giving enough if you at least accept that what you're doing is raising a child, not a robot, and that you give love, praise, and set boundaries all with a good heart.

Wear loose clothing or nothing at all.,
If you decide to wear a nightgown, make sure it is breathable, loose, and comfortable.,
Consider wearing a large t-shirt that belongs to your partner.,
Consider wearing a big t-shirt, a comfortable sports bra, and some loose bottoms.,
Consider going nude.",How to Dress for When You’re in Labor2," Your comfort is your top priority. Avoid wearing anything that is tight around your stomach while you are having contractions—this will only increase the pain. Tight clothing can also keep you from finding a comfortable laboring position, and it may make it even harder to change into a nightgown if you are having strong contractions.

, Make sure that it is not too long—knee-length is good. A long gown can become a problem during labor and delivery: it could get in the way of your fetal monitoring or the birth of the baby. Also make sure that any gown you choose is not too short. The A-line dress is very popular for labor; momos, maxis, and nighties also work well.


While you are still in the early stages of labor—before you actually start the delivery process—you may want to stay covered up so that you don't feel exposed.
If you plan to breastfeed right after the birth, make sure that your nightgown buttons down the front at least enough to fully expose your breast.

, This may be loose and comfortable, and it can give you extra emotional support. Make sure that it's an old shirt, or something non-essential—there's a chance that you will stain or rip any clothing that you wear.

, This will allow you to move around between contractions to maximize comfort and support effective breathing. As labor drags on, you may want to remove your bottoms to allow for examinations and fluid discharge.


Wear something that you don't care too much about. Things could get messy.
Remember that other people will be there. Consider how much skin you are comfortable showing., Many women prefer to go bare, especially for water births. You may find that you feel more comfortable and less restricted without clothing sticking to your sweaty body. You don't need to decide right away. You can always remove your gown or your bottoms as your labor progresses."
"
Pack a ""hospital bag"" with everything you will need during your labor and hospital stay.,
Pack a bathrobe for after you have delivered your baby.,
Don't over-pack items for the baby.,
Bring slippers and slipper socks.,
Remember to pack any toiletries that you will need.,
Pack a set of clothes to wear out of the hospital or birthing center.",How to Dress for When You’re in Labor3," Make a checklist of essential items, and pack your bag at least a week before your baby is due. You may not have time to pack when the time comes. Pack all the clothing you will need while you are at the hospital or birthing center. Planning ahead will help ensure that you are well-prepared when the time comes., Pack a robe that breathes well and will not cling to you. Cotton and terrycloth are popular fabric choices for postpartum robes. These fabrics will keep you warm, but they won't cling to your body too tightly.


Avoid silk or satin robes. They are slippery, so they allow you to slide around while you are in bed. Hospital rooms can get cool at night, and the sheer material may not be enough to keep you warm.
Avoid fleece and other heavy materials. You want to stay warm, but you don’t want to overheat.

, It's best not to pack anything for the baby besides their going-home outfit and a car seat. The hospital will take care of the rest.

, Choose slippers that will keep your feet warm and offer you good support. You may have to take walks during certain stages of your labor, so you want to stay warm and well-supported while walking. Avoid loose-fitting slippers that could lead you to slip or fall while you are walking.


Slipper socks can be a lifesaver while you are confined to the bed during the early stages of your labor, as well as immediately after you give birth. They will keep your feet warm without being bulky or getting in the way.Slipper socks are also great for keeping your feet warm during your delivery, as you will have to place your feet in stirrups. Most stirrups are fitted with covers, but they can still feel cold and uncomfortable.

, If you wear contacts, don’t forget your glasses and your contact solution. Bring your toothbrush and your hair brush. If your labor is prolonged, you may end up walking down to the cafeteria or around the hospital, so bring anything that you will need to feel presentable.Most hospitals carry pads or tampons, but consider bringing your own just in case. You don't need to use your own, but it can't hurt to have them., Above all, make sure that this outfit is comfortable.

Coloring utensils such as markers, crayons, and colored pencils
Glue
Stickers
Rubber stamps or other images such as photographs, magazine pictures, or images from cards that have already been used;
, Take a piece of construction paper and fold it into quarters.


Depending on how large or small you want to card to be, you can also use a piece of good quality cardstock (A4 size), cut it in half, and then fold it down the middle.
If you have an envelope you'd like to use for the card, fold the paper so it will fit inside the envelope. Leave at the very least 1/8"" (.3 cm) on all sides so the card can slide easily in and out of the envelope.

, Customize the card design based on who the card is for and the materials you have available.

, There is far, far more to Chinese astrology than just the twelve signs of the Zodiac. There's also the Four Pillars of Destiny -- which does use the Zodiac, but goes much, much further. It uses the year you were born and the month, day, and time of your birth, as well. It's similar to the birth chart used in Western astrology. It is believed to be a lot more accurate, telling more about your personal life instead of your sign as a whole.


The four pillars are those four factors, in that order. They are also combined with yin and yang and the 5 elements (metal, wood, water, fire, earth). It is all believed to determine your luck, affluence, longevity, happiness, and wealth year by year.
Chinese astrology works in 60 year cycles. If you're a math fiend with nothing better to do, you could break down the patterns of all these ideas into a sexagesimal cycle.

, Let's go further than the animal of your birth year. Your ""inner"" animal is determined by the month you were born in. It is believed to determine your later years in life or information about your parents. Here's how it correlates to the Western calendar:


February 4th - March 5th: Tiger

March 6th - April 4th: Rabbit

April 5th - May 4th: Dragon

May 5th - June 5th: Snake

June 6th - July 6th: Horse

July 7th - August 6th: Goat

August 7th - September 7th: Monkey

September 8th - October 7th: Rooster

October 8th - November 6th: Dog

November 7th - December 6th: Pig

December 7th - January 5th: Rat

January 6th - February 3rd: Ox


, This is the third pillar, believed to determine information about your adult or married life in the day-to-day. A pretty important one! Again, it is a sexagesimal cycle that starts when the sun reaches the celestial longitude of 315° and ends when it reaches the longitude of 330°. Therefore, each year is just a teeny bit different.


Because it'd be ridiculous to list the entire 60-day cycle here, it's advisable to visit an online calculator to find out your element and Zodiac sign for your day. If you're really bored, map out the entire cycle!

, In the Four Pillars of Destiny, the hour you were born represents the final and most personal pillar -- it also determines your ""secret animal"". This is thought to be the truest representation of yourself, the self that has been covered by layers and layers of nurture and environment. It is also used to represent information about your kids or your senior years. Here's how it lines up:


1:00 - 03:00 AM: Ox

3:00 - 5:00 AM: Tiger

5:00 - 7:00 AM: Rabbit

7:00 - 9:00 AM: Dragon

9:00 - 11:00 AM: Snake

11:00 - 1:00 PM: Horse

1:00 - 3:00 PM: Ram

3:00 - 5:00 PM: Monkey

5:00 - 7:00 PM: Rooster

7:00 - 9:00 PM: Dog

9:00 - 11:00 PM: Pig

11:00 - 1:00 AM: Rat


, There's a few things to consider here:


Every year is either yin or yang. Odd years are yang and even years are yin. Whatever the current year is, it's that side of the spectrum that tends to get emphasized.
Every sign is yin or yang as well. This is the side of your personality that naturally has more power -- though anything can change in alignment with the stars.
Yin is associate with passivity, cold, femininity, submissive, dark energy. Yang represents activity, heat, masculinity, aggressiveness, and light energy. Before you go assuming the worst, know that everyone has both -- it's just a cycle. You start with yin, say, until it blooms and turns into yang. And take into account the year's yin or yang, too!

, Almost done! Now we're getting to your element. On the outside, it's quite simple. Just take the last number in the year of your birth!0 or 1: Metal

2 or 3: Water

4 or 5: Wood

6 or 7: Fire

8 or 9: Earth

What does this mean? Again, it's a cycle, this part emphasizing movement and change. Whatever element you are will naturally be emphasized, but how does it mix with the element of the current year? It is believed that the element of the year is the dominant one -- some years will work with your element, while others will work against, creating harmony and disharmony.There are believed to be two cycles: the creative cycle and the destructive cycle.
For example, water destroys fire but produces wood and so forth. Each element affects others in different ways, ideally creating a perfect balance.
It is believed that the elements line up with the 4 seasons. Wood is the strongest in spring, fire in summer, Earth during the season transitions, and so on.Each element is dominant for 2 years in a row. The cycle repeats every 10 years (there being 5 elements and all).



, You have your own complicated sign, but the years have more detail to them too; each one has a stem paired with a branch. For example, the year 2002 has a Yang Water Stem on the Horse Branch. The horse branch has not only Yin Fire behind it, but Yin Earth too. It's how your pillars fit into every year that determines your cyclical fate.


The Ten Heavenly stems are a combination of yin and yang and the Five Elements. Therefore, your options are Yang Wood, Yin Wood, Yang Fire, Yin Fire , Yang Earth, Yin Earth, Yang Metal, Yin Metal, Yang Water, Yin Water.

These go in a 60-year cycle as discussed above. Year 1 was Rat Yang Wood; year 61 will be the same, cycling through with no repetitions before that.


The Twelve Earthly Branches are the Zodiac animals discussed in the first section. You know, the ones you find on Chinese take-out menus.

, Remember that this is a blueprint or map. It cannot be changed. That is nothing to fret about! The Chinese believe that this is knowledge to make you powerful -- you will be better able to overcome obstacles and grasp opportunities when need be. In other words, you can always do the right thing at the right time.Remember that good luck and all positive things don't just happen. This chart is telling you that at certain times, they have potential. You have to go out and get it! By knowing this chart, you'll know when those times are and when you should make your move in alignment with the stars.

, To know what seasons (parts of the cycle, not ""winter"") or years will be for the better or worse, talk to a master of Chinese astrology. They'll be able to pinpoint your when you're lucky and, quite frankly, when you're not. Certain seasons (days, even) will be better than others (especially to take action) and they can outline that cycle for you.


Carry a lucky symbol with you. Let's say you're a goat and it's a bad year for you, but it's a great year for the Ox. Carry a little trinket of an Ox around you to circumvent the negative airs around you.
Use an online calculator if you'd like to figure out your sign the easy way. Remember to account for Chinese time -- if you input the timezone of your birth, some calculators can do that for you. And don't forget the new year!

Consider yourself important too.,
Put the brakes on multi-tasking.,
Prioritize.,
Learn to say no, even if you once used to but have now forgotten.,
Be in the moment.,
Avoid judging yourself.,
Talk honestly with other women.,
Look after your physical health.,
Look after your mental health.,
Welcome those who support you.,
Remember who you are.",How to Rediscover Yourself in Motherhood," Women who don't find the time to take good care of themselves risk being overwhelmed and eventual burn out. It may seem like multi-tasking and juggling everything is allowing you to manage it all right now but you're paying a high price for the constant on-the-go mentality by ignoring your need for rest and recreation. Remembering that you matter is a key element to ensuring that you remain in good physical and mental health and that your relationships with others are not compromised by your exhaustion and even resentment. Bear in the mind the following major realities:


You cannot be Supermom or Superwoman. That myth has long been laid to rest by academics, doctors, therapists, and all the other moms who have tried. However, for some bizarre reason, the myth persists because many women were raised to believe they could have and do it all at once, only to collapse in a heap and self blame when it doesn't work out.
It isn't possible to fit everything and some into a single day. You have to make choices about what to prioritize and what to leave out. To not do so is to live under the feeling that everything is half done and things are unraveling at the seams.
Being overwhelmed and exhausted is the least successful way of coping with your daily chores and responsibilities and by not allowing yourself the time to recover from particularly stressful periods of life, you are laying down the foundations for future health, relationship, and self-esteem problems.
You're a role model for the children in your life. Do you want them to learn how to be or expect a frazzled, worn down, exhausted mom or someone who sets a good example by gently and calmly caring for herself as well as for everyone around her?;
, Multi-tasking is a buzzword that gets commonly attached to women. There is a common belief, often backed up by women out of a sense of pride at coping, that women are better at multi-tasking than men. The truth? Social scientists think that multi-tasking is bad news for everyone, whatever your gender.The human brain is far happier focusing on one task through to its completion (or as near as completion as appropriate) before switching to another, and by trying to juggle several tasks at once, we put the brain under enough pressure to end up stressed, in a rage, and even with reduced IQ levels by as much as 10 points.Professor Miller, the author of one study into the dangers of multi-tasking says that it can induce brain fog and yet we're very good at deluding ourselves that it's working.Frighteningly, while you may work faster initially, your productivity plummets and the outcomes are far poorer than when you single-task. And why are women supposedly better at it? It is as simple as the fact that women are more ready to try it and to say they're happy doing it rather than it actually being effective!It isn't working but it is making you stressed, so the solution is to drop the multi-tasking and to start focusing more on less.



Focus on one thing at a time. If you have a list of things needing to be done, jot them down and follow through on them one by one rather than baking a pie at the same time as consoling an upset friend on the phone at the same time as tallying up the report figures for work at the same time as placing a Band-Aid® on little Johnny's knee...
Always do what can be done rather than what you feel should be done. A lot of ""shoulds"" are wishes for being more organized, more ready, more something that could be achieved with better systems, as well as having more help from others, and maybe even a magic wand but you cannot perform miracles and should not expect such. Over time perhaps you can develop better systems but in the midst of chaos, do what can be done first.

, Minimizing multi-tasking comes through prioritizing more than anything else. There are only so many hours in the day, as the wiser people around you are apt to remind you. Consider what the most important two to three things to be achieved for that day are. And set yourself to deal with those as a priority before all else. The benefit of doing this is the word ""achievement"". Completing two to three things well will leave you with a sense of achievement that buoys you and frees you to take some downtime to rejuvenate.


Sit down each morning, relax and plan out what you have to do that day. Keeping a planner is always helpful in remembering which trips and tasks really need to be accomplished.
Forget the things that aren't prioritized for the day. They can wait.
Decide what to prioritize by your goals and values, not by what a magazine, website, or your perfectly coiffed neighbor says is appropriate. While it can be helpful to read and learn from others, always bear in mind that their situation, context, and standards may be very different from your own and they may be saying what they think people ought to do but not even practicing it themselves. Remove their conditions and admonishments from your head!
Think about the things that matter most to you, such as being fit, having time to read to your children, getting back to work, cooking gourmet once a week, whatever.
Use a vision board or a journal to document your priorities. Writing it down and drawing visual elements will help you to stay focused on what matters to you and will serve as a reminder of the direction you want your life to take. Keep it simple though!

, When women become moms, there is a tendency to feel a great sense of responsibility that can extend beyond the kids just through habit. And saying yes all the time becomes a bit of habit as you get used to tidying up after everyone else, answering immediately to requests (or demands), and being available for all the family and other people close to you, including your boss and that charming but rather nosy neighbor over the way. And in time, your availability and willingness to say yes tends to be taken for granted if you've forgotten to set limitations with others. If you're resenting saying yes once the word slips out, that's an indication that you need to reset your boundaries with others and begin again to assert your needs and balance the needs of others.


Remember that saying yes to too many things and then not being able to meet your commitments will be viewed with greater disappointment than if you simply say no up front.
There are ways of softening the blow, such as saying ""Sorry, I can't help you with that right now. Maybe I will be free in 6 months though, so feel free to ask again."" or ""I'd love to help you out but I am already committed to three major functions and my kids have school camp this month. I can suggest a friend of mine whom I know would love to help though."" And so forth.
Give yourself the time and space to think before agreeing to commitments. Some of the reason for why women over-commit is because it's easier to say ""yes"" in the rush of the moment than to make explanations as to why not. Instead, replace the quick ""yes"" with a quick ""I can't say right now. Let me get back to you on that.""
Read How to say no, How to say no to your boss, and How to know when to say no, and How to say no to a coworker for more ideas.

, Staying in the present, focused on the role relevant to the moment, can be difficult if you're juggling roles. Yet, it is vital to do this to minimize stress and making the most of the time. While this will take practice, it is definitely worth the effort. Basically, make a decision to be the role you have for the time of day. So, before work, you're mom and revel in the mom chores. At work, enjoy your working day; rest reassured that you've made the right care, schooling and after-school choices for your children as women have done for time immemorial. Once you get home, remove your work clothes and be mom again, completely. Put away the work manuals, the phone, the emails and concentrate fully on the mom role. Later at night, when the kids are in bed, focus on your self time and spouse time, in the role of self-nurturer and lover.


If there is work that you had to bring home, allot an hour to it and no more. If work bleeds into your home-life consistently, question its value to you at this point in your life. It may be a very hard choice but your kids won't stay kids forever but the work, well it'll always keep piling up in the same manner.

, This step relates back to trying to multi-task and do too much, and failing. Many women who find themselves in this situation have a tendency to judge themselves harshly and blame themselves for being inadequate, disorganized, and not good enough at mothering. All of this is more self-delusion. You are a good mother and you are a good person; what you have done to yourself is added more than you can manage to your to-do list and forgot to realize that having children is a big game changer. The person you were before children (the one who could pull all-nighters to get the report in on time and could then turn up to work reasonably coherent) is no longer there (and with good reason); the person you are now is one whose day is determined by the pull of the needs and demands of children. This means that no plan will go accordingly. Your best allies are now: flexibility, acceptance, and a releasing of perfectionism. If you accept that things may not go according to plan, prepare for plans B, C, and D, and even for plan E which involves abandonment of all plans and simply going with the flow!

, Talking to one another about life's events matters. This is not the preschool choosing, boss venting, makeup preferences, or house buying kinds of talk. This is about major life events women go through. There are no manuals that come with major life changing events. However, there are very honest and good biographies around from many women who have been through such events as: the shock of working in male influenced environments after gender-free university life, the shock of life post-birth changes including juggling a career and/or full-time home life, the mental health challenges such as depression that can creep up on you unawares, the challenges presented by affairs and/or divorce, and the sheer unexpectedness of menopausal changes that hit mid-mothering, etc. Reading about other women's experiences will help you to realize you're not alone and that it is better that women talk about these issues than to pretend they do not exist. You can then use your reading knowledge to open up to other women about your experiences and to gently inquire after their concerns and experiences as well. Set the example for them feel comfortable around and you'll have some very eye-opening and supportive conversations.


Being honest means being honest. If you start comparing yourself to other mothers and finding yourself lacking against what you perceive about their lives, you are falling into the trap of believing appearances. While they may seem like they've got it all together, you really don't know and it's unkind to yourself to imagine that you lack the skills or abilities of other mothers. The simple answer is to accept that you're the way you are and not to compare yourself to other mothers. Remember that your kids love you, not other moms!

, Allowing yourself to become run down impacts both you and your family and it's no fun having to keep going while you're exhausted and unwell. Minor health issues can become major ones if left unattended and allowed to grow out of control, and you'll be of no help to anyone if you get a chronic illness.


Exercise regularly by choosing a form of exercise that you love and that gives you some thinking space, from walking the dog to kickboxing in the local gym. Mark your exercise breaks in your diary and be sure to keep them.






Eat a nutritious diet that is tailored to your needs. Whether you're pregnant, breastfeeding, working long hours, doing hard physical labor, or typing away at a desk, your nutritional needs will be specific to your situation and if you're not sure what's best, have a quick talk about it with your doctor. There are plenty of good books and websites that can fill you in on the basics of good eating habits.
Investigate any need for multi-vitamins or other supplements. Some mothers find it helpful to give their children a vitamin supplement and take one themselves at the same time. However, a well-balanced diet should meet most vitamin and other nutritional requirements unless you have particular issues. Speak to your doctor about such needs.

Get plenty of sleep. While your sleep will be broken during the newborn stage, ensure that adequate sleep is paramount for you during your mothering years. Sleep helps you gain a sense of perspective, rejuvenates your appearance, and helps you to think much more clearly about everything. And, of course, it helps improve your energy levels.

, Anxiety, worries, depression, and stress disorders are real mental health issues that you might face as a full-time mom with many responsibilities. It is very important that you do not neglect to take care of such issues when they arise because they are as debilitating as physical illnesses and can have physical impacts on your health long-term too. Not all mothers are aware that their general, long-lived sense of unhappiness, unease, and sadness could be sourced in depression, stress, or anxiety and sadly such women can tend to blame themselves for not being adequate or strong enough to pull through the ""blues"". Never blame yourself! If you are experiencing more than a week of constant sadness, blue moods, feeling down, and disliking yourself, see a doctor to talk through your feelings and concerns. A life lived in a mental fog and self-blame is a half life with little joy and every mother deserves to enjoy her children, relationships, and work, so do not deny yourself the possibility of having a more enjoyable life.

, Asking for help can be hard when you feel like you're ""it"" but it's an essential skill for a mom. If you're uncomfortable reaching out for help with immediate family and friends for whatever reason, consider asking for help from organizations specifically set up to help moms, such as groups for moms and babies or toddlers, sports groups, mothering groups, school groups, and even activities such as book clubs run by all-moms. Wherever you can source support, do so and make use of it without guilt.


Get into a good habit early on of accepting babysitting requests and offering to babysit in return. The relief you will get from being able to go out when your kids are being cared for by someone else will be tremendously refreshing.
Let your own parents and parents-in-law do their grandparenting. Indeed, it is worth putting up with bossiness or overbearing attitudes from them, provided they're good with your children and they're happy to take care of them. In this case, put aside your personal grievances about their attitudes toward you or the way you keep house, etc., and just let them give you occasional breaks from the children. Someone did it for them when they were parents, and some day, you'll do it for your children, so allow the trend to continue unbroken.

, Regardless of your working role, your SAHM (stay-at-home-mom) role, your mothering role in general, you are still you. You are a woman first, and a smart, caring, and thoughtful being with as much right as anyone else on the planet to lead a fulfilled life. There will be tough times during mothering (nobody ever goes into enough details about just how tough sometimes) but there will also be amazing moments, great rewards, incredible intimacy, and deep love. All of these things reassure the majority of mothers that the journey is worthwhile. And it is likely to be a far more enjoyable journey when you can continue to reassure yourself of your own self-worth and personhood. Keep at least one thing in your life that is just for you (and this does not mean work), like a hobby, a regular outing, a meet-up with girlfriends, etc. and do it with clockwork regularity. Rediscovering your essence through motherhood is not only essential for your own well-being but is an example to your children to also remain true to themselves, and to respect that all mothers are individuals in their own right. Celebrate yourself regularly and you'll stay a whole and reassured individual.

, Set up a workstation with all your tools and supplies. For a simple handmade birthday card, you'll need:


Construction paper, cardstock, or any paper you have.
Coloring utensils such as markers, crayons, and colored pencils.
Glue (optional)
Stickers (optional)
Glitter (optional)
Ribbon (optional)

, The paper possibilities are virtually endless. You can use any paper you have around the house or use colored paper. Pick whatever kind of paper is easiest and most fun. Here are some options to consider:


Printer paper is easy to work with and you might have some on hand.
Cardstock or construction paper is a heavier and will feel more like a store bought card.
Scrapbook paper might include patterns or borders to start you off with more than just a blank slate.

, You can create a traditional folded card, or a flat postcard style card. You can even fold your card in half and then half again. Here are a few things to think about:


If you are using printer paper, you will probably want to make a folded card. Printer paper is thin and flimsy, so folding it will make it a bit sturdier.
If you are using cardstock or construction paper you can easily fold it or cut it into a flat postcard style birthday card.

, If you decide to fold your card, place your paper on a table in profile layout and fold it in half to bring the top and bottom edges together.


Line up the edges of the paper and make the fold slowly to keep the edges as even as possible.
If you'd like, you can take your folded card in profile layout and fold it in half again, bringing the top and bottom edges together to make a sturdier card.
Make a sharp clean crease if you are folding construction paper.
If you decide to use scrapbook paper, decide whether or not to fold it based on its thickness.

, Take a ruler and measure out a card between 3 1/2 and 4 1/4 inches high and between 5 and 6 inches long.This is the size of a standard postcard.


You can get creative with the dimensions of your card and make the edges curvy.
If you want to make a postcard style birthday card and have thin scrapbook paper, you can glue it to a piece of cardstock to make it stronger.

, Once you have selected your paper and your card format, it's time to get started on creating your simple birthday card. You can use a thick marker or a combination of different colors to write, ""Happy Birthday!"" on the front of your card. If you prefer not to hand write it, you can also print the words using a word processor and cut them out for your card, or use the printed piece of paper as your template.


You can make the words big and center them on the front of your card, or write them small based on your preference. There is no wrong way to do it, but since it is a birthday card, it should say, ""Happy Birthday"" somewhere!

, The great thing about making cards by hand is that you can create them specifically for their recipient. Print put a picture of the two of you. Draw a birthday cake with the appropriate amount of candles. You can even write the beginning of a phrase that will end on the inside or back of your card. Try something like:


I hope you have a great day today. Celebrate! It's your birthday!
Happy birthday to a great friend. I like your birthday. Without it, I would not have such a great friend. Have an awesome birthday!
I want to wish a happy birthday to one of the coolest people I know. Happy birthday to you!
Add a fun memory that you and your recipient share. Use the front of your card to start the story and finish it in the inside or back of the card. For example, ""Remember last year when we went rock climbing on your birthday? I can't wait for our next adventure, Happy Birthday!""

, Think about your relationship with this person and some of the fun memories you share. You can write an inside joke or congratulate them on accomplishments they have made in the last year.


Use this space to tell them something light and fun that you would like them to know.
Wish them the best for next year too!

, Depending on how much room you have, you may want to draw some more pictures or include another photo. Draw pictures of candles, balloons, birthday cakes, or cartoon characters of you and your recipient.


Look up a line from your favorite poem, or find a funny riddle to include., Include your full name, first name, or whatever name your recipient knows you by. Include a phone number, email address, or mailing address if you would like to offer your recipient an easy way to keep in touch with you.

Celebrate the Lantern Festival.",How to Celebrate Chinese New Year," This tradition is founded in the belief that cleaning the house at this time of year will ""sweep away the bad luck"" that has accumulated inside over the past year.Cleaning also makes the house ready for the good luck to start entering again.


Keeping fresh and hygienic is also an important part of celebrating; even a new haircut will do.

Don't clean your home after the New Year has started. To do so is to ""sweep away"" the good luck you've just received. Over the following fifteen days, or at least the first few if you can't wait that long, you are re relieved of cleaning duties.;
, Red is the color or symbol of good luck in Chinese culture and is often used for new year decorations. The number ""8"" also symbolizes good luck and wealth, since the Chinese character for eight rhymes with fortune or wealth.


Paste paper cutouts onto the window. These elaborate cutouts usually depict scenes from rural life or Chinese mythology, and are traditionally put up on south and north facing windows.Display Chinese New Year paintings and artwork. Traditionally, these contain images of health and bounty, including animals and fruit.

You can write spring-themed couplets yourself or buy Chinese calligraphy printed on red paper.

Paint your door, doorframe, or window panes red for a real change of pace!

, Complement the crafts and artwork with bowls of food, flowers, and other treats.


Place flowers through the house, such as lotuses. Lotus flowers symbolize rebirth and new growth.
Place mandarin oranges in bowls throughout the house. Mandarins with their leaves still intact are the fruits of happiness for the New Year. Use an even number and eat in pairs for good luck.Set out a tray of eight candies. Eight is a lucky number. You can use any treats for your tray, or traditional Chinese candies made from lotus seeds, longan, peanuts, coconut, red melon seed, or candied melon., Seven days before the New Year, the Kitchen God is said to report to the Jade Emperor about the household. Keep on your best behavior and offer him a sacrifice of fruit, candy, water, or other food. Some people burn a picture of the Kitchen God to send him up to heaven as smoke.


In some areas, people traditionally prepare bean curd or tofu two days after honoring the kitchen god and eat the unpleasant residue to demonstrate thrift when the Jade Emperor comes to check up on the Kitchen God's report. You can substitute this tradition with tastier portions of tofu if you like!

, If you have traditional Chinese clothing, this is the perfect time to wear it. Outfits can be purchased in Chinatown, including beautiful silk clothing. Associated with joy, happiness, good luck, wealth and good fortune, red clothes will ensure that you're fully participating in the spirit of the celebrations. Gold is another suitable color; try combining the two for a festive look.


Avoid wearing too much black during the celebration period. Black symbolizes bad luck and even death. This is a time of good fortune and life!

, Chinese celebrators head to temples to pray for good luck during the New Year celebration period. There they burn incense sticks and have their fortunes told. Most temples welcome participants not of Chinese descent.


You can find the tube of fortune sticks near the entrance to the temple. Ask a question and shake the tube until a numbered stick falls out. One of the fortune tellers can interpret it for you., Set off fireworks at midnight when the New Year begins. The firecrackers used in China and Hong Kong are loud, banging fireworks that are mostly lit on the ground. The loud noises are thought to scare the bad spirits away, to prevent them from bringing bad luck.Many people continue to set off fireworks for the entire fifteen days, or at least the first four to eight days before they have to return to work. Expect a lot of noise and excitement if you're living in a Chinese community!
Personal fireworks are banned in some countries and regions, but you may be able to watch an official fireworks display.

, Show gratitude and respect for what your ancestors have done for you. There are many traditional customs associated with this if you choose to follow them, such as bowing to a shrine dedicated to them or offering them food and drink as a sacrifice.

, Chinese New Year is a time of happiness and good fortune and it's important to spread the goodwill. Avoid having any quarrels, fights, or negative attitudes during the New Year. These will bring you bad luck.


Visit your family and friends often to share the New Year with them.
Greet other celebrants with ""Gong Xi,"" pronounced ""gong zee."" This means ""Congratulations!"" Longer greetings include Gong Hei Fat Choi or Gong Xi Fa Chai in Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese respectively.

, Look online or in your local newspaper for information about a Chinese New Year Parade. These are sometimes held on a nearby weekend instead of New Year's Day itself, or even slightly outside the New Year period altogether.


Remember your camera, and dress warmly if you live in an area that has to celebrate the Spring Festival in the wintertime!
You're in luck if you live near San Francisco: its annual Chinese New Year parade is said to be the largest and oldest outside of Asia.

, In the United States, large parades are often broadcast on local or regional television. Inside China, the national China Central Television broadcaster (CCTV) attracts hundreds of millions of viewers with their annual midnight Spring Festival Gala.

, Besides firecrackers, food, activities, and music, Chinese New Year parades are a rare opportunity to watch costumed dragon dancers and lion dancers.


The dragon dancers skillfully synchronize their dancing in one line, holding poles supporting a long, vibrant dragon. Dragons are common in Chinese mythology, in which they are revered symbols of the nation and people.Two lion dancers share a single costume depicting a large, stylized lion.

Decorate the edges of the paper.,
Add some layers to your card.,
Make a story.,
Add embellishments like stickers, stamps, glitter, or fabric.",How to Make a Simple Handmade Birthday Card2," You can use a hole punch to punch some holes along the side of your card and string a ribbon through the holes or use craft scissors to cut a patterned shape along the edges of your card.

, Cut out different shapes in colored paper and glue them onto the top of your card to add a splash of color and a thicker surface.


This is a great way to make use of scrap paper.
You can tie a ribbon around an additional piece of paper that you glue down to your template for a fun and fancy creative touch.

, If you have a little bit of extra time, you can turn the card into a mini graphic novel. Divide the card into a grid and tell a little story. Draw pictures of you and your recipient using a fun memory from your past.

, Tailor the card’s decorative details to the recipient. For example, if it’s your mom's birthday and she loves gardening, add a stamped flower image or draw the outline of a flower with glue and cover it in glitter.

Find a box which is big enough to package the item.,
Before you place the console inside the box, remove all the wires and connectors.,
Wrap the actual console in protective wrapping such as bubble wrap.,
Once you are certain that all of the consoles wires and attachments are packaged and there isn’t much room for anything to move about, you should then add additional protective material to fill any gaps.,
Next, securely tape down the box and add tape for additional support to the corners of the box to make it even more secure.

,
Once the item is securely packaged, you can send it with a relevant courier service who will be able to collect your item and deliver it to the recipient.

,
Always get a receipt or proof of sending documentation.",How to Package and Send a Games Console for Christmas," It’s no good trying to tape two boxes together or manufacturing your own casing, as this is more likely to come apart whilst being sent to its intended address.;
, This includes any memory cards which need to be stored in one of the games cases. You might also want to include a note on the front of the games box to explain to the recipient that this is where the card has been placed.

, You don’t need to protect the wires, as long as the main console unit is protected, you will prevent any damage to the most important part of the parcel.

, Your parcel might be stacked at the sorting depot so you don’t want it to collapse if other parcels are placed on top.

,,, If the intended recipient argues that you haven’t sent the item and you have no receipt then you can’t prove anything.

Cut a long piece of ribbon that fits correctly around your gift and lay it over the top, holding firmly in the middle.,
Pull the ribbon around the box and make sure both sides of the ribbon are of the same length.,
Sharply twist the fold to the side as tightly as possible.,
Pull tightly into the middle of your box and make a huge knot.,
Tie a bow.,
Finally, trim the ends.",How to Tie a Gift Wrapping Bow," This will wrap around your gift and be where the bow sits on top of your gift. The longer your ribbon is, the bigger the bow will be. Make sure the top is long enough for you to tie a (probably) large knot and a bow.;
, You can measure this by lifting them up and touching ends above the present. Next, pull one end of the ribbon under and over the other, so you have a ""T"" shape.

, You'll need to do this to create the crossed shape. After this, pull the entire ribbon around the box and meet in the middle with both ends. Now we can get into forming the bow.

, Press the middle of your bow with your finger to keep it down, or you can have somebody else hold it. You might also just use a clear piece of tape if you're unable or cautious to do this on your own and nobody's around. Now, make a regular knot. Your safest bet is to make a double or even triple knot, if you have the correct amount of ribbon and it won't be too bulky. This will be the center of your bow.

, Make it as large as you want, and be sure it's tight. You can pull out the edges a bit if you'd like, and make sure the ""ears"" of the bow and wide and as round as possible. The fluffier and more cartoon-ish look is what you're going for, not a flat or typical bow.


This will be easier to accomplish with a wired ribbon, but possibly be messier looking, so be careful!

, The ends should have quite a bit extra, so cut them at an angle in either diagonal direction. For an even more elegant and professional look, check the tips below for an alternative (but equally as easy) method.

Know who you are buying gifts for.,
Set a budget.,
Decide on what sort of gift matches each person on your list.,
Start as early as the day following Christmas day.,
Put off procrastinating.,
Have a shopping plan.,
Keep track of presents.,
Hide the gifts well.",How to Start Your Christmas Shopping Early1," Some people only shop for close family and friends. Other people put together Christmas presents for co-workers, the postal worker, the dog walker, hairdresser, plumber, poker buddies, kid's teacher, and more. Decide on what you are comfortable with.;
, Christmas presents should figure into your household or personal budget for the entire year, instead of just trying to find extra money somehow every November or December. You can always start by saving a small amount every month.


Keep a general idea of how much you will spend on each person. For instance, you will likely spend more money on your immediate family than on a co-worker.

, What do they like? Movies, books, games? Have a rough idea of what presents would please the people on your list. brainstorm ideas. Write the ideas down on your list. Listen to the person or other people for ideas, and write them down too. Keep this list in an easy-to-carry form, like tucked away in your wallet or checkbook for quick reference.

, There's no point in buying early if you're going to buy for full price. Christmas shopping can start December 26th. Although you may feel the last thing you want to do is shop after the Christmas rush, stores often have incredible sales immediately after the holidays, and most items will be perfectly good gifts the next year.


Check out sales throughout the year, such as at the end of summer.
After-Christmas and Boxing Day sales are a good time to pick up wrapping paper and the like for the next year for a pittance.

, Many people end up shopping last-minute because they put off the inevitable. Instead, make a plan with solid goals, dates, and timelines.


For instance, shopping will be done by December 20th. Put aside two evenings, twice a week for 2 weeks to accomplish this task. Leave some wiggle-room in case something comes up, but don't keep making excuses. It can help to have someone who is good about shopping to keep you on track.

, Maybe you're not the type of person who likes shopping, or don't have the time to browse for Christmas presents all year long. Instead, put aside one period of time, like a weekend or a special shopping trip.

, Don't lose the present or forget who you bought it for.


Have a designated area for presents, such as a tote, section of closet, or attic. Be sure that the present won't be ruined by variations of temperature, humidity, mold, mice, and so on.
Write the name of the designated gift-receiver on a removable sticker or piece of tape. That way you'll remember who you bought it for. If you change your mind, it's easy to re-designate. Cross their name off the list as soon as possible to avoid forgetting that you already bought them something.

, Hiding is the hardest part of buying a gift early, but it's perfectly possible. If you live with the person, hide it in your craft cupboard, toy box, the back of a wardrobe, etc. and leave it inside backpacks or other opaque bags. It's best to choose somewhere the other person is not likely to look.

Know what you're having for the Christmas meal at least a month in advance.,
Start looking for liquor and soft drink sales at least one month ahead.,
Purchase the ingredients for the cake and pudding as soon as you see the ingredients go on sale in November.,
Purchase the non-perishable food items from mid-November through to mid-December.,
Order food well ahead of time.,
Buy perishable supermarket foods two days before Christmas.",How to Start Your Christmas Shopping Early2," This will allow you to start buying the foodstuffs and drinks that are on sale and aren't perishable. Write it all out on a list, then list the ingredients separately. From the ingredients list, highlight all the foods that can be bought early, such as canned foods, long life foods and dried foods. All of these can be bought well ahead of Christmas, perhaps in November.


Make storage space. Check the freezer, pantry and refrigerator for space that can be spared to contain all of the Christmas goodies you're purchasing ahead of time.

, Stock up well ahead of the rush. Dealing with drinks early is a great way to buy yourself more time when Christmas Day approaches––no long lines for you.


Store these out of the way in the basement, pantry floor or other area where they won't be disturbed or subject to temperature extremes.

, Many stores stock up additional amounts of dried fruits, flour, spices, etc. and put sales on early to get the stock moving. Since a cake and pudding are best made a month before Christmas to give them time to cure, start looking for the sales on the ingredients early November.

, Having these tucked away in the pantry, refrigerator or freezer in readiness for use will take a great weight off your mind. Non-perishables that can be bought ahead include:


Nuts and Nibbles
Chips, pretzels, and crackers
Canned foods
Frozen foods, including frozen desserts
Candies and candied fruits
Ice cream
Some root vegetables, pumpkins
Gingerbread and other spiced cookies
Commercially made Christmas cake, puddings, mince pies
Long-life milk, bread wraps, cookies, etc.

, Order meats, baked items, cakes, desserts, etc. from the relevant providers at the end of November into early December. Get an emailed or texted confirmation of your order and always call ahead a few days prior to pick-up date to check that the order has not been mislaid and is underway. Collect the day before Christmas or Christmas morning, as relevant. Although you still have to shop at Christmas-time, pre-ordering removes the stress of last-minute thinking and ensures that the provider of the goods has the resources and time to service your order.


Make things easier by having a family member do all the pick-ups. Provide them with a list and locations for pickups, then send them on their way.

, This avoids the pre-Christmas day rush that is usually full of all the people who forgot to be organized. If there is anything that must be bought fresh the day before or on the day, add that to the pre-orders––even many supermarkets will take pre-orders for things such as meats and baked goods.


Store everything in one part of the refrigerator or use a second one if you have another.

For casual gatherings, a smaller amount might be appropriate. Likewise, if it’s just a silly game for kids, it will probably be more fun with small, inexpensive toys than bigger items., Give them the price range, and let them know that they should wrap whatever they bring.


If the game will include all ages, ask guests to label any adult items, such as alcoholic beverages. Likewise, if they bring a toy, they can label it specifically for children.e
Specify in advance whether they should bring silly gag gifts or something small but nice, just so all of your guests are on the same page.

, Write numbers on pieces of paper from one up through the total number of participants.

, Have each person to take one. This will determine the order that they go in to pick their gift.

, They can unwrap it immediately. Otherwise, they don’t have to do anything else for now, just hold on to what they chose., Once they have unwrapped it, they can either trade with the first person as long as the first person agrees to the swap, or they can keep what they chose.

, During their turn, they can trade with anyone who has gone before them or keep the gift they chose.

, This way they won’t miss out on the chance to make a trade even though they went first.

, Don’t let them unwrap it yet. This will be a ""blind"" exchange, where nobody gets to see what they've chosen until the end.

, They can also steal from the first person. If the second person decides to steal, then the first person gets to choose another gift., Once you have three or more participants, a person who loses their gift to a thief now also has the option of stealing from someone else.


You might want to have a “three steals” rule for gifts, people, or both. This means that a gift can only be stolen three times before the third thief gets to keep it. Similarly, a person can only be stolen from three times before they get to keep what they have.
If you have a large group or you put a limit on the number of steals, you may want to tell those who have been stolen from just to choose a new gift from the pile. Otherwise, it could prolong the turn indefinitely, because whoever they steal from could steal too, and so on.

, Once everyone else has gone, go back to the first person. If they want to keep their gift, they can, but at least they have the chance to participate in the stealing.

, Now that everyone has a gift, tell them to unwrap what they have and enjoy!

From handwritten and decorated designs to photo cards, you can personalize each card to its recipient or have one overall design to send everyone on your list.


You can get a sense of card formats from different sources including magazines and websites. Publications such as Better Homes and Gardens, Martha Stewart Living, and Real Simple have examples of different card formats you can make, including decorated and handwritten cards. Websites such as Shutterfly have suggestions on picture cards., If you have a good idea of how you want your card to look, it will be easier to gather the proper supplies and simplify the process of making the cards. Consider a variety of design aspects from color to motif and message and whether each element matches the others.There are many different Christmas motifs for your card. For example, you could use a Santa or Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer design for children. For adults, you could have a Christmas tree or dangling ornaments, or even a simple message such as “Season’s Greetings” or “Noel.”There are also many different Christmas messages you can write in the card. Perhaps you want to use something traditional and simple such as “Wishing You a Merry Christmas,” or maybe you want to write a personal message in each card. Another option is matching your motif and your message. For example, if you want to use stockings hung by a chimney for your motif, you could write “The Stockings Were Hung…”, Once you have a developed idea for your card, including format and a basic design sketch, choose the paper you want to use. There are many different options of paper type and color from a sturdy cardstock to scrapbook paper.Don’t forget to buy envelopes, either, as you’ll need something in which to send the cards!
cardstock is a heavier, excellent quality paper that comes in a variety of colors, including holiday favorites red, green, silver and gold.If you’re going to make a photograph card, use cardstock so that holds the weight of the picture.
Scrapbooking paper is also a high quality paper that is not as heavy as cardstock. Even though it’s called scrapbooking, you can also use it to make Christmas cards.You might notice that cardstock and sometimes scrapbooking paper is pre-folded. At this stage, you can also decide if you want your card to have a portrait (up and down) or landscape (side to side) orientation.
Purchase the paper for your cards at large stores such as Target, or specialty stores like Michael’s or Paper Source. It’s also possible to purchase your card paper online at retailers including Target, Michael’s, and Paper Source. Local printing shops usually have a nice paper selection for your cards.

There is a large variety of possible decorations you can use. Some examples include: ribbons, Christmas motif stickers, stick on letters, and glitter.One option to consider for decorations are online templates of motifs you would like to use. Martha Stewart Living, for example, provides easy templates that you can download and draw on to your cards., Make one card using your basic design sketch. Doing this will let you see if everything matches and approximately what size writing must be as well as the best placement for your decorations.

, You can either hand write or print out whatever messages you’ve chosen for the inside and front of your card.


Use a ruler to guide your writing and assure that it is straight.
If you have a message for the front of the card, or if it is only one page, write it and make sure to leave enough room for your decorations. For example, if you decided to write “The Stocking Were Hung…” and add some stocking stickers, you’ll need to make sure you have enough space to hang your stockings on the card.Likewise, if you’re using a photograph on the front of your card and want to include a message, make sure there is plenty of space for both, or tailor the size of your written message to accommodate the picture.
If you don’t have the neatest or most beautiful handwriting, print out your message either from a design you like on the internet or one you generate in a Word program on your computer.
Write your message on the inside of the card after you’ve finished the front. Make sure to sign your name, and those of your family members if you like.
Make to allow enough time for pens or glue to dry before you start decorating the card.

, Now comes the fun part! Once you’ve written your messages on the front and inside the card, you’re ready to embellish it with decorations.


Have your decorations readily available as you work. You might also want to have orange sticks or cotton swabs to fix any mistakes.
If you run out of decorations, improvise with other decorative supplies, including your paper, if necessary.

, Before you place your handcrafted Christmas cards in their envelopes to send, allow them to set overnight to make sure that any adhesives don’t shift.

You can get a sense of the different card formats from online services by looking at different websites such as Shutterfly, PSPrint., Once you’ve had a chance to see the different options of card formats and services available online, decide which one best suits your wishes and needs.

Remember not to put too much on a one-sided card, though., You might want to include additional decorative motifs or a personalized message inside of each card.


If there is a pre-formulated message inside the card, you may have the option to rewrite it as you like.

, Before you place your order, check each aspect of the card to make sure there aren’t any mistakes. If there are, fix them and then check until the card is exactly how you like it.
