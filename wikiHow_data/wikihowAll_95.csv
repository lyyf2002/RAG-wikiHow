Shop through your credit card’s website.,
Get gift cards instead of tangible gifts.,
Monetize your reward points.,
Check to see if your rewards can be used on Amazon.,
Give the gift of giving.",How to Use Credit Card Rewards at Christmas1," Many large card companies offer access to online shopping portals that will allow you to buy gifts with the rewards points you’ve already earned. For instance, you may be able to cash in your points for apparel, toys, electronics, or pet supplies, among other possibilities.If you don’t have enough points to buy everything you'd like, note that using your credit card to make purchases on these portals often leads to bonus points.;
, Not only can you increase the usefulness of your gift by giving a gift card to someone, there is often financial incentive for you as well. Different credit card companies will treat gift card purchases separately. While you can exchange points directly for gift cards in some cases, other companies allow rewards card members to buy gift cards at a discount and receive bonus points for doing so.For example, you may be able to buy a $25 gift card from a popular restaurant chain for $10 with your rewards card. Since the specifics vary widely, go to the credit card website and look for information on the rewards page.

, Most rewards programs will allow you to exchange your points for statement credits. In this way you can reduce the final cost of your holiday expenses by reducing your card balances after you’ve made your holiday purchases (which will have brought you additional points). Balances are commonly reduced by one cent per point redeemed. Thus, redeeming 10,000 points could reduce your balance by $100.
Check on options to monetize your points before doing your shopping. Some rewards programs allow you to redeem points with a direct deposit into a bank account, which is money you can spend immediately.

, Amazon allows purchases to be made with rewards points from certain credit cards. If your credit card account is with a major bank, you can likely use the points you’ve acquired to make a dent in that online shopping cart that’s been piling up. , Making a donation in someone else’s name is a thoughtful, meaningful, and appreciated gift. If the people in your life have everything they need, think about donating your reward points to a charity on their behalf. Most reward programs allow this, and many will even help recommend all sorts of non-profit organizations to which you can donate. Note that credit card companies will often cover the transaction cost of donating your points, and the donations themselves can often be claimed as a tax deduction.
To help choose which organization to donate your points to, think about the causes the person you’re donating on behalf of would support.

Use the wire to make the tree shape.,
Roll out a length of wire to work with.,
Make a spiral at one end of the wire.,
Unfurl the coil to form the tree shape.,
Thread the green seed beads onto the tree shape, from the base to the top of the tree.,
Add the hanging red bauble in the base loop under the tree.,
Repeat for the second earring.

,
Add the earring hook to each tree earring to complete the whole project.,
Done.",How to Make Tree Shape Earrings for Christmas," Use the image shown here to guide you through the steps in this tutorial part.;
, It must be longer than the spiral you're about the make, to allow for adjustments, etc,, so about 35cm/13.7 inches

, To do this:


Gently roll up or coil the wire to form a spiral. As shown in the image, begin with a very small roll first, then gradually roll the length of wire around this first coil.
Continue until the spiral is large enough. It is recommended that you use about 30cm/12 inches of the length of wire to make the complete spiral.
Cut the remaining wire off but leave a short length that will be used to hold the tree as you work with the beads, before it is later rolled into a circle and/or cut off.

, Place the spiral on one prong of the pliers, then gradually pull the coils apart one by one, to stretch out the tree. Be sure to separate the loops to leave even spaces as you go. (See the image above.) The tree is now ready for adding beads; just be sure to make its partner for a pair of earrings.

, The original coil you made when making the spiral will act as a stopper when the beads reach it.


When you reach the base of the tree, roll a short length of wire into a small loop. This may require cutting off excess wire; judge it before you form the shape.

, Thread the red Czech glass bead onto an eye-pin. Cut the excess wire off the eye-pin, leaving enough to roll into loop the same size as the existing loop at the top of the eye-pin. Attach this piece to the base loop under the tree using one of the loops, allowing it to dangle free.

,, Connect a brass link to the top loop of the wire tree with a jumpring, then attach an earring hook to the brass link.


The little bow is optional but makes for a sweet touch.

, The Christmas tree shape earrings are now ready for wearing.

Cover your own travel expenses with rewards.,
Buy someone else’s flight.,
Research your airline miles rewards program.",How to Use Credit Card Rewards at Christmas2," Chances are your mother would love to see you for Christmas. In fact, the gift of time together is often the best gift of all. Especially if you have rewards points that can be exchanged for airline miles or hotel lodging, offer to visit a family member you haven’t seen in awhile. Not only might a free plane ticket facilitate a happy holiday reunion, any money you would have needed to travel can be used to cover other holiday expenses.
Note that any airline expenses that are not covered by your points will likely lead to bonus rewards points. In addition, you may receive discounts on travel-related expenses you book with your credit card.

, If you know that one of your family members would like to visit you and your family over the holidays, offering to cover their flight can be a hugely appreciated gift. Note that different airlines and rewards programs will have different rules about gifting airline miles, so be sure to contact your card company with any questions. Similarly, you can give the gift of travel. If your rewards program allows you to transfer miles, consider giving someone a flight somewhere you know they’ve always wanted to go or simply to visit you later in the year.

, You may have signed up for a rewards program for a particular reason without knowing about other potential benefits. You may even be acquiring rewards points you didn’t know about. Though it will often be written in rather fine print, the full description of your card’s reward program is disclosed on the credit card’s website.An example of little-known information involves rewards programs most people use to get airline miles but which can also be redeemed for merchandise or gift cards.

Use your credit card responsibly.,
Sign up for a new rewards card a few months before the holidays.,
Make sure your rewards card is right for you.,
Look ahead to next holiday season.",How to Use Credit Card Rewards at Christmas3," If you cannot consistently pay off your entire credit card balance each month and are accumulating debt, stop using the card. While rewards programs are great incentives to use a card, they can also be very costly if your use is irresponsible.If you carry a balance from one month to the next, you’re likely paying the card company more in interest than any perks you get from the reward program.

, A sign-up bonus is often the best way to accumulate points quickly. Know that there may be a purchase level you need to reach in order to receive the best bonus. Take advantage of your increased holiday spending to reach that level. For example, one major credit card offers a 100,000-point sign-up bonus if you spend $4,000 on the card within the first three months.

, One immediate factor to consider each year is the annual fee associated with your card. If you’re receiving and using your points, you’ve probably saved substantially more than the cost of the fee. However, if you only occasionally use your rewards points, a card with an annual fee may not be cost-effective. In short, you should choose credit cards that offer you the best advantages in light of your pattern of use. For many people airline miles offer the best advantages associated with rewards programs. Simple cash-back rewards may be best for others.

, The best way successfully to use credit card rewards to cover holiday expenses is to save them up throughout the year. Note that many rewards programs offer additional point bonuses for certain types of purchases throughout the year. For instance, you might receive extra points on hotel expenses during a particular fiscal quarter. Familiarize yourself with these incentives schedules, and consider making significant purchases during periods that will lead to the greatest rewards.

Tell friends and family to give you cash.,
Ask for bank gift cards.,
Ask for gift cards to your favorite stores.",How to Get What You Want for Christmas3," A great way to get what you want for Christmas is to buy it yourself. Ask your friends and family for cash this Christmas, and then you can use it to buy whatever you want. As a bonus, you might make the cash last a little longer because you can take advantage of the after Christmas sales., There are many gift cards that can be used anywhere for anything.

Start early.,
Before writing out your final list, write down everything that you want.,
Think of luxuries.,
Get rid of things that you don't really want.,
Research a bit on your items.,
Put together your list.,
Go over your list one last time before presenting it.",How to Make a Christmas Wish List," Don't wait until December to start thinking about this. Whenever there is something that you want, but you can't get because you don't have enough money or your parents won't buy it for you, write it down.;
, That means every single thing you would want. Even if you only want it a little, write it down. Once you cannot think of anything else that you could possibly want, move on to step two.


Think of your interests. Do you like sports? Then put a soccer ball, or some sort of sports equipment on your list. Do you love fashion? Then write down clothes, or be more specific (shirts, a scarf, etc.) If you like music, Put CDs, radio, or an iPod on your Christmas list.
Think of what you need. Do you need some more T-shirts? If so, put them on your list. Or are you short on headbands and hair accessories? Put them on the list.
Think about what you want. Do you so desperately want the latest makeup palette? If so, put that on your list.

, If you are a very practical person, think of things you would never buy for yourself, because you don't really need them, but that you would enjoy anyway. Let others treat you to those things.

, Yes, this is the hardest part. Narrowing down the list. Try to shoot for around 10-20 items. For example, let's say you have really wanted a digital camera for the past two years. That's something to keep on the list. But if you just recently wanted a new pair of headphones, and your old pair is just fine, that's something to cross off the list, because you don't really need or want it. A camera, however, is functional for taking pictures of things, and shooting videos.

, Who makes the item? How much is it? Do you know any one who owns it? Could you describe it? are probably some of the questions you will hear. Go online and research what you want. Prices are always the best thing to look up first, then where this item can be obtained, and any other information. Pictures are great, so when your parents go Christmas shopping, they aren't stuck looking around for the present with the same name, they are just looking for the object that resembled the picture.

, Make it neat, colorful, and make sure to add some data about the item, like a picture and a price, and where you can buy it. This way, shopping for your gifts will not be too confusing. Also, if your mom/dad has to hop around to 10 stores just to buy two gifts, it will most likely tick them off. Try to make sure that they can buy most of your gifts at one or two stores. And, there is always online shopping from the comfort of your own home!

, Double-check your information. Are all the prices correct? Can you replace a brand name item with a cheaper but equally functional one? Is everything spelled correctly? When you are ABSOLUTELY SURE everything is correct, present your list to your parents.

Choose your fabric.,
Create a sewing pattern or print a template.,
Cut your fabric.,
Fuse the fusible fleece to the fleece.,
Orient your outer fabric inward and sew its front.,
Attach the back strip of your stocking.,
Fasten the sole to your stocking.,
Assemble the innermost deco bond layer.,
Finish your stocking.",How to Make a No‐Hang Christmas Stocking," This guide utilizes deco bond, fake fur, fleece, and fusible fleece fabrics. However, you can substitute similar materials to suit your preferences. For example, in place of the fleece you might use a festive, holiday themed quilting fabric. Feel free to experiment with different options.


When choosing a substitute for fusible fleece, make sure you select a fabric that can fuse to other fabrics when heat is applied, like fusible fleece. Otherwise, you'll have to sew this fabric in place instead of ironing it on.
If you want to use a substitute for deco bond, be sure you choose a fabric that is similarly semi-rigid. This fabric will form an insert which will help your stocking stand upright on the floor without assistance, so substitutes need to be able to do the same. ;
, Your stocking will have four parts: two pieces for either side of the stocking, one for its sole, and one for its back. However, you'll only need three patterns: one for both sides, one for the sole, and one for the back. You may want to use a pre-made template online, which can be found with a online keyword search for ""no hang stocking template,"" or you can make your own sewing pattern. To recap, you'll need a pattern for:


Both sides (only one pattern for both)
The back (rectangular shaped, to connect the sides together)
The sole (to connect both sides together at the bottom), Take your patterns and use a fabric pencil or piece of chalk to outline the patterns on your fleece, fusible fleece, and deco bond fabric. Each piece of fabric should have four patterns drawn: one outline for each side of the stocking, one for the back, and one for the sole. Then take your scissors and cut out the patterns from the fabric.


After you finish cutting, you should have a total of 12 pieces of cut fabric, which you will assemble together to form your stocking.

, In this example, the fleece will form the outer fabric of your stocking. Feel free to use other materials, like a Christmas themed quilting fabric.Attach the fusible fleece to the reverse side of the fabric's print/design.Generally, to fuse fusible fleece:


Lay it on an iron safe surface with the adhesive side facing up. Lay the outer fabric of your stocking so the opposite side of its print/design is atop the fusible fleece. Iron the fabric according to the manufacturer's instructions to cause it to fuse together., You're going to sew together your stocking with the outer, patterned side of the fabric facing inwards. This way, unsightly seams will be hidden inside the stocking when you turn it inside out when you're finished. Before sewing:


Position the left and right sides of the stocking that have been already fused together so the outer, patterned side of the fabric is facing to the inside of the stocking.
Use pins to hold the sides of the stocking together along the front seam. Make sure your fabric is evenly aligned.

Sew your stocking from the tip of the toe of the stocking up its front seam until you reach its top. Sew your seam 3/8"" (.95 cm) in from the outer edge of the pattern., This part, and all following parts, should be oriented with the outer, patterned side of the fabric oriented inward. Use pins to hold position the back rectangular strip of your stocking so as to connect the side parts. Then:Use your needle and thread to sew the back strip of the stocking 3/8"" (.95 cm) in from the outer edge of the fabric, from the back heel up to the top of the stocking.

, Use pins to position the sole in place, attaching it to the side pieces of fabric and the back strip. Sew your sole to the sides and back strip 3/8"" (.95 cm) in from the outer edge of the fabric.


Once you are finished sewing on the sole, you can set this assembled section of your stocking aside.

, The deco bond layer will form a semi-rigid shell inside your stocking, which will enable the stocking to stand upright without being hung. But first, you'll assemble it separate from the rest of the sock. Put together the deco bond layer in the same fashion you did the rest of your stocking:


Use pins to hold fabric pieces in place while sewing. Sew the front of the stocking, from the tip of the toes to the top, 3/8"" (.95 cm) in from the outer edge of the fabric.
Similarly pin in place and sew the back strip for the deco bond. Then do the same for the sole piece of the deco bond., Take the fused, sewn together part of your stocking and turn it inside out. Insert your semi-rigid deco bond shell into the stocking so it can stand upright. At this point, the print side of your fabric should be facing outwards, as it does normally. Then:


Pin your rectangle of fake fur along the top of your stocking and sew it in place. After that, insert your deco bond shell into the stocking so it can stand on its own.
Decorate your stocking according to your tastes. You might want to add glitter, use fabric markers to write festive messages, like ""Happy Holidays,"" ribbons, bows, and so on."

Accept that it is okay to give yourself a gift.,
Work out what to give yourself.,
Save up for your special gift.,
Keep quiet about the gift you're getting for yourself.,
Buy the Christmas gift for yourself.,
Open your self-given gift on Christmas Day, along with other gifts.,
Be open about it being a self gift.",How to Give Yourself a Christmas Present," Think about how hard you've worked this year and all the things you've done to make other people's lives easier. Realize too, that if you've a history of family and friends not quite hitting the mark when it comes to giving you gifts, that the only way that you're likely to get what you truly want is to get it yourself.;
, There are so many possibilities, that only ideas can be suggested here. It could be something that you've always wanted, it could be something you really need or it could be something that will make your life or the life of others easier. Some ideas include:


A donation to charity in your name; or a gift of an animal/tools/teaching via a charity.
Pampering items, such as a spa set, a gift certificate for a spa/massage treatment, expensive spa products, etc.
Electronics that you don't think you'll ever be given as a gift.
Something tailored just the way you like it.
Clothing, shoes, accessories, jewelry, etc.
Travel, education, a dinner out, etc.
The services of a cleaner, gardener, de-clutter specialist, hair stylist, architect, etc.
Hobby, craft, art supplies, etc.
Membership or subscription to a gym, club, magazines, wine club, etc.
A basket or box filled with goodies and gourmet items.
A garden set of seeds, seedlings, garden gloves, spade and hoe, etc.
A comfortable new chair for work or play
Your New Year's Resolutions, already worked out clearly and already scheduled, booked in and saved up for!
A new diary with times blocked out in it just for you.

, This is a good opportunity to purchase something decent for yourself, by saving up well ahead and using this gift to present a savings goal. In order for you to set aside any guilt feelings over a self-purchased gift, this early saving-up approach will allow you to have the spare cash without eating into other needs.

, If you've been dropping hints left, right and center about it, then there is an increased possibility that someone will take you up on that and purchase the gift. Thus, it's best to stay quiet about the item or activity and simply set it aside as your goal.


You may need to check that nobody else is likely to purchase this gift for you. If you overhear anybody talking about it or suspect it might be purchased for you, it might be a good idea to wait until after Christmas to purchase the gift for yourself. It might even be on sale then.

, If it's a thing, wrap it up and put it away somewhere safe in your house in readiness for placing under the Christmas tree. When wrapping, this means:


Do not open the item in any way. Leave it completely intact. Part of the joy is discovering its contents on Christmas Day, not at wrapping time.
If it's an experience or service, place the voucher or invoice in a card and wrap that. Check carefully that it won't expire before Christmas or before you're ready to take advantage of it.
If you've given a gift to charity in your name, place the invoice or donor acknowledgement in a card and wrap that. Opening it can present a fabulous opportunity to talk to others at the time about the charity and the good things that it does.

, It's one of the bundle of gifts you're getting, the only difference being that you know what it is. The joy lies in knowing that it's exactly what you want, it's brand new and you've yet to make use of it/familiarize yourself with it. It'll still be enjoyable even though you know what it is.

, Tell others when opening it that you gave it to yourself. It might encourage them to be self-generous too!

Crafts like sewing? This step is do determine the personality of your recipient. This will make sure you are not in the dark when choosing the gifts and the decoration on the box.
, When you thought through, go and buy the materials to make the box. The items you need are listed here in this article, further down the page under ""Things You'll Need"".

, Stores like Target, Walmart, PBteen, and others may have good teen décor, although PBteen is expensive. GameStop is the ideal place is your recipient is an avid or novice gamer alike, and used games are ideal if you plan on a tighter budget. There are many deals online. Use Google Products or a similar sales search engine for online sales, once you have rough ideas of what to get.

, If your recipient is an audiophile (an individual who listens to loads of music), get them an iTunes Gift Card (only applies to iTunes users) or a different gift card for their preferred music store. A new iPod/Zune/other MP3/MP4 player upwards of 40-50GB would be good for moderate audiophiles, or up to an iPod classic 160GB for the serious audiophile who is on the go.

, If you chose not to buy the store bought card of your choice, make your homemade card. Insert a gift card (if you bought one) and/or some cash. Do it well.

, Gather the gifts, card, wrapping paper, box, scissors, tape, tissue paper, and anything else you want to use (Don't forget the Christmas To/From Label!)

, The task is now present. Take the box, and use shipping tape to close the bottom (this applies to shipping boxes or any box that is non-taped on the bottom).

, Take your store bought gifts and wrap them in at least 3-8 sheets of tissue paper over each other. Depending on the weight and physical size, you may need to adjust this amount. The heavier the more paper, the less, the less paper, but don't reduce the paper below 2 sheets! This is for obvious reasons as the gift needs to be wrapped well to be cushioned. Tissue paper is very thin.

, For the cards, find a regular security mailing envelope (the kind with the special see-out no see-in pattern) and fold the card to fit in it. Write the recipient's name on the front of the envelope exterior.


Stick the card in the box, but wrap that too, as if they try to shake the box, a heavy present could easily rip open the card and spoil the surprise.

, Get your wrapping paper ready.

, Find your favorite method, or use one you already know you like. Use a Christmas Wrapping Paper! This is not a birthday, Easter, or Halloween. If you don't have any, look in your favorite special occasion store, like Hallmark for an example. Many awesome styles of Christmas wrapping paper are out there.

, Find a nice, beautiful, bow with strong, sticky adhesive.

",How to Organize a Home for Christmas," Whether you'll be travelling or stuck in your house hosting your own party/get-together, there will be lots to do to get things organized and ready.


Don't forget the boring but necessary stuff. You will need clothes to get dry cleaned, as well as bedding to retrieve from cupboards and closets for festive sleep overs. In addition, you will need to make sure that you have enough plates, chairs and glasses for serving meals to more people than usual, and all those sorts of things.;
, Whether it's your grandmother's favorite apple pie, your cousin's favorite fruitcake or a relative that loves Christmas-colored Jell-O, there's always something that can transform your home into the goodness that only the holiday brings in.

, Make budgets for each family member (including yourself) on what you are willing to spend on Christmas presents. A budget can be a critical method of making sure you don't overspend and end up flat broke in your bank. Even those credit cards can acquire this bad taste if you don't budget your money wisely enough.


Make a list of gifts for each family member you need to buy for. Make sure to place the approximate value, that the item is normally known to be sold for from most stores, on the one side of the list next to the item. This way, you will know how much the item is known to sell for, and how much you'll need to budget during the Christmas-buying extravaganza that occurs in most families who celebrate Christmas.
If the item is at sold for 150 US dollars at one store, while other places is 300 and up, you either might want to look elsewhere or find something that's a little cheaper so you can't over-budget yourself and your money.

, Even on the areas that are meant for shorter-sized people, kids can get in the smaller places where adults tend to slack off or tend to miss. A child's attention to detail will be inevitable and can surely help in most projects you'll complete. Delegate tasks that don't have any very-hurtful risks.

, Ask your spouse to help you, so that both sides of the family can join in. Utilize friends of both sides of the family.

, Make sure that all Christmas light strands are in working order, and that there are no wires that have frayed or broken from storage over the past year.


If they are frayed, don't use that strand. If they have broken, replace what is broken or make the proper adjustments to ensure safe use of the decorating piece. Fraying areas will trump brokenness if both are apparent.

, Whether it's your favorite porcelain Santa collection that's only brought out for the Christmas season, or it's the collectible Christmas village scene, display all the decorations that you own and that fit into your house's theme.

, Don't start wrapping just yet, though. If you email Christmas cards, you can leave the paper Christmas cards off the list, and prepare to make the adjustments to switch to this form accordingly.,,, Christmas crackers, candles, batteries for toys, cranberry sauce and Brandy Butter are just a few examples of things you can forget easily. However, you have the potential to take the edge of the Perfect Christmas so try to get these kinds of things well in advance.

, Shop at shopping malls and bargain outlets, thrift stores and the like for the ""after-Christmas sales"" for cards, decorations, and gift paper.

, Recognize what you'd like to do different. Is there someone who you'd like to leave off your list, or invite someone who you missed inviting? Is there another part of your house that you forgot to decorate or is there something that was over-decorated and shouldn't have been? The only person who can be trusted to know what things need to change the following year, is the decorators themselves - not the invitees!

You could buy individually wrapped candies and distribute them into the cups. Look for candies wrapped in holiday colors like red, green, white and silver. You could also buy bulk candy and then make your own individually wrapped treats using cellophane or tiny plastic baggies., As an alternative to sweets, gather other types of tiny gifts for each muffin cup. Buy tiny ornaments that can be used to decorate a tabletop Christmas tree, so that each day your child can add a new decoration to it. If you want to do something more religiously themed, write bible verses on 24 small pieces of paper. Roll them up like tiny scrolls, tie them with red or green ribbon and place one in each cup.

You could also put small trinkets (like inspirational pictures and symbols) or tiny toys (like individual Legos) in the cups, as well.

, It is standard for most muffin tins to have two punches holes on one or both ends of the pan. If you want to hang your calendar on the wall, thread a holiday-colored ribbon through the holes on one end, then knot the ends together to create a “hook.” Hang the calendar from a nail on the wall.

To display it on a flat surface, situate the muffin tin on a simple picture frame stand.
You may want to “fill” the cups with treats after you decide where and how you are going to display the calendar."

Choose ribbon.,
Start by looping your bow around the gift and tying a knot.,
Make a loop with the left end of the ribbon.,
Create a second loop.,
Tighten the bow.,
Add decorations.",How to Make a Christmas Bow1," Classic Christmas ribbon usually has red, green, or a mixture of the two. You can choose solid red or green ribbon, a plaid design, polka dots, or stripes - when it comes to Christmas colors, personal preference is what matters most. Here are some other ideas that aren't so black and white - or, shall we say, red and green:


If you're looking for something different, go for a blue ribbon with silver or white accents. This is a pretty choice that still looks festive enough for the season.
Purple is also a nice choice for a Christmas ribbon. Look for a deep, rich hue that's a bit reddish in tone.
Anything that sports stars, candy canes, snowflakes, bells, or mittens is a great choice for Christmas, no matter the color scheme.;
, Cut a length of ribbon long enough to circle the package with several inches to spare on either end. Secure the ribbon tightly so that it won't slip off.








, Use your forefinger and thumb to hold the loop in place over the knot. The loop should be smooth with no twists or wrinkles.








, Bring the right side of the ribbon around the left loop, then underneath it. Pull it through so that you create a second loop the same size as the first. You're using the same technique you use to tie your shoes.








, Pull the two loops with equal pressure to tighten the knot at their center. Adjust the ends to make the loops look neat and even.








, Now that you've got your basic bow, consider adding a few decorative elements. You can fasten a bit of wire tinsel to the bow, or tape a small ornament underneath it.

"
"
Choose wide ribbon.,
Cut a long length of ribbon.,
Make a loop at the left end.,
Make a second loop.,
Make more accordion-style loops.,
Make a center cinch.,
Fluff the loops on either side.,
Finish the bow.",How to Make a Christmas Bow2," To decorate your home, you'll want thick, wide, fancy-looking ribbon. A fabric like velvet adds a nice, classy touch. Ribbon made with wires to help it retain its shape also works well for this bow.

, You'll need a piece at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) long. For a larger bow, cut a longer length of ribbon.








, Start three inches from the end of the ribbon. Use your forefinger and thumb to pinch the bow into a loop.








, Gather ribbon to the right of the first loop to create a second loop of the same size right next to it. Now the ribbon should look like a backward ""S"" with a length of ribbon on either side.








, Keep making loops, working toward the right, so that you have a pile of loops of equal size. Work until you get almost to the end. Stop about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the end, so you have a tail on either side of the pile of loops. Pinch the loops in the center.

, Use a small piece of florist wire, a thin string, or a smaller ribbon to tie the loops together at the center, where your fingers are holding them in place.








, Once the center is secure, fluff the loops and separate them on either side, so that you can't see where the center is cinched.








, Use scissors to cut an inverted ""v"" shape into the ends of the tails for a classic look. Tie a few jingle bells around the center cinch so that they hang down from the middle of the bow. Hang the bow on your wall, on a doorknob, or on a mirror to decorate for the season.








"
"
Pick out bright ribbon.,
Wrap ribbon around your hand.,
Remove the loops and fold them in half.,
Cut the middle.,
Tie the cinch.,
Fluff out the loops.,
Affix the bow to your wreath.",How to Make a Christmas Bow3," Since you're adding this bow to a wreath, pick out ribbon that will contrast with the deep evergreen color of the foliage. Red, silver, and gold ribbon all work well for this purpose. Cut a length at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) long.

, Hold the tail end of the ribbon against your palm, using your thumb to keep it in place. Wrap the ribbon around the back of your hand and bring it up over your palm. Keep doing this until the entire ribbon has been looped around your hand.








, Be careful to keep the loops in place, stacked on top of one another, when you slip them off of your hand.








, Hold the folded stack of loops in one hand so that the center fold is facing up. Use scissors to cut the the two corners off of the center fold. You've now created the place where the bow will be cinched.









Be careful to cut through all of the ribbon layers using a good sharp pair of scissors.
Don't cut the corners too close to the middle of the ribbon, or you'll cut it all apart.

, Use a second ribbon or piece of string to tie the cinch between the notches you made. Use a pretty piece of twine or florist wire for a decorative touch.








, One by one, fan out the loops from the center and twist them toward you. Arrange them so that they create a circular pattern reminiscent of petals.








, Use a little more florist twine to attach the bow to the bottom of your wreath.

Cut the butter into the flour, baking powder, and ground ginger.,
Mix together the brown sugar, egg, and golden syrup in a separate bowl.,
Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture, and mix until a dough forms.,
Chill the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes.,
Roll the dough out on a sheet of parchment paper, then cut it into shapes using cookie cutters.,
Peel away the excess cookie dough, then lift the parchment paper and place it onto a large baking sheet.Once you have cut out as many shapes as you can fit, peel the excess dough away and ball it up.,
Chill the dough for another 30 minutes.,
Bake the cookies for 12 to 15 minutes, or until firm.,
Allow the cookies to cool completely before decorating them.,
Beat the egg white and vanilla extract until they turn frothy.,
Add the confectioner's sugar gradually.,
Beat the mixture on high speed until it forms stiff peaks.,
Divide the icing into bowls, and stir in some food coloring into each one.,

, Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl first, then cut the butter into them. You can use a food processor, pastry blender, or two crisscrossing knives for this step.


For chocolate gingerbread, add ½ cup 50 grams) of cocoa powder., Place the brown sugar into a clean mixing bowl, then add the egg and brown syrup. Stir everything together until evenly combined., Start by stirring everything together with a spoon or rubber spatula. Once it is just combined, use your hands to finish kneading the dough. The dough may be dry at first, but it will eventually soften up.If the dough is too dry, add a splash of milk.

, Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, then put it into the fridge for 30 minutes. This will prevent the dough from becoming too mushy when you roll it out., You can use standard sized cookie cutters or mini cookie cutters. You will need 25 cookies, one for each day on the Advent Calendar. They can be Christian symbols, such as stars and angels, or they can be holiday symbols, such as trees, reindeer, and stockings.


Consider making a larger cookie for the last day on the Calendar.
It might be a good idea to make a few extra cookies in case you mess up.
If you plan on hanging the cookies, use a straw or skewer to poke holes into the top of each one.

, Lift the parchment paper up and place it on a large baking sheet.

, Place the entire baking sheet back into the fridge, and leave it there for 30 minutes. This will prevent the cookies from spreading and losing their shape when baked., It is better to over-bake these cookies than to under-bake them. You will be using them as an Advent Calendar by eating one each day; you want them to last the entire month.

, Once the cookies are baked, transfer them to a wire cooling rack, and let them cool. This will take about 5 minutes., Separate the egg yolk from the white. Save the yolk for another recipe, and put the white into a large bowl. Add the lemon juice, then beat until the whites turn frothy. You can do this using a stand mixer, a handheld beater, or a food processor fitted with whisks.If you'd prefer something less sweet, use lemon juice instead of vanilla extract.
Be sure to use pasteurized egg whites.

, Turn the speed down to the lowest setting and add the sugar slowly. Keep beating until the sugar is evenly mixed in. The mixture should look a little shiny at this point., This will take about 5 to 7 minutes., You can use as many colors as you'd like, or just two different ones. For a more old-fashioned look, consider leaving one of the bowls white. You can use as much or as little as you'd like. The more food coloring you use, the darker and more vibrant the color will be.One color will be your background color. The other color will be your detail color. Plan on using more icing for the background.

,, Choose a background color, then pipe the icing around the inside edges of your cookies. This will create a border for the icing, and prevent it from running off. Once you have the cookies outlined, let them dry for 10 to 30 minutes.If you added holes to your cookies, be sure to outline around the hole. This way, you won't risk accidentally filling it in.

, Using the same color as you did for the piped edges, squeeze the icing back into its bowl. Stir in some water so that it becomes thinner. You'll be using this to fill in your outlines.

, Some people find that using a skewer or cocktail stick helps them guide the icing to the edges. You want the icing to blend in smoothly with the outlines., This can take up to 12 hours. Be sure to store your piping bags in the fridge so that they don't dry out.

, Take out your piping bags, and write a number on each cookie. An Advent Calendar has 25 days, so number the cookies accordingly. Consider writing 25 on the largest cookie.

, At this point, your cookies are done, but you can still decorate them further. For example, if you have stocking-shaped cookies, you might want to add the trim. If you have gingerbread men-shaped cookies, you might want to add the face.

, If you added holes to them, cut some ribbon, and thread it through each hole. Hang the cookies on a decorative board or on a tree. If you did not add holes, you can put them into a banner with 25 pouches, or into a box with 25 slots.

Buy a reusable advent calendar for your child.,
A messy house always contributes to stress.,
Keeping the children busy shouldn't be too difficult as there is plenty for them to do!,
It might be a good idea to buy as many presents as you can from charity shops.,
While were on the subject, get your children into the charitable feeling as well.,
Rather than spending your time wrapping presents a better idea might be to buy a cloth sack.,
Caring involves caring for you.,
You can make decorations out of unwanted rubbish - a great activity for your kids to join in with – or you can by ready made recycled gifts that help the environment.,
When planning your Christmas meal try to use only seasonal vegetables and if you can grown locally.,
Baking is also good fun even if you’re not that good.",How to Have a Truly Caring Christmas," They are purse friendly and you can fill them with your own choice of edible and non-edible treats. Take good care of them and your child could be giving them to their children. Plus, can you imagine how much card is thrown away every year for the sake of twenty-four clumps of sugary chocolate? See sources below for some lovely calendars.;
, Get the Christmas CD out, roll your sleeves up and out that cupboard. If your house is full of old junk perhaps you'd better start earlier in the year and spread it out. Remember, if it's not useful, ornamental or sentimental - get rid of it! Once you've sorted everything, you'll feel like a huge wall has been lifted out your way and you can tackle anything! It’s important that you are not too stressed out at Christmas. It’s bad for you and your family and kids know when something is up, even if you’re pretending to be happy. Really try to enjoy yourselves and don’t make more work for yourself over tiny details.

, Have them make and write their own cards, make tree decorations, write a Christmas story, make decorations for their room and even make a menu for the table on Christmas day while you take care of the important things. Whatever the time of year you should always be spending some family time together. It's therapeutic to sit down and play a board game, bake cookies or just watch a movie together. Be sure to read to them before they go to bed to help their imaginations as well as their sleep.

, No seriously, second hand doesn't always mean shabby and dirty and plenty of things even look brand new but for lower prices. You'll surely find something and the earlier you go the better. A local Oxfam shop might be the best option so when 'Do they know it's Christmas' comes on the radio, you can be proud that you helped that charity. If this interests you and you have some cash to spare, there is a website called Oxfam unwrapped which lets you buy and send some of the things we take for granted and send them to third world countries. It’s worth a look!

, Children that are brought up well care about others and I’m sure they have plenty of things in their bedroom that can go those less fortunate. Why? Because that was exactly what the real St. Nicolas did. He gave his bags of gold to a poor family as they slept. Teach them the story, and why it feels good to give as well as receive. Make them feel that what they’re doing is important. This makes them feel special and happy. Get them - as well as yourself – to say a prayer of thanks and pray for those less fortunate.

, Plenty of shops sell these. Pulling the paper of presents sure is exciting but walking into a living room Christmas morning and seeing a bag of prezzies is no less wonderful. Tell them to close their eyes and reach into the sack and pull their presents out one by one. Tons and tons of wrapping are thrown away every year. If you receive a present that's wrapped try to save the wrapping, it could come in useful. Recycle Christmas cards as well. Plenty of supermarkets have some sort of recycling scheme like this. Just check it out!

, Things might be getting stressful as the day draws ever nearer. When you’re alone and the house is quiet, try reversing some of the symptoms of stress through meditation. You don’t have to sit like a Buddha. A lot of people find it comfortable lying on the bed and clearing their minds. try to get some things done during the day to get things off your mind before you meditate as it will help clear your mind better. See sources below for some helpful guides to meditation. Listening to classical music or carols is also a good idea. Find some time to take a walk down the park or countryside for some fresh air as well. Maybe you could have a winter nature walk with the kids and see what you find.

, Check out sources below for more information. Prices vary, but you’re sure to find something useful. One idea you might have on your walks is collecting pine cones into a pretty bowl and dusting them with icing sugar. They are great festive decorations and can be simply put back outside again once you’re done. Grow a holly bush as well or buy plastic holly. If you are buying plastic decorations look after them so you’re not throwing tattered pieces away every Christmas. The longer they last the better.

, If you eat meat try to buy a free-range turkey. I'll be honest, they aren't always cheap but if you've been following my steps perhaps you have some cash to spare. You’d be doing a good thing and easing a perfectly normal conscience. For more detailed information on the subject, see sources below.

, Brownies and cookies make great presents. They are more special that something bought and let’s them know how much you care to go to the effort. Nothing gets those festive thoughts going more than a bit of Christmas music. Play some in the background as it gets closer to that time. Try to work together with family more rather than being isolated and don’t be afraid to sing along yourself with the children or whoever as you’re licking the bowl clean. If your children believe in Santa bake some cookies for him and don’t forget to leave some carrots for his reindeer!

Gauge your child's feelings.,
Let the question come up naturally.,
Play a guessing game.,
Explain the background of Santa.",How to Tell Your Child Who Santa Is1," Understand what your child feels and knows about Santa before complicating the truth about the myth. Keep up the story they know until they introduce some skepticism or desire to know more of the truth.


Ask your child what other children have said about Santa, or what your child thinks about him. You will be able to tell if he or she believes wholeheartedly that he is real, in which case saying anything different will be met with severe disappointment or plain disbelief.
It may be that you have chosen from the beginning to opt out of telling the magical story of Santa delivering presents to children in one night. But even so, it is easy for children to foster a belief that Santa is real anyhow from friends, movies, and other media portrayals of the jolly man. Be careful not to assume that your child understands completely.;
, Wait to talk to your child about the truth of Santa until he or she brings it up themselves. This way you know you are not springing new information on them too soon.


Allow your child to wait to hear rumors, put together clues, and otherwise use his or her reasoning skills to question what they know on their own. This can become a positive exercise in critical thinking rather than a disappointing revelation.
Turn your child's question around. If he or she asks, “Mom/Dad, is Santa real?” you ask, “Well, what do you think?” and wait for the answer before giving anything away., Let your child guess who the real Santa Claus could be. Offer clues or options to choose from to make it an enjoyable experience.


Try listening to a Christmas song that your child likes and sing along to any lyrics that might hint at who Santa could be. “He knows when you’ve been bad or good” for example, can be a nudge in the right direction.
You can hint at subtle logic to start your child guessing on their own at who could be “playing” Santa. For example: “Hmm, who would be able to get into our house at night?” or “Who likes those cookies we leave out?

, Let your child know that Santa was a real person or based on a real person if you want to. Explain Saint Nicholas or another origin of your choice.


Tell the story of St. Nicholas, who was well known as a gift-giver, a protector of children, and a man of great faith who spent his whole life and life savings to help those less fortunate than himself. Some people believe the red robes that St. Nicholas wore as a bishop inspired the famous red Santa suit.If you want to keep up some level of myth, you can say that Santa was a real person who is no longer around and that today, there need to be lots of Santas, in the form of moms and dads, to do all the work of giving kids presents on Christmas.

Get something to sleep on.,
Find a good hiding place!,
When your parents tell you to go to bed, pretend like you are doing just that.,
Wait till you hear the door shut.,
Get up and start arranging your spot and what you will do before they get back.

,
Hide.,
If you want to see your gift, get binoculars.,
Be surprised about your gift even if you sneakily saw it.,
You will have needed to set up everything before Christmas comes.,
You will need food with lots of sugar.,
Don't drink too much liquid because your parents will hear if you flush the toilet.,
Simply fall asleep!",How to Stay Awake on Christmas Eve," The best and most comfortable thing is a sleeping bag, because no one wants to sleep on a dirty carpet. If your bedroom is close by or you can peek out into the hall from your bedroom, that's the best option.;
, Your parents (or Santa) might not be very happy if you're up so late. Behind cupboards or couches are good if there's a wall behind them.

, Roll on your side so they can't see your face and drink or eat something with lots of sugar to keep your hyper and energized.

, It will be very quiet so you will have to pay close attention. Most parents will also turn the hall lights off if you/they are going to bed.

,, A very good hiding space is underneath the Christmas tree, but make sure you have lots of room.


If your Christmas tree is low to the ground it will probably not be a very good idea.
Most houses have a dining room and a dining table. Hide underneath the dining room table if you really want to. You can also hide under a couch or in a cupboard.

, It's better safe than sorry.

, You will need a very surprised look unless you asked what you are going to get, so start practicing!

, Christmas Eve or the day before Christmas Eve work just fine so your parents don't see your stuff.

, Not too much though because you will probably crash when you're opening your gifts. A few pieces of candy and hot chocolate do well enough to keep you awake.

, On the other hand, going to the bathroom is a great way to create a distraction if you need a quick escape!

, Little kids probably won't want their Christmas spoiled, so get the sleep you'll need for your early morning if you want a surprise!"

Think about the gifts you are going to buy people.,
To save a bit of money, you can give Christmas pop up cards as gifts to people you don't know too well.,
If you are a child, don't spend too much money on people whom you don't know too well.,
Put all the presents under the tree as soon as you receive them so you don't lose them.",How to Keep Busy During Christmas2," What have they always wanted to buy? What is something that they were thinking of getting sometime soon? Remember, it is not always about how much you spend; but about the quality of the present.

, Try to give personalised gifts to closer people.

, Just get presents for your parents and best friend/friends.

, Resist the temptation to open it before Christmas!

"
Get a small Christmas tree and put ornaments on it (Just like a regular Christmas tree).

,
Hang paper snowflakes from your ceiling and you can also pin them up on the walls.

,
Hang lights or tinsel from your curtain pole.

,
Hang lights or tinsel from the very tops of your walls.

,
If you want to be really festive, you can buy Christmas cushions and a Christmas duvet and pillow cover.

,
Drape lights on the side of your bed to brighten your bed up.

Explain that your child is ""ready"".,
Show that Santa is still real in spirit.,
Understand what upsets your child.",How to Tell Your Child Who Santa Is2," Let your child know you are only telling him or her about Santa because you think they are old enough or ready to know the truth. Emphasize the positive accomplishment this represents, rather than being a letdown or lack of trust.


Give your child a hug and let him or her know how special, grown up, and wise they are now that they know more about Santa.
You can say, for example, “I’m so proud of you! You figured out the magic of Christmas! I knew you were ready to learn more about Santa because you’re such a smart girl/boy.”, Explain that you and other parents keep up the spirit of Santa, which is still real and represents generosity, love, and fun for children all over the world.


You can explain that different people dress up and “pretend” to be Santa not to lie to children, but because they want Santa’s spirit to be real too, and because it’s fun to dress up and play pretend every once in awhile.
If your child has a hard time understanding how Santa embodies the “spirit” of Christmas, you can compare him to a team mascot, or a Disney character at Disney World, who both represent a character and story.Offer an opportunity for your child to show his or her own Santa qualities of generosity or giving. Find a toy drive or other volunteer opportunity that they can donate items that are unused or grown out of to children who may not have them., If your child is upset by learning more of the truth about Santa, ask what bothers him or her about it. This can give you a better idea of how to console them.


If your child is upset that you lied to him or her, you can apologize genuinely and explain that the story is one that’s told to almost all children, and it’s part of growing up to figure out that there’s more to the story. Explain that it’s actually because you trust them that you decided to tell the full story.
If your child is upset by the possibility that no real Santa means no more gifts, writing letters, sitting on his lap, etc., you can assure him or her that gift-giving will still happen, and they can still go visit the man dressed as Santa in the mall if they want. Just because one knows the full truth of Santa doesn’t mean all the fun parts of Christmas go away.

"
"
Let Santa become a special secret.,
Explain that different families have different Santas.,
Continue to play pretend.",How to Tell Your Child Who Santa Is3," Make sure that your child knows that not everyone is ready to learn more about who Santa is. You can make it a special responsibility for your child to keep this secret for any younger siblings.


Let your child become a helper by giving them the responsibility of stuffing stockings for younger children after they have gone to bed, or another task that allows them to be involved in maintaining the ritual.If you have no younger children, you can ask your child to help keep the Santa story alive for other kids of the same age or younger at school who might not be ready to hear about Santa’s true story.

, Make sure your child understands that other children and other families will choose to tell the story of Santa differently, or at different times. He or she should do their best to respect these differences.


For example, if another child says Santa leaves cookie crumbs in his or her house but “yours” doesn't, you can instruct your child that families simply have different Santa traditions, and that one is not better or more real than another.
You can also explain different ways of dealing with Santa by comparing the belief to religion, if that’s already something you’ve discussed with your child. You can point out that your child wouldn’t make fun of another child for celebrating Hanukkah instead of Christmas, so they also shouldn’t make fun of someone for believing Santa is real., Know that just because you tell the truth about Santa doesn’t mean that your child can’t keep up a level of fantasy and make-believe about Christmas. Allow them to continue to act out elements of the story if they want to.


Offer your child the ability to act as Santa him or herself, or be an elf on Christmas eve, working to wrap presents for other family members and get the house set up for the holiday.
Remember that just like any other story, your child can understand that Santa and other characters may not be real, but can still enjoy the fantasy of it. You can laugh over the silliness of how Santa could ever visit every child’s house in one night while still appreciating the magic of an idea like the North Pole.

Start a new website.,
Write a story.,
Start up a scrapbook for your art.,
Get an A4 art book and start on fresh clean page, draw a title like ""my visual art diary"" and then put down your address under a subtitle ""if found return to"" decorate the page with glitter pens and drawings of things you can draw well then use it like a diary.,

Go on your website at least once a week and update it and read the comments and posts.;
, You could either write one in a book or online. If you decide to go the online route, you could post your story as a weekly or monthly blog. This will help keep your readers coming back and you could always advertise your website on Facebook and Twitter .

, Search on the Internet for some free art classes or information about the history of art write down the key points or notes and then illustrate them with drawings the best thing about this is that you don't have to be a good drawer or start taking art classes that cost money you could just scribble and make a picture out of it like its an ocean wave or something like that.

, not a normal 'dear diary' thing a diary that you use to draw in, like an art diary but more direct the first page after the title page could be an 'about me' page the next you could do a self portrait or maybe you could make a picture like the country side entirely out of pencil shavings. Last page suggestion is kinda dorky but it keeps you entertained.

, This is a fun idea even if you don't have younger siblings because like the story idea you could post it online! but if you do have siblings you can write them a script and get them to practice their lines and then rehearse in front of mum, dad or your guardians. if you like the script idea but don't know what to base it on perhaps you could visit wacky websites and pick a theme from there if not then you can always use Google to help you out

, This will keep you occupied reading about celebrity fashion and gossip, the hottest trends and whatnot. I know for sure that Dolly.com has weekly newsletters so try them first.

,,,, Christmas tree lights, candles, alcohol, ice, snow, heat, wind, leftovers, excess wrapping paper etc etc can all be Christmas health hazards. To survive, make sure nothing in your home over Christmas is an unacceptable risk to life."

Have your child write a Santa Letter.,
Write a letter from Santa and have your child receive it in the mail.,
Have your child leave milk and cookies out for Santa Claus on Christmas Eve.,
On Christmas Eve, have your child sprinkle reindeer food on the lawn.,
Leave Santa Claus tracks in your house on Christmas Eve.,
A month or so after Christmas, send your child a postcard from Santa Claus on vacation.,
Mail your child a birthday greeting from Santa Claus.",How to Keep Your Child Believing in Santa Claus," This can be a simple letter that your child can write to Santa Claus. Children absolutely love to write a letter to Santa, but they occasionally need a little parental guidance to pull it off.
Help your child include a special list of gifts they desire for Christmas into the Santa letter. Many children enjoy getting more creative by drawing or cutting out pictures that represent the gifts they want.
Once the child’s Santa letter is finished, simply mail it to the North Pole. Mail it to the following Santa Claus address: Santa Claus, 1 Candy Cane Lane, North Pole 00001. Don’t bother using a return address, you wouldn’t want it to return as ‘undeliverable’ for any reason.;
, Create a personalized letter from Santa by directly mentioning your child’s name and certain information about your child in the text. This will make for a much more believable Santa letter. Be sure to make these letters from Santa different for each child in the same household. The child will have no doubt that Santa Claus is coming to town after they receive their personalized letter from Santa!
“I can honestly state as a parent that the personalized letter from Santa has single -handedly restored my son’s belief! The look of shock and amazement on his face when he got an ‘authentic letter from Santa’ quickly abolished any doubt he previously had about Santa Claus.”
Print the Santa letter on authentic looking letterhead, as this will help to reinforce the believability. Many different styles of paper can be found at your local office supply store.
You can add to the fun by getting your letter from Santa postmarked at the North Pole. Simply send your Santa letter inside another sealed, stamped envelope to: North Pole Christmas Cancellation, Postmaster, 5400 Mail Trail, Fairbanks, AK 99709-9999. (It needs to arrive by December 15th)
Many parents add a certificate for being on Santa’s “Nice List” along with the Santa Letter for added effect. Another great item to add with the Santa letter is a Santa Claus coloring sheet. Combining the personalized Santa letter, the nice certificate, and the Santa Claus coloring sheet is a sure fire method for keeping your child believing.
A reputable online service that offers inexpensive Personalized Santa Letters and Nice Certificates can be found here: http://www.PackageFromSanta.com .

, This is simple enough to do with your child. It lets your child know YOU still believe, too. Make it a bonding experience for you and your child by baking the cookies together on Christmas Eve. Don’t underestimate how powerful this can be for creating joyful memories of Santa Claus, for both you and your child. Did you know that Santa’s favorite cookie recipe is Chocolate Chip?
Put the fresh cookies on a plate next to a glass of cold milk. You can even put a short letter to Santa Claus next to the cookies and milk. These tasty treats will give Santa the energy he needs to continue traveling to the millions of other households awaiting his arrival.
Don’t forget to leave some crumbs on the table Christmas morning. Your child will feel honored that Santa Claus ate the whole plate of cookies and drank all of the milk before rushing on his way.


Alternatively, leave him some brandy and a mince pie.

, Santa Claus gets milk and cookies on Christmas Eve, but what about Rudolph and the rest of the joyful gang? What do they eat? Well, reindeer food, of course!
You can make a batch of environmentally friendly reindeer food with common grocery items such as oats or granola. (Do not use potentially hazardous items, such as glitter in your reindeer food. Although this may make the reindeer food appear to be magical in some way, it can be extremely dangerous if ingested by small children, should they decide to ‘sample’ the reindeer food. It can also be potentially hazardous to the small animals outside such as rabbits, dogs, or cats that may eat the food.)
Once you have the reindeer food mixed up, walk outside with your child on Christmas Eve night and explain the importance of making sure Santa’s sleigh team stays fed. Sprinkle a small amount onto your yard near bushes or trees.
This healthy reindeer snack will give Rudolph and the rest of the reindeer the nourishment they need to continue flying Santa’s heavy sleigh into the night. Your child will be proud for helping Santa Claus on his journey, and is sure to raise the belief in Rudolph and the other reindeer as well.


If you don't have a lawn, you could leave some carrots, parsnips and/or Brussels sprouts on a plate in your house, near the milk/brandy and the cookies/mince pies, for Santa to feed his reindeer.

, Being sure to not stain your carpet, leave some dirty boot prints by the fireplace (or doorway). Be sure to draw attention to the Santa Claus footprints on Christmas morning. To a child, this is solid evidence that Santa had been to their house.

, This not only keeps your child believing, but reminds your child that Santa is in their hearts all year long. It also answers the common question posed by children after Christmas, “Where is Santa Claus now?”
Be sure to make the postcard from somewhere very warm and sunny. After all, Santa does need a break from all that North Pole snow.

, This technique works in tandem with the personalized Santa letter you mailed your child previously. Mailing your child a simple birthday card from Santa is an excellent way to keep your child’s belief high throughout the year. Your child will think, “Wow! Santa actually knows my birthday!” The shock on your child’s face will be priceless.

Chances are that you can whip some up using each recipe without having to run to the store. So create a small test batch of each if you’re so inclined. Find out which is most pleasing to the eye, touch, or both before buying in bulk.


Even if you decide to go with only one recipe right away, start with a small batch.

For an extra surprise, you might hide your card somewhere sneaky, like in the backpack of your intended recipient. Be careful when attempting this; your card might be accidentally overlooked!
Make the Christmas cards by hand. This will pass time and allows you to tailor the cards to the interests of friends and family., You might have to rely on your parents or someone older to drive you to the store to shop, which can make buying a gift for that person difficult.

, You’ll have plenty of work planning and hosting your party to take your mind off of how slow Christmas is coming. You're going to have to cook food for the party and decorate. You may even want to send out cute little invitations for your guests to RSVP whether they will or will not be coming.


At your party, you might have a White Elephant gift exchange, where each person brings a silly gift wrapped up to exchange with others.

, Hunting for a Christmas tree is a great way of getting out of the house, breathing some fresh air, and enjoying some nature.

Then you can take it home, hang your tree with lights and ornaments, or if you’re feeling especially ambitious, you can make your own decorations.

Let everyone make their own.,

Make your snow fizz.",How to Make Baking Soda Snow2," Half the fun of baking soda snow is getting your hands “dirty.” If this is a group activity for kids, let each make their own batch. Give the kids the thrill of making a mess with ingredients that are actually cleaners.At the same time, keep a close eye on young children who have a habit of putting things in their mouths. Instruct all young children not to consume it.

, With each jar, rub a glue stick (or regular old glue from a bottle) over the inside of the jar’s lid. Press the bottom of whatever elements you’re adding (like a Santa, sleigh, or evergreen figurine) into the glue until it’s firmly in place. Then dust the rest of the lid with your fake snow and screw the jar on upside-down., Be sure to add enough liquid ingredient to your batch so that your snow is easily molded without crumbling. Then simply ball some up to form a snowman as you would with real snow. Or, break out the sand toys from your last beach trip to make snow castles instead of sand castles., Make enough snow to cover a wide area like a tabletop. Then invite the kids to break out their favorite action figures and dolls for a wintry blast. Let the Barbies go skiing, reenact the Battle of Hoth with Star Wars figures, or do whatever else their imagination comes up with., Adding vinegar to baking soda causes a perfectly safe chemical reaction that makes the baking soda erupt into fizz, much like the Mentos-and-soda trick. Amuse the kids by giving them a bowl of vinegar to drop their snowballs into. For some twisted Bond-villain fun, make snowmen, inject them with a dropper filled with vinegar, and cackle evilly as they melt from the inside out."

Supervise the kids.,
Lay a protective surface out for easy clean-up.,
Take it outdoors.",How to Make Baking Soda Snow3," The older they are, the less of a concern this is. However, with young kids, stick around and oversee their science project and playtime in case they’re tempted to make snowballs. This might seem to them like an obvious way to have fun with fake snow, but keep in mind that baking soda is pretty abrasive in large amounts and not something you want to get in your eye. It’s not the end of the world if it does, but stinging eyes might be the end of fun time.Baking soda snow isn’t advisable for very young kids who still have a habit of putting things in their mouths, especially if you’re using shaving cream or hair conditioner as a wet ingredient.

, Cover the table, floor, or wherever you’re making fake snow with a bedsheet, towel, or similar material. Once playtime is over, simply bundle it up by its corners, shake it over the bathtub, and rinse the fake snow down the drain. Then vacuum the floor where any of it may have spilled off the sheet.With the exception of shaving foam, all of them are commonly used as cleaners, so there’s really no stress if a big mess was made.

, To make clean-up even less of a concern, take your project outside as long as the weather is clear. Avoid doing so on wet or windy days, since moisture and strong winds will dissolve and scatter your snow. Otherwise, do the same activities as you would inside, or even decorate bushes, patio furniture, or other outside fixtures with freshly fallen snow.

, Think about what you will do over Christmas Break. Will you go play in the snow with your friends? Will you also play video games? And many more.

, Many youth groups or churches hold a Christmas Party, if you don't go to church than bring your friends or make friends when you arrive. You can also see a concert, go to a sleepover.

, Everyone knows life is more enjoyable when we have money, but as a kid, you probably don't have a job, so do anything from begging your parents to snow shoveling people's drive ways for $5 bucks.

, For Pete's sake, how obvious is this one. Go to the movies, cause some trouble (I mean like ding dong ditching not beating up people trouble). You're a boy, go play video games with them, host or attend a perfect sleepover, and most of all, go play in the snow. If you don't have any friends try to make some with people you are comfortable around, of course this step is optional if you are too shy to make friends.

, Go make an igloo, or even an old-fashioned Snow Man. Get help from a friend if you wish, or do it alone. If your snow is deep enough, make tunnels. If you unfortunately don't have snow, have a pine-cone fight, they are quite fun. Last but not least, go sledding/skiing/snowboarding down some hills.

, They love you, and they want a great Christmas as much as you do, so remember to obey them.

, These steps are only a little bit of all you can get out of Christmas Break, there is millions more possibilities, so brainstorm and write down any other great ideas you have for Christmas Break.

,, Jesus was born 2000 years ago, and he is the reason of this joy, and this is proof that the Lord is joy. Doing something as simple as making a fine prayer thanking God for being born, or whatever will surely put a smile on God's face. Listen to Flyleaf's Christmas Song, it will remind you what Christmas is all about.

, If your parent's won't allow you to, than simply sneak staying up. But the point is to stay up on Christmas Eve.

Enjoy your gifts and the family togetherness.",How to Have a Great Christmas As a Child," In order to have a great Christmas you need to start as early as possible. Right after American Thanksgiving or the beginning of December are both good times. You should begin by doing things like making Christmas cards, buying an advent calender and starting your wish list. If you do everything at the beginning you'll be sick of Christmas before the day even comes!;
, You should have a few basic guidelines for the season. For instance, you should do things like go enjoy the snow as much as possible (if possible)., Honestly, it will put you in a much more festive mood if you're baking cookies with your family while watching Rudolph instead of playing video games alone.

, They give off a Christmas vibe that helps people be merry. If they're not up quite yet try to encourage the decorating.

, If you don't want to participate in commercialism than try singing your own songs while gathering around the fireplace.

, Christmas is about being together, not watching separate shows in separate rooms.

, Wake up as early as you can on the 24th. This will cause you to be very sleepy, allowing you to get to bed on Christmas Eve.

, Some suggested activities are watching a Christmas movie, tracking Santa on NORAD or going for a winter walk. Nothings worse than waiting for the day of excitement and ending it by wishing it was over.

, You should also limit the sweets after about 3 or 4pm, we don't want a hyperactive child going to bed do we?

, Many articles have lists of activities you can do to unwind and get your mind of The Big Day, but honestly what's the point of occupying yourself with small chores when you should be dreaming of sugarplums?, The only reason you should be out is if you really have to use the washroom, and if you do, resist the urge to peek at the presents. This will only increase your excitement about the morning.

, Instead of trying not to think about Christmas (which will only make the thought become front and center in your mind) just remind yourself that the sooner you fall asleep the sooner morning will come, the sooner you get to open presents and the sooner you get to see what St.Nick left you.

, Once morning arrives you are free to enjoy your gifts! Spend the day admiring that new toy you got, or sitting with your family playing that new board game Santa delivered. After all this is what you have been waiting for, so enjoy it!

, Before Santa Claus (aka Father Christmas) arrives, make sure you hang up your Christmas stockings over the fireplace or at the end of your bed, ready to be filled with fun sized gifts.

, Sliding down millions of chimneys and delivering presents all over the world in one night can be very tiring. Santa Claus needs to keep his sugar levels up. Leave out a few cookies by the Christmas tree to give him that extra burst of energy he needs to make it round the rest of those homes on Christmas night.

, It can be thirsty work too, so ask an adult to pour Santa a glass of milk and have it waiting for him. He'll be very grateful for this drink on a cold winter's night.

, Of course, it's not just Santa who has work to do on Christmas Eve. In fact, the hardest part of the job is done for him by his magical reindeer. Leave them a few carrots to munch on. They'll provide Rudolph and the rest with some much needed energy as they fly around the globe, making sure the big man gets where he needs to be, when he needs to be there.

, Whatever you do, you must make sure that you are tucked up in bed before Santa arrives. He will only visit your house once you are asleep. And don't think you can outsmart him by pretending. He can always spot a faker. The sooner you go to bed, the sooner it'll be Christmas.

, If you've been good all year, on Christmas morning, you could wake up to find a mountain of presents under the Christmas tree. The cookies and the milk will be gone and so will the carrots.

Don’t talk down to them.,
Treat them like they’re on your level.,
Be age appropriate.",How to Be a Cool Aunt or Uncle Without Alienating Your Niece or Nephew's Parents2," Whether your nieces or nephews are children or teenagers, young people are far more perceptive than we give them credit for. Try picking adult topics for conversation - obviously avoiding drinking stories but don't assume their minds are controlled by social media and video games.


For example, let them interject if they have an opinion on a political candidate.
If they ask questions that seem too deep for their age, still try and find a way to explain them. A child may ask, ""why do leaves fall to the ground?"" You could respond, ""heavy stuff pulls other stuff towards it. The Earth is really heavy, so its weight pulls stuff to the ground.""

, When you're discussing something, take their opinions seriously and listen to them like you would an adult. If other adults start talking over them, make sure to give your niece or nephew the space to voice their opinion, ultimately proving you value them as equals.

, Find a balance between speaking about adult topics and recognizing their parent's boundaries. If they're particularly young avoid controversial topics such as a religion, politics, and violent news events. Remember, even if you're talking about their favorite television show you can still have a mature conversation. "

Taking them hiking, embarking on a cross-country road trip, or even going for a picnic creates a memory that's sure to make a more meaningful impression than a disposable present.

, Youth is full of a myriad of events such as softball games, middle school concerts, and dance recitals that may seem mundane but represent a huge milestone in your niece or nephew's life. Being there for the little stuff makes them and their parents know that you want to be an active part of their lives instead of a passing figure at holidays. "

Don't be afraid to buy something ridiculous.,
Think of their interests.,
Keep it wholesome.",How to Be a Cool Aunt or Uncle Without Alienating Your Niece or Nephew's Parents4," While goofy gifts aren't the cornerstone of being the cool aunt or uncle, they certainly help. Buying your niece or nephew oddball presents help to give you personality and show you have a relatable sense of humor. , Even when buying something offbeat, try to make sure it ties back to their interests in some fashion. For example, if they're into fishing a talking wall-mounted bass could be a good fit, or if they're into comedy shows try getting them a collection of an old sketch show you enjoyed when you were younger. , Always keep your gifts, no matter how ridiculous, within the confines of their parent's values. Getting a gift that's too obscene or vulgar could easily confuse your niece and nephew while causing their parents to question your judgement - possibly restricting future opportunities to hang out with them.


Know their parent's morals so you can know which gifts are appropriate. Are their parents strict on movie and television ratings or subversive material? Then maybe you should avoid getting the Ren and Stimpy box set and go for some classic Mickey Mouse cartoons.
Try getting gifts that inspire hobbies, like a book of magic tricks, a crystal growing kit, or a do-it-yourself volcano.
Even better, make gifts with your niece or nephew. You can easily create interesting shapes out of clay, or make homemade slime, or craft a collage art project they can hang on their wall as a constant reminder of the fun they had with their aunt or uncle. "

Do a turnabout and donate decorations you've over-indulged in from previous years rather than upgrading to new ones. Give them to a charity store or a charity organization. Simplifying is about having less but getting more enjoyment from what you do have.;
, Decide how much you can afford to spend on gifts and food for Christmas and don't go beyond it. Use the budget to be more aware of the need to reuse, recycle and make do with the things you do have.


Stick to your budget. Many people make a budget and then use it as a guideline. Instead, use it as a mandate, a necessity, a stricture. Stick to what you say you're going to spend. It feels good to be virtuous.
Choose to stay away from the stores when they're crowded. The pressure created by last-minute shopping in crowds can be intense and cause you to buy things that are more expensive than you intended just to escape the place faster.

, Agree in advance with family and friends that you won't give each other lots or expensive gifts this year. In fact, set a limit of one gift each and perhaps even set a spending limit on each gift too. Emphasize that Christmas is about getting together, not about outdoing one another in the gift zone.

, Whatever your skill, there are lots of possibilities for making items, including knitted and crocheted items, paper craft, woodwork, writing of a poem or short story, programming a special program just for them, creating them a website, etc. Use the skills you have!


Here are some suggestions for crafts that you can experiment with if the urge hits you:

A wine-cork trivet using the leftovers from wine bottles and a little glue.
A pet collar using a little bit of extra fabric.
A bracelet with hearts or a necklace with beads.
A scrapbook or a sketchbook using an old game board.
Some bath sachets and bouquets made of fragrant flowers and herbs.
Some great homemade ornaments.



, Use organizations that support fair trade, training programs and self-sufficient savings. That way, you're supporting artisans and their craft and ensuring that they can survive and make a living. Many of these handcrafted items are very unique, making them an ideal gift and most don't cost a lot.


Buy a donation gift. This consists of a gift that keeps on giving through a reputable charity that promises to deliver the item you buy to those in need. Buy an animal, seeds or other item for a family in need in a developing country through a charity. Donate this gift on behalf of a family member or friend and give them the details of how their gift is helping others to lead a better life.

, Ask everyone who is coming along to bring their favorite dish rather than expecting one person or family/household to do all the work and carry the costs. This way you get a lot of variety in food and you all get to share the workload.


It's a good idea to ask for mains, desserts, and other courses to ensure a good balance. Don't specify the recipe, just the course.
Don't forget the vegetarians, gluten intolerant and any other special dietary needs.
Have children set the table and clear away as part of their contribution to the Christmas helping spirit.
Give serious consideration to a restaurant meal. After buying all the different types of food and spending hours in the kitchen, a restaurant meal may prove cheaper and kinder on everyone who is usually responsible for preparing everything.

, Consider volunteering or asking people who seem to be left out of Christmas because of their family situation or being foreigners, etc. This is something that doesn't cost you anything more than time and possibly a few donations but the value far exceeds what you put into it. And for yourself and your family, it's a lesson in giving of oneself, of one's skills and time, and in creating community spirit, all something that can only be passed on to future generations in the doing instead of the purchasing.

, Attend your place of worship more often. Find out what free events are being held through your place of worship and take the family along to all of them. You can easily keep so busy during the season that you won't notice any lack of spending!


If you're not religiously inclined or church-going, or you're not a believer in Christianity but follow secular Christmas traditions, this is still a good time to think about your spiritual, community and humanist values. Think about how to make Christmas time a meaningful and connecting event.

Store your Christmas decorations well after use.,
Buy an artificial Christmas tree (preferably in the sales) and look after it.",How to Celebrate Christmas on a Budget," Before the frenzy of Christmas time descends, work out how much you're able and prepared to spend on Christmas festivities, gifts, and catering. The amount will depend on how much you've already saved, how much you can set aside from current funds, and how much you can spare in the weeks leading up to Christmas. If you start early enough, you'll have more leeway to save a bit more.


Work out how much you want to spend on people for presents and include decorations, food, and whatever else you think you will need.
Stick to your budget – it's the indicator of what you can and cannot afford.
Consider starting a budget straight after Christmas for future years. Start saving early, put money into a savings account each month or week and stick to it. Doing this will give you a lump sum to spend in December rather than scraping together money. Budget well – this should include food, decorations, presents and anything else you may buy at Christmas.;
, Sit down and make decisions about limits on gifts. This is especially important in large families where the costs of buying a gift for every member of the family can soon add up. Seek agreement that you'll only spend so much per person.


If you're really strapped, a decision to only give gifts to the children can sometimes ease budget constraints.
One way to spend less on presents is to have each family member bring one present and then to Play the ""Goofy Gift Exchange"" Christmas Game or Play Santa's Present.
Remind everyone that thoughtfully chosen gifts are more important than expensive ones.

, If your family overdid the spending last Christmas and your budget is still really stretched, consider not spending for one Christmas. One non-spending Christmas will ensure that your budget catches up. There are still a lot of things you can do to celebrate Christmas without spending money:


Make a nice meal, not an expensive one. Look at old cookbook recipes for thrifty Christmas cooking.
Make homemade gifts from recycled and inexpensive items.
Don't buy any new decorations and either use a live tree in a planter from your garden, or an artificial tree kept in your storage.

, Sales closer to Christmas can be worth marking on your calendar, such as end-of-summer sales, sales after Thanksgiving, etc.


Take advantage of the post-Christmas sales to start buying gifts, cards, wrapping paper, decorations, tableware, etc., for next Christmas. Be sure to put these somewhere that they're easier to find and use when Christmas comes around.
Keep a list of whose gifts you've already purchased, so that you don't double up on gifts.
Make your own labels. Printable gift labels on the internet or making you own and printing them off can save pounds or dollars on gift tags.

, Use the skills you're best at, such as knitting, crocheting, woodwork, sewing, decoupage, putting together a basket, cooking, etc. A small selection of ideas:


Make a ""recipe in a jar"" gift
Make spice hot mats
Make a gift voucher for your parents for Christmas
For more ideas, see the very detailed article How to make your own Christmas gifts and wikiHow's various articles on making Christmas gifts. And don't forget the magic of baking homemade goodies for Christmas!

, There are many nifty Christmas decorations that can be made from items already in the home. Here are a few suggestions to get you started:



Make Christmas ornaments from dough; or

Make a small Christmas penguin ornament.

, There are a lot of items that aren't needed and are unnecessary waste at Christmas time. Save your money and finite resources by not including them in your Christmas celebrations. Examples include:


Ribbons, bows, fancy tape, stickers, etc., are usually tossed away.
Plastic tablecloths with Christmas designs. Either use plain colored tablecloths from your linen cupboard, or go without.
Don't spend massive amounts of money on outside lights, keep it to a minimum and inside lights should be left off at all times when no-one is in the room, this saves on energy bills.

, If there are people coming to your house for Christmas dinner, assign them tasks to help out. At the very least, ask them if they want to bring anything; this takes pressure off you and generally people do want to bring something and contribute in meaningful ways.

, This will mean that there is no need to replace them year after year. If you look after your decorations, they will look after you!


Keep fragile decorations wrapped and boxed. Place all decorations in a storage place that won't be disturbed.
Read How to create an inventory of Christmas decorations for more ideas.

, A real tree costs money every year, both in terms of purchasing it and fuel needed to collect it. An artificial tree is a one-off cost. An artificial pre-lit tree can also save money in lights and if one bulb goes, the others will carry on working, obviously depending on which tree.

Think energy efficiency when using items that draw on power.,
Decorate with earth-friendly items.,
Wrap green.,
Get friends and family members involved.,
Ask everyone to give at least one green gift.,
Serve local and, if possible, organic food at holiday gatherings.,
Save all gift wrapping paper, packaging materials and decorations you don't intend to keep or reuse.",How to Be Earth Friendly During the Holidays," You'll save money and energy at the same time:


Replace old light-up decorations with energy-efficient LED versions––you'll save up to 90 percent on energy costs with LED lights compared with conventional lights.
Use automatic timers or sensor lights for lights in rooms and areas that will have frequent visitors but not long-staying visits. Examples include the bathroom, hallway, driveway or path to your porch.
Switch off your computers when not in use. Do you really need to sit at it all through the holidays? Give yourself a few decent breaks from the online world and immerse yourself in the holiday festivities instead.
Think ahead and make less trips to the stores. When purchasing gifts, picking up poultry and shopping for food, try to do as much as possible in a single trip, reducing the amount of multiple trips just for one or two items. Check tire pressure and tread to increase the energy efficiency of your vehicle too; both cold and heat extremes (depending on where you live) during the holiday season can affect the tires detrimentally. And where you can, walk or carpool to the stores.
Lower the heating thermostat (or for those in hot climates, increase the point at which the air conditioning kicks in). If you're burning a fire, lower the thermostat even more.;
, There are endless ways to decorate through reusing, recycling. Just a few ways to get started include:


Purchase fresh, local, pesticide-free wreaths and trees whenever possible. For wreaths, you might even consider making one from scrap fabric, recycled paper or pine cones from the local park.
Save your decorations from last year and re-use them. When you do buy new decorations, opt for recycled holiday decorations or at least recyclable versions whenever possible. Aim to keep decorations for as many years as possible, so that they take on the aura of ""heirlooms"". You might even use ones you've inherited from other family members.
Make your own decorations from scrap materials and from repurposing things around the house. There are many books and online articles which will explain how to do this if your imagination is stuck!

Think nature when decorating––pine cones, acorns, shells, leaves, branches and more are all suitable for decorating your home with.
Decorate the tree with cranberry and popcorn strands. You can feed these to the birds when the holiday season ends.

, Don't be afraid to use unusual sources of paper, from newspaper to magazine catalogs and comic strips. Dress the gifts up with scrap ribbon, string and other bits and pieces from around the home. Provided you do this stylishly, they'll look fantastic––and unique.


Wrap gifts in cloth, scarves or a t-shirt instead of disposable wrapping paper (furoshiki). This continues the idea of giving something useful that can be re-used instead of thrown away, or to re-use something that would otherwise have gone into the trash.

If you need to use protective packaging, look for biodegradable peanuts and environmentally friendly soft foam.

, The holidays are usually a time for visiting, and if the entire group is looking for earth-friendly ways to celebrate, you'll all benefit from the positive peer pressure.


Travel wisely to holiday gatherings. Carpool or take mass transit when possible. Some plane travel may be unavoidable for far-flung families, but according to Discovery's Planet Green, flying and driving alone are the two most emission-intensive ways to travel. Short flights emit more carbon dioxide than long flights. Even if you can't avoid flying in some family members, you can still cut down on energy expenditure and greenhouse emissions by sticking to mass transit or people-powered transportation as much as possible once you're together.
Encourage visiting family members to follow earth-friendly practices. These include taking short showers, turning lights and electronics off when not in use. Unplugging electronics when not in use, or switching off the power strip, also saves electricity.

, This could be a donation to charity, a valuable service, or a crafted or recycled item that used little or no energy to create or ship. Once the idea catches on, you may be able to encourage completely green gifting.


Green gifts that ""keep on giving"" include donations to a nature conservancy, programs that help people in developing world communities maintain a livelihood and adopt-a-tree style programs.
Invite re-gifting. This reduces the costs and energy use associated with creating and shipping new items. It also opens the door to something that's probably already going on, anyway.
Books on conservation and environmental issues make great gifts when you'd like others to learn more.

, Purchase your holiday meats or poultry from local farmers––you may need to reserve in advance. Even in areas where you can't get fresh greens during the winter holidays, you can probably still get local root and storage crops for use with your holiday dinners. Eating organic isn't just easier on your body, it's also easier on the environment since no pesticides or chemical fertilizers are used. Eating local saves on the energy use and greenhouse emissions associated with transporting food over long distances.


Turn this into a fun challenge––how many local ingredients can you buy for the holiday dinner? This can make a great talking point during the meal.
Avoid using disposable plates, cutlery or other items. Use dishes and cutlery that can be washed and reused (and ask that everyone pitch in to ensure a fast clean up). Alternatively, look for recycled disposable paper goods that can be recycled again. Avoid Styrofoam products––these are the hardest to recycle.

, Make it a point to sort these materials into the appropriate recycling categories––paper, types of plastic, glass––and take them to the recycling center or put them out for recycling pickup right after the holiday celebration is over. You can even recycle your Christmas tree.

Prevent Christmas tree fires.,
Take care with holiday lights.,
Be alert to the hazards holiday decorations can cause.,
Be candle wise.",How to Decorate Safely for the Holiday Season," Special fire safety precautions need to be taken when keeping a live tree in the house; a burning tree can rapidly fill a room with fire and deadly gases.



Select a tree for the holiday. Needles on fresh trees should be green and hard to pull back from the branches, and the needle should not break if the tree has been freshly cut. The trunk should be sticky to the touch. Old trees can be identified by bouncing the tree trunk on the ground. If many needles fall off, the tree has been cut too long, has probably dried out, and is a fire hazard.
Ask the tree seller to cut off 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5cm) off the end; this will improve the tree's ability to take up water, keeping it greener for longer.

Caring for Your Tree. Do not place your tree close to a heat source, including a fireplace or heat vent; it should be at least 3 feet (approximately 1 meter) from any heat source. The heat will dry out the tree, causing it to be more easily ignited by heat, flame or sparks. Be careful not to drop or flick cigarette ashes near a tree.
Do not put your live tree up too early or leave it up for longer than two weeks.
Keep the tree stand filled with water at all times.

Disposing of your tree. Never put tree branches or needles in a fireplace or wood burning stove. When the tree becomes dry, discard it promptly. The best way to dispose of your tree is by taking it to a recycling center or having it hauled away by a community pick-up service.
If you're using a metallic or artificial tree, make sure it is flame retardant.;
, All electrical lights should be treated with care to avoid the potential for fire or electric shocks. If you can, upgrade to LED (light-emitting diode) lights; these are safer because they don't generate heat.


Maintain your holiday lights. Inspect holiday lights each year for frayed wires, bare spots, gaps in the insulation, broken or cracked sockets, and excessive kinking or wear before putting them up. Use only lighting listed by an approved testing laboratory.
Don't run cords under rugs; this is a fire hazard.
Do not overload electrical outlets. Do not link more than three light strands per outlet, unless the directions indicate it is safe to do so. Connect strings of lights to an extension cord before plugging the cord into the outlet. Make sure to periodically check the wires - they should not be warm to the touch.
Use heavy gauge extension cords; they are much harder to fray and they remain cool.
Tape down cords that are in traffic areas and could easily be tripped over. Blue masking tape will keep the cords firmly in place against the floor and prevent tripping, without damaging paint.

, Holiday decorations can become fire hazards or choking hazards if not placed thoughtfully. Here are some things to be aware of:


Use only non-flammable decorations - all decorations should be nonflammable or flame-retardant. Place decorations away from heat vents.
Never put wrapping paper in a fireplace. It can result in a very large fire, throwing off dangerous sparks and embers and may result in a chimney fire.
Keep small and breakable decorations out of the reach of babies, toddlers, cats, dogs, and any other pets. Ornaments can easily be swallowed and turn into choking hazards when curious hands and paws get hold of them. In addition, take care when hanging tinsel, stringed decorations, etc., to avoid tripping or strangulation hazards.
Do not put ornaments that have small parts or metal hooks, or look like food or candy, on the lower branches where small children can reach them.

, While candles are a long-loved tradition for some families at Christmas, they can also be a major fire hazard if left unattended or near flammable items.


Avoid using lit candles if possible. If you do use them, make sure they are in stable holders and place them where they cannot be easily knocked down. Never leave the house with candles burning; if you think you're going to be distracted, consider putting them out when you leave the room, or not using them at all.
Never put lit candles on a tree. Do not go near a Christmas tree with an open flame - candles, lighters or matches.
Do not put candles out by blowing - blowing on them can send sparks and hot wax flying, which can easily cause a fire. It is safer to extinguish them with a snuffer or a spoon.

, You want the tree to have a theme dealing with Disney movies? Theme parks? Or even something else Disney-inspired? Fine! As long as people can't get hurt, everything on a Disney-inspired Christmas tree is free game!


If you have a World of Disney store in your area, get ideas there, if you need any. Plus, if you see something that can complement your existing style that you don't already have, these can complement the tree.
Have you decided to go with the theme of the Disney theme parks and are at-home now? Did you purchase MagicBands for your trip? Have another use for them as they can be hung on the tree much like hanging ornaments. (If you own a Condo at Disney World, you'll have to give up with using this idea as an ornament and use the band as it would normally be used).

Have unused FastPasses from a trip to the park earlier in the year (if you visit the Disneyland California park)? String a string into the pass and hang those on the tree.



, Look around the stores for them, or make some classic three-balled Mickey ornaments from three white circular balls with toothpicks to attach them together.

LED lights are best for live trees as they do not heat up too quickly.The Around-and-Around Wrap: Wrap strands of lights around the top of the tree and work your way down to the base of the tree. For a 6-foot tall tree, you will need about 6 strands of lights with 100 bulbs each.Put your first light at the very top of the tree to begin. This light will shine on the star, angel, or snowflake that you will add later.
Secure your light strands by weaving them in an out of the tree’s branches.
The Vertical Wrap: Divide your tree into 3 sections. Each section will have its own lights.
Begin at the base of the tree and weave the lights up through the branches to the top of the tree and back down to the base. Repeat.

,, The plastic will collect any needles that fall off your tree. Cover the plastic with a festive Christmas tree skirt.


These skirts add to the beauty of your tree and also keep the tree’s needles from collecting on your floor.

, Look for branches that are wider apart so that your ornaments won’t rest on lower branches.

, The tree is strongest near the trunk and can bear more weight.

, This works particularly well with shiny bulb, glass, or metal ornaments as these types are the most reflective.

, Make sure not to hang too many ornaments on each branch.


If a branch starts to get too weighed down, ornaments could fall off or the branch could break.

, These extras can include bows, strands of popcorn and cranberries, and candy canes.

, Tinsel makes your tree glitter. Hang tinsel near lights for the shiniest look possible.


Be mindful with the amount of tinsel you place on your tree. Too much tinsel could take away from the beauty of your ornaments.
For a more modern look, buy colored tinsel rather than the traditional gold and silver.

, Make sure that it is secure and not crooked.

, Admire the festive tree you have created and be jolly.

, The orbs can be glass or plastic.Add fake winterberries and silver bells to complete a traditional tree.

, Hang white lights instead of colored lights to accent the flowers.Silk roses, magnolias, and hydrangeas are good options for a wintery feel.
Add richly colored ribbons and little silver orbs or glittering glass ornaments for a twinkling, flowery look.

, Place pine cones throughout the tree.Mix bird ornaments in with fake leaves.
White lights are best for this natural look.

, Mix glass and plastic ornaments alongside white lights for a tree that could rival the White House's own.To get even more patriotic, hang red, white, and blue lights on your tree.

, Mod colors include lime greens, purples, bright blues, and hot pink.Light strands with large light bulbs mixed with bright small and large ornaments will give your tree a contemporary, edgy feel.

Each species has its own characteristic that plays a role in how you decorate it, how long it lasts in your home and also rather or not it has a strong Christmas tree fragrance. There are three main families offered in the fresh cut Christmas tree trade. Each region or state of the United States has its own local favorites. Firs, spruces and pines are the three families or categories most often sold.


Take a look at the inexpensive pine tree. All pine species have the longer needles than other Christmas trees, which some species like the Scotch Pine are sharp and require gloves. Others like the White Pine are soft but the branches are weak and can't hold many heavy ornaments.
Consider the popular and expensive fir family. This Rose Royce or Cadillac tree family gets it's name for it's soft non-prickly needles. These species also have a very rich fragrance unlike the similar spruces. Also fir needles grow upward along the top of branch like a hairbrush rather than in spirals. Balsams Douglas and Fraser firs are the most readily sold ones in the fresh cut tree trade but others Noble and Grand firs are harder to find.
If someone has Christmas tree allergies consider the spruce family. These species have a faint fragrance that doesn't bother most people. This family is recognized by the needles being arranged in a spiral along the branch the Blue Spruce is the one most often seen in stores
Watch for more unique varieties not listed in this article. Depending on your region there are other species of evergreens you might encounter offered for Christmas trees. Ask the dealer or go to a fresh cut Christmas tree website to learn about additional selections.;
, Your tree is your canvas, so it's important to select a good one — gorgeous ornaments can do only so much for a scraggly tree. Some people prefer the look and smell of a real pine or fir tree, while others like the reliability of a fake one. Your housing rules (in condos, etc.) may also dictate your choice due to fire safety regulations. Whatever you choose, here are some points to think about:


Get a well-shaped tree. If you're getting a real tree, make sure you see it out of its netting. Look for full, evenly-spaced branches and a symmetric shape that tapers toward the top. The more branch tips the better. If you're setting up a fake tree and shaping the branches yourself, try to bend them so that you can't see the inches of space between each layer of branches.
Set up a tree stand and skirt. For real trees, you'll need a tree stand with a deep water reservoir, which you should fill only after the tree is in place. Set up a tree skirt around the floor to catch any falling needles and make clean-up easier later.
Consider a pre-lit tree. If you've already decided on an artificial tree, you might want to buy one that already has tiny Christmas lights on the branches. Putting up the lights is the worst part of the process for most people — if you can skip that step, you'll be able to spend more time and energy on other aspects of decorating your tree.

, Sticking to one color scheme will make your tree look cohesive and complete. Keep in mind that you might want to choose something that doesn't clash with the room the tree is in, and that you might have to concede some space for childhood or heirloom ornaments that clash with the rest of the tree. That said, here are some popular color schemes you could try:


Classic Christmas colors, red and green. Accent the green tree with red ornaments, garlands and ribbons. If you want to add some pizazz with one metallic color, try gold or silver. Red, green or clear lights would work best with this style.
Wintry colors, like blue, silver and purple. Use your tree to imitate the icy, glittering colors of a snowy Christmas. If you choose this scheme, try to avoid mixing in anything red, yellow, or golden. Pick clear or blue lights to go with it. For a truly minimalist winter look, use only white and silver decorations.
Metallic colors, such as gold, silver and bronze. The good news is that metallic colors are easy to mix, and you can play with one, two or three. They're best accented with clear lights.
Cool or warm colors. If you want a tree that's a little more diverse, try sticking to colors that are either cool (with blue undertones) or warm (with red undertones). For instance, a warm tree might feature red, orange and gold decorations; a cool one could have green, purple, blue and silver.

, Some people select a specific theme for their Christmas trees, such as angels, nutcrackers or snowflakes.You can also collect ornaments from a specific region, city or country as a theme. A theme can help your tree look cohesive, as well as making it stand out against other trees.


If you tend to collect ornaments that are centered around a particular theme anyway, this could be a fun way to decorate your tree and expand your collection.
If you're not much of a theme collector, don't worry about it too much — ""Christmas"" is enough theme for most trees!

, Maybe you've already collected ornaments for several years, and you're planning on using those. If not, though, now's the time to get a set that will make your tree look elegant and classic for years to come.

, Most stores sell ornaments in boxes of six to 12, at a fairly reasonable price. Though you can add a few more interesting and expensive ornaments to the mix, these multi pack bulbs make up the base of most people's Christmas tree ornaments. You can also create your own ""set"" by buying ornaments made of the same materials like you may like collecting crystal ornaments, wooden toy ornaments, crochet snowflakes or even an artist or brand set.


Matte or Shiny? It's really no rule to this but mixing can be a great way to add diversity and interest.
Christmas balls and other basic ornaments used in their place come in many designer packs with different colors, textures, designs on one set. Pick one main color or two for the basic finishes. Red and green can be in all shiny or matte, or one color can be matte and another one shiny. Silver and gold and other metallics are great neutrals. Don't be afraid of adding new colors and/or new ornaments with the two colors of your selection dominating it or in the same color scheme.
You can also have different colors in a specific scheme like all deep rich jewel tones, all earth tones, or all pastels. Don't be afraid to experiment with mixing colors, finishes, textures on one tree.
If your doing single-color (monochromatic) tree consider having variety in the selected color. Try different shades, values, tints, of the color. You can also have all shiny balls of the color and change up the display with with the ribbons having a totally different texture. Without variety monochromatic trees can get boring.

, The light selection has gotten really intensive over the years with many forms, shapes and colors. Before buying fancy bulb sets make sure you are ready for the hassle of finding their replacement bulbs. Small basic lights are often the best choice for many people but others may like the old fashioned look of big lights or figure lights. If using the larger lights place the individual bulbs like ornaments in the tree spacing evenly as you go. There are also more mini lights with different shapes that are not really intrusive and can be mixed with normal lights.


Take advantage of the kinds of wire patterns and construction of lights. Got icicle lights? You can wrap the main wire around the circumference of the tree and wrap the individual strands of lights around the nearest branch and you might want to leave some stands hanging. White wire lights on green tree can give the tree a lacy wedding day look, gingerbread icing look, or frosty look to a tree. Lights wired in like a garland or ribbon can just be laid on a tree like a ribbon pattern and tucked inside the tree.
Try to choose lights that don't play music or flash, and stick to a color that works with your chosen scheme. If you want to have chasing or functional lights get a lot of steady burners to keep the flashing patterns from getting too busy and hectic.Give your eyes a rest. Every bulb on the tree doesn't have to flash or blink. Also instead of music lights play your favorite Christmas songs via CD Cassette or MP3. Many stores now have many cool tech devices that let the user program the lights to music from a radio boombox or MP3 device which might be great for holiday parties.
If you want to make a fail-safe choice, pick white or off-white lights.
How many lights? This varies depending on personal taste, the tree itself, the size and brightness of the bulbs on the set rather than the number of lights. One basic rule is at least 25 to 50 bulbs per foot but this really depends on many individual factors. Use one's own judgement and be ready to adjust this to best suit ones needs.

, The lights go first so that you don't see wires all over the other decorations on the tree which is not a pretty sight. Putting up strands of lights can be the most labor-intensive part of decorating a tree. Do it right, though, and it'll make your tree look more magical than anything else you could do to it. Follow these tips for maximum light-stringing success:


String the lights from top to bottom, pushing them partway into the branches to hide the cord.
Space them evenly. If you're not sure how even the lights look, step 10 feet (3.0 m) away from the tree and squint your eyes. Take note of any particularly bright or dark spots.

, If you were to put the ornaments before the garlands and ribbons there's a chance that the garland can get caught in an ornament hook and make that ornament fall. Once your lights are up, you can wrap your tree with anything else that should go on beneath the ornaments. What you choose to use will depend on your personal taste, but consider these points:


Avoid fluffy tinsel. Fluffy strands of tinsel were a mainstay of mid-century Christmas trees, but they've fallen out of style lately. If you're a tinsel die-hard or you like the shimmery look, try smaller wire-based garlands that feature smaller pieces of foil, usually cut into shapes like trees or stars.
Plastic icicles are difficult to do right. Like tinsel, strands of plastic icicles with small lights inside them used to be more common. If you've used them successfully in the past, you probably know how to pull it off without making the plastic really noticeable; if not, though, choose something else. Icicles are now available in glass and tin and both add shine to your tree.
If you like popcorn garlands, keep them white. That means: no pre-buttered popcorn. For a look that's as elegant as possible, pop the corn yourself so that it'll be a nice wintry white, instead of yellow-tinged.
It's hard to go wrong with metallic or plastic beaded garlands. As long as you choose a color that fits your scheme and a size that's dainty, strings of metallic beads or stars will probably look great on your tree. Distribute them evenly along the outer branches of the tree, similar to the way you put up the lights.You can also use old bead necklaces, decorative cording, and fabric pompom garlands in appropriate colors
Use wired or mesh ribbon. If you want to put up a ribbon garland, make sure you choose a kind that will hold its shape instead of flopping over. Choose medium width, so that the ribbon is still wide enough to see from afar, but not so large that weaving it around the tree is difficult. Add small bows, evenly distributed along the length of ribbon, to make it look even better.

, Putting on the topper before the ornaments might seem crazy, but think of it this way: you don't want to be calling ""Timber!"" on a tree loaded with precious glass ornaments if something goes wrong. What kind of topper you choose depends on the theme and look of your tree, but here are some popular options:


A star
An artificial bird
An artificial flower (choose your favorite one)
An angel
A pretty bow

Imitation holly leaves and berries
A large snowflake
A Christian cross
A Crown or Tiara

, Keep definite ornament sets together in separate piles or in a box in the category it belongs. You can categorize by color, materials, all snow themes, all religious themes together in each pile.


If you have a ""complete decorator set"" like a 60 piece ""Winter Splendor"" set with all ornaments in glass,a good approach is to create ""mini categories"" that are very specific. All the balls with the exact same pattern or all figurative ornaments can go in their separate categories. Use this approach also when you have a lot of ornaments of the same thing like all snowflakes or the same gold ball with the same texture or finish with a different scene.
Place one ornament from the pile category on the tree on each ""side"" this can be 2, 3, 4 sides so that an ornament category can be seen throughout the tree. Simply when you place an ornament in your tree place one in the opposite side.
Work from top to bottom, and try to distribute them evenly. Remember to place some a few inches back into the tree, to give it a little depth. As you go with decorating the tree you can create patterns and effects. This gives your tree a cohesive look and gives the illusion of a professional.
If you're using a mix of bulb ornaments and specialty ornaments, add the bulbs first. Think of them as your base. Then you can choose where to distribute stand-out ornaments, so they'll both easily seen and integrated with the rest of the tree.
Consider the bottom of the tree. If you have pets or small children, you might want to avoid placing anything too precious where it can be easily pulled down. Instead, consider filling in the area with extra lights or garlands making sure that these are extra secure so they can't be yanked off the tree.
You can even use things that aren’t strictly for the tree. Candy and other treats are a traditional addition and popular with kids. Also try natural objects like pine cones and fake or non-edible fruit.

, Shiny and glittery stuff looks good reflecting lights from in the tree. Clear translucent or transparent ornaments can look really pretty in front of a bulb. You can place house ornaments over the bulbs to give the illusion of a lighted house. Hide your animals and birds deep within the tree to give guests a surprise or shock as they look in your tree! A blue ball can look nice next to a blue light.


Place larger ornaments deep inside the tree closer to the trunk to give dimension. Smaller ones can go on the outer parts of the branches. Placing large ornaments on the outside can be effective if done sparingly.Also place solid heavy solid looking ornaments near the bottom and deep inside a tree and your lacy and lighter ornaments further out the branches to give balance.
You can also create mini caches for special ornaments by surrounding that ornament with ornaments of a similar color theme or like a house ornament can be placed next to a snowman ornament, a bird can be placed next to a fruit to make it look like he's eating at the fruit. Place plain ornaments deep in the tree and your special ones further out. Also try to place ornaments on a mis-matched tree where they make sense like angels and stars near the top and houses and deer on the bottom.

Consider the origin of the tree.,
Check out the materials involved.,
Consider its end life.,
Go one better.",How to Choose Between a Real Tree and a Fake Tree for Christmas," Most real trees will be grown in your local area and won't have had to travel too far to reach your home. Most fake trees have been shipped all the way from China. That's a lot of extra energy miles.;
, Most artificial trees are made from metals and plastics. These leave a trail of toxins in the environment where they're produced. Your real tree is made of - tree. And if you look for organic growers, it won't have had pesticides sprayed on it either.

, Fake trees are not biodegradable although if well cared for, they can last a long time (but probably not longer than a living tree) - something you might want to balance in the equation. Your real tree can be chipped and used as mulch and is definitely biodegradable.

, Maybe you could prefer a tree that is living and one of your local biodiversity and plant it after it has been a Christmas helper. Buy a tree, in a pot, and plant it in your garden, or in a public area if you don’t have a back yard, after Christmas. Or, simply repot it and bring it in again next year.

Enjoy your tree!",How to Decorate a Christmas Tree with Food," Fake trees are more convenient to use from year to year, while many families greatly prefer live trees for their aroma, as well as seeming more lifelike. The choice is yours - feel free to experiment!;
, See ""ingredients"" for ideas!

, Candy canes are the most common food item put onto trees, and for a good reason, too! There are a million flavors and colors to choose from! The more types of candy canes you have, the more colorful the tree will be.

, Popcorn chains are yet another classic, and they're easy to make! Just pop some popcorn and thread a needle. Push the needle through the center of the popcorn kernel. Repeat until you are happy with the length of the chain.

, You can use any firm - but not too hard - food item, such as cranberries or raisins. Be careful the food doesn't spoil, though!

, Make a hole in the top and string ribbon through it.


Make sure the cookie you're using isn't crumbly!

, Apples and oranges are classic Christmas fruits, but don't be afraid to try others! If you have a fake tree with movable branches, make a little perch for the fruit. Otherwise, scour your tree for two branches that are close together and put the fruit onto them.


Be sure to check your fruit often. Replace any fruit that shows signs of spoilage.

, You can incorporate almost any non-perishable food into a Christmas tree- be creative in putting them on!

, String lights around, and place ornaments in the gaps.

, Sit back and admire (or eat!) your hard work!

Consider the type of tree you want to plant.,
Find a suitable plot of land.,
Conduct a soil analysis for nutrients and pH levels.,
Research environmental and planting restrictions in your town.,
Prepare the land for your tree forest.",How to Create a Christmas Tree Forest1," There are a wide variety of Christmas trees and include fir, pine, spruce, cypress, and cedar.These trees thrive in different climates and look different from one another. Think about where your tree forest will be located and choose a tree that can thrive in that climate.


Balsam firs are a popular Christmas tree species that grow in the northern United States and Canada, in Hardiness Zones 3–5 or states like Minnesota, North Dakota, and Montana.Virginia Pines are Christmas trees that grow in hotter climates such as states like Alabama and Georgia.The Eastern Red Cedar and Deodar Cedar are trees that are traditionally grown in warmer climates.;
, The best place to start a Christmas tree forest is on a flat plot of land. Find a piece of land that is large enough to accommodate the number of Christmas trees that you want to grow. The land's slope should not exceed 10% because it's not good for tree growth.


Trees should be spaced at least five feet apart.
With one acre of land, you'd be able to plant 1,500 trees., Soil quality is also a crucial factor in determining the quality of land that you choose. While different types of Christmas trees will require different nitrogen, phosphorus, and mineral levels, most Christmas trees thrive in well-drained mossy loam.The pH levels of the soil is also an important aspect in planting your Christmas tree forest. Conduct a soil analysis with a local university or cooperative or find soil surveys conducted by the Natural Resources and Conservation Services by visiting their website, nrcs.usda.gov.A pH of 6.0 is recommended for Christmas trees like the Norway spruce, Fraser fir, Canaan fir, Scotch pine, and white pine.
For Douglas fir, blue spruce, and concolor fir the ideal soil pH is 6.5.Conducting a soil test every three years is recommended.

, Farming and zoning restrictions exist in many counties, states, and cities. Before dedicating your free land to growing a tree forest, contact your local state's forest service or state department of agriculture and consult with them about what forms and licenses you'll need before you can start your Christmas tree farm.The primary issues with growing a tree farm include the handling of chemicals and disposal of waste., Remove excess weeds or debris from the plot of land that you plan on using for your tree. You can use an herbicide to eliminate existing weeds and prevent future weeds from growing. Use a mechanical or manual spade or till to remove the dead plants from your land. If your soil doesn't contain the right minerals, nutrients, or pH level, get soil amendments such as sphagnum or organic material to help promote tree growth in your soil.If your soil has a low pH, you can add lime or potassium carbonate to raise it.If your soil is lacking nitrogen, you can add fertilizer to the soil to increase nitrogen levels.Herbicides typically used for Christmas tree farms include photosynthesis inhibitors, root inhibitors, and cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors.Check the label to make sure that the herbicide that you use will not hurt the trees you are trying to grow.

Plant your trees in the spring.,
Measure tree sites that are 5–8 feet (1.5–2.4 m) apart from one another.,
Create a hole with a garden tool or electric drill.,
Plant the sapling into the hole.,
Water your seedlings.,
Regularly shear your trees.",How to Create a Christmas Tree Forest2," The spring is the best season to plant most saplings or seedlings. Extreme hot or cold weather leads to ""transplant shock"" which can cause seedlings to die prematurely.Planting your trees in the spring will also lead to greater root growth before top growth begins., Before you start planting your trees, you'll want to use a measuring tape to ensure a 5–8 foot (1.5–2.4 m) radius around each of your trees. Plant a flag in the spots where you'll eventually dig holes to plant your trees. This will also let you know how many saplings that you can grow on your plot.

, Go to the locations of your flags and dig a hole that's big enough to fit the sapling's roots. Usually, this means digging a hole at least a foot deep. An electric drill with an auger bit will allow you to do this quickly and easily. You can also use manual tools like a shovel to dig your hole., Place the saplings into the holes that you created. To encourage growth, pour an inch of topsoil into the hole before you plant your sapling. Pack soil around the hole once the tree is in it. Finish by tamping the soil with a garden tool, like a shovel.

, Use a garden hose or watering bucket to saturate the soil around the plant site for your trees. This will help initial root growth and will prevent your seedlings from dying because of a lack of water.For the first year, your trees will need weekly watering. After the first year, you won't have to water your tree forest unless there is a drought.Test the moistness of your soil by sticking a screwdriver eight inches (203.2 millimeters) into the soil. The screwdriver will easily pass through the soil it it's moist. If you can't push it down, it means that your soil needs more water., Shearing your trees will help shape the trees to grow the way that you want. Use tools like hand clippers, hedge clippers and shearing knives to maintain the shape of your tree. The time to shear your tree depends on the climate and type of tree that you are growing. Remove the double tops and cut the main shoot 12 to 14 inches (30.5 to 35.6 cm). You won't have to shear many of the side branches.Pines should be sheared during the growing season, near the time that terminal growth is almost complete.
Douglas firs should be sheared late July or early August.

"
"
Determine how you want to sell you trees.,
Build the proper infrastructure.,
Get the right marketing strategy.",How to Create a Christmas Tree Forest3," You can sell your Christmas trees wholesale or retail. Wholesale includes contacting established Christmas tree retailers or distributors in the area and selling off a significant portion of your lot for a discounted rate per tree. Selling retail, or directly to the consumer means that you'll have to open up a booth or storefront to cater to specific customer needs.


The upside to wholesale is that you can quickly offload all of your trees in one business transaction rather than invest time in selling it to individual buyers.
If you plan on selling wholesale, make sure that you contact local buyers before you plant your tree forest.
You will see a higher rate of return per tree if you sell retail, but you also run the chance of not being able to sell all of your trees before the holiday season is over.

, If you plan on selling retail, you'll need to build a business infrastructure around your tree sales that includes a stand or space for salespeople. If you are going to run a cut-your-own tree strategy, then you'll need the equipment in the form of a hacksaw or bone saw, as well as a mechanical baler to help transport the trees. For both retail and wholesale, you'll also need storage and loading areas to transport your trees.Infrastructure can also include the sales processes behind selling trees to the consumer.

, If you are selling trees directly the consumer you should invest into local and regional advertising in media avenues like newspapers, magazines, and online. When selling wholesale, make sure to establish industry connections before your harvest is fully grown. Lining up a list of buyers before your crop is finished growing will ensure that you can sell your trees if one buyer drops out.Offering perks like free tree delivery could create a competitive advantage for your tree farm.
Magazines that you can get advertisements in include, Christmas Trees Magazine, American Nurseryman, and Northwest Christmas Tree Association Buy-Sell Directory.

Attach the lights to the tree.,
Separate the wires at intervals.,
Drape the organza.,
Push white painted birch twigs in between the branches of the tree for a beautiful wintry effect.,
Hang icicles and snowflakes on a few of the branches, spreading them evenly around the entire tree.,
Drape beaded garlands onto the tree in between the other decorations, spacing them evenly.

,
Hang baubles.,
Stand back and check the proportions.",How to Decorate a Contemporary Christmas Tree," In particular, it is important to choose items that are elegant and reflect the beauty of Christmas in winter:


White organza
Painted birch twigs
Snowflakes
Icicles
Crystal beaded garlands
Assortment of baubles and ornaments
Assortment of larger baubles and ornaments;
, Unwind your string of lights. LED lights are a better option than regular fairy lights. If one LED bulb goes out, the rest will still work unlike fairy lights. Although they are more expensive, they are much more energy efficient and safer, as they stay cool to the touch. They will also last longer, so you won't have to buy a new set every year.

, Find the end of your string of lights and twist a piece of wire around the last bulb. Wind the wire around the top of the tree to secure the lights to the tree. You may need to stand on a stool or stepladder to reach the top of the tree.

, Push the branches of the tree between them to ensure that the lights stay in place.

, Take a roll of white organza.


Cut the fabric in half along the length of the material.
Gather the fabric all the way down the roll. Wind a piece of wire around the end of one strip and attach it to the top of the tree.
Drape the organza in a spiral around the tree all the way to the bottom, placing one strip after another. Lay it on roughly at first and then tidy it up once it is in place. Twist a piece of wire around the ends and secure it to the tree.

, You can buy these from any florist in a number of colours.

,


You can rest some snowflakes on top of the branches further in towards the tree trunk to add depth.

,, Thread some wire through the bauble and twist it onto a branch.


Use clear glass and silver baubles to carry on the wintry theme. Hang them anywhere you like, including on the birch twigs, to fill in any gaps on the tree.
Leave any special baubles you have until last and give them pride of place in a spot where they will stand out.

, Adjust where necessary. Admire your decorating efforts.

Go through your ornaments and separate them by shade and color.,
Plan out your design.,
Consider the lights.,
Put the lights on first.,
Wrap a garland or two around the tree.,
Hang your ornaments based on color, starting with the largest.,
Add some neutral fillers.,
Add a tree topper, if desired.,
Consider adding a tree skirt.",How to Decorate a Christmas Tree in Ombre1," Ombre is the transition of different colors or shades. If you want to give your tree an ombre look, you will need to hang your ornaments in rows, based on shade or color. For example, if you have dark blue, light blue, and silver ornaments, put them into three separate groups. Don't worry about the shape or material: focus on the color and shade alone.;
, If you are using different shades of the same color, plan on arranging the ornaments from darkest to lightest. If you are planning on using different colors, such as red, gold, and green, use the color with the most ornaments on the bottom of the tree, and the color with the fewest ornaments on the top.

, White Christmas lights are always a great start, regardless of the color scheme you are using. You can always take things a step further, however, by going with colored Christmas lights. Be sure to match the color of the cable to the color of your tree, however. For example, if you have a white tree, you should get Christmas lights with a white cable.If you are going with a standard ombre, consider getting lights that match the main color. For example, if you are doing dark-to-light pink ombre, get pink lights.
If you have a multicolor scheme going on, consider a strand of multi-colored lights. Take out the bulbs, then rearrange them on the string, grouping the like colors together.
If you bought a fake Christmas tree, it may already have lights attached. You can remove the clips/tags, pull the lights off, and replace them with your own.
Consider mixing and matching different colors. There is nothing wrong with having both white and colored lights., Start at the base of the tree and work your way up in a spiral. Wrap the cable around the main branches, from trunk to tip and back to trunk.Moving back-and-forth along the branches will help give your tree more depth.

, Leave about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) of space between each row/round.If you have multiple colors, you can hang the garlands in rows based on color. You can also choose one color of garland, and use it throughout your tree. This can help tie all of the different colors/shades together.


Consider having both simple and fancy garlands. This will add variety to your tree and keep it from looking too busy.Drape delicate, beaded garlands from branch to branch. Wrap fluffier, tinsel garlands loosely around the tree in a spiral., Hang all of the ornaments from your first color group on the bottommost branches. Hang the ornaments from the next color right above them. Work your way up in rows until you reach the top of the tree. Be sure to hang some ornaments close to the trunk. This will give your tree more depth.If you are doing a standard ombre, start with the darkest color and work your way up to the lightest.
If you are doing a multicolor ombre, use the color with the most ornaments on the bottom of the tree. Use the color with the fewest ornaments on the top of the tree.

, Clear ornaments make great fillers for any color scheme. Wooden ornaments are great if you have a lot of silver, gold, copper, or bronze in your tree. You can also use some neutral colors, such as white.Do not get too carried away, however! You want the main color for each section to shine through!


Other ideas for fillers include icicles, tinsel, snowflakes, and floral picks.

, You can use a tree topper that matches one of the colors on the lower part of your tree. You can also match the topper to the last color on the top of your tree. Alternatively, you can skip the tree topper altogether; ombre is a pretty fancy look for a tree to begin with.

, You can match the tree skirt to the first/bottom color on your tree. You can also choose a darker shade. Alternatively, you can go with white, which will look like snow and help the ombre really stand out. Avoid using am ombre tree skirt, or you will have too much ombre!

Buy acrylic paint based on your desired color scheme.,
Divide some clear ornaments into groups based on your color scheme.,
Mix a few drops of water into your color.,
Pour a little bit of paint into your first group of ornaments.,
Swirl the paint to coat the inside if the ornament.,
Turn the ornaments upside down so that the excess paint can drain.The easiest way to do this would be to slide some paper under a wire rack, and then setting the ornaments upside down onto the rack.,
Repeat the previous steps with the rest of your paint colors and ornaments.,
Let the ornaments dry completely before putting the caps back in.,
Arrange the ornaments on your tree, starting with your darkest and finishing with the lightest.",How to Decorate a Christmas Tree in Ombre2," You will need one bottle of paint for each color. Plan on having 3 to 4 different shades of the same color, going from dark to light.


You can use regular paint, glittery paint, or metallic paint.
It does not matter if the paint is matte or glossy.
The bigger your tree is, the more colors/shades you can have.

, Buy some clear, plastic or glass ornaments. Divide your ornaments into groups based on how many colors you will be using for the ombre. The ornaments don't have to be the same shape and size.


Plan ahead. You will need more ""dark"" ornaments for the bottom of your tree, and fewer ""light"" ornaments for the top.
For a fancier look, consider iridescent ornaments, or ornaments with glittery designs on them. They must still be clear, however.

, Pour some of your darkest paint color into a cup. Add a few drops of water, and stir to combine. You want the paint to be runny, sort of like cream. Don't let it get so thin that it becomes transparent, however., Pull the metal caps off of each ornament first, then pour some paint inside the ornament. If you need to, stick a funnel into the neck of the ornament first, then pour the paint in.Keep the caps in a safe place so that you don't lose them.
You don't need a lot of paint; a little bit goes a long way.

, Plug the opening of the ornament with your thumb. Rotate your wrist to swirl the paint around the ornament. Keep doing this until the ornament is evenly coated. Do this for all of the ornaments you poured the paint into.If the paint doesn't swirl easily, it may be too thick. Add more water.

, The excess paint will drip out of the ornaments and onto the paper.


Alternatively, you can set the ornaments upside down into an egg carton.

, Work one color group at a time. If you are using a funnel, be sure to clean it out first so that you don't mix paint colors.

, Pinch the wire prongs on each cap, then slide them down the neck of each ornament. Be careful not to scratch the paint.


Some acrylic paint requires curing time in addition to drying time. Read the label carefully.
The paint may pool in parts of the ornament. If this happens, swirl the paint around to redistribute it., Hang all of the darkest ornaments along the bottom of the tree. Move on to the next shade, and hang them on the next level. Go through your shades until you reach the top of the tree. Hang the lightest ornaments there.

Buy a white Christmas tree.,
Choose and plan a color scheme.,
Buy some spray paint according to your color scheme.,
Take apart your tree, if possible.,
Prep the branches for painting.,
Spray paint the branches.,
Continue painting the branches until you are done.,
Apply a sealer, if necessary.,
Let the branches dry before placing them back on the tree.,
Decorate your tree.",How to Decorate a Christmas Tree in Ombre3," If your tree came with lights attached to it, you will need to pull them off. Go over the tree, and pull off the little clips/tabs first, then pull the lights off.

, Pick at least four colors to use for your ombre design, including white.Choose a base color for your tree, then pick out different shades of that color: dark, medium, light, and white. For example, if you chose blue as your color, your color scheme would be: dark blue, medium blue, light blue, and white.Christmas trees have distinct rows or sections. Plan on having one shade per row.

, You will need one can of spray paint for each color that you will be using. It would be a good idea to buy a can of white spray paint as well. Even though your tree is already white, the white spray paint can act as an ""eraser"" if you make a mistake.Spray paint comes in both flat and glossy finishes. Pay attention to this when out shopping.
If you can't find matching spray paint, buy clear acrylic sealer in the finish you want.

, Some trees are built so that you can pull out the branches. If your tree is one of those, take these branches off now, and separate them into groups based on what row or section they were in. If it is not possible to take your tree apart, keep it together.

, Open up the branches and fluff them out. Take them outside, or to a well-ventilated area. Spread out some newspaper, and place the branches on top. If you don't have a lot of space to work with, start with the branches from the bottommost row.

, Paint the branches from the bottommost row your darkest color. Let the paint dry, then flip the branches over, and paint the back. The paint likely won't cover the branches completely, and you may have some white showing. This is fine.


If you didn't take your tree apart, simply spray paint the bottommost row using your first, darkest color.

, Leave the branches at the top of your tree white.If you can't take apart your tree, wrap a trash bag around the parts you have already painted. Make sure that they are dry first.

, If your spray paint had both glossy and matte finishes, your tree will look mismatched. Pick a finish (matte or glossy) and buying a matching can of clear, acrylic sealer. Spray the mismatches branches with the sealer. This way, all of the branches will have the same finish.


A sealer can also help the paint last longer.
Choose a non-yellowing sealer, if possible.

, Once the paint has completely dried, you can bring the tree back inside. Be careful when handling the tree, however, as some of the paint may flake off.

, You can continue the ombre scheme by placing matching ornaments in each section. You can also create a more subtle ombre effect by using ornaments that have neutral colors, such as black, white, silver, or clear.

Check the trunk to see if it is sticky.,
Check for loose needles by banging the tree up and down on the ground.",How to Check the Freshness of a Christmas Tree," Does it appear fresh, healthy, and in good shape?;
, If the tree is fresh, the needles should stay in place and not break. It should be hard to pull them off the branches.

, If so, it's definitely fresh.

, Expect some needles to fall off but if a lot fall off, move to another tree. One that loses a lot of needles is no longer fresh and could be dry enough to be a fire hazard.

Then measure the diameter of your tree from the tips of its outer branches. Your Christmas tree skirt should be larger than the diameter of your stand, but smaller than the diameter of the outer branches of your tree.


You can find the diameter by measuring the entire width of the circles formed by the stand and the tips of the tree's outer branches.Your skirt should always completely cover your tree stand from view. If yours does not, it is too small.;
, Decorative tree skirts may feature a prominent design that you want to show off. In this case, using a slightly larger than necessary tree skirt will display it better. Skirts only intended as an accent to the tree can be on the smaller side so as not to detract attention from other decorations., At some point, it's likely you and your family will gather around the tree to open presents. During this activity, overlarge tree skirts can become a dangerous tripping hazard.


In some cases, you may be able to tuck the extra fabric of overlarge skirts underneath itself.

, Even if your quilted tree skirt is brand new, quilted material is often equated with a traditional, down-home sense. Quilted tree skirts come in a variety of themes, colors, and designs.


If you have a yearly Christmas theme, like nutcrackers or snowmen for example, you can likely find a quilted tree skirt that features these designs.If you can't find a quilted tree skirt in the right theme, why not quilt your own blanket and cut a hole in it to create a homemade quilted tree skirt?

, Some tree skirts have a special shape. Two common shapes used for tree skirts include snowmen and snowflakes. What's more, you can coordinate these specialty skirts with other decorations to create a neat Christmas display.


Snowflake tree skirts are often decorated with glittering accents. This can give your tree extra pop., If you appreciate the simple, honest feel of rustic decorations, the primitive skirt will be perfect. Even better, you can make a rustic skirt inexpensively with a burlap sack and a pair of scissors. Simply:


Cut the burlap sack down its seam until the bag shape is reduced to a single, flat piece of fabric.
Wrap the burlap around your tree until the stand is covered and the skirt extends to your ideal size range.
Use more burlap bags prepared in the same way as the first if there is not enough burlap to make your tree skirt from a single one., Velvet will look fantastically soft under the gentle glow of the Christmas lights on your tree. These beautiful tree skirts come in many colors, patterns, and designs. Choose whichever one suits your taste and decor., Some stores specialize exclusively in Christmas related products. These stores oftentimes have a much more extensive array of Christmas items in stock, including tree skirts.

If you don't know where to find a store like this, you might try a general online keyword search for, ""Christmas stores near me"".

, As Christmas approaches, holiday items become more and more common on the shelves of general retailers. General retailers often even sell trees, so its likely they'll carry skirts and other supplies, like stands, as well.


If you are in dire need of a tree skirt and cannot find one, you could use a large, durable blanket bought from a general retailer instead.

, Online sellers often have the widest selection, especially when it comes to specialty items like tree skirts. The search features most sites have will help you narrow down on a specific size or type of tree skirt in a jiffy.


Online marketplaces, like eBay and Amazon, are excellent places to find suitable tree skirts.

Consider doing a number of snowy Christmas decoration crafts.",How to Create a Wintery and Snowy Christmas Tree Without Flocking It," The goal of this project is to produce an effect that resembles the Winter Wonderland that comes with a winter day. If you're in a winter climate, step outside and admire how the ice traces every little branch or paints the items it touches, how fresh fallen snow glistens or how snow clumps on the evergreens. If you don't live in such a climate, research books and web galleries for ideas.;
, You might just want to add a few glimmers of silver or white here and there with some crystals to create just a ""kiss of ice"" look. Or you might want to all go out with almost covering the tree with clusters and clumps of white ornaments for a snowy mountain look. Here you are not limited to the selections, amounts of ""snow"" on the tree as well as what it covers or the prices of flocked trees available in stores. In fact you'll be surprised at how easy it is to create a high end flocked look without the high end price.


Make note of the different forms of flocking available. All flocking is not the same. Some is the fine powder stuff that is like chalk which gives a ""frosted"" look. Others are more chunky which can be anything from micro Styrofoam beads, shredded paper, tiny shipping peanuts, and micro glass beads.

,


You might want an artificial tree. While any plain green artificial tree will be adequate for this project , a tree with needles in a grayish, silvery, or bluish-green color will really make the frosty look really authentic.
Alternatively, you can use a fresh cut tree. When choosing a natural tree you can always just choose any tree kind that you want, but if you want a really frosty look consider the silvery blue spruce. Another option is the Fraser Fir with it's dark green needles up-swept revealing a silvery gray underside. Other options include the soft needled white pines or other silvery fir species.

, Different stands suit different trees of different kinds. Artificial trees are very versatile and don't require water and can be set up in pieces depending on how it's constructed. Fresh trees need stands and containers that can resist rust, rot, sap and the heavier weight. Potted or ""plant-after"" living trees can be treated like houseplants.


Ideas for tree containers include:
Popcorn or cookie tins.
Decorative urns or flower pot.
Glass vases.

, You can skip this if you're using a tree skirt to cover or the tree stand is attractive. You can any container you want as long as it supports the weight of the weight of the tree and all the decor on it.


Artificial trees with stands or base/containers : Find a container that is wider and taller than the stand itself. Set the entire tree into the container and add heavy items to cover the stand filling the container to support the tree.
Artificial trees without stands or for container that is too small for a stand. There is floral putty the florist uses mount heavy topiary arrangements, flowers and stems in pots without falling over. Also unlike plaster or concrete it's not permanent.
Fresh cut trees tend to be heavy and with required water that adds more weight. Put tree in the stand first then place the tree in a container that's wider than the stand. This is more suitable for smaller trees.
Make sure the tree is secure! Push and tug the tree to test for resistance and that it's straight. It's no fun watching a decorated tree fall down or trying to readjust a crooked one after decorating.

, Classic white lights are always a safe choice. It's a great idea to use lights of different shapes, sizes and textures in the same colors to add interest. Some have bulbs that come in frosted and other finishes with all the lights the same shape. Some sets have different shapes and sizes within one set.


Multicolored or many solid colors can look excellent in snowy tree schemes. Blue and cool blue really bring home the winter frosty feel. Cool bluish green bulbs like teal or peacock also can have the same effect. Rainbow lights can really give a snowy tree a Gingerbread or Toy Store feeling. Purples, red and pinks can look too Valentine-themed. Greens on the yellow side, like lime green, as well as yellow, orange, amber also are more challenging to use in winter snow decorating scheme unless you are going for a flocked tree with mostly gold ornaments.
Because of the new LED lights out there there are more options of colors including the whites. Cool whites have blue and warms are more yellowish. Pure whites have no colors in them like white printing paper. However the color of the white as well as the brightness of the set, even with the same name, varies by brand, so you should experiment with different brands to find the tone of white or any other color that you are looking for or try to see the set lit in person.
You could also paint plain bulbs in a desired color. LED sets work best because they are cooler burning and plastic. You can use Sun catcher paint, acrylic paint or translucent nail polish. Water paint down if it's too opaque to let the light through. Glass incandescent sets are more sensitive and give off a lot of heat. Using the wrong paint here can be a fire hazard.

, There are many ways and opinions on the web and books, magazines to do this. Despite all claims there is no magic number of lights per foot you need to put on it. How you do it is up to you as each different size or shape of bulb, kind of bulb, length of the strand requires a different technique. The shape of the tree and its fullness will also affect how you put your lights on it. Just arrange the bulbs evenly and make sure the wires and plugs are as hidden as possible. Remove those annoying spare bulb and/or fuse packages and the UL labels if they are too obvious.


You can use white wire lights on a green tree. This will give you a winter snow laying on the tree or candle effect which will go well with this decorating idea. Strands constructed like icicles or curtains can be just placed on the tree and each icicle can be wrapped on a branch. Leave some left to hang freely.

, After doing the top lights of the tree (or all your lights) do the tree topper now so there's no risk of a decorated tree falling down with your decorations being destroyed.Many tree toppers come with white lights and gorgeous textures including faceted bulbs that resemble gemstones or pearls or are made of shells called capiz shells which resemble mother of pearl which make excellent choices for a frosty look.

, If your tree stand is attractive you can skip this step. If it's not you can purchase a yard of fancy fabric or humble felt or satin and wrap it around the tree stand. Or you can purchase a ready made tree skirt or sew your own. For a very snowy look consider anything white,grey, silver, turquoise, mint green.


You also disguise the stand with a ring of plants, toys, anything around the tree.

, Look around for glittery, snowy, flocked decorations found in many stores. You also find artificial wreathes, garlands, swags already flocked you can break apart using wire cutters and wire them to the tree using floral wire or a thick jewelry wires. You can also just tuck these decorations in the tree. Also available in stores are bowl fillers which can can made of feathers, sticks, or be a collection of pine cones, white flowers or fruit.


You can also snake ready made flocked floral garlands in the tree by going around and around the circumference of the tree and tucking those deep within up against the trunk of the tree.
Be also on the look out for floral picks with variegated holly and other plants which can really make an unique effect. Variegated means white on green leaves. There are also picks with soft velvety greenish gray leaves ( Sage, Dusty Miller) and also grayish, silvery ferns that can really resemble a fresh dusting of snow or frost.
Make sure the majority of the markings on the leaves are white and not cream. Use cream sparingly if you want a really authentic snowy look.

, These are the garlands that are not the floral ones (crystals, beads, ribbons, roping, tinsel). The more wavy the pattern is the longer length of garlands you are going to need. For shorter garlands and precision in placing the garlands in exact areas use ornament hooks. This prevents sliding and slipping as well.


Choose your garlands with care. The more intricate in shape a garland is the more easier it is to get tangled! Also garlands with items on the ground like snowmen and trees will look wacky with those items upside down. Also intricate garlands can make the tree look too busy.
Try hanging too short garlands vertically like icicles. Snowflake garlands look really pretty like this. Icicle garlands not so much.
White or silver tinsel velvet ribbon or pure white or silver velvet,satin, white feather boas, tulle or whatever material will look lovely with a flocked tree effect.
A cute idea is to take icicle garlands and swag them around the very bottom of the tree which makes it look like it's wearing a fringe skirt.

, These are the ornaments you have a lot of. One of the most popular options is simply the ball (or other shapes) ornaments that are made of glass or plastic that come in a multitude of finishes and textures. But you don't have to jump on this bandwagon. Why not try chandelier pendents, crochet snowflake ornaments, snowmen, or all icicles? For a fun musical tree consider purchasing metal silver instead or glass or plastic bells and using those as a basic ornaments.


Play with textures and randomness. The snow and ice outside is not just one texture and icicles are not all one perfect shape. Cloning gets repetitive and boring. Forget the ""Murder She Wrote"" snowflake clones you see every where. Use ones with individuality just like nature does.
You don't have to use the boring ornament hooks for your ornaments that are on the outer branches of the Christmas tree. Look around for ribbon, pipe cleaners or/and decorative cording you can tie to your ornaments to in the form of a loop and hang it by the ribbon. This also makes the ornaments less likely to fall and eliminates sharp wire edges.

, Don't be afraid to become creative and adjust the suggestions in this article to your own desires. The snow outside doesn't choose a specific color to cover outside.

, Basic white paint is the obvious as the snow is outside but you can add other colors. Consider cool greys, minty blue-greens, icy turquoise blues. Instead using just silver as a metallic consider steel and pewter options.


There are also different mediums and glazes the give various effects that can mimic snow outside. These are either already mixed in the paint when you purchase it or you can purchase the medium and paint separately.

Iridescent mediums the surface has a rainbow color play reflected when viewed under a light. Like a bath bubble.

Stone or rock if you can find any in a white marble effect. You can easily create the sparkly crystalline texture of snow.

Chalk Paint resembles fine powder snow and needs to by protected with protective sealers.

Crackle Finish Consider using white and silver in combination to create the effect of crackle ice on a solid surface.
Many paints and some glues have glitter or other materials already mixed in. You may also want to consider painting with other paints not normally used in crafts like acrylic nail polishes and lacquers. Go out and experiment.
Be careful when choosing specific shades of white to get a pure white or bluish white. Warm white lights with brown or yellow-like ivory or cream decorations will result in a tree that looks like mayonnaise and not snow. Avoid greenish whites, or you'll end up with a cream of pea soup or green alien blob invasion.

, Glitter comes in many form and textures now. Those fruit decorations you see in the department stores are all covered in what is called glass glitter or glass microbeads. If you are not finding the glitter you want try shopping online on eBay, Etsy or a craft shop.


If the normal glitter in the crafts department is too coarse (big particles) consider purchasing body glitter used in make up. This glitter is very fine like salt or sugar.

, This way you can take the messy flocking/spray snow stuff outside and avoid the huge cleanup and harmful fumes inside.

, Using glue and strings as well as balloons you can create lovely string structure ornaments that are really cool. Take plain styrofoam balls and cover them with paper mache, clay, plaster, Mod Podge, paint white and roll in glitter. Another approach is taking the same balls and covering them with white or silver shimmering fabric, and/or gluing and pinning on ribbons, sequins, buttons, rhinestones, pearls, cotton balls, decorative trimmings other jewels until the ball is completely covered. If you are into jewelry you can easily find or make ornaments of icicles and snowflakes with beads and wires. Look around for ideas in books or on the web.

, These things are a computer, CD-R or a CD-RW drive, blank CD-R, CD Case, wrapping paper, ribbon (optional) Christmas card, gift tags and a pen or pencil. You'll also need song files and windows media player or iTunes, on your computer.

, Take your CD and go onto your computer. Then burn the CD with Christmas music or even your own recordings of songs! Some songs could be Deck the halls, Jingle bells, etc. It depends on your style.

, You can use a bag but personally wrapping is more festive and fun! Put your CD in a CD case first. then wrap it with some Christmas themed wrapping paper. There are also many articles on wrapping a gift to help you. But the process is just folding over again. Then (optional) tie a ribbon or use a ribbon that you stick on for a more festive look! Then insert your gift tag with the name of the receiver and the giver on it. Now you are done with your gift CD!

Make the gifts instead of buying them.,
Be creative.,
Do not procrastinate.,
Make a donation on behalf of the recipient.,
Go somewhere together.,
Give a service.,
Enroll the recipient in a hobby or activity course.,
Give yourself.",How to Find Alternatives to Buying Christmas Gifts," Most people cherish gifts if they are hand made because they know you invested time making them; they feel you were thinking of them throughout the entire project. They can lose or break their store-bought gifts, but tend to be more careful with the sentimental things; they also remember who the gift was from.;
, Inspiration can come from anywhere. Watch the person you are making the gift for. See what they need, find out if anything is broken, listen to what they say. Chances are they will tell you what they want.


Remember, you don't have to be original. You can find ideas on Pinterest and other similar web sites. Pinterest, in particular, is a great website to use because you can find many do-it-yourself ideas, and it is free!

, If you are making a gift, you should not wait until the last minute, it will wind up being a mess.

, Choose their favorite charity and make a donation to it, and give them a card with a certificate or other form of recognition in it.


You might also consider purchasing a gift that keeps on giving, such as a goat, cow, water, etc. for a poor family in another country or place. Many charities offer this service. It's a nice way to make a donation and have something to give to the recipient in whose name you purchased it.

, Arrange a vacation stay somewhere instead of giving gifts for Christmas. Spend some time at the beach, in the snow, in Mexico, or wherever else you think your family or friends would like to go.

, Organize a year's supply of cleaning, organic food delivery or snow and yard clearing for the recipient. These aren't ""gifts"" in the traditional sense but they're extremely useful services that will keep on giving throughout the coming year.

, Give them an experience that they might not otherwise dare to try or might not be able to afford. This could be anything from art and craft to adventure sports and travel.

, Offer to spend more time with people than you have been. If you've been really busy, make a deal to be around a bit more, then keep that promise! Your time is far more precious than any gift you could possibly give.

During the current holidays, make as detailed a list as possible of everyone you would like to buy a gift for (family, friends, co workers, etc).,
Divide the list according to the cost or type (or both) of gift you would like to give.

,
Start shopping for next year the day or week after the holiday.,
As you purchase gifts, assign each to a person on your list.,
Buy in bulk where possible for groups of people.,
Keep an open mind!,
Keep your list and purchased gift items in a central location.,
Don't get discouraged!,
In a year or two, you will wonder how you ever did it all at one time!

",How to Christmas Shop Year Round,";
,, You can pick up some great bargains at after holiday sales. Just be sure it is something that will not be outdated by next year.

, If you want to be really efficient, wrap each gift and tag it as they are purchased!

, (Manicure sets, hand lotion, etc make great gifts for co workers, members of professional organizations, etc).

, When you see something great on sale, think of different ways it can be used. Sometimes you can get great deals on sets of things that can be used individually as gifts. (Dessert dishes can be used with greenery as centerpieces, used as candle holders...) Those nice red candy dishes and candle holders from the Valentine's Day sale, could also be used as Christmas or 4th of July decorations or hostess gifts.

, A large tote or cardboard box with a clipboard for your list is ideal. A hall closet or under a bed in the guest room makes it easy to check your list and store your gifts.

, Every gift you can cross off the list throughout the year is one less expense or stress when the holiday rolls around.

Avoid getting caught when searching for your present.,
Prepare to search the home thoroughly.,
Begin by looking in the most obvious places for your gift.,
Search the less obvious places for your gift.,
Search in shopping bags and suitcases.,
Search their office for your gift.,
Check receipts for things you have asked for.,
Look for your Christmas list for items that have been crossed off.",How to Find out What You Got for Christmas1," This is the most important part of finding Christmas gifts. If the gifter finds you snooping, they will probably be very angry about it, and they may take away the gifts if they are really upset. Therefore, you should only look for presents when you know you won’t get caught.


For example, a good time to snoop is when you have a few hours alone at home, or if your loved one is very busy with something in another part of the house.
Make sure you have a place to hide if they do come back into the room you are searching, or at least a good excuse to give them about why you are in there in the first place.
If you are searching for your gift at someone else's house, then you should only do so if you're certain that the person won't mind you being there. Under no circumstances should you break into someone's house to look for gifts.;
, Some people are very clever when it comes to hiding things, and may have arranged clothes, bags, or blankets over your gifts. They may know exactly how they are arranged, and it will be obvious if they come back and they are arranged differently. Snap a quick photo of the area before you begin moving stuff around.


When you’re finished searching, use the picture to place everything back exactly as it was.
Don’t forget to delete the photo! If the person giving you the gift sees the picture, they might figure out what you were doing.

, If you are observant, you may already know where the gifter tends to hide stuff they don’t want you to find. For example, under the bed in their bedroom, or in the closet.


Hall closets and high shelves are also good places.
Don’t forget to search in the basement and/or attic.
Try to think of places where you don’t normally go. If you live with the person giving you the gift, and they know that you hardly ever go in the laundry room, they might have hidden something there.

, The gifter may have thought very carefully about how to hide your gifts, so they may be in places you would never think of hiding anything.


Look in your sibling’s room, if you live with them, as well as your own. If the gifter is really clever, they might even hide your gift in your own room. For example, they might have hidden them on a high shelf that you can’t easily see or reach.
If you have an outdoor shed or garage, you should also look there. This probably seems like a good hiding spot if you don’t spend much time doing outside chores.
Don’t forget to search in the trunk of the car! People often leave gifts their for a little while before sneaking them into the house.

, Your presents are unlikely to be wrapped if Christmas is still a few weeks away. Therefore, you should look inside any shopping bags you find during your search.


If you come across a suitcase, look in there too! They may have thought this to be a clever hiding place.

, If the person giving you the gift has their own office at work, or if they own their own business, they might hide your gifts at work.


Do not enter their office without permission! Especially if it is not their own business, you may get caught, and you may get yourself and the gifter into very big trouble.
If you get the chance to go to their office with them, casually walk around their office to see if you notice anything. You probably won’t be able to search too thoroughly, and it probably isn’t a good idea to try as you may unintentionally get into someone else’s property.

, If you can’t find the gifts, you may be able to find receipts. Search in kitchen drawers, where the mail is usually kept, as well as in wallets and purses.


If you look in their wallet, be sure to put everything back just as it was. Make sure none of the money falls out, as they are likely to notice missing cash.

, If you wrote a list of wishes for Christmas and gave it to them, try to find that. It might be in their purse or wallet, in their bedside table, or in a desk near the computer.


If you are able to find the list, look to see if any of the items have been crossed off. This may suggest that they have already gotten it for you.
However, be aware that a crossed off item could possibly also mean that there was no way they could get you that. If the item was a far-fetched one, or was very, very expensive, then keep in mind that this may be the case.

Open all of the browsers on your family computer.,
Open settings.,
Go to browsing history.,
Check the history carefully for websites that might sell your gift.,
Check their email for purchase confirmations.",How to Find out What You Got for Christmas2," If the gift has their own computer that they use, then go to that computer. Make sure you do this when they aren’t home, or are busy with other things so they won’t notice what you are doing.


Remember to open all the browsers installed on the computer, unless you already know what browser they use. For example, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.

, Although the instructions will vary based on which browser you are in, you will probably need to go to the “settings” or “preferences” tab in the browser.


In Google Chrome, for example, if you go to settings, a new browsing tab will open. On this browser page, you will find the “history” section.

, Again, this will vary depending upon your specific browser, but you will usually see a setting called history. If you click on this, it will show you a list of the websites that have been visited using that browser.

, Once you have found the history page, look through all the websites listed carefully. If you made a list of things you want, you should look for websites that might sell what you asked for.


Remember though, that just because you don’t see anything that looks like it could be your gift doesn’t mean they didn’t get you something online. They may have just deleted the browser history. It is possible to delete a specific website without clearing everything.
Understand that it is unlikely that you will be able to figure out whether they actually bought the gift for you or not using this method. However, it may be able to clue you in on what they have been considering getting you.

, If you have access to their email, you can look through to see if they received any emails that confirm their purchase. If you find any, then you will know exactly what you’re getting.


However, be careful doing this! This is a big violation of privacy, and they may feel very hurt if they find out what you've been doing.

Examine the box.,
Shake the box.,
Beware of very large boxes, as they may be a trick.,
Feel around in gift bags for clues.,
Open the gift carefully.,
Rewrap the gift to look as though it hasn't been opened.,
Place each gift exactly as it was.",How to Find out What You Got for Christmas3," When doing this, keep in mind the things you asked for. For example, if you asked for a CD, and you find a gift that is thin, relatively small, and square, it is likely the CD you asked for.


If you find a relatively light, rectangular box that gives a bit when you press on it, it is almost definitely clothing of some sort.
If the box is tall and a bit rectangular, try feeling along the long edge of the box. If you can feel a lip where a flap is, it could be a new pair of shoes.

, What do you hear? Is there a rattling noise of any sort? Do things shift around in the box? Although this will not give the most obvious clues, it can help if the shape of the box didn't give you any answers.


This will be especially helpful if you have all of the things you asked for in mind. For example, if you asked for a music box, and you hear a chiming sound when you shake it, then it is pretty likely that is what's in the box.

, If the gift giver likes to play tricks, then they may have also put your gift inside a box that is way too big for it.


If you find a very large box, but did not ask for anything very large, and if the box is also light considering the size, then you probably have a smaller gift inside a larger box.
Keep in mind that this could mean that the gifter knows you are likely to snoop!

, If you find your gift already placed in a gift bag with tissue paper, you can also slide your hand down the side, between the side of the bag and the tissue paper.


Be careful doing this! You don’t want to disturb the tissue paper too much or it will be obvious that you peeked. Simply slide your open hand down the side, and try to gently feel around in the bag.
You can also carefully remove the tissue paper. Try to grab all of the tissue without crushing it. Lift it out of the bag and peek inside, Your gift may be wrapped in more tissue, or it may simply be in the bottom of the bag. Either way, you should be able to see what it is.

, You should only do this if you have enough time, all of the right supplies, and the skill to re-wrap the gift exactly as it was done the first time. If you want to do this, make sure you have all of the supplies out (e.g. wrapping paper, tape, scissors, etc), and a way to dispose of all the evidence, for example, in a dumpster down the street. Unwrapping the present will only work with gifts that come in regularly shaped boxes, such as squares or rectangles. If they have wrapped a gift with a strange shape, it will be hard to get the paper back in place exactly as it was.


Snap a photo of the gift. You should make sure you take a photo so you can compare your rewrapped gift with how it was originally. Make sure to take a close up of the wrapping on the edges, too!
Begin by trying to cut the tape. Carefully use a pair of open scissors, or a knife, and slide the blade along the seam of the paper, where the tape is. Repeat this for all tape on the gift.
Very carefully open the paper. You should try to unwrap the present in the reverse order that it was wrapped in order to avoid tearing or creasing the paper. This usually means you will have to unfold the paper on each end of the box first. If there are any bows on the gift, leave them alone as much as possible.
Examine the box. Hopefully, the box will give you an indication of what is inside. If so, you now know what you are getting. If not, you will need to see if the box can easily be opened. If it is sealed with packing tape, do not try to open it. In this case, it is very unlikely that you will be able to seal the box so that it looks the same.

, If you were able to unwrap the gift without tearing, creasing, or otherwise messing up the paper, then you should just wrap up the gift again. Use the creases in the paper to guide you. If you damaged the paper, then you will need to use your gift wrapping supplies to wrap your gift again. Make sure that the gift wrap is the same one, and that you use the photos you took to wrap it up to look the same as it did before.


If you are simply folding the paper back onto the box, and not rewrapping with new paper, you will need to begin by folding the paper over the gift lengthwise. After you do this, tear off a piece of tape that is exactly the same length as the old piece of tape.
Carefully line up the tape with the old piece. If you are able to lay the new piece directly on top of the old piece, it won’t be so obvious that it was re-taped.
Fold the paper at each end of the box. Do this carefully, as each person tends to do this a bit differently. You should try to fold the paper as neatly and carefully as it was done the first time. Once you have folded it as best you can, you will need to, again, lay a new piece of tape over the old ones so that they line up exactly.

, If you opened multiple gifts, make sure you put them back exactly how they were. Hopefully you took photos, as these will be very helpful in making sure they are in the same position, and same place as they were before.

Select a frame from the dollar store.,
Decide whether you like the frame color as it is or would prefer to improve it.,
Add glitter to the frame.,
Add some Christmas elements for decoration.,
Insert an image.",How to Decorate a Photo Frame for Christmas1," It's going to look a whole lot better when you've finished with it!


Choose a frame according to the size of the image you'd like to place inside, or just a frame size that you like.;
, If you do want to change it, use a paint suitable for wood and paint the frame. One color is easiest, although you could vary by having one color for the long sides and another matching color for the top and base sides. Red and green or silver or gold are good colors. If you do paint it, let it dry completely before proceeding.

, Paint a light layer of glue onto the frame and sprinkle glitter onto the glue. Allow to dry for at least quarter of an hour, or as long as the manufacturer's instructions suggest.


Match the glitter to the frame or paint color. Christmas colors include red, green, metallic, white, etc.

, Glue something else to the frame to finish it off. Some examples include:


Artificial mistletoe in each corner of the frame.
A red and green ribbon bow on the top center of the frame.
Use Christmas themed buttons, plastic models, cut-outs, etc. and attach them wherever you think they look best on the frame.

, The frame is now ready for display or to give as a gift.

Select a frame from the dollar store.,
Find suitable Christmas jewelry.,
Prepare the jewelry.,
Design the layout.,
Commence gluing each piece onto the frame.,
Insert a photo into the frame.",How to Decorate a Photo Frame for Christmas2," It's going to look a whole lot better when you've finished with it!


Choose a frame according to the size of the image you'd like to place inside, or just a frame size that you like.

, Look for brooches, pendants and other pieces of jewelry that can be stuck against the picture frame. Don't be afraid to raid the costume jewelry box at a thrift store or the drugstore. You'll need enough pieces to cover the whole frame.


Finding Christmas-themed jewelry in stores will be easier during the Christmas season. However, online sales might be available all-year around if you're looking to make the frame out-of-season.
Consider adding Christmas decorations in with the jewelry too. Small decorations will look right at home amid the jewelry pieces.
Some jewelry isn't made for Christmas but will still work well, such as bows or deer. Think laterally about the pieces you choose, and pick Christmas colors.

, Pull brooch backs, etc. off the jewelry pieces so that they have reasonably flat backs and nothing sticking out on the back side.

, This is a very creative process, and you'll just have to play around a bit with placement of the pieces. It is easier to trace a copy of the frame size onto a piece of white paper and play around with the placement design on that rather than on the frame itself. Once you're happy with the design, you can leave it in place on the paper and pick the pieces off in order of the layout.

, Add glue to the back of the jewelry piece and press firmly onto the frame. In order to ensure that pieces don't get knocked off before they're properly dried in place, ensure that each piece is properly dried before adding another one next to that piece. Continue slowly until the frame has been covered.

, Do this when you're sure that the frame is completely dry. It's now ready for display or for giving as a gift.

, If it is dirty and dusty, clean off the dust. Sand any part of it that is rough.

, Paint it all one color, either red or green. Allow it to dry completely, then paint another layer or two.

, Tie them together, varying the levels of the baubles. Tie the top end of the cords or string that the baubles hang from over the top center of the frame.

, The bow is most effective if its loops reach across the top bar of the frame. Either glue or tie the bow in place.

, Alternatively, lean the frame against a wall or other surface.

, Either hang, lean or place the frame over a few of the branches of your Christmas tree.

Think about what you want the gift to do for the new baby and his or her parent(s).,
Decide how much you want to spend once you've narrowed down the type of gift you're buying.,
Choose a gift that will mean something to the baby and its parents for all time.,
Look around in baby stores to see what's popular if you don't have a practical gift in mind.,
Get some soft toys the baby can play with.,
Look for some clothes for the baby.,
Knit booties for baby if you like or knit other items like clothing and blankets.,
Offer to pay for a photographic sessions, to lessen the cost of having pictures taken at the hospital (if provided) or at a photography studio by the parents.

,
Look into finding help for the parents in the form of a babysitter who can be paid by you.",How to Choose Christmas Gifts for a New Baby," Do you want to buy something practical? Something personalized? Something for Christmas or something that can be used all year? Something the baby can use now? A gift for baby to cherish for his or her whole life? There are a lot of things to consider and some gifts will serve multiple purposes; for example, a cute reindeer baby outfit with a little hood with antlers can be used now (if you get the right size), is practical, and could be kept and treasured as a doll or teddy outfit in the future.;
, Remember that lots of baby stuff is only practical for a while. Clothes, educational toys, and cribs will all be grown out of, so decide whether or not you want to spend a lot of money on these sorts of items.

, Items bought for a newborn at Christmas can become family heirlooms, and, whilst they don't have to be expensive, they can be priceless. Some suggestions for gifts to cherish include:


Illustrated fairy tale book
Personalized Christmas tree decorations. These are available named and dated, and can look like an egg that says something like ""Chris's First Christmas 2014"".
Collectible or antique toys, such as a Steiff teddy bear
Antique traditional toys, such as dolls, boats, or trains.
Precious metal items, such as a silver teething ring or money box. These are often given as Christening gifts, but not all babies are christened and you can give these as Christmas gifts if you like.
If the newborn is a new brother or sister for another child, you can buy gifts for both with a theme.

, If you haven't bought baby things for a while, you may not know what the latest gadgets, trends and popular items are. Try Babies-R-Us, Toys-R-Us or similar stores in your location if you want something 'high street'. Try looking online (you don't have to purchase online, but you can research the latest innovations for babies) or in boutique stores if you're looking for something special or unique.


Consider diapers and baby formula, but those things aren't very Christmas-like or festive. If you do go this route, make sure you know the exact requirements of the baby. You'll need to ask parents, that will take away any surprise element from your gift of course, although, most parents of a newborn would be pretty surprised to get diapers and formula for Christmas. Additionally, the parents will probably have all the diapers and formula they need beforehand from being planned parents and from baby shower gifts. Mom may even be breastfeeding, making formula redundant.
Look at blankets and things that can keep the baby warm. You can get a specific Receiving Blanket (for those places that can get warm all year long) or a cozy thermal baby blanket that can be used in cold weather. Blankets can be really great Christmas gifts for a newborn. Even for places that aren't warm all year long, Receiving Blankets are almost always a plus, unless the parents already have stacks from the baby shower. A cute, warm festive themed blanket could be a lovely gift for a newborn in a cold Christmas climate. Some babies have the same blanket their whole childhood, as a comfort, stroking it and always sleeping with it, like a Snuggie or a Blankie. Your gift of the right blanket could last the baby a lifetime!
Look for soothing items (soothers) such as pacifiers (make sure the parents are allowing them). They are an indelible point of some baby's needs, that not many parents buy too many of. You can never find a pacifier when you absolutely need one, and it's always best if one is on hand whatever room the baby is presently in. These are a good idea if money is short and festive themed items are available.
Look for diaper-rash ointment or baby powder along with some baby oil or baby lotion (unscented at first, if the baby has been found to be allergic to the scents or detergent that's being used). If nothing else, baby wipes are always a plus/need but exceedingly boring and not festive in the least.
Look for common things that should be stocked in a medicine area. These can include digital thermometers, re-hydrating fluids (Pedialyte), and pain relievers, which are all very practical and useful.
Look for bath supplies. Whether it's baby soap or baby shampoo, a baby comb or the like, these supplies are always necessary. If you are also able to find for the child for later, a character hoodie bath towel is a great idea. Most kids, later on, get a kick out of using them, and they are a good motivator when the child becomes older, to motivate them to take a bath when they normally kick and scream (chant-wise) ""No bath! No bath! No bath!""
Forgo buying big pieces of furniture, unless the parents request specific items. The parents will have purchased these pieces as soon as they were able to. Car seats can also be included in this list and were needed upon first transport home from the hospital.

, Soft toys are available for newborns but choose carefully with safety in mind. Don't be offended when you don't see baby sleeping with the toy in his/her crib as common practice today is not to actually lay toys down in the crib with a baby (for fear of SIDS and suffocation risk). Baby can play with these when he or she is old enough to do so and they can be used as decorative items in the nursery. There's a huge range of toys available for newborn babies and infants of all ages. Buy a toy baby can use now, like a crib-mobile with a built in nursery rhyme player or something for when they are a little older.

, Items of clothing can be great newborn Christmas gifts. If you are planning ahead and the baby hasn't been born yet and the parents don't know or haven't told you the sex, make sure that the clothes are gender-neutral. Buy a teeny tiny super cute baby grow with jingle bell images stamped all over if you have your heart set on it. It's Christmas, it's okay to be indulgent, especially if the baby is a long awaited first child.


You can be practical and plan for the child to grow into clothes if you prefer (add two sizes larger than the age of the child at the current time). Don't go crazy trying to add 3 sizes larger, as 3-sizes can cause a falling hazard once baby is toddling although a sensible parent won't dress their toddler in anything too big and will put items aside until they are suitable. This is where you may want to reconsider that baby Santa suit; baby might not look so cute in it come Easter, so if you choose Christmas themed clothes, try to make sure they fit at Christmas if at all possible. Whether it's a blanket sleeper (for use at least during the Winter) or a onesies for Spring and Summer-use later on, or even other clothes such as dresses or pants, clothes are a really great thing that most parents don't think their baby can have too many of.
Shoes or slippers won't be needed by baby yet but you can buy these items if you want to. Baby shoes are some of the most adorable items in children's retail so go ahead, buy tiny sneakers, gum boots or booties if you want to. They can be displayed, put to one side or 'Borrowed' by a teddy or doll until needed. It's Christmas, you're gift shopping, indulge if you want to.

, If you are good at other crafts, a hand made toy is a lovely gift, just remember that baby may never be able to play with it without supervision by a parent.

,, It doesn't just have to be a month - even a night's worth of help is better than nothing. Parents always enjoy help.

Think about specific sports, activities, animals, bands, authors, or artists that she likes. Any one of these interests is a potential gift.
If you don't want her to know you're asking about her, you can always ask around (her friends, or your friends) to gather more ideas. There's no shame in asking. Ask about other girls' interests, too, if you're worried that you might;
, It's probably not a great ideas to go and buy her a skull statue, unless she's into that kind of thing. Put yourself in her shoes; think about what girls generally swoon over.


Jewelry, flowers or candy are usually safe bets. Note: if you plan on buying her any one of these, don't expect to keep your crush secret. These gifts scream ""I'm really into you.""
Clothing can also be a good option, but choose with care. Shirts, scarves, hats, and socks are all fine clothing gifts.

However, underwear, lingerie, camisoles or anything that goes underneath clothing is not! It's way too personal and may be taken the wrong way, or earn you a slap in the face. Underwear is only okay with her permission!

, This may sound weird to say, but she may get a little uncomfortable if you buy her a $300 necklace and she buys you a pair of socks, or nothing at all. You might want to get her the world, but she might find it embarrassing.


If you're just getting to know your crush, or haven't known her for too long, stick with presents that are under $100. It's still fairly easy to get her a great present that's classy and tasteful but doesn't cost too much. Think about:

A nice set of paper and envelopes if she's a romantic or she likes to write letters. A pen (fountain or ball point) might be nice.
A set of wonderfully-smelling candles. Just remember that the candles you think smell good might not appeal to her.
A lomography camera. A lomography camera is a fancy name for a lo-fi camera that's coming back into style. These cameras are often available under $100.
A miniature ecosystem if she's into nature, science, or biology. Mini ecosystems are customizable, require little upkeep, and can be bought for under $100.



, Buying a gift — anyone can do that. Making a gift, on the other hand — that takes time, effort, and dedication. If you really want to show her you care around her, make her something she'll enjoy and appreciate.


There are tons of things you can make for her. Most involve a little bit of crafting. Maybe go with a rope bowl or some vintage stamp coasters. Both are ideas you can expand on.
Make her a necklace with nice fabric and beads, or tiny Polaroid magnets with pictures of you and her.
If she's a food-lover, make her some printable recipe cards where she can immortalize her favorite recipes, or a fruit bouquet packed with some of her favorite fruit.

, If you both enjoy doing something similar, why not make her happy while reinforcing what you have in common? More common ground can mean more time together.


If you both like a sports team or a particular sport, get tickets to a game. Make sure she actually likes the sport though. You don't want to invite her to a baseball game only to find out she thinks it's incredibly boring.
If you both like art or cooking, buy entry into a sculpture class or a cooking lesson. These are both fun group activities, and end up being pretty easy dates!

, Simple wrapping paper with a pretty ribbon. Girls don't like presents handed to them in trash bags.


There are a couple different wrapping methods you can experiment with, or you can always get your present gift wrapped for a fee (or sometimes free).
Experiment a bit. Some people wrap the present inside a present. For example, cut a hole out of the middle of an old, used book and place a small, wrapped present inside the space you cut out. Then wrap up the book.
Even if you're getting her tickets or something that fits into an envelope, take care to make the envelope look good. Make a great impression on her with sleek, high-quality paper.

, When you get her a card, don't run down the aisle and get the first one that falls off the shelf. Try to pick one that says something about how special she is. All girls like to be told they are special.


Keep your card short and sweet. An essay is probably what you'd like to write, but that much gushing can make her feel overwhelmed and embarrassed. Keep it simple.
Cards are perfect opportunities for you to say something that will hit home with her.

You can make it suggestive and romantic by saying something like: ""Choosing gifts isn't easy, but what's worth all the world is to see you happy and healthy.""
Or you can stick to the friendly, familiar, or funny: ""Hope your holidays are filled with the brightest cheer.""



, When she's squealing with delight at your great gift, just go for it. It's normal to exchange hugs like that after gift-giving.

, You'll make more of an impression on her if you give her the gift personally. Not only are you showing her how confident you are, you're showing her how she makes you feel. That's a great thing.

, Hopefully she sees how much you like her. Lay low and keep the course.


If she has a gift for you, or gives you a gift over the course of the next couple of weeks, there's a good chance she really values you as a friend or likes you more intimately.
If she really likes your gift, you could take a risk and tell her how you feel. She may even tell you how she feels! You may want to do this in a less populated area (e.g. not at school, work, or at a party), just in case her reaction to the news is unexpected.
If she doesn't get you a gift back, and doesn't starting talking to you more, the signs aren't looking good. She probably doesn't like you in the same way that you like her, but you can never be sure. The surest way is to go out and ask her out at this point. You have nothing to lose.

, If you get a girl a gift, don't back out. Even if she doesn't really like the gift, she'll still love the thought. Put feeling behind your actions and everything should turn out fine.

, Accept the fact she is not the one for you. Try to find the right girl next time.

Save as soon as possible.,
Figure out your budget.,
Think about making gifts.,
If you have the time, look for items you have but don't want.,
Figure out the personality of the person you're buying a gift for.,
Find out what the person has and doesn't have.,
Prioritize.",How to Buy Christmas Presents When You Don't Have Much Money," A little bit at a time helps. If you can, put away 10 or 20 dollars once or twice a month. If you can, put your money into a bank account. This way, you will accrue interest.


Talk to your employer and/or bank about setting up an automatic transfer. If you never see the money coming out of your paycheck in the first place, you're a lot less likely to miss it.;
, Work out how many people you want to give a gift to and how much money you have. Stick with your budget. Don't dilly-dally or use the budget as a rough estimate; a budget is a promise, so keep it.


Use software to help you budget. In the age of the internet, budgeting has become easier, faster, and more intuitive. Use budgeting software to help you meet your goals!
Don't count on windfalls or bonuses. Only factor the money that you know you're going to have into your budget.

, It is the thought that counts for gifts and not how much money you spent on it. Make a necklace for your sister, or a stuffed animal for your baby cousin.


Here are some other items to consider crafting if you're that sort of person:

A leather-bound scrapbook or sketchbook is easier than you might think.
A trivet using leftover wine cork, assembled into a nice snowflake or star pattern.
Turn a mason jar into a quirky, retro lamp.
Make flower lights out of an egg carton simply and quickly. Great for lasting holiday value!
A wreath or other door-decorations for that special person to show their holiday spirit.



, One man's trash is another man's treasure, but only if that treasure is still intact, useful, and respectable. You don't want to give anyone a broken faucet just because it's lying around your garage.


Once you run out of money, that's it. Don't justify spending extra money because it's such a great deal or you have to have it. Find other, creative ways to get around the money constraint.

, Buying a gift successfully depends on knowing what the person likes. That may seem like a no-brainer, but we often buy gifts that we think are cool or appealing. Always keep the perspective of the gift recipient in mind.


For example, if your cousin is a music promoter, consider getting her a CD or vinyl LP of an up-and-coming artist that she might enjoy.
If, for example, your brother is an avid explorer, consider getting him a travel guide or a photography book about a place he's interested in going to.
Balance out the interests of the gift recipients with the need to stay frugal. You can get your friends and loved ones great, appropriate gifts without breaking the bank.

, Peruse their room, office, or closet for items. This will give you both an idea of what the person likes, and what the person doesn't already have.


Ask yourself when you do a little reconnaissance if the person is technology-oriented, book-, music- or media-oriented, travel-oriented, food-oriented, or any number of other interests.
Ask the gift recipient's family or friends what sort of gifts they think the person might want to receive. Sometimes, you won't be able to snoop your way through their closet like Sherlock.

, Buy for people of the most importance to you first. Your family is the most important. After you do that, buy gifts for your close friends and then your acquaintances.

PikStiks are one of the handiest tools ever invented, for both old and young.,
Sliding cabinet organizers are such a great addition to any kitchen, that we feel compelled to mention them as a holiday gift idea.,
Gardening items, such as a gardening stool with garden utensils, are always a perfect gift for those seniors who still have access to a yard or patio.,
Colorful, theme based, garden stakes are an easy and beautiful addition to any yard or garden.,
Shopping cart trolleys were originally designed for people who walk to the corner grocery store or frequent farmer's markets - like city folks and many Europeans.,
Sheepskin seat belt covers are usually not something you think of as a gift, but the comfort level of senior citizens is so improved that they will thank you over and over for these covers.,
Wall mounted ironing boards are not only a space saver, but a labor saver for the older generation, especially if they have had to downsize their living space.,
Fleece blanket throws are always an appreciated gift, especially when paired with a book or movie.,
Tag Tamers, which are soft attachable covers for clothing tags, are a wonderful gift for senior citizens as they will stop the itchiness and scratching caused by sewn-in garment tags Yes, you could cut out the tags, but there is always a little left at the seam and that can be more irritating than the whole tag itself.

,
A retractable clothes drying line is another idea that many people never think about.",How to Choose Practical Christmas Gifts That the Elderly Will Appreciate," These teachers and grabbers come in a range of lengths and enable someone to retrieve items from the top shelf of a cupboard or closet, without standing on a chair or to pick up items that are on the floor, without having to get up from the sofa, and can even reach and grab objects that have fallen behind the washing machine. They are easy to use, even for people with arthritis or limited arm and hand movement.;
, We know this may seem like a weird idea, but think about it for a while. These cabinet organizers come in a variety of sizes for a variety of uses and would help all older people with storing and retrieving cooking pots and cleaning supplies, without having to get on their hands and knees to try to find something in the back of the cabinet. Of course, someone would have to help with the installation of these, but think how easy it would be for them to find and reach everything.

, Whether your recipient has a vegetable or flower garden these are perfect gift ideas that will allow them to cultivate their garden with little or no concern for the needed tools and with a comfy place to sit while they work.

, With low maintenance and easy set-up anyone can decorate their outdoor and indoor living areas with these cute and whimsical decorations. No tools or ladders are required to display these, making them senior-citizen friendly. Some nursing homes may allow these to be placed outside a resident's window.

, But they are not just for hauling groceries, they are perfect for transporting laundry to the laundry room or outdoors to the clothesline, for hauling groceries from the car to the house, and for moving a pile of stuff from one room to another.

, Even if they do not drive, one of these on the passenger seat belt will make their travels more comfortable by keeping the belt from digging into their neck. While on sheepskin ideas, a sheepskin wheelchair pad is perfect for someone who is wheelchair bound, but these can also be used on a living room chair for extra comfort and warmth. Be forewarned that if they have small pets, the cats and dogs will probably claim the sheepskin pad as their official napping mat!

, Plus, as we get older and wiser there is less and less items that we feel we have to iron. Putting up and taking down those large clumsy ironing boards, just to iron a collar on a shirt, is not easy.

, A fleece blanket is lightweight, easy to fold, easy to wash, and will keep them warm and comfy on those long, lonely winter nights.

,, Again, these are great for those who have had to downsize their homes or who can't easily get outside to hang up items on the outdoor clothesline. These lines range from 8 to 40 feet (2.4 to 12.2 m) of drying surface and the units mount in any small space, such as the laundry area, a mudroom, even in the bathtub/shower."

Avoid buying decorative items.,
Avoid purchasing large appliances.,
Get over the ""impersonality"" of vouchers.,
Ask.,
Reduce the amount and up the quality.,
Target voids and worn-outs.,
Consider homemade items as being just fine.,
Give of yourself.",How to Avoid Christmas Gift Mistakes," Unless your spouse or friend has specifically directed you to purchase ""that exact decorative thing"" for the house, just don't go there. It's way too personal and worst of all, it's blatantly invasive. Remember the stories about people scrambling around to find Great Aunt Jemima's ugly duckling sculpture whenever she visits only to have her thump through the door before they get it on display?! Maybe those aren't stories - maybe it's precisely what you do. The reality is that people don't want to feel obliged to include your idea of style with theirs. They already have a good notion of what they perceive as their style and without specific knowledge of how to add to that, you will end up causing guilt, distress, or thoughts of disposal!;
, You might feel you're being generous forking out $1000 on that coffee making super deluxe that requires at least half the bench space but sadly, unless it was asked for specifically, it's likely your generosity will cause intense discomfort. Assuming someone loves the appliance and its tricks as much as you do is problem number one. Problem number two is assuming they will be more than happy to make room for it in their already limited space. And problem number three is the reality that it's very hard to hide a large appliance and ""forget about it"". Don't be surprised if you find it on eBay come January.

, Vouchers are great. The reason is several fold: Vouchers give freedom of shopping expression. Vouchers oblige a shopping-shy person to go somewhere they might otherwise feel is beyond their budget or style and try out new ""somethings"". Vouchers take away the guilt, the misjudgments, the messiness of personal style infliction. And vouchers can be for services as much as goods: Services such as massages, spa visits, hair styling at expensive salons, movie visits, a ride in a balloon, a rock climb, etc. The wonder of service vouchers is that you can give something to people that they might not otherwise allow themselves to indulge in. How wonderful is that?!

, Surprise is for the vague and the wandering souls who hope gifts will bring them a sense of direction. There is no harm in asking someone directly what it is they'd really and truly appreciate as a gift for Christmas. If they appear uncomfortable, or worry about costs attached, make it easy by asking for a list of their wildest to their most frugal ideas. And assure them that something will be ""sorted"" as a result of that list! It can be very reassuring to both purchaser and recipient to know that the gift is truly wanted.

, When that nasty habit of making the Christmas tree appear as if it is swimming in gifts has overtaken your household each year, it's time to take stock and do a rethink. Quantity is not all that we might dream it to be; quantity often means a reduction in quality, a surfeit of dollar store fill-ins and a tendency to feel overwhelmed and worn out with the extent of gewgaws getting opened. As for watching children open too many gifts, that can be a wipeout of its very own, especially as they cease to remember who gave them what as the opening continues...

, A really fantastic gift is the one that replaces something much loved but worn out or on its last legs. It's even better where the gift replaces something that is broken but the owner never ""got around to buying a new one"". In the case of ""voids"", ask about missing items, such as the missing trousers amid the glut of t-shirts, etc. Fill the gaps and help create balance.

, Homemade food, homemade clothing, homemade kits, etc., make eminently suitable gifts provided you do a good job of them. The care lavished on them more than makes up for the lack of a commercial brand name and packaging. Great ideas include gift baskets of jams and jellies, homemade candies, screen-printed t-shirts, knitted scarves, eco-friendly cleaning kit (with printed instructions), homemade flavored alcohol or vinegars, etc.

, Give your time to do things such as repairs around the house, collecting the groceries, preparing the Christmas meal, babysitting, etc. For some families who travel vast distances to be with the wider family at Christmas, the mere fact of your presence is a gift, one that hides the realities of the costs of travel, accommodations, making arrangements for pets/plants at home to be cared for, etc. That in itself is a huge gift and reflects the focus on what Christmas spirit is really about–sharing time together for spiritual and emotional nourishment.

Purchase or recycle a small present.,
Assemble the items needed.,
Begin by wrapping the small item itself in the Christmas wrap.,
Put the item in a small box.,
Wrap the box holding the initial gift in wrapping paper.

,
Insert this small box into the next biggest box.,
Wrap this box.

,
Place this wrapped box into the next bigger box.,
Wrap this box.,
Snap a photo of the sheepish look when the recipient finally reaches the real gift.",How to Prank Someone with a Layered Christmas Gift," It's up to you whether you give something expensive or cheap. In this article, the gift is an iPod Nano but any small item is fine, including electronics, picture frames, clothing and trinkets such as key chains, tools and small toys, etc.;
, These are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"". The boxes can be of any kind; grocery boxes are just fine but if possible, have a decoy box for the second-to-last box prior to the real gift, just to ""double prank"" your recipient! (In this article, the iPad box serves as the decoy box, in which the iPod gets placed.) Bear in mind, though, that if you put a cheap gift in a box that suggests a valuable or much-desired gift, the recipient may be disappointed and upset - hopefully that's not the effect you want.


Check that the boxes each fit into one another. Just doing this by sight can be deceptive, so be sure to check that each box fits into each bigger box until your main, final box. If not, hunt around for more fitting boxes or visit your local grocery store for some more.

, In this example, an iPod.

, Since this prank is a ""double prank"" because the iPod is being inserted into an empty iPad box to make the poor recipient think that they've finally got to their gift of an iPad, the small first box is one in excellent shape. (This is a rather mean trick which you might prefer to avoid, and use a plain box or one that suggests some cheap contents.)

,,


At this stage, you may notice the potential for rattling to occur. If this is the case, include scrunched up tissue or newspaper, or foam peanuts. These will serve to prevent the box from moving, as well as being even more effort for your recipient to unwrap! Make use of such stuffing in every level of the wrapping where you're concerned about the potential for the gift to rattle around.

,,


For the purposes of this article, a box with a hole in its lid was chosen so that you could see the earlier box tucked safely inside. This is how the layering should look if you could see through the box with X-ray vision.

, At this stage, you've got the idea by now. Basically, continue the process of wrapping each successive box and placing it inside the next biggest box, adding stuffing if necessary, until you've reached the dimensions wanted.


You can also include additional layers of wrapping in between boxes, or every few boxes, to make it even more frustrating and effort inducing!

, Pin the photo up on the work bulletin board or family fridge with a caption for memories of a Christmas party that was a little more amusing than normal.


A video is also a great way to capture the mounting frustration slash excitement that builds with a layered Christmas gift!

"
Look for eco-friendly elements when purchasing your gifts.,
Know what not to buy.,
Consider the following list if you're stuck for ideas:

Make or bake your own - biscuits, cookies, cakes, candies, pickles, sauces, flavoured vinegars etc.,
Shop online for organic products and avoid the manic rush completely.",How to Choose Green Gifts for Christmas," The considerations that should guide your purchase are as follows. Look for:


Durable gifts - items that are of good quality and have a long lifespan
Think less materialistically – choose items that don't necessarily mean your recipient gets a ""thing""
Support the little guy - avoid big brands and supermarket chains; look in craft stores, cooperatives, farmer's markets etc.
Try second-hand - books, CDs, antiques, local market items etc. are unique and original ideas that can really be enjoyed by your recipient. Look for items that have long disappeared from our current trends and wow their socks off!;
, It is equally important to avoid certain things when choosing green gifts for Christmas. Here are some things to look out for and avoid:


Plastic, PVC, or unsustainable goods
Overly packaged items
Anything made from endangered wood
Gimmicks that are completely trend-driven

, are all wonderful gifts






Magazine subscriptions - look for ecological and ethical-minded magazines
Books - Scorched by Leonie Joubert; Boiling Point , also by Leonie Joubert; green books, DVDs about green issues etc. (add a sticker to DVDs that say ""to be shared around)






Clothing – hemp clothing is sustainable, it requires no pesticides, herbicides and little fertiliser; vintage clothing and locally made items from markets and organic clothing choices






Edible gifts - locally made or organic chocolate, local organic cheese and wine or an organic vegetable and fruit box delivery






Eco body care - look for organic, local and free of harmful chemicals. Local organic brands should be easy to find in your local health care stores
Green gadgets - solar-powered devices, wind-up radios, eco toys, torches, water clocks; look online for more ideas
Sustainable gifts - solar lights, low-flow shower heads, geyser timers and hot bags
Edible gardens - having your own organic vegetable garden and eating it is catching on fast. Why not sponsor the initial month or part thereof for someone you love?
Alternative transport - buy an electric bicycle or an electric scooter and help lower carbon emissions; buy several monthly bus or train passes to save them some money and encourage transportation use

, You can keep your car off the street and your head in a calm zone by doing this!

If you can't make cookies, but want your house to smell nice, you can get some scented candles or some christmas-y scented room spray. It makes your house smell like the holiday season, but without the mess!

, When you focus on the ornaments, and just on getting it done, it's not fun. But when you have fun, dance with the Christmas music, put a garland up, put little trinkets of Santa Claus, angels and whatnot. You will see, you will have fun.


Have other family members help with the tree.

, It doesn't matter if you put it up after you read this article, or in a few days, just get it up early. That way, you can decorate the tree and have fun with it, expressing your creativity and feeling like you are really into the spirit.

, Print it off the internet and sing the verses quietly to yourself at work, or at the store. Create your own Christmas song if you like.

, Go to stores like Macy's and Target and shop in the Christmas aisles. Have fun picking out what stuff you could possibly need. When you see other spirit around you, you're more likely to have that special feeling once again.

, This probably is the most important way to feeling happy. Make some cookies, and invite a few friends over, and watch a Christmas movie such as ""White Christmas"".


See if you can find a party to go to this year instead of organizing it all yourself. It makes for a nice change.

, But take time with the gift, wrap it, and make your own card, add a special poem or heartfelt Christmas greeting.

, Take time out. Go and do things for yourself now and then, to relieve the pressure of always preparing and being around frantic activity. You can't please all of the people all of the time, so don't even try; by taking breaks, you will feel refreshed and able to cope with difficult people all the more constructively., If you expect too much, you may feel disappointed. Instead, expect things to be low key and easy and you'll feel a lot calmer and happier about the season, being able to enjoy the experience more.


Realize that the commercialized version of Christmas is the marketer's dreams, not yours. Don't try to live up to that version and don't fall for thinking you need to buy happiness at Christmas time. Enjoyment does not mean expense.

, Laugh more, see the funny side of things, even more so when things don't go to plan. Be genuine in your mirth; forcing jolly feelings will feel artificial. That might just mean watching something that makes you laugh for real or taking time out to watch a frolicking puppy or your children at play.

Shop for them, not you.,
Get them something functional.,
Avoid artificially colored treats.",How to Give a Dog a Merry Christmas1," It may be tempting to buy your dog a Santa hat and a fur-trimmed Christmas sweater or a handmade ceramic food dish and holly-trimmed dog-biscuit jar, but these gifts are geared towards people’s pleasure, not pet’s. If you want your pooch to be merry, get them a gift that they’ll actually enjoy, like a treat or toy.Be sure to get toys and treats that appropriate to your dog’s size. For instance, if you have a Saint Bernard, you should go for durable toys that are designed for large breeds.
Pick toys that align with dog’s favorite activities. If they love to chew, get them a chew toy. If they love to play fetch, get them a glow-in-the-dark ball or a new frisbee.;
, If you’re going to get your dog a present, it may as well be something that they need or will put to regular use. Pet stores will be filled with seasonal gifts, but the wisest use of your money is to put it towards something they can use repeatedly, all year round.For example, if you notice that your dog’s plastic water dish is getting grungy, try giving them a stainless steel, non-slip bowl. If your puppy has outgrown their old bed, get them a new cozy sleeping pad.

, While pet companies roll out many a red and green treat over the holiday season, these Christmas-colored products are to attract you, the buyer, not your dog. Your dog does not care what color a treat comes in, so you might as well stick to ones that do not contain potentially harmful synthetic dyes, like Red 40.In fact, dogs can only see a limited amount of the color spectrum, which does not in fact include red or green."

Make your Christmas tree decorations dog-friendly.,
Keep electrical wires safe.,
Be sure to skirt your tree.,
Consider putting your tree out-of-reach.,
Keep decorative holiday plants out-of-reach.,
Avoid using candles.",How to Give a Dog a Merry Christmas2," Keep lights and breakable ornaments away from the bottom of the tree where your dog can reach them. Don’t string your tree with edible ornaments like popcorn, gingerbread, and/or candy that may be tempting to your pooch.Make sure that all fragile ornaments are fastened securely towards the top of your tree.
If you’re worried about a cherished ornament breaking, don’t put it on your tree. Relocate it to a less risky place where your dog definitely cannot reach or disrupt it, such as hanging from a window, doorway, or ceiling.
Avoid getting trees that have been flocked to make the branches look glittery or frosted since these chemicals are toxic to canines.

, Some dogs love to chew on cords. You can minimize the risk of your pet chomping on or playing with any loose wires by keeping extension cords short, taping any slack to the floor or wall, and hiding plugs and sockets behind the tree., The water that feeds Christmas trees can make a dog very sick if they lap any of it up. Many cut trees are chemically treated, and the stagnant water at the base of them can include run-off and toxic bacterial growth. Be sure to cover the dish with a tree skirt to keep them out of harm’s way.If you don’t have a tree skirt, cover the dish with aluminum foil, a thick cloth, or a thick plastic bag secured with tape.

, Eating pine needles or consuming tree sap can also be dangerous for dogs, causing mild to severe irritation to their mouths and digestive tracts. If your dog is attracted to your tree, it’s best to keep it out-of-reach by elevating it and/or putting a barrier around it.Fire screens and mobile fencing for kids or pets make good barriers.
You can also simply keep them out of the room with the tree when they’re unsupervised.

, Many wintry flowers and berries commonly displayed for the holidays are poisonous to dogs. If you do decorate with them, be sure to put them in a location that your pooch cannot get to, especially if they love to chew.Poinsettias, mistletoe, holly, lilies, and amaryllis are all toxic to dogs. They can cause mild to severe gastrointestinal, circulatory, and respiratory issues.
If your dog does get into one of these plants, contact your veterinarian and/or local poison control center immediately.

, Candles always pose a fire risk, but the risk’s much greater when you have a curious or rambunctious pooch around. Minimize any potential hazards by using flameless, battery-operated candles."
"
Include your dog in the festivities.,
Don’t feed your dog human holiday treats.,
Give your dog healthy Christmas dinner leftovers.,
Don’t leave potentially hazardous presents under the tree.,
Don’t overdo it with treats.",How to Give a Dog a Merry Christmas3," Even though the holiday season may be busy with parties and visits, remember not to neglect your dog. Organize family events so that your dog can be a part of them. Keep up with your dog’s daily exercise and feeding routines, so that they don’t get crotchety over Christmas.

, Many of our favorite Christmas foods are poisonous or dangerous for our canine companions. It’s best to not include your dog in the buffet line, feed them scraps, or leave food out where they can reach it.Common holiday foods that are toxic to canines include chocolate, macadamia nuts, grapes, raisins (and baked goods with raisins, like mince pies and fruit cake), alcohol, and sugar-free candy with xylitol.

, Your dog will thank you if you give them their share of the Christmas feast. However, try to keep their tasty scraps as plain and low-fat as possible.Boneless, skinless meat and/or fish without gravy, sauce, or dressing is a good option. Winter vegetables, like brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes, and green beans are also healthy eats for your pooch.
Avoid foods with butter and salt. Don’t give them foods that include onions, garlic, nuts, or alcohol.
Cooked bones from any roasted meat, turkey to lamb, are dangerous for your pet. Never let your dog chew on bones since splinters from them can perforate your dog’s digestive tract.

, It’s best practice never to leave food items under your Christmas tree. If you’re giving your aunt a box of truffles, be sure to stash that tempting-but-toxic gift well out of your dog’s reach, on a high shelf or in a closet.


Alternatively, never leave your dog unsupervised in the same room as the tree.

, If you’re giving your dog holiday goodies, be sure to adjust their normal feedings accordingly. That way, you can keep them at a healthy weight all year round. In general, treats should only account for 10% of their daily caloric intake."

Don't forget those who aren't home for Christmas.,
Don't leave this article as you found it but make it better.",How to Have A Memorable Christmas," Tired of the usual gift-giving rigmarole? Try giving to those who have little and check out your local charities or online charities. Many are providing the means for you to help others less fortunate by funding things they really need - school texts, animals for farming, water pumps for a village to have clean water. Once you have bought these gifts, wrap the information beautifully and put a family or friend's name on it and pop it under the tree. When they open it, spend some time sharing the story about how you bought it on their behalf, why you chose that gift and the benefits it will bring to others. In this way, you give and you also raise awareness amongst loved ones of the things that really matter at Christmas time - giving, understanding, sharing and caring about the human family.;
, A neighbour you have never talked to, watchman of the nearby shop or anyone. No one would say no to a gift wrapped in smile on a Christmas Day. Remember, it's not the value of the gift, it's the pleasant surprise you give them that add up to both your joy.

, Is there someone who is all alone this Christmas who could do with a family? Or is there a family member who has been left out in the cold for years following a family dispute or other problem? Christmas is a time to bury hatchets, to unfold our charitable spirit and share amongst all. Invite someone special to your Christmas dinner and share the warmth amongst each other all the while opening your heart and acting upon charitable intentions.

, Many people work until the moment of Christmas and miss out on the preparations leading up to it. Make an effort to take off one day or more if you can, to share time with the family making Christmas craft, food and decorating in a holiday theme together. Visit the stores together to shop and go and see a Christmas movie as a family. Take it easy for change and feel the spirit of Christmas rather than having it thrust upon you. Nothing makes memories last for longer than the memory of peace, tranquility, harmony and a slow pace all at once.

, Don't just listen to them - go and join them! Roam your local neighborhood singing songs of peace, love and joy to everyone around. Spread the spirit of Christmas directly.

, Go out and see what others are doing for Christmas. Some ideas include:


Buy tickets to a local theater troupe's play. All the effort of learning lines, rehearsing and caring to put a play on during the busy season deserves your attention and applause.
Take a walk and see your street's Christmas lights. Take a movie of what you see and add it to YouTube. Leave a notelet in your neighbor's mailboxes with the URL for them to check out their own street life at Christmas time as your gift to them. Just be sure to not show driver's plates or other identifiable information - keep it general.
Visit a hospital. Whether you visit the children or the other patients, Christmas is always a very hard time for patients and to see cheery faces of people coming to see how they are, perhaps with fresh fruit and a stuffed teddy or two, is always welcoming. Check at your local hospital for visiting hours.
Join the soup kitchen and ladle out some Christmas cheer to those who have nothing in your local community. Double bonus points if you do this and and you give the charity gifts mentioned in Step 1!
Have your neighbors over for Christmas brunch. They're almost family and why not do something new?
Visit local museums and public libraries. Look for Christmas storytelling sessions, for Christmas displays and Christmas themed activities that can provide you and your family with an opportunity to share in group activities with other people in your community and make the season feel even more joyous and shared.
Offer to help at a preschool or school Christmas party. Even if your kids have grown up and left, they can always do with helpers. And there is nothing quite like the joy on children's faces - time and time and time again to make you feel really good at Christmas time.

, There are people who cannot be home for Christmas - troops, scientists in Antarctica, doctors doing emergency duty, volunteers in refugee camps, a family member in hospital, an exchange student overseas and many other reasons. Show them you are thinking of them by contacting them the best way you can - phone them, e-mail them, YouTube them - any way that works best for you. Just make sure they are a part of your Christmas celebrations in your heart and mind and that they are aware of this.

Through different acts of meditation, you can help to calm the mind during the holidays.Use breathing exercises to help you concentrate. By focusing on your breath, you can reduce your mind's distracting thoughts.
Meditation exercises can help to release tension from the body. For example, when you breathe in, say to yourself, ""I am aware of my body."" Then breathe out and say to yourself, ""I release the tension from my body."" Repeat multiple times throughout the day.
Deep breathing can help to reduce anxiety in stressful situations. When you're feeling overwhelmed, take a deep breath and hold it for five seconds, then exhale slowly for five seconds. Do this ten times or until you feel relief.;
, While you may be ""playing host"" to a large gathering of family and friends, understand that your body and mind need rest. Leave yourself time each day to do nothing. Make sure to give yourself at least seven hours of sleep each night.It can be helpful to delegate tasks of preparation to others ahead of time so there is less on your plate to begin with.
Set aside time to sit and do nothing. If you're sitting on the couch and everyone is watching TV, close your eyes and rest for 5 minutes.
Avoid making plans or doing chores right before bed. Give yourself at least 30 minutes to wind down when heading to bed. Avoid your phone, computer, and TV during this time.

Avoid the rush when traveling.,
Be an active listener.,
Eat mindfully.",How to Be Mindful During the Holidays2," Traveling can be stressful and difficult during peak holiday times. Consider ways to travel during off-peak times during the holiday. Give yourself plenty of time. While the weather may make things difficult, focus on the journey rather than the destination.Avoid being impatient when traveling. Avoid negative talk. Focus on how you can making your travel time fun.
If traveling with friends or family, use this time to do games or activities together. Help your loved ones to see the act of traveling as part of the holiday experience. Bring small, travel-size games that you can play with your kids, friends, or family.
Plan ahead for ""down times"" when travel is slow or there is a delay.

, Minimize distractions by making conversations a priority. Don't have televisions, computers, phones, and other things on when you're trying to connect with your loved ones. Focus your eyes on the person talking, and pay attention to their body language.By giving your full attention, you are being present and communicating that you care.
Allow your loved ones to speak. Avoid interrupting them frequently. Engage in the moment by putting aside other activities in order to focus on them.
Show them that you're listening by nodding or asking questions about what they're saying. If it's a difficult topic of conversation, make them feel loved by saying, ""I appreciate you sharing that with me.""

, During the holidays, one of the main activities with friends and family is eating--lots of eating. This may be a special time where you eat some of your favorite dishes. While it's important to enjoy good food with friends and family, it's also important to savor each dish. Avoid stuffing yourself with sweets and fatty foods, just because they're there. Slow down when eating. Enjoy each bite. Put your fork down while chewing. Give your body time to tell your brain that you're feeling satisfied.
Make eating an event rather than mindlessly snacking in front of the TV or while talking on the phone. When people are gathered together for the holidays, each meal can feel special in this way.
Don't force yourself to eat a lot just because there is a lot of food being served. Fill your plate with smaller portions. Be present by choosing smaller amounts and filling up less often.

Be grateful.,
Show kindness.,
Love yourself and your loved ones.",How to Be Mindful During the Holidays3," Avoid dwelling on the negative aspects of the holidays. Though you may be confronted with stresses, there are likely an equal number of things to be grateful for. Practice gratitude by being aware of what you have, rather than what you don't.Take a short break during the day, and close your eyes. Think about three things that you are grateful for in your life. They don't need to be big things. Sometimes it's the smallest things that stick with you.
Share what you're grateful for. Some holidays, such as Thanksgiving, are built around the idea of giving thanks. Remember this on all the holidays you share with loved ones.

, Holidays can be hectic. People may act negative due to high expectations for family gatherings. Shoppers may feel stress with holiday costs, or wishing they could have more. Some people may feel isolated or depressed without their loved ones.Smile and be present during these tough times. Show that you care through the act of paying attention to someone else's hurt. Be empathetic.
Trying putting yourself in the shoes of someone who's having a tough time. Treat them as you would like to be treated.
Volunteering with or donating to the less fortunate can also be fulfilling and helpful.

, Being mindful is focusing on our thoughts and feelings without judgment. Loving yourself and others is about acceptance. Turn your thoughts away from guilt, envy, pain, or anger. Instead see what it means to be present and to take full account of this living, breathing moment.You don’t need to engage in stressful activities, such as shopping, just because everyone else is. Channel your passion into a homemade gift that also makes you feel fulfilled, such as baking cookies or writing a kind note.
By loving and caring for yourself, you will be better able to love and care for others.
Do things that fill your soul with love. This may be as simple as sitting out on the porch and waiting the sunset with your family, or building a fire when it's cold outside. Do activities that make you happy.
Turn your thoughts to the positive things you love about yourself and those around you. Think of at least three things that make you feel good about yourself.

Save up during the year.,
Discuss the financial issues openly with family members.,
Don't stress or mourn over lost times.,
Prepare healthy food in the right proportions.,
Emphasize the point of Christmas.,
Get the kids and the crafty people to make the wrap, cards, and tags.,
See the silver linings in a recession Christmas.,
Give to others more needy.,
Get an advent calendar.",How to Celebrate Christmas During a Recession," Although there are Christmas savings schemes available, it is usually better value and definitely more flexible to save your money into the bank (open a special online only account) and just add a small amount every week without fail. By Christmas time, this money is available for you to spend as you see fit, rather than having to accept the choices of a Christmas club.;
, This is not a time to keep up a pretense of wealth and ""anything goes"". Everyone knows when a recession happens, and although not everyone suffers equally, it is well understood that only the foolish spend money unwisely during such a time. Explain to family members that expectations in the gift department must be lowered for a recession Christmas but that this doesn't mean the tree will be bare. Instead, ask your family to come up with creative alternatives to spending a lot of money on gifts. Some examples might include:


Homegrown favorite herbs, flowers, citrus, ferns, etc.
Sewn items from aprons to eye pillows, using fabric already at home, or purchased at sales
Re-gifted items – gifts received during the year that were not wanted, duplicated, etc. can be re-given to those who will appreciate them
Baked goods – homemade candies, cakes, chocolates, cookies, preserves, jellies, etc. are ideal gifts. Not only are they tasty but family members can get really creative making these and team spirit can also prevail if several members get into the kitchen at once!
Coupons – for personal services. Offer to wash a car monthly for a year, to take the dogs for regular walks, to give a regular massage, to make a special meal once a month, to go hiking somewhere together, to have a picnic together, etc. There are just so many ideas of how you can gift your talents, expertise, skills, and labor to others that the only limit is your availability and willingness!
Photos - create a montage of family and friends; don't forget the pets! Or, take the time to arrange photos in an album for a family member who has never taken the time to do this.

, Excess is excess and if you really admit it to yourself, having more money to spend on gifts doesn't necessarily reduce the stress of obtaining them, and can in fact increase expectations and worries. Less money should equal less fuss and more thoughtful input from each purchaser.

, Many Christmas spreads overdo the food, and there are leftovers aplenty for days to follow. Skip that mentality and only make enough for the day; reduce the size of the poultry, reduce the expensive food items. Make better use of homemade food such as specialty bread, cookies, cake, baked nuts, etc. Use seasonal vegetables and fruit – these will be far cheaper than food shipped or flown in for the occasion.

, In case anyone has missed the real message of Christmas, recession time is an ideal time to reinforce this message. For those celebrating a faith-based Christmas, retell the stories of Jesus' life and the values he espoused about loving one another and not money. If you are celebrating a secular Christmas, the message is no less pertinent – rewatch the story of Scrooge in Dickens' A Christmas Carol to see where hoarding money and never truly giving leads to.

, Anything that can be made from paper should be made at home. Not only is this budget-conscious but it's way more fun than buying processed gift wrap and cards from the store. There are so many possibilities: drawings, photos, stickers, stamping, printing, finger-painting, collages, scrapbooking, recycling, etc. Get creative and get chatting with one another as you craft your cards and wrapping.

, When you all draw together and seriously address the need to reduce costs at Christmas, you can find your family gelling as a team and spending more time together problem-solving. This is a good outcome, and is a gentle reminder that money cannot buy all our needs.

, A very humble way to deal with Christmas in a recession is to look around at those worse off than you. There will always be many people in this situation. Ask your family for ideas of ways you might be able to help out; perhaps some members can spend Christmas morning helping to prepare Christmas food for the homeless at a local charity? Even if you're in very bad financial shape yourself (something you should not ignore but seek help for), you will benefit from reaching out to help others too; it gives a perspective to things that you won't otherwise get just thinking about your own troubles.

, This is a fun way to give yourself a little cheer.Some advent calendars are very inexpensive.A lot of times,they won't break your diet either.

Know what events occur.,
Attend masses.,
Attend the St Stephen's Day Races.,
Celebrate Women's Christmas.,
Consider using Irish Christmas decorations.,
Place a candle in the window.,
Lay the table.,
Hang a holly wreath.,
Take your decorations down on January 6th (Women's Christmas).",How to Celebrate an Irish Christmas," In Ireland, there are many Christmas events, like midnight masses and horse races. Some people make it their mission to attend every single one of these, so if you want an Irish Christmas, you'll have to too!;
, In Ireland there are many masses you can attend to celebrate Christmas.


Christmas Eve mass is held at midnight in most churches, where family and friends come together to meet in a church that's packed to the rafters.
Christmas Day mass is even more hectic, where most people with children tend to come at around 10 a.m., so expect madness with the church full to the brim with screaming babies and fed-up adults alike.
Go to as many masses as you can, as they are a great way for you to celebrate Christmas the Irish way.

, St. Stephen is the patron saint of horses, so it is only right that the biggest horse race of the year is held in Leopardstown, Dublin, on his feast day, December 26th. Over 20,000 people attend the race each year. Attend this race if you want to spend Christmas in Ireland the right way!

, On January 6th, Christmas celebrations are generally finished in Ireland. Tradition has it that women get a day off and men do all of the housework for the day. Many women go out and enjoy themselves shopping or having meals with friends. This comes from the ancient Christian Holy Day, the Feast of Epiphany, which is January 6th. Also, women were generally given time off as maids after Christmas was over long ago, so the tradition has held.


Women's Christmas is called Nollaig na mBan (Null-ig na man) in Irish.
Take the day off with your friends - if you're a woman, that is!

, Many traditional Christmas decorations come from Ireland, and also many weird ones!

, Leave a lit candle in the window on Christmas Eve, just before you go to bed. This candle is meant to symbolize a light indicating that Mary and Joseph were welcome to stay the night in the house. It also indicated a safe place to hold mass, because during Penal Times, this was not allowed.


Let the youngest family member lights the candle. In older times, only a girl named Mary (a very common name in former times) would extinguish the flame. Although the latter isn't required, this is a nice family tradition for you to do on Christmas.

, Set the table after finishing your Christmas Eve meal.


Put a loaf of bread filled with caraway seeds and raisins, a jug of milk and a large, lit candle on the table.
Leave your kitchen door open as a sign that Mary and Joseph are welcome to avail of the meal.
This also makes a great Christmas Day breakfast!

, Not many non-Irish people know this, but the holly wreath tradition originated in Ireland. This tradition comes from the way the poor used to decorate their doors with holly, because it was so abundant around Christmas time.


Place a holly wreath on your front door to show you're celebrating Christmas.
Decorate your wreath with berries, if it doesn't have them already.

, This is when Christmas celebrations usually end."
"
Delegate tasks.,
Try to book a day out with your family.,
Eat food that promotes a good sleep.,
Drink calming and soothing beverages.,
Meditate or sit in peace.,
Exercise some time during Christmas Eve.",How to Sleep Deeply on Christmas Eve1," If you're feeling overwhelmed, the worry can really eat you up and prevent sleep. Get everyone helping out with the cleaning, baking, cooking, wrapping, decorating and preparing, just so that you don't feel the stress as much. Each person will have something useful to contribute and it helps to make everyone feel involved instead of left out. And when everyone knows that all the preparations are in place, hopefully everyone will get a good night's sleep and feel happy about it.;
, Maybe go to the theatre, or the bowling alley. This will spend a whole day, and will make the time go fast (unless you don't enjoy it). By the time you get home, it will be at least 6pm if you go to the city or into town. Then think about what you have done during the day when you are lying in bed, instead of thinking about christmas day. This will make you eventually drift off to sleep. Remember, these are only tips, this may not work in all situations.

Recognize that keeping busy during the day is a good thing but only if you're productive and not simply running around in circles worrying. Check off everything on a To Do list and make the most of the time. If something is trivial or can be done another time, drop it.

, Food itself doesn't necessarily make you sleepy (unless you over-indulge) but there are some foods that are beneficial at helping you to fall asleep better. These include foods rich in vitamin B, calcium, magnesium, essential fatty acids and the amino acid tryptophan. Indeed, tryptophan is used by your brain to make sleep-inducing chemicals, in combination with the previously mentioned nutrients. You might want to forget about the beer or cider or wine you are having tonight as this will keep you awake (or anything of fizzy matter). Therefore, for your meals and snacks, have some of these soporific foods:

Potatoes (boiled, mashed, baked or steamed); avoid fatty versions such as fries or roasted potatoes







Sliced banana on wholemeal toast or bread






Dates as a snack
Wholegrain bread with lettuce.
If you know that certain foods cause you to have an upset tummy, avoid having these during Christmas Eve because a rumbling or sore stomach will likely keep you awake.
Don't eat a heavy meal on Christmas Eve; keep all meals light and easily digestible.

, Warm milk is ideal to help induce sleep or a chamomile tea if you don't like milk. Avoid alcohol, which can make it harder to fall asleep or can cause poor sleep with periods of waking during the night, leaving you unrefreshed the next morning.


Other herbal teas of benefit in aiding sleep include lime flower, catnip, lemon balm and hops.Celery seed or valerian teas can also be beneficial.
Be sure to empty your bladder before bedtime. Waking up during the night might lead to an inability to fall back asleep again because you know you are awake and you know it is Christmas, this will make you excited and unable to sleep thinking about it and you might start worrying about money again.
To make a soothing bedtime drink, add 1 tbsp honey and 1/8 to 1/4 tsp nutmeg to a mug of hot milk and drink right away.

, If you like meditating, use it on Christmas Eve to calm your nerves and to restore a sense of balance. Meditation can be beneficial after you've been rushing around a lot, worrying about things like family feuds and budgets or feeling overwhelmed. It will give you the energy and space to focus better and also help you to handle excitement or stress by putting the extreme feelings into perspective. If you don't know how to meditate, simply find a spot to sit in peace and reflect calmly. Stop doing everything you're doing, stop fidgeting, worrying, doing. Simply sit and give yourself 15 minutes of time out from everything to relax. Any method that dulls the stress and excitement will help to prevent sleeping problems.

, Exercise for about 30 minutes will help to prepare your body for sleep. Just be sure to avoid vigorous exercise in the last 3 hours before bedtime, as you don't want to be hyped up. An evening walk, run or dog walk is a good way to get some last-minute exercise in.

Nail the costume.,
Get the Santa Attitude.,
If you are going to interact with children, make sure you do it right.,
* Say to the child, ""That's right, son / sweetie.,
* Fight for your Santa right.,
Never yell, swear, or get angry at any children that come sit on your lap.,
Buy a big red sack and fill it with candy canes.",How to Be a Good Santa Claus," A red Santa hat, a red jacket with some white fur on it, a black belt, red pants with white fur on the bottoms, and a pair of black boots is great. If you do not already have a long, white beard, do not forget it. Buy one that is as realistic as possible.;
, He is always smiling, so you should never be frowning. Smile, laugh, and ""ho ho ho"" as much as possible. Some people feel self-conscious about acting so jolly, but if you have a great costume on, people will not know it is you anyhow. Also be sure to speak in a deep, jolly voice to sound like Santa.

, If they are sitting on your lap, make sure to ask them what they want for Christmas. Give them a hug or a high five. You can also give a thumbs up. Children love that stuff. Some will present the problem of saying, ""You're not the real Santa."" You can deal with this problem 1 of 2 ways.

, I'm just a stand-in. The real Santa is busy making toys for all you boys and girls in his workshop in the North Pole, so he asked me to come down and visit you."" This works pretty well, especially if you have a fake beard because sometimes, that occasional bratty child will try to rip off your fake beard to prove you are not Santa., Tell the child, ""Of course I'm the real Santa! Ho ho ho!"" and give him a candy cane so he won't say anything else that could blow your cover., It is the number one rule of being a good Santa. Santa loves children!

, If you are having children sit on your lap or take a picture with you, give them a candy cane from your sack after each child tells you what they want for Christmas and / or take a picture with you. The children love it. If you are at an adult Christmas party, bounce around happily and give candy canes to random adults. Add a ""Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!"" In there, and you will most likely make them smile.

"
"(Children) Plan to go to bed by at least 9 because this will make sure that you are comforted and ready for sleep, even if you don't go to sleep till later, you are relaxed.,
Plan to go bed at least by midnight.,
Slow down before bedtime.,
Take a warm bath.,
Place soothing scents under your pillow.,
If you find yourself too agitated to sleep, get up and do something different for a half hour.,
If you find yourself unable for any of these to work.",How to Sleep Deeply on Christmas Eve2,", Staying up too late baking, making and shaking won't help your energy levels on Christmas Day. Moreover, you risk making mistakes once you're too tired–– you don't want to mix up Great Uncle Jorge's hearing aid with young Briony's Bratz doll or burn the cookies. Going to bed around 10 or 11 will ensure a restful night's sleep.


If you attend Midnight Mass, try to have a nap around midday on Christmas Eve. It'll help give you the energy needed and then you can get a good night's sleep upon returning home from Mass, (or have a sneaky lie in on Christmas morning - better if you don't have kids).
Ensure that your room is dark and quiet. Light and noise streaming in can prevent you from sleeping. Also, make sure that the room is nice and airy with windows open because this can help you sleep better with fresh oxygen in your room. If you get cold, close them but staying cool can help you get to sleep quicker (not too cold though).

, Rather than racing around finishing last minute touches, be satisfied with what you've already done and leave any leftover chores to the early morning, when you'll feel more awake. Avoid watching TV or listening to head-banging music; you need to relax into a sleeping mindset.


Get one of your favorite blankets and curl up with a good book. Preferably choose a book that takes your mind off all the excitement and/or worry about the next day. i.e make sure you don't read Christmas books or watch Christmas movies as this can cause in excitement.
Spend time with a pet. Dogs are great cuddle buddies, so are cats! Take your dog for a walk––it'll take your mind off things and get some good exercise in.
Call, text or visit friends. They're probably feeling similar to you and the distraction can be helpful. However, if you sense that your friend is too busy, don't keep them too long or you might increase their stress levels if they feel obliged to keep talking to you.

, A warm bath before bedtime can sooth and relax you enough to aid sleep. The addition of a calming bath oil such as lavender will heighten the effect. (See ""Tips"" below for more bath oil suggestions.)

, To help with sleep, use herbs and scents that have been traditionally associated with sleeping aids. Add some lavender scent or a lavender filled sachet to your pillow to release its odor when you place your head on it. Other suitable herbs include lime flower, chamomile, catnip, lemon balm and hops., For example, go into another room and read or do some yoga poses. Keep the lights low and avoid doing anything stimulating like watching games or sending messages on Facebook. Avoid the temptation to go and do more Christmas preparations or you might end up not going back to bed. You can also keep yourself distracted by telling yourself 'the faster I go to bed the quicker I get presents'. Say that over and over, kind of just like counting sheep. So hopefully you get a  good night's rest. One more thing that you can do is set an alarm clock and say 'the faster I go to sleep the more hours of sleep I get', just in case the part about present keeps you even wider awake. Now when you do the timer, your brain is racing to get to sleep because, your brain assumes that if you don't get sleep you will lose the race. Time your activity and return to bed a half hour later, hopefully distracted enough to fall asleep now.

, Talk to your teddy (children) about your holiday that might be coming up or talk to the teddy about something other than Christmas. If you are an adult, talk to your partner or get them to snuggle up with you somewhere."

Consider putting up a simplified Christmas tree.,
Keep your decorations centered around the birth of Christ.,
In order to instill good values of gift-giving and sharing, buy gifts for the less fortunate.,
Keep your entertainment relevant to the origins of the holiday.,
Inform your family and friends early on in the year that you plan on changing your Christmas celebrations.",How to Celebrate a Strictly Religious Christmas," The origins of the modern-day Christmas can be linked back the tree of Thor that was cut down as an act of Christianity to prove the Norse Gods weren't real and there is only one true God.;
, Avoid things such as reindeer, Santa Claus, and similar items. Keep your household decorations more ""spiritual"" and relevant to the holiday. Good ideas include a nativity scene, depiction of angels, and stars. Candy canes can be used to represent the shepherds that were told of Christ birth. Images of Christs life can help you reflect on him this holiday season and the green represents His love year round, not just seasonally.

, Christ commonly sat with the beggars and sinners. Instead of purchasing gifts for family and friends that are hot trends, consider spending the money on gifts or donations that help them, like a Bible they can read about Christ's life, or new church clothing. Donate to charitable organizations for those less fortunate. Many families also choose to donate their time, as well as money, by volunteering in soup kitchens and homeless shelters.

, Avoid music and television programs that center on the more commercialized aspects of Christmas (again, such as reindeer, Santa Claus, and so on). Unfortunately, this may prove more and more difficult as time passes. Consider purchasing your own music and movies for your personal collection.

, Let them know what and why you have chosen to change your pattern.

"
Start with the obvious: look in basements, in the trunk of their cars, under beds, on top of shelves.,
Examine any suspicious boxes or bags for company or store names as shipped boxes may have a return address.,
Don't look just at the biggest present.,
If you asked for something unusual, consider what they may ask you of this item (where do you get it, what does it do, who else has it...).,
Question siblings.,
Check bags for store receipts.,
If still stumped, think about your parents' shopping habits.,
If you have a friend owning something you requested (especially something your parents are unfamiliar with), they may call your friend's parents to ask them about it.,
Sometimes parents are just last minute shoppers-maybe they haven't gotten you anything yet (there's always Christmas Eve)!

,
The hardest gifts are the ones your parents keep at your neighbor's house.,
Parents often leave presents in the car trunk.,
Though trickier, you can also peek at wrapped gifts.,
When they are out, check your parents' Internet history to see if they bought or looked at what you asked for.

,
If you have sheds at your house, or you live on a farm, it is possible that gifts will be hidden there.

,
Take a DVD box and compare to gifts of similar size.,
Feel the boxes of the presents you want, make sure you feel all the soft spots and where exactly they were.,
If you know how to enter your parent's email/texts do so.,
Listen out for subtle slip ups your parents might make that could give away the secret.,
Make sure to ""borrow"" all of the supplies that you'll need to open the gift.

,
Make sure you know or have the same wrapping paper as the present, and a lot of it, so you won't have to get caught not being able to wrap it back!

,
Pad the box with pillows so your parents won't hear the rattling while walking around.

,
Put the tape at the bottom.

,
Put the scissors next to the tape.

,
Next on top is the wrapping paper.,
Also on top place the letter opener, flash light, the paper clips and a blanket.

,
Open your gift.,
Carefully part the gift wrap, making sure not to tear it.

,
Look at your gift.,
Now, the skilled tape applying: Put strips of tape over cut tape, to hide evidence of cut tape.

,
Put away the gift for now, if you don't like it.,
Once you remember it, like it, and got details, you need to wrap the present all over again.,
Put all the borrowed supplies back exactly where you found them or your parents will suspect something.

,
If you have a bagged present, then this is easy as pie!,
You said something like, ""I want a new camera someday."",
If you gave them a Christmas list, look for it they might have crossed out what they already bought.

,
Look in the garage.

",How to Figure Out What Your Parents Got You for Christmas," Parents are usually busy and may not have time to hide presents well.;
, If you wanted something from that company, you can get a pretty good idea of what might be inside.

, They may have bought you tickets to a show you really wanted to go to, or bought you a voucher for a shop you really love. Think about what you want. If you want a car, it will be big, but if you want to go to have your ears pierced, they may just give you a card saying that's what you are going to do.

, This means they are at least thinking about buying it.

, A classic maneuver. Arrange an exchange of information if you must-this is often the case with older siblings.

, They may have information about recent purchases.

, Did they most likely order your gifts online or did they store-buy? If online, check the order history on their online accounts. Amazon.com keeps lists of all of one's orders-a real jackpot. Most smart parents know what you're trying to do so be VERY sneaky!

, This is a huge clue, but is also easily hidden by parents.

,, That includes dogs, bikes, etc. While hard to get clues, try to find where your parents are stashing these gifts, like if your Mom stops at a neighbor's house after shopping.

, Usually they keep them there for awhile--for the opportunity to sneak it home or to a neighbor's house. You may be able to sneak a peek at the trunk when you go to the garage for some bogus reason.

, This requires some skill and is not for the untrained.

,,, If it rattles, bingo, you've got a disc. It could be a DVD or a video game, especially if that's what you wanted. This is a good, non-invasive method.

, When you get home, feel the boxes wrapped up under the tree, feel the edges and for soft spots, if you know where all the creases of the box, you should know what present it is.

, Sometimes you could find conformation emails or even have your parents talking about it(ex. Have you bought (your name)'s Xbox yet?)

, For example, if they are thinking about getting you a DVD, they may ask you if your DVD player still works. If they are going to get you a TV, then they may ask you ""Can you plug your into new TVs?"". Similar clues are very easy to spot for more technical gifts that your parents don't understand as well as you do (but may be obvious for other gifts also), and while a clue like this is by no means a guarantee of the gift, it's usually a pretty good indicator of it.,,,,,, Then the screwdriver.

,, Use the scissors to cut the tape.

,, Admire your gift.

,, You can replace it. If you didn't replace, keep reading:

, Use the same wrapping paper your parents used, and try to wrap the paper the same way as your parents did. Once it is back, put the present back where you found it.

,, Just take out the tissue paper carefully and put it back when you're done.

, Remember stuff you wanted and your parents wanted to get you that for Christmas.


Your parents always refresh their minds on Christmas on what to get you.

, Tuck your trousers into your boots so you can show off the white fluffy trim on your boots.

, If your belly doesn't quite wobble like a bowl full of jelly, you can bring it up to Santa's standard by adding some padding. Tie with a bow on both sides.

, Put on a red jacket to match the trousers. The furry borders around the sleeves and the hood keep Santa Claus warm on a cold Christmas Eve. Of course, if Santa's doing the rounds of the Southern Hemisphere, make sure the jacket is lightweight so that Santa doesn't overheat.

, Add a wide black leather belt with a gold buckle over your jacket. This should be quite tight so that your tummy spills over it slightly.

, If you are wearing long sleeves underneath your jacket, make sure they are completely hidden and tuck them up out of sight. You should also take off your watch if you are wearing one, unless it is authentically in the style of St. Nick.

, You've got the suit right but you probably still look a little too young to be the real Santa Claus. If you don't have a real beard already or the time to grow one, wear a fake white beard and moustache. The elastic should sit at the back of the head near your crown. Fix your beard so you can see your mouth just below your moustache.

, Wear a wig of wavy white hair to go with your beard. You should be starting to feel quite jolly around about now.

, Santa Claus is a very old man so his eyesight isn't what it used to be. Wear some half moon spectacles at the end of your nose. Don't push them too high up your nose so that you can peer over them and look down at children who come to see you with bright, happy eyes.

, Put on a bright red hat with white fluffy trim. Hold the rim at the front and slide the back over your head. Let the pom pom dangle down at one side over your shoulder.

, To complete the look, slip on some white gloves to hide any signs that you're not the real Father Christmas.

, Finally, put your hands on your belly or rest them on your belt buckle and let out your best ""Ho Ho Ho!""

, Example:


Get the Christmas feast groceries
Get presents December 2nd
Wrap presents
Get good treats

, Get your boss a good present too, this may increase their ""kindness.""

, When eating Christmas dinner and the turkey on Christmas day -- it isn't complete without the crackers, novelties, paper hats, mottos and jokes. And don't make the meal gross, like cranberry sauce mixed with squash and mashed potatoes.

Decorate your house fancifully for Christmas. No cheap lights. It should look like the house in ""The Nutcracker."" Make paper snowflakes and hang them everywhere. Put candles in the window and use small white Christmas lights. There are lots of nice things to buy in Christmas catalogs.
Have Christmas music playing at your home. It may also help if you play music from the Nutcracker, which can be found on iTunes and at the play. You have probably heard it in previews for Christmas films.

You need to sneak downstairs without anyone hearing you. Even though it is fun to have someone come with you (like a sibling or cousin) be warned that you two are more likely to be heard.
Plan ahead. Make a map of your house and living room. Mark all the spots where the floor or stairs creak, etc. Map your route, emergency escape route, and hiding spots in case someone goes down to check what is going on.
Make a Santa Cam. First, get a shoe box and spray-paint it a Christmas color. Put a bow on top. Make sure it looks like a real present. Then get a video camera. Put it in the shoe box, mark where the lens touches the box (this can be done by painting the rim of the lens with washable watercolor paint and pressing it against the box)and cut it out with a cardboard box cutter. The camera should be concealed in the present. Make sure the hole points towards the fireplace. Turn the camera on so it films all night.
If you are willing to stay up all night and want to watch the fireplace live while being hidden, here is what to do: Ask a person who knows how to use a camera show you how to show how you can see what you filmed on a television. This is done by turning the mode to VTR and plugging it into the television with a cable that has red, white and yellow ends into the sockets of those colors. Hide the television (which should be small) somewhere near if you don't have one in your living room. Now you can watch the fireplace hidden away.

Don't get caught!,
Do your homework.,
Start with the obvious places.,
Move on to the other rooms, no matter how innocent they may appear.,
Search areas that aren't part of the main house.,
Look inside your parents’ cars.,
Search your parents’ workplace, especially if they own their own business.,
Check your relative or neighbor’s house.,
If all else fails, search for receipts.",How to Find Christmas Presents That Your Parents Have Hidden1," The first rule of present-peeking is that you search only when you’re sure your parents won't catch you. Preferably, search while they’re out. If that’s not an option, search while they’re busy elsewhere in the house. It helps to have a quick place to hide if you hear someone coming.;
, No, not your math, your sleuthing homework. Take photos before you search an area, using either a camera or cell phone. Snap a few pictures of how everything is arranged before you touch any of it.


When you’re done snooping, use the pictures to put everything back in its right place. It’ll be like you were never there.
Be sure to delete the photos when you’re finished!

, Your parents’ bedroom is the most likely candidate, so start in the closet and under the bed (some parents are careless like this). Then move on to hall closets, high shelves, or anything that’s out of reach.


Check inside bags. If your presents aren’t wrapped (or your parents are sneaky), there might be goodies inside plain paper and plastic bags.
Look inside rooms that are suddenly locked around Christmas. Look through the keys on your parents’ key chains. Indoor locks (the kind with just the small hole in the knob) are just privacy locks, and can usually be opened with a tiny screwdriver.
If your parents like spy movies, make sure they haven't put a piece of tape or something in the door so they can tell if somebody opens the door.

, A really crafty parent might even hide things in your own bedroom! Search all nooks and crannies, including cabinets, closets, vents, and the spaces between sofa pillows. Don’t disregard anything if you really want to find those presents!

, Look in the storage room, basement, garage, sun-room, attic, shed, or storm cellar if you have one. Look under the deck or patio as well.

, Your parents might be keeping gifts there until they think it’s safe to bring them inside. Don’t forget to check the glove box.


Also look in roof or bike storage units. They may be locked, but usually the key is easy to find where they always keep their keys.

, Only do this if your parents bring you to work for some reason. Be very careful not to get into important documents or any of their coworkers’ things; this might get you into real trouble.

, If your family is very close with friends or family members who live nearby, your parents might have kept your presents with them for safekeeping. Only try this if you’re going to be over there anyway; never try to sneak in uninvited. Again, don’t search any areas that might get you into trouble (ex. bedrooms or home offices).

, These could be in the dresser, the car, mom’s purse, or dad’s wallet. You might also find a product description or purchase confirmation in your parents’ email or internet history if they bought your presents online.
. Also try to look for plastic bags that may reveal where they went shopping.


Be extra careful if you decide to snoop on your parent’s computer: this is a serious violation of privacy and can ruin your entire family’s Christmas.

Check out the box.,
Shake the box.,
Beware the large box.,
Dig deeper.,
Put it all back together.",How to Find Christmas Presents That Your Parents Have Hidden2," If it's almost square and about 5-inches (140 mm) long, it's obviously a CD. If it's sealed tight, don't try to open it—wrapping paper can tear very easily. Just think about saying anything to your parents about your favorite CD that you want, and that's probably what it is.


If it's a long rectangle that's not too deep, it might be clothes. If there is any gap in the paper, you might be able to see the color of the box, and at least figure out where they were shopping.
A box that is larger on the bottom, and has a really skinny top, is usually a game of some sort. If there's a second, smaller box taped to the the outside, it's probably batteries for the game.
If the box is about the size of a shoe box, the way to make sure is to feel around the sides of the box, near the top. If there's a lip, you can be pretty certain you have new shoes.

, Does it make any rattly noises, or can you feel something move inside when you shake? If it does, try to describe what you hear. If you hear chime sounds, it might be a music box; if you hear thumps, it could be something inside something else. If you hear broken glass, put the box down!

, Parents are tricky—often times, they will put a small box inside a larger box, especially if the shape of the small box would give up the secret of what's inside.


If the box is large, but is not very heavy, you can be pretty sure it's not packed with clothing, books, or other weighty things.
Truly clever parents will nest smaller boxes inside larger boxes if they catch you snooping. You'll open one box, and find another and then another. Your Big Present may actually turn out to be a gag gift, like a magic decoder ring, or some other silly stocking stuffer.

, If the paper wrapping the present is slick and shiny, you can try peeling off the taped ends. Take great caution with this—wrapping paper tears easily, and unless you have more, you could ruin your sleuthing expedition.


Peel off one end only, if you can. If you manage to loosen up one end, you'll be able to get a peek at the sides of your present.

, Referring to your snapshots, return everything to its original position, seal up any presents you opened and have a Merry Christmas!

Consider your own feelings.,
Find out what inspired the question.,
Ask what the child believes.,
Follow your child’s lead.","How to Deal With the ""Is Santa Claus Real"" Question1"," You may be uncomfortable perpetuating the Santa story or feel discomfort about lying to your child, and those are legitimate concerns shared by many. On the other hand, you may want your child to believe in something whimsical and magical, like Santa. How to deal with the Santa Claus story is a personal decision that can only be made by your family.Remember, though, that even if you do not share the Santa story in your own family, your child might still come to you with tricky questions about Santa.;
, Perhaps they heard something at school or they have thought about the Santa story and it doesn't completely make sense. Acknowledge the question and praise them for their critical thinking. This is actually a positive developmental step. Determining their reason for asking will help you figure out the best way to proceed.You might give this question some thought before it ever comes up, so that you are not caught completely off guard. This will help you respond more thoughtfully and slowly, rather than be reactionary.
Ask your child very plainly, ""Why do you ask?"" or ""Where is this question coming from?"".

, Just because the child is asking questions doesn't necessarily mean that they are emotionally ready to believe the truth. They may just be curiously probing. Asking what your child believes will give you an idea of where they are emotionally and cognitively. If your child indicates that they still believe in Santa, despite any outside doubts, it's likely not time to tell them the truth yet.Respond to your child’s question with a simple, ""Well, what do you believe?"" This allows them to reflect on what they think and whether or not they believe in Santa Claus.

, When your child answers your question about what they believe, they will tell you that they don’t think Santa is real, or that they do but that they have questions. This answer should guide how you proceed and you can either tell them the truth about Santa or let them continue to believe.


They may also say that they do believe the story of Santa Claus, but are confused about something specific in the Santa story, such as how he gets around the world in one night, or fits all of the presents in one bag. Just reiterate whatever you’ve already told them and answer questions as best as you can.

",How to Cut Christmas Expenses when You Have Children," Even if you weren't buying $200 electronics for everyone, costs add up quickly at Christmas. If you saved the receipts use them but if not try to reconstruct your spending from memory. Include everything, from gifts and tree decorations to the food.;
, Figure out what areas won't get as much money spent on them this year. Will gifts be less expensive? Will you not go to the ballet or orchestra this year?

, Unless your children are infants you will have to talk to them and let them know you're not spending as much this year. Tell them early, before Thanksgiving would be preferred, but as early as possible. Don't tell them when they're in a bad mood, and never use it as a type of punishment or as the ""winning"" statement in an argument. Children understand much more than we give them credit for, so just be honest about why you want to cut costs. Have you lost your job? Do you hate the commercialism? Do you think your family has lost sight of everything but gifts?

, TV, magazines, books, movies, every time we turn around we are bombarded with the idea of a ""perfect"" Christmas. The next time you catch yourself saying wistfully ""Oh, wouldn't that just be great if our Christmas was like that,"" take note. Often times, the decorations you see, these perfect rooms, would look ridiculous in real life. It may look pretty in pictures, but who wants to have to fight their way through 15 holiday throw pillows to find the couch? If Uncle Greg didn't get drunk and go on his rant about the government every year, wouldn't it be just that little bit sadder? Embrace your family's quirks and oddities, and realize that what you see from the media is only carefully crafted images, not real rooms or real people.

, Everyone celebrates Christmas for different reasons. Some people celebrate time with family, some celebrate hope and the renewal of light, others celebrate Jesus. It is entirely up to you why you celebrate it. Once you have figured out why you celebrate, try to incorporate that into your holiday more than anything else. If you celebrate for family, perhaps you should have a potluck together and forgo gift giving. If you celebrate for Jesus, perhaps you should go to church more often in December, or make a bigger deal out of it.

, Make a list of everyone you bought presents for last year and how much you spent.


Gifts for extended family. Do you buy gifts for all your relatives, even the ones you never see? Talk to your family about gift giving and have some solutions at the ready. Would a gift exchange where everyone only buys for one person work? Would eliminating gifts for everyone over 16 be the solution? Talk it over and set price limits for gifts as well. Nothing over $10 is common for gift exchanges. If they insist that you buy gifts for everyone, simply say it won't be happening this year.
Gifts for friends. Do you and your friends buy each other expensive gifts every Christmas? Talk about other solutions with them. Instead of buying gifts for each other, perhaps you should all go out for lunch or coffee?
Gifts for everyone else. Do you give gifts to everyone who enters your home during the holiday season, as well as the mail carrier, garbage man, paper boy, and every other person you meet? Often this type of gift can be eliminated completely. If you don't know them well enough to buy them a gift and give it to them as you would a friend, why are you buying gifts for them at all? While it's nice to thank service people for the jobs they do, if you do insist on giving them gifts keep it small and not homemade. A bag of m&ms or Christmas candy would be plenty, and wrapped candies can be bought in bulk and distributed amongst all of them.
Gifts for your significant other. Do you and your significant other exchange expensive gifts? Would you be happier hiring a babysitter and giving yourselves the gift of a night on the town?

, Set up a budget just for gifts for your children with your significant other. It doesn't have to be large, only make it what you can afford or what you want to spend. Stick to your budget no matter what! So your son won't get that new computer, and your daughter won't get the $300 makeup kit. Alright, they'll survive. Consider instead


practical gifts. They may not be as much fun, but if you know they're going to need new clothes or toothbrushes or backpacks anyway, give them to the children as gifts. This doesn't mean they have to be boring. Perhaps the toothbrushes can be glittery, and the backpacks can have pins the children can arrange themselves.
Crafting gifts. Craft supplies for younger children are often very inexpensive. It wouldn't cost much to fill a bag with crafty supplies for a young child. If one of your children enjoys sewing, often interesting and inexpensive fabric can be found in thrift stores in the form of sheets and shirts or dresses.
Handmade gifts. Use your talents whenever possible! If you're handy with a sewing machine, maybe you could make the child who enjoys cooking an apron, or a new shirt or pajamas. Hats, scarves, and mittens are popular gifts and not too difficult if you can knit or crochet.
Experience gifts. Most people find they don't remember the gifts they received as a child in any case, so give your kids the gift of an experience with you! You can make coupons or gift certificates easily by hand or on the computer. Make them valid for one dinner of the child's choosing, a day spent just with you, a trip to the zoo, or for one night of a later bedtime.

, So you always buy an enormous turkey, only a little gets eaten, then you're stuck with leftovers for two weeks before you finally throw the rest out. Why bother? Consider every item that goes on the menu carefully. Will it get eaten? How much do you really need? Would one kind of pie be plenty, even though you usually get three? Do you need to make 15 batches of cookies? Try to use coupons whenever possible and keep an eye out for sales.

, Do you need new decorations, or are the ones from last year still in perfect condition? Do you need to buy a live tree, or would spending a little extra on a fake tree that will last for years be a better plan? Are live greens for the mantel and wreath necessary? Inventory all of your current Christmas decorations and plan where you'll put them long before you head for the decorations isle. Most Christmas decorations can be used year after year, but if you need new ornaments, why not let the children make them? It will be much more fun, the ornaments will have more meaning, and it will cost less!

, Maybe instead of a full tree, you'll cut a branch from one of your own trees and stick it upright in a pot. Maybe you'll cluster the houseplants together and decorate those, or perhaps the lonely stuffed animals in the attic will get a second life as decorations, with festive ribbons around their necks. Don't get caught in thinking ""traditional"" decorations are the only way to go. Be creative!

, No one wants to skimp at Christmas and make their donations to others be the place that suffers. But sometimes, if you're donating hundreds of dollars to several organizations, that's where the cutting has to be done. Especially if you're in a money crisis, it's important to consider where you and your family stand as well. That's not to say you should give up donations all together! Certainly still give. Just cut your donation sizes down, and give only to a few charities you really admire. You can also donate your time to them, which is something that's just as necessary as money, but won't cost you anything but the gas or bus fair to get where you need to go!

, Skiing trip on the 11-14th, the symphony on the 15th, The Nutcracker on the 17th, a Christmas production on the 20th. During Christmas there's a lot going on that costs money to get into. Pick only the ones that you and your family ALL enjoy and that you can afford.

, With all this cutting down and cutting back, kids can feel like it isn't really Christmas. Don't think spending less money and having less fun go hand in hand. There are lots of fun, inexpensive things that you can do as a family to still have a wonderful holiday season. Some ideas are:


Make a gingerbread house, and don't fuss over it looking perfect.
Make a batch of cookies and let everyone have one cookie they can decorate any way they want - even if that means an inch and a half thick layer of frosting or half a jar of sprinkles.
Look at Christmas lights. You can drive around looking at them or just take a walk through your own neighbourhood in the evening.
Turn off all the lights except for the ones on the tree and sit around together, talking. Tell them what Christmas was like when you were a child. Have everyone share favorite Christmas memories, what their favorite gift received was, what the perfect gift they gave someone was.
Go to a public library and check out Christmas themed books. You may have to place them on hold early in the season. Read one book every night until Christmas, of course finishing with Twas the Night Before Christmas on Christmas Eve.
Watch Christmas specials and movies together. Don't worry about renting them, just watch the ones you already have or the ones that are on TV.
Have everyone (including you!) write a letter about what they hope the new year brings. Maybe someone's looking for love, or a new job. Maybe they just want to go to the movies. Fold the letters up and hide them. Put them away with the Christmas decorations and read them again next Christmas Eve. It lets everyone see how they've grown and changed.
Look online for Christmas crafts that are age appropriate for your children. Many of them can be made with items most people already have at home.

, If this Christmas didn't go how you wanted it to, don't give up! Any change in Christmas can seem like a big deal, and sometimes the changes we make we realize we hate. Maybe you've learned it really is important that you have Grandma's peach cobbler on Christmas, or that you go to see The Nutcracker. But you have learned, and now you're better prepared for next year!

Tell the historical story of Santa.,
Explain various traditions.,
Prepare for an emotional response.,
Choose a middle ground.","How to Deal With the ""Is Santa Claus Real"" Question2"," If you feel your child is ready for the truth, there are different ways to approach the conversation. Explaining who ""Santa"" really is rather than simply saying he isn’t real can help make the transition a lot easier. Whether you’re religious or not, explaining to your child how Santa Claus came to be as we know him today and the history of the tradition, all the way back to the real Saint Nicholas, may lessen any disappointment they feel and encourage them to help others.You can shift their imagination’s focus from the Santa Claus seen in malls and on television to the exciting and robust history of Santa, a history that goes all the way back to the actual person, Saint Nicholas., Your child might be interested to know that people celebrate Christmas all over the world and that each tradition has its own version of Santa Claus.This will reinforce the idea that Santa is not any one person, but a holiday spirit and tradition that is appreciated by people across the globe.


In many parts of Switzerland, for example, a large parade is held in which people march with artistic representations of Saint Nicholas. There are instruments, animals, children, and processions in the parade, not to mention the 1700 people walking in the main parade.
In the United States, Santa Claus has become a symbol of generosity, jolliness, and giving. He travels the world in one night, leaving presents under the Christmas tree for all good children.
In Austria, on the other hand, children leave their empty shoes outside their bedroom doors or on windowsills to find them filled in the morning by St. Nicholas.

, Your child is likely to be just fine upon hearing the truth about Santa Claus and will not need reassurance or have an emotional response. However, some children do feel confused or even betrayed, and that’s perfectly acceptable. Fortunately, if there is any negative reaction, it should not last very long.


Don’t force your child to explain why they feel badly. They might not even know the words for what they’re feeling. Just take the conversation at their pace and encourage them to talk with you.
Ask more questions if they’re having difficulty talking to you. For example, “are you upset that Mommy told you that Santa Claus was real or are you feeling embarrassed because you enjoyed the story so much?” This will help you figure out how to direct the conversation.
When you explain why you promoted the story of Santa, use “I” language: “I wanted you to experience…,” or, “I hoped that you would…,” or, “I believed that it was best because…” This language is active and claims ownership, not putting any responsibility on the child.
Acknowledge how your child is feeling by saying something like, “I understand that this might feel confusing and that you’re upset with me. I’d like us to talk more about it so that I can explain.”
You can also say, “I respect how you’re feeling right now and it was never my intention to betray your trust. I encouraged the story of Santa Claus because it represents what I hold dear about Christmas: kindness, giving, and generosity. I would like very much to talk about your feelings and I want you to know that you can trust me.”
Let your child know that they are your biggest priority and that your job is to love, nurture, and protect them and that you would never do anything to violate their trust. Then explain, again, why you chose to participate in the story of Santa Claus, your interpretation of Christmas, and that Santa isn’t a lie, but a mysterious story meant to spread joy.

, Some parents opt to tell their child that Santa is not any one person, but instead, the sentiment of the season and is really everyone.You could write them a letter or simply explain to them what the season means to your family, emphasizing that Christmas is about joy and giving.


This would be a great time to ask them to be one of “Santa’s Helpers,” a person who helps fill stockings and arrange presents for others.

Reinforce the Santa Claus story.,
Retell the story of Santa Claus.,
Take pictures with Santa.","How to Deal With the ""Is Santa Claus Real"" Question3"," There are several fun ways to reassure your child that Santa Claus exists and will be coming to visit on Christmas Eve.Noradallows you to track Santa as he makes his annual trek across the world.
Leave a plate for treats for Santa on Christmas Eve so that he has a lovely snack while at your house.
Use special Santa-only paper to wrap presents with.
Send something to your child from Santa, like a letter or postcard.
Have your child sprinkle reindeer food outside on Christmas Eve.

, Fortunately, there are thousands of books that tell stories about Santa Claus. Read these books to your child, which will show them several sides to Santa and Mrs. Claus, his reindeer, the North Pole, and even how the elves make all the presents. These stories will help reinforce the meaning behind Santa Claus – generosity, whimsy, and giving – while bringing Santa to life in your child’s imagination.Booksellers can often recommend age-appropriate books about Santa Claus and Christmas.
Use a search engine to find book titles and summaries that you might be interested in reading to your child.
Your local librarian is the best resource around. Going to the library and asking your librarian for recommendations has a few benefits: librarians know more about books than anyone, the books are free to check out, and you can leave the library with several books in hand to read rather than wait for them to be shipped to your house.

, Having your child’s picture taken with Santa Claus allows them to experience the story of Santa with their senses, not just their imagination. They can sit on Santa’s lap, have their picture taken, and even tell Santa Claus what they’d like for Christmas. This four-dimensional experience reinforces the realness of Santa Claus.


Your child might be uncomfortable seeing Santa in person and may even cry. That’s a normal reaction, especially when your child is very young, and just shows their fear of strangers and the unfamiliar. Don’t force them to sit on Santa’s lap, and reassure them that you are there and that they are safe.
They might ask why the Santa they just met looks different than the Santa they saw on television. You can say, “Well, Santa is very busy this time of year getting ready for Christmas Eve, so he has helpers all over the world, and you just met one of his helpers. Don’t worry, he will tell Santa how good you were and what you asked for.”

"
"
Acknowledge their feelings.,
Don’t tell others.,
Appreciate what Santa is.,
Support one another.,
Start new traditions.","How to Deal With the ""Is Santa Claus Real"" Question4"," Your child may be disappointed upon hearing the truth, or perhaps even upset because they may feel betrayed or tricked. If this happens, acknowledge their feelings and make sure to explain why you let them believe in the magic of Santa Claus. Also let them know that your intention was not to mislead them, but that

, Explain to your child that everyone asks this question when they’re ready, and that they should respect that their classmates may not have asked their families yet. To be respectful, they should not share their new knowledge and they should definitely not make fun of anyone who believes in Santa Claus. Remind your child about the spirit of Christmas and how magical it was for them to believe, and that they wouldn’t want to take that from anyone.You can simply say, “Let other kids believe until they’re ready to learn the truth, just like you did.”
You can also say, “Not telling others about Santa is a new and important job that you have, and I’m counting on you.”

, Remind your child that Santa embodies the spirit of Christmas, and that is why you have chosen to embrace the story. This is also an excellent time to remind your child of the religious reasons for Christmas, if you celebrate them. You can also talk with your child about what you and they appreciate most about the Santa Claus story and figure out how to incorporate those elements into future Christmas celebrations.

, The Santa question is not only tricky, it represents a family transition from one of belief in a fictional, well-loved character, to a more mature appreciation of what Santa Claus represents and how that relates to Christmas. The transition might be a little uncomfortable, or even sad, for everyone, and that’s to be expected. Remind one another that Santa Claus is a myth that your family enjoyed and that you had a wonderful time sharing the magic, and most importantly, that you look forward to future Christmases together., Now that your child has a new understanding of Santa Claus, your Christmas celebrations will change a bit. A productive and positive way to handle this transition is to start new traditions. Ask your child to help you think of new traditions that you can participate in as a family, keeping the spirit of Santa Claus alive.You might decide that you’ll bake and wrap cookies to deliver to your neighbors.
Work with a charity to sponsor a family that is less fortunate than yours.
Go through your belongings and have your child go through theirs, finding donate-able items that others might enjoy.
Send Christmas cards to soldiers stationed overseas who won’t be able to come home for the holidays.

Check with your local library. Librarians can offer great recommendations on what kids of all ages are reading, and they may be able to suggest something wonderful that's a little off the beaten track.

, This is where you need to know her tastes. If you don't know if she'd like a certain singer or not, don't get her a CD by them.

, Post-it notes, fun patterned or coloured pens, a small calendar or day planner, or a key chain for her house key are all good options.

, Everyone eats. Many companies release special Christmas-themed sweets and snacks at Christmas time. An orange and some nuts are traditional, but if you know they won't get eaten, try something that will.

, Plastic bangles, long necklaces, and cute earrings are all options. You can even get her pieces in her favorite colour, if you like. Of course, this depends on whether the girl wears jewelry, and what her taste in jewelry is.

, Gift cards are fun, and allow the receiver to buy whatever she wants. They can be for stores or for things like the local movie theater, or a fast food restaurant.


The downside is they're impersonal, they say ""I don't know you well enough to think of a gift for you."" The receiver also has to wait to get her gift, and, of course, it would take a lot of gift cards to fill a stocking.

, If the girl is artistic or likes to do crafts, include some small items such as brushes, pencils (colored or otherwise), a pocket-sized sketch pad, or a miniature artist's mannequin. Be sure to match the items to the crafts she does. Your craft or hobby store can offer suggestions if you're not familiar with the supplies for a craft.


Consider transportation, too. A preteen may have to wait or beg Mom to get herself to a store, especially if it's not very close to home.

",How to Make a Bookworm Christmas Tree," If you are going to do this right, you’ll need to find books that not only have meaning but also come in a variety of shapes and sizes in order to effectively create a tree look. Depending the height you'd like for your tree, you may need several dozen books. While you can source them from your own bookshelf, if you don't have enough, visit the local thrift stores, auction houses that sell boxes of books for next-to-nothing and secondhand book stores. You can also raid the shelves of friends and family if they're willing. When selecting books, keep in mind:


The colors. If you're wanting the tree to reflect Christmas colors, you'll need to focus most on books with red, green, white, gold, silver, etc. covers, or focus mainly on darker, more elegant colors for the mix. Alternatively, go for an eclectic mix or stick to just one style of book, such as old Penguin classics.
Consider the girth. You'll want decent, heavyweight books for the base, gradually going up to lighter books at the top. Keep the Bibles, encyclopedias and dictionaries for the base and the paperbacks for the top.
It's nice to get a good mix of paperbacks and hardcover books.
Choose books in good condition on the whole. While a few tatty ones here and there won't be too distracting, if you have a lot, it'll look just shabby and probably not too chic. Any book that threatens to be unstable because it's back stitching is loose or the spine wobbles, should be left out of consideration.
Consider covering some of the books with paper or even printed book covers if you want to maintain a semblance of a color theme.;
, For this purpose, bigger bulbs are best, so that they're not swamped by all the books. Even an old-school outdoor light set won't be pushing things too far. Compare the lights to the books you've chosen; if you have several colorful books, you may want to use a string of white lights instead of multi-colored ones.


If the lights won't fit all the way, use more than one set of lights. Simply attach additional strands at the points provided on the light cords.
Check that all the lights are in working order before you use them.

, As with the standard Christmas tree, a corner of the room where you're holding all the celebrations is the best choice for setting up the bookworm Christmas tree. Check that the floor is even and non-slippery. If it is slippery, place down some non-slip mats first, available from dollar stores, bathroom stores, and the like.


Check that there is nothing fragile or likely to stick into the tree. While the aim is to make as stable a structure as possible, should it topple, you don't want to damage items around it.

, Begin with the largest, heaviest books first. Create a circle with them on the floor spot set aside for the bookworm tree. Check that they're sitting firmly and won't slide.


Use as many books as possible to create the solid base. This is the largest section of the tree and will bear all the weight.
The size of this circle determines the size of the tree. Adjust if it looks like it will turn out too small or too large.

, The trick to creating the ""tree-like"" formation of the bookworm tree is to align the books so that they have their spine facing outward with their spine edges jutting out. Each book layer on the lower levels needs to use the layer underneath for support, which means that there will be a gap under the middle section of each book, while its edges sit on two books underneath, all the way around each circle. However, as you go higher, there will be less and less gaps, as the circles get closer together, so just focus on keeping the book ends jutting out adequately to resemble tree branches. It's very much like building with Jenga blocks!


At all times of building the layers, keep an eye on stability. Gently push against the tree structure to ensure that it isn't going to topple but sits firmly. A tiny bit of sway is okay but anything more should be a warning signal.

, A few heavier, larger books can be aligned at the top to finish off the look. Whether or not this works for your tree will depend on its size and how evenly you've added the book circles.

, There are two approaches to adding the lights:


Feed the lights in as you build the tree. The advantage of doing this is the the cords are firmly inserted into the tree and won't fall off. The disadvantage is that they may get in the way of what you're doing, they may create instability if they don't sit flat enough and they may get broken if your work topples at any stage of construction.
Wrap the lights around the finished bookworm Christmas tree. The advantages to doing this is that it's a lot easier. The disadvantage may be that it's harder to keep them in place but with the use of hooks, tape, string, etc., it shouldn't be too hard.
Make sure that the light bulbs all face outward.

, While this part is totally up to your imagination, here are some ideas:


Place an upright book standing and slightly open. Perhaps choose a small Bible or a book with a Christmas theme. If you're feeling cheeky, use a book that talks about the perils of Christmas, such as anthologies about bad Christmas experiences, or the Worst Case Scenario Christmas book!
Add a traditional tree-topper. If you have a star or angel stand it on top of the final book for fun.
Place your “favorite” toy on top. Whether it’s your dog’s favorite toy or it’s a desk jockey you find hilarious, use that for your tree topper.
Use the tree top to hold a candy dish. Candy canes anyone? Or you can place a platter of cookies for Santa on top of your book tree.

Buy a lightweight, artificial tree.,
Discard the stand that comes with your tree.,
Wrap wire or string around the trunk to create a loop by which to hook the tree from your ceiling.,
Drill or stick a hook to your ceiling.,
Wrap lights, garland, ribbon or any other ribbon like object you wish to use for decorating around your tree.,
Loop the string onto the hook.,
Decorate the tree.,
Stick a tree skirt to the ceiling.",How to Hang a Christmas Tree Upside Down," Though it is possible to use a real tree, it will be very heavy and much harder to hang, and it won't last long as you can't water it. Select a tree of the appropriate height and fullness to fill your space.Look for one that is lightweight and that has fairly full, evenly spaced branches and a stand that attaches securely to the base of the tree. A wire tree stand or one with pre-drilled holes in the base is a bonus that will make the tree easier to hang.;
, Check to see whether the trunk has parts that might come loose when you hang the tree upside down; if it does, toss those too. It is necessary to have a solid 'trunk', nothing more.

, If your tree has a little loop on the bottom, great. Hook the string through that. If not, take the lowest 'branches' and tie the string around there, so it's up by the branches and doesn't slip down. Next, bring the string around and tie it into a loop.

, This will be what you loop the string onto. If you choose to get a adhesive hook, make sure to get the heavy duty type (20+ pounds). However, this method is not recommended if you have bumpy, stucco-like ceilings, as it will be hard for the hook to adhere. If you drill, realize you may have to consult with your landlord (if you rent).


When you drill, drill a pilot hole in the ceiling at the joist mark and screw a sturdy eye bolt into the joist. Clip a quick link to the eye bolt. Screw a hook or eye hook into the corner nearest the tree at the ceiling to drape a light cord to later.

,


If you use lights, keep in mind that you need an outlet, so you may want to invest in an extension cord.


, With the help of another person, invert the Christmas tree and place the loop in the hook, securing the tree. Cautiously let go, and if all seems okay, proceed to the next step.

, Tighten the ornament hangers around each branch to hold them in place. Run an extension cord from the tree base -- at the ceiling -- to a hook in the nearest corner and down to a baseboard power outlet. Decorating the Christmas tree after successfully hanging it is quite similar to decorating an upright tree. However, weight concerns may play a role here as well. While many modern ornaments consist of aluminum or other lightweight metals, heavier vintage ornaments should be evenly spaced out to distribute the added weight properly.

, Tie the skirt around the 'trunk' then secure the edges to the ceiling. This step is completely optional.

Remove the tree from the box and securely assemble the base.,
Test your vacuum on the tree.,
Start vacuuming.,
Prepare to wipe down the tree.,
Wipe the branches and the trunk.,
Clean up the area around the tree.,
Dump the dust out of the sheet.,
Decorate your tree.",How to Clean an Artificial Christmas Tree1," Spread out the branches to attach to the tree as you go after cleaning each piece. You may wish to place a sheet on the floor around the tree to catch any falling debris., Use an upholstery bristle brush attachment to test an area at the very base of the tree. Your vacuum should be able to safely clean the dirt off the branches without damaging the tree.


You can also use a hand vacuum if you want a weaker suction and don’t wish to deal with a long tube or cords.

, Work from the top to the bottom, using your vacuum brush to gently suction dust off the branches and the trunk of the tree. Avoid vacuuming the tree into the hose or pulling out greenery.Don't allow any parts of the branches to be sucked into the hose. The broken pieces could damage your vacuum cleaner.

, Fill a bucket with mild dish soap and warm water, avoiding any harsh chemicals that can damage your tree. Unplug your tree if it has built-in lights. Use a soft dish or dust rag to clean the tree so the cloth won’t get tangled in the branches., Dip your rag in the soapy water and wring well. Use the rag to gently clean the tree, working from top to bottom. Rinse the dust off your rag frequently to prevent spreading wet dust to other parts of the tree.Replace the water as necessary.
If you are leaving suds, your towel is dripping, or you're leaving wet branches behind, you are not wringing the rag enough.
Allow the tree to dry thoroughly before plugging the lights back in.

, Vacuum the area around the tree to remove any dust that may have fallen on the floor. Put your cleaning supplies away.

, Fold the corners of your dust sheet in towards the center. This will form a sack to transport the sheet without spilling any contained dirt. Take the sheet out to the garbage and dump out the contents., Now that your tree is clean, now is the time to put on your decorations. Test the tree to make sure all the branches are dry before plugging in the lights.

Remove the decorations.,
Make sure the tree is secure and won't topple.,
Use a dust cloth or vacuum to clean the tree.,
Prepare your tree for storage.",How to Clean an Artificial Christmas Tree2," Take off all lights, ornaments, tinsels, and anything else attached to the tree., Make sure you can support the tree with one hand while cleaning the branches with the other.

, Cleaning the tree will usually be more necessary prior to decorating, meaning it will be easier to clean before you put the tree away. At this point, a simple wipe down with a soft cloth or a light vacuuming should be enough to clean your tree and prepare it for storage. , Disassemble the tree if necessary. You may put an unfolded sheet inside the tree box to protect the tree from dust while in storage. Once the tree and all its parts are placed the box, wrap the sides of the sheet over the tree, then seal the box.You may also place the tree’s different sections in heavy duty black trash bags to protect from dust and damage.
Avoid storing your tree in attic spaces with exposed insulation or in dusty garages without proper protections, such as covering the tree with plastic or sealing the box with tape.
It is possible to purchase Christmas tree wraps that fit your specific tree dimensions. Check online or with a tree designer.

If you can't find the instructions, check the company website. They may have an online instruction book you can access to show you how to clean and assemble the tree.

, Remove all ornaments, lights, and any debris that has become tangled in the tree, such as sticks, leaves, and straw., Use the fabric attachment to vacuum dust and dirt off the tree. You can also use a leaf blower to blow debris off the tree, while keeping a careful distance to avoid damaging the tree.

, Fill a bucket with soapy water and use a soft dish rag to wipe down the individual branches and the trunk. As before, work around and then from top to bottom. Replace the water as necessary.
Allow the tree to dry thoroughly before plugging the lights back in.

, Be sure to use lights and decorations that will be able to withstand the weather.

"
Think ahead.,
Shop around.,
Inspect the trees.,
Dig the tree properly.,
Handle the tree carefully.",How to Choose a Living Christmas Tree," Before you actually go shopping for a living Christmas tree, take the following into consideration:


Tree digging stops once the ground freezes. Unless you can find a nursery or farm that carries pre-potted trees, you'll have to do your shopping before the ground in your area freezes. This means you may have to purchase the tree several weeks before Christmas and find a proper place to store it, such as a patio. It can't be kept indoors for any more than 7 to 10 days or else it may die.3-5 days indoors is preferable so that the buds remain dormant and the tree avoids ""winter kill"" when moved outside.Consider when the tree can be planted. In some areas, the holiday season is an ideal time to plant trees. If this is not the case in your region, the tree will need to be stored and cared for outdoors until a good planting time arrives.
Make sure that the tree will fit into your landscape and that the type of tree you are considering will ultimately thrive in your local environment. Some trees used as Christmas trees will eventually reach heights of 40 to 60 feet (12.2 to 18.3 m)! If coniferous trees are uncommon in your area, the environment may not be conducive to them (e.g. arid regions) and you'll have to look for drought-tolerant species (e.g. Arizona cypress). If you don't want to plant the tree on your property, find a neighbor, friend or organization who does want it, and make an agreement before you purchase the tree.
Keep in mind that living trees are much heavier than cut trees because they come with roots and soil that must be kept constantly moist. For example, a 5–6 foot (1.5–1.8 m) tall balled and burlapped tree can weight up to 200 lbs!It may not be wise to purchase a living tree if you can't move it around without hurting yourself or damaging the tree (e.g. bad back, small doorways, stairs). If you anticipate difficulty moving the tree, consider buying a small, container tree.;
, Make a list of local nurseries, garden centers, retail lots and choose-and-cut farms. Call ahead and ask if they have any container trees, or if they are willing to dig up a tree for you (instead of cutting it) and how much that will cost (or you can offer to dig the tree up yourself). Find out if you can order a tree to be picked up a few days before Christmas.If they have living Christmas trees available, visit to check the condition of the trees.

, Whether they're in the ground, recently dug, or container grown, you should carefully inspect the trees to make sure they're healthy.


Feel the soil with your fingertips. It should be soft and moist. If it's hard and dry, it means the tree hasn't been watered properly. This may indicate poor practices on the part of the nursery or farm, so you may want to look elsewhere.
Check the firmness of the root ball if the tree's roots are bound in burlap. It should be tightly packed. Trees with loose root balls are less likely to survive.
Observe the needles. When shopping for any real Christmas tree, living or cut, you should run your hand gently along the branches. No more than a few needles should drop. Most of the needles should be green and firm, not brittle, yellowing or brown.
Bend a branch gently. It should bend flexibly, not snap.
Look for live buds.
Determine the type of tree you're looking at. Most cut Christmas trees are Douglas and balsam fir, pine and spruce. Normally, the type wouldn't matter other than in terms of aesthetics, but since you might be planting this tree in your backyard, you'll want to consider how this particular type will fare in your environment.

, If all you can find is a tree farm, you may need to dig the tree yourself. If someone else is doing the digging, you can watch carefully to make sure it's being done properly. Otherwise, the tree's chances of survival can be severely decreased through incorrect digging.


Make a circular trench that's a foot deep and six inches out beyond the drip line (where the tree's outermost branches will drip water onto the ground).
Start from the outside in. Towards the trunk, you will encounter roots that dive into the ground--a small saw may be needed to cut these.
Work a tarp in between the severed roots and the soil and use the tarp to hoist the tree onto a burlap square, which can be tied tightly around the roots.

, When handling the tree, lift it carefully by the roots (not by the trunk). When you put it down, do so gently--don't let the roots hit the ground forcefully.

Create a customized journal.,
Make a set of cards or stationary with envelopes.",How to Make Your Own Christmas Gifts1," It's easy to change an inexpensive notebook into a personalized gift just for the receiver.


Purchase an old-fashioned, black and white composition book (usually smaller than a regular notebook and with the pages sewn in).
Cover the book with aluminum foil, gift wrap or fabric being sure to wrap it around the edges. Use spray adhesive to secure it to the inside of the cover. You can even use duct tape which comes in many colors and patterns to cover the book.
Add stickers, photos, magazine cutouts, and handwritten words (inside jokes, names of recipient's children) reflecting the recipient's interests.

Write a short note on the first page about how much the recipient means to you.;
, If you're into paper or card making, create a set of cards or stationary using an image you've painted/stitched/drawn/printed, etc. You can either repeat the same image on each card or change them up. You can even make your own envelopes to go with the set of cards if you're really ambitious. Place it all into a small box and affix a ribbon that can be tied shut to keep it all neatly together.

, Use an old clean sock, perhaps one of those whose companion was lost in the blackhole of the washing machine or, if you sew, make a sewn version from an old t-shirt or scrap fabric. Great for all sorts of purposes from toys to back support cushions.

, If you are good at sewing, quick and inexpensive gifts can be made when you focus on the accessories. Try making belts, neck ties, hair accessories or shoe bows.

, For children and the young-at-heart, hand-made toys will be treasured for years to come. Choose cute fabrics, from vintage to eye-popping colors, dependent on the age and likes of the gift recipient.

Consider what you think the person might like. Once you've settled on their preferences, pick a theme for a set of gifts.


Are you filling the stocking of a six year old boy or a sixty year old woman? Clearly the age directs the choice of gift and yes, it is perfectly fine to give stockings to adults too! It is a good idea though to note whether or not adult recipients think that this is an appropriate gesture at Christmas time. Many adults may prefer that only the children receive stockings, so keep this in mind.;
, Well chosen gifts need not be costly to be meaningful, helpful, or fun. For children, pick items that are fun, interesting, and likely to keep them amused for hours. For adults, select items that are both small and useful, such as kitchen accessories and office gadgets.


When filling the stocking, think of the shape. Small, expensive items are best placed at the toe because they're the last to be found and deserve to be the most exciting. Long slimmer items can be slipped down the length of the stocking leg, and in between many filler items can be stuffed in randomly.
Decide whether or not you wish to wrap the stocking items. It isn't essential but it does prolong the fun!

, The classics are great additions to any stocking: crayons, modeling clay or play dough, a Slinky, miniature Lego kits, travel games, decks of cards, mini jigsaw puzzles, wind-up toys, tops, squirt guns, balloons, beach balls, high bounce balls, small stuffed animals, toy cars, and even fancy shoelaces.

, A wide variety of foods fit in stockings, and they are consumable, enjoyable, and easy to give.


Try a favorite candy, jam, or ice cream sauce.
Fancy coffee, tea, or hot cocoa samplers would make a great addition for those who drink them.
Gum, cookies, fruit leathers, and other small snacks fit nicely.
An orange makes a good, traditional addition. You can also substitute it with a chocolate orange. Oranges fit well in the toe of a stocking. Don't bother to wrap it; just make sure it is in good condition.
Decorate the top of the stocking by hooking a candy cane or two over the rim.

, These can make excellent stocking stuffers because they're small and they're always useful and desirable.


Try a new hairbrush or toothbrush (perhaps the one with the purple sparkles or a favorite cartoon character), a bar of fancy soap, or a loofah. For an adult, expensive electric toothbrushes might make a useful choice.
Check out the travel and trial sizes. Would someone you know enjoy trying a new hand lotion or shampoo? A travel set can be an excellent gift for someone you know who is about to travel just after Christmas.
Give a small handheld ball-type massager. These come in many shapes and sizes and you might like to include more than one.
Add fashion jewelry, nail polish, or hair clips.

, Handy little things make excellent stocking fillers for adults and teens. Some ideas include:


Pocket or desktop calendars.
Pocket knives or multi-tools.
Pens, pencils, erasers, pocket staplers, highlighters, color pens, notepads, especially for the students on your list.
Wristwatches or small alarm clocks.

Flashlights, small hand tools, kitchen utensils.
A travel-sized sewing kit. Again, this is perfect for someone who is about to travel after Christmas.

, For instance, if anyone on your list is an aspiring artist, you could give a set of good artist's pencils or try a pocket sized pencil drawing kit.

, For example, try US$2 bills, if you can find them. Most banks have 2's, just ask. Give wheat pennies, dollar coins, or other interesting coins.


In the U.S., many post office vending machines give change in dollar coins. Money doesn't need to be wrapped, but make sure it doesn't get lost.

, Gift vouchers can be slipped in easily and can cover clothing, restaurants, groceries, music download cards, and even gift cards for new experiences for the more adventurous recipient.


While gift cards and gift certificates fit in a stocking, remember that they may be relatively costly compared to the space they take up. One possibility if you want to include gift cards is to attach them to a small, related gift. For example, a hardware store gift card could piggyback on a wrapped tape measure or other small hand tool.

, These items can be decorative, enjoyable, or whimsical.


Small candles
Pretty stones or minerals
Potpourri or incense
Ornaments and miniatures
Music CDs.

, For children, good ones are:
Chocolate - miniature individually wrapped chocolate, hot chocolate mix, chocolate scented pen or stickers, one large thick bar of chocolate, a calculator that looks like a chocolate bar, chocolate scented soap, etc.
Sweets - minute individually wrapped sweets.
Princess - tiny pink ribbons, individually wrapped pink strawberry bonbons, minute stories about fairies and princesses, a plastic tiara, costume jewelry, clear lip gloss, etc.
Football - Football key rings, tiny soft footballs, chocolates wrapped in football pattern paper.
For adults:
Stationery - minute erasers, pencils, pens, a tiny hole puncher, a mini roll of sellotape, a tiny stapler and pencil shaped chocolates.
Sanitary items - tester sachets of shampoo and conditioner, tiny bottles of shower gel, shampoo and conditioner, combs and brushes.

, Many people make up stockings for pets. These are fun for the recipient and for the family because family members have to encourage or help the pet to remove the items from the stocking. Be sure to leave something enticing dangling from the top of the stocking! Things to stuff a pet's stocking with include:


Dog or cat treats

A new collar
New cat or dog toys (homemade or purchased)
New food bowls
Catnip for cats
Laser light for chasing
Tug-o-war rope for dogs.

Choose a healthy tree.,
Steer clear of trees with a large number of dead or browning needles––these trees are already past their prime.,
Choose and clear a location for the tree.,
Cover the floor where the tree will be placed.,
Prepare the base of your tree.,
Mount your tree within eight hours of cutting the base.,
Make sure the tree is straight.,
Decorate the tree.,
Water the tree.,
Check for sap leakage.,
Collect fallen pine needles.,
Dispose of your tree as garden waste.",How to Care for a Christmas Tree," If at all possible, buy a Christmas tree from a tree farm, where you can purchase your tree while it's still in the ground. A freshly cut Christmas tree will last longer than one that's been cut weeks ago and shipped to distant retail outlets.;
, Gently stroke a branch on the tree to make sure that the needles are flexible and remain on the tree.

, It should be kept away from open flames or heat sources, which may dry it out prematurely. Trees do sometimes burn so be careful (see Warnings below). Corners are good places to put trees because this placement keeps the tree safe from knocks and bumps.


If you'll be using lights to decorate your tree, place the tree close to an outlet. If this isn't possible, you'll need to use an extension cord. Be sure that if you use an extension cord, it runs along to wall and doesn't create a trip hazard.







, You can use a properly sewn tree skirt or be budget savvy and use Christmas-themed paper or a piece of satin fabric as shown. This will not only serve decorative purposes, but it will also help protect the floor in case any water splashes out.


If you have a skirt that goes over the cradle, you can still place a barrier underneath the cradle and apply the decorative skirt after the tree has been mounted. Not only does this make the tree more presentable but it prevents pets from attempting or wanting to drink the water in the base.

, Using a small handsaw, cut about a half inch to an inch (1.3cm-2.5cm) off the bottom to aid water absorption.


Note: It is recommended that you don't cut the base at an angle, in a V-shape or drill a hole in the base. None of these methods help water absorption and they may make it more difficult to hold the tree safely in the stand.
DO NOT cut the tree with a reciprocal saw or any blade that moves so fast that it will create friction. If the cut gets hot enough, the sap in the tree will seal the end and make water absorption impossible. A chainsaw or manual saw will work.

, That is how long a fresh tree can go without water before absorption is jeopardized. A Christmas tree should never be mounted dry. It is much better to place it in a container of water that is replenished on a regular basis. You can buy special tree cradles or stands which screw into the base of the tree and provide watering space. Or, you can go for the rougher but tried-and-true method of using a bucket filled with small rocks (put the tree in, fill the bucket with rocks around the trunk). The tree should be provided with 1 quart (950ml) of water for every inch (2.5cm) in trunk diameter.


Note: ensure that whatever you use, the tree is stable. Don't whittle down the bark of the tree just so that it can fit in the stand - that outer layer is the part that absorbs the most water.

, It is a good idea for at least two people to put up the tree, one holding it stable while the other fixes the base. Always stand back to check that the tree is straight before you get busy decorating. Obviously, it is easiest to fix at this stage.


Before decorating let the tree sit for a while to ""settle"" into its shape. Some suggest just an hour or so, others overnight.

, For many, this is the most enjoyable part. It's also a good time to think about Christmas tree safety. A properly maintained Christmas tree should not be a fire hazard, as long as you use common sense in decorating it. For example:


Check each string of lights to ensure that the bulbs are working properly.






Inspect the cords to make sure they are not frayed or bitten by pets, and that the connections are secure.






Discard any decorations that look questionable and replace them. Tree ornaments are not expensive items to replace, but your house is.






Place small and fragile ornaments out of the reach of small children and pets to prevent accidental breakage or ingestion.







, To start, you'll need to make sure your tree gets lots of water because in the first few hours that it's settling in, it will need plenty and will drink like crazy (possibly a full gallon/3.7 liters on the first day). (Also see Tips below.) Afterward, you will need to add water almost every day. Not only is regular water good for the tree's vitality, but a well-watered tree is less dry and therefore, less combustible. Make sure you never let the water level go below the base of the tree.


Some people put an aspirin in the water to help keep it fresh. Some also add Ginger Ale, Sprite™ or another similar soda drink (fizzy lemonade) to feed their tree. Be careful, though; if you accidentally bump the can whilst watering the tree, you might end up with very sticky presents!

, It is a good idea to check occasionally for sap that has leaked from your tree onto nearby furnishings or floor coverings. The sooner you catch any sap leakages, the easier they are to remove.

, Use a dustpan and brush or a handheld vacuum (many needles going into a larger vacuum can easily clog it up; this may even break the machine, whereas a handheld version works well because you are obliged to keep emptying it as you work).


This is a daily ritual, unless you want to have an enormous pile of needles to clean up when you finally move the tree. The needles are unsightly and potentially hazardous for curious pets and infants.






A well-watered tree will lose fewer needles but all fresh trees will lose some needles.







, Your tree has given you its life and has done a great service in being a part of your Christmas spirit. If your municipality has a tree collection program, you can make use of it. If you have room in the garden, you can leave your tree there until spring, when you can chip it into garden mulch (or, if you live where Christmas occurs in summer, you can chip the tree as soon as you remove it).


Some people choose to dispose of their old and decaying Christmas trees in lakes. If you live in an area warm enough to do this, consider that a Christmas tree would provide a healthy hiding place for fish and other underwater critters. Check with local officials or park rangers before depositing old trees into lakes.

Give fancy soap.,
Make a peppermint candle.,
Re-gift.",How to Make Your Own Christmas Gifts7," Buy a glycerin soap block, found in most craft stores, divided into small cubes or make your own.


Tie ribbon around the block to make a loop, turning at ninety degree angles to create each additional loop.
Carefully run one scissor blade on the back of the ribbon until you have completely curled it.
Repeat with the other side. They will look like gourmet soap and cost a fraction of the price.

, Buy a large plain white unscented pillar candle and peppermint candies (round or stick). Unwrap the candies. Using a hot glue gun or glue dots (found at craft stores), glue candies all around the sides of the candle. It will look like candles sold for $15 and more in catalogs and fancy stores.


You can even make your own scented candles


, Never be afraid to re-gift old gifts you've never used or opened. This can save you a lot of time and money, and you'll be getting rid of an unwanted item and up-cycling; just be sure to do it in the spirit of giving the item to someone you know will appreciate it. There is a lot of nonsense about re-gifting being unthoughtful––it is probably one of the more thoughtful approaches to giving precisely because you have to focus on whether or not it's an appropriate gift for the particular recipient.

Assemble a winter warm-up basket.,
Make a themed gift basket for newlyweds, college students, or new home owners you can create a gift basket with several inexpensive items from discount stores.,
Send them to the movies.,
Throw them a tea party.",How to Make Your Own Christmas Gifts8," Your basket can include marshmallows and hot chocolate. You can purchase hand-crafted marshmallows in gourmet stores like Williams Sonoma for $15-$18 or simply include make your own gourmet marshmallows.. Purchase instant hot chocolate in sample sizes or in fancy tins or make your own. Then assemble your basket.


Buy a cheap basket at the dollar store or craft store.
Line it with a decorative kitchen towel or shredded tissue paper.
Fill it with hot chocolate, homemade marshmallows and, if you like, an inexpensive mug or a favorite movie.
Wrap the basket in shrink wrap and use a hair dryer to blow-dry the shrink wrap on the basket to stay in place.
If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, make a summer cool-down basket. Include beach gear, a towel, sunscreen, face mist, a reusable water bottle, flip flops and a sun hat.

, Theme the basket for the kitchen, bath, or dorm room. Avoid a color scheme unless you know what they want.

, Buy a bucket of movie popcorn, include a box of candy and a gift card for a movie rental center or a cinema. Makes a great last-minute gift.

, Shop thrift stores, antique stores, pottery outlets, yard sales or your own cabinet for cute tea cups and saucers. Add several gourmet tea bags, individually packaged tea bags and tasty biscuits from the dollar store. Wrap with cellophane and top with a holiday bow. (Hint: add a drop of rubber cement or piece of tape to attach the saucer to the cup to prevent from slipping or breaking.) This is a great way to get rid of old china.


You can also do that for the coffee lover and include a gift card for gourmet coffee beans at a local or online store.

Write the names of everyone participating on a piece of paper.,
Cut out and toss the names into a hat.,
Set a price limit.,
Draw names.,
Set a gift-giving date.,
Purchase a gift.,
Exchange gifts.,
Keep it appropriate.,
Avoid alcohol.,
Buy something practical.,
Get something specific.,
Consider making a gift.",How to Do a Secret Santa," If the group is larger and people don't know each other that well, it is a good idea to get people to write their names and some distinguishing features/interests such as ""male astronomy buff, 65"" or ""female triathlete devotee, 34"". In more intimate group environments, only the name of the person is necessary.;
, The next step is to prepare the names for a drawing. Cut each name out, and then fold it in half once or twice to prevent people from reading it without unfolding it. Then, place all the folded names into a bowl or hat and mix them around a bit so that the names are shuffled.

, This can be done in discussion with the whole group or just by those who are organizing the event. The price limit is set so that some people don’t try to be cheap and get away with purchasing a gift for only a few dollars, while others try to overachieve and purchase very expensive gifts. Select a price limit in the ‘happy medium’ range that you know everyone in the group can afford. It’s better to be safe than sorry and choose a lower price range than to choose something too high that some people don’t have enough money for.

, Work around the group, giving everyone the opportunity to draw a single name randomly out of the hat. Keep the names folded and hidden until everyone has drawn. At this point each person can look at their name, as long as they are careful not to say who they have or to show anyone else their slip of paper. If someone draws their own name, have them redraw.

, The next step is for everyone to go out and purchase a gift (within the price range) for the person whose name they drew from the hat. Typically, there is a second meeting time at which all the secret santa players exchange gifts and reveal whose name they had the whole time. Check with the members of the group and select a date and time several days in advance at which everyone can meet to exchange their gifts.

, With your person in mind, go out and choose the perfect gift for them. Try to make it personal, and avoid choosing a generic gift like a coffee mug or a bag of candy. Be intentional about matching the price limit though, otherwise you may make your gift recipient or others uncomfortable with how cheap or how expensive you were.

, When everyone in the group has purchased their gifts and met up together, you can begin the gift exchange. Wait until everyone is present, and continue keeping your gift recipient a secret until everyone is given a ‘go’ to start exchanging gifts. At that point, find the person to match the name you drew, and reveal your gift! Don’t forget you’ll be receiving a gift as well, so remain gracious and polite as you accept your present (even if you really don’t like what you got)., Gag gifts are fun sometimes, but in general you should always choose gifts that would not be perceived as inappropriate for a group setting. 

, Unless your secret santa is happening at a wine tasting party, you shouldn’t assume that your gift recipient will appreciate a bottle of alcohol as much as you or someone else might. Especially at office parties, giving alcohol could create an awkward exchange if your recipient doesn’t like drinking or is recently sober. If your recipient is an alcohol enthusiast, try choosing a related gift rather than alcohol itself (like wine charms or a beer koozie).

, If you’re not quite sure what to get your person, play it safe and choose something that is practical and useful. That way, even if it isn’t something that they might have wanted, they will still have a use for it. Consider holiday ornaments, kitchen necessities, or a good book in a genre they’re interested in.

, If you can, do a bit of research on your gift recipient in order to choose a gift that is truly tailored to them. Ask around, look at their work or social media profiles, or discreetly do a bit of questioning with them. They’ll appreciate the time and effort you put into choosing a gift that is special and geared towards them.

, If you’re the creative type, a homemade gift done in good taste will seem personal and meaningful. Consider your recipient’s interests when making a gift for them, rather than just throwing together a bunch of scraps and appearing cheap. There is a big difference between making something creative and worthwhile, and making something cheap and lazy because you forgot to/didn’t buy something."

Know thy geek’s specific tastes.,
Ask the geek's mom what’s on his or her Christmas list.,
Think gaming.,
Go for the full collection.,
Consider the outrageous gift.,
If you get confused, ask another geek’s opinion.,
Get crafty.,
Last but not least, find suitable stocking fillers.",How to Buy Christmas Presents for Geeks," Whether your geek is a gaming fanatic or has his or her own geeky affection for sci-fi films, home in on what makes your geek quiver with excitement. Ways to learn what makes him or her tick include:


How does your geek spend his or her day? In front of the computer playing World of Warcraft or trolling the local comic book stores? Maybe your geek has a special dress up fetish that he or she only reveals on Comic Con days.
What brings a smile to your geek’s face? You want a gift that will light up the room, so study his or her habits to determine what is considered to be a happy place (namely, going to the movies, playing cards or games at home, etc.).
Study his or her friends. Geeks often travel in packs, so glean some information off a pal of your geek recipient. Witnessing what your geek’s friends are doing during the week and weekend may help you to determine his or her tastes.
Pay attention to the differences between various geek franchises. If your geek is really into Star Wars, that's no indication he or she also likes Star Trek; in fact, sometimes quite the opposite. Non-geeks may make the assumption that ""something different seemed nice for a change,"" but that's not the way geeks' minds work (see Collections, below).;
, Even a middle-aged geek will maintain a list––it’s in their biological make-up. Rather than just ask your friend for the list, go directly to the mom-in-charge so you can maintain some element of surprise. Also, asking mom will help you determine which gifts she has already purchased and allow you to share what you intend to buy.

, Games cover a wide range of possibilities, so there is a lot to choose from.


You could choose electronic games such as a game for an Xbox, Wii, PSP, etc., or a PC game. Or, offer to pay their ongoing subscription to an online game like World of Warcraft or something similar that they're already playing. Perhaps give them some iTunes cards to download games apps.
Or, if your geek is more interested in non-electronic games, go for board games that focus on logic, physics, math or fantasy themes. Card games and dice games can also be a hit, and never forget the place of role playing games, either in their book/board or electronic forms. Just like with movies and comics, however, geeks can be quite picky, so a game that's not their preferred style or genre may miss the mark. But, if you find out they like a specific collectable card game, or strategy board games about space, for example, then you've hit gift gold.

, For some reason, geeks love full collections of films, comic books, action figures––you name it, they strive to obtain the entire collection. For example, if your geek has an affinity for Star Trek (an obvious choice) find out which season he or she does not currently own and the purchase the entire season. It may be considerably more expensive than purchasing just one DVD, but it will position you as the “Mack Daddy” friend with the good gift.


Collections aren't just about movies. For sci-fi fans, there are books, comics, magazines, toys, figurines, outfits, posters, movie placards, calendars, desk gadgets and much, much more. Don't get into a tizzy though––a lot of online retailers stock these items, especially those linked to selling books. Items spawned from Dr. Who, Star Trek, Star Wars and the like are usually always available through online retailers.

, No self-respecting geek likes a lame-o, humdrum gift, so pull out all the stops and take a walk on the wild side. When it comes to outrageous gifts think “experience” and “fantasy:”


Choose a full Comic Con-ready costume as a gift. If you’ve noticed that your pal has been slapping together tin foil and taping old batteries to his head in an attempt at creating a Tron costume for Comic Con, plunk down a wad of cash and go for the real thing. It will not only be safer for your friend, but it will restore his or her dignity on convention day. If you'd rather not buy the actual costume (due to size and style preferences, etc.), consider finding out which costume store is their favorite and buy a voucher to that store.
Explore “experience” type gifts such as a helicopter flight lesson or an air combat dogfight. Several companies offer full, head-on, in your face experience gifts. Before selecting one of these gifts, be completely sure your friend will enjoy the experience. If your geeky friend white knuckles a quick flight from Orlando to Miami, scrap a hot air balloon ride experience and perhaps opt for something on the ground. On the other hand, an afternoon in a flight simulator might just make their coming year.
Choose the hottest electronic gadget this year. If you have money to burn, go for the newest, most innovative electronic “toy” on the market. Be sure you purchase the best of the best––a computer or gadget nerd will only settle for top-notch quality. Just be warned––if you don't give the best or the right model, you'll get a whole lot of reasons as to why it's inferior. Don't take that personally, it's just that geeks are so keyed into the specs that they can't help themselves discuss the innards of a gadget's pros and cons. You might want to give the exchange receipt to them if they really seem peeved.

, If peering into your geeky friend’s world makes you feel like Forrest Gump (confused), ask someone on his or her wavelength for gift ideas. Questions to ask include:


What does everyone in your group want for Christmas (and more importantly, doesn’t have)? Even if it’s a talking hamster, find out what it is and figure out how to get it.
If you could have anything for Christmas, what would you want? Getting an idea of what the friend wants may give you a better idea of what your buddy would like.
What store is best for buying a geek presents? With millions of online and in-store retailers, procuring a specific list of merchants will help you save time in your search.
What are the ""best"" ones? Quality matters, especially when it comes to games. Many geeks own stacks of unplayed video and board games that were the result of poor research. The good news is that it's an easy mistake to avoid: asking another geek or a knowledgeable shopkeeper which ones are really good will make your gift that much better. Honestly, most geeks will be more impressed by a duplicate of something they already owns but is really good (and they'll have fun trading it for something else) than something that's quite bad and they may be stuck with.

, If you're good at making things with your hands, this might be the ideal solution for a geek gift. A handmade gift not only says that you've noticed their preference but that you've cared enough to take the time to make something supportive of their fandom. There are lots of possibilities for the avid crafts person:


Crochet a yip yip alien
A painting of Yoda from Star Wars
Twitter Fail Whale cookies
Yoshi egg cakes

A jigsaw puzzle - given the ease of taking photos and turning them into jigsaw puzzles, this one has hundreds of possibilities including something really complex like the inner workings of an iPhone through to sci-fi characters and the store front of a favorite tech shop
A book of difficult mathematical puzzles, quizzes and know-how all put together by you
A Pi pie


Bacon chocolate chip cookies and chocolate bacon

A homemade board game based on logic, their favorite fantasy or anything else you know they'd like. This is the ultimate––your intelligence and thoughtfulness put to good use making a board game that will give them hours of pleasure playing!

, If you're in charge of the stocking filling, find some suitably geek fillers, such as:


Floppy disk notepads and coasters
App magnets or magnets that allow poems or math equations to be made
Book lights
Dalek flashlight or a Yoda figurine (or insert any character they like for such items)
A laptop or iPad rest, a wrist rest in the shape of something cute
Notebooks or diary
Japanese stationery, candies
Desk gadgets that move or light up or even vacuum the desk
Cord tidies in interesting colors or styles
Grow-a-Geek (just add water and the figure expands)
Anything small from their favorite fantasy, science, sci-fi, gaming, etc. likes.

Think simple.,

Consolidate your shopping.,
Compile a list.,
Create a special Christmas card or video.,
Donate your time.,
Make an offer to attend the post-Christmas sales with your gift recipient and offer to buy them something then.,
Write a poem or a short story.",How to Do Last Minute Christmas Shopping," By this stage, elaborate gifts are beyond your capability, and keeping it simple is the name of the game. Perhaps this is why you left things till the last minute anyway, but there's no need to feel guilty––simple gifts in our recession-prone, environmentally responsible and conscious consumption era make sound sense anyway. If your own ideas aren't sparking, here are just a few ideas to get you started:



For coffee lovers: Buy a package of really good quality Fair Trade coffee, add a package of organic cinnamon sticks and wrap it all together with a beautiful scarf or napkin and a big bow.

For tea lovers: Buy a teacup and saucer from a vintage or secondhand store, stick a package of French (or other quality) tea inside it and add a tea strainer to the side. Wrap all in cellophane with a gorgeous bow to finish.

For music lovers: You could buy a CD of their favorite music or you could make one from your own music. Make a playlist and burn it to a CD, carefully write out the titles and artists and wrap beautifully. Making your own selection can carry great meaning when the songs are ones that reflect shared experiences. Other ideas include purchasing a ticket to a concert they'd love to go to (buy online and prettify the ticket packaging), an iTunes voucher or a book on the history of some aspect of music.

For book lovers: If you're running out of time, a book voucher purchased in-store or online will suffice, but how much nicer to choose at least one book that you think will resonate with the person and slip the voucher inside it. Or, how about going to the secondhand bookstore and choosing a much loved classic with beautiful binding, writing a note that describes how this book made you feel when you first read it, then wrapping it in lovely paper?

For garden lovers: Buy a kitchen herb garden or some fancy containers for indoor plants. A small set of good quality gardening gloves, garden snips, and seeds can be easily put together in a little basket, tied together in cellophane. A potted plant always makes a nice gift for someone who enjoys caring for plants.

For gourmet food lovers: Grab the best bottle of olive/walnut/sesame oil you can find on the supermarket shelf, some grissini (Italian bread sticks), a box of decent if not downright luxurious chocolates, a bottle of wine and some fresh packages of spices. Place in a gift box or basket, wrap with cellophane and add a bow.

For video game fans: Grabbing a video game at the last minute is risky unless you're certain the recipient lacks that title. Instead, purchase a voucher from their favorite game store, and perhaps an accessory such as an extra game controller, a case for storing the games or similar items to round out the gift. If you do buy a game, ask if it can be exchanged; do not buy if it can't be.

For the jewelry lover: While bling is a bit ostentatious in current times, if you can afford a decent piece of jewelry for someone special, keep it simple. You can rarely go wrong with well crafted gold or silver pieces, but if time is of the essence, be careful about making snap choices. An alternative is a voucher to a really quaint boutique jewelry store rather than the run-of-the-mill franchise. And for those unable to afford the real stuff, indulge in gorgeous handcrafted hair accessories, costume jewelry and pretty vintage brooches. A voucher for Etsy never goes astray either.

For the bath/spa lover: Find some fine French soap, a gorgeous bubble bath, a divine scrubbing mitt, and some bath salts. Package everything together inside a pretty container and, if you have the time, bring together a little book of bath recipes on your computer and add the printed version to the package.

For the baking fan: New baking tools will always be appreciated. Look for silicone-coated baking pan with interesting shapes, vintage-looking, sturdy mixing bowls, wooden spoons of substance (you can never have too many), pastry brushes, cookie cutters, etc. If you have time, make a collection of your own favorite recipes in eBook or printed form and pass them on.






For the candy lover: This isn't hard, really! Find candies, chocolates, and anything else sweet. There are chocolate Santas, reindeer drops, and all the usual candies to choose from. Or splash out and get a box of hand-selected Belgian or handcrafted chocolates. Wrap exquisitely.;
, In the press of people, blaring music, and seemingly emptying shelves of ""what's hot"" this Christmas, there can be a temptation to give in to overspending on stuff that may not be what you wanted to give. The brain tends to give in to the pressure of noise and glitzy displays when in a rush, all in the hope of getting out faster! Seek out quieter venues, such as your local boutique stores or a deserted city center.


Failing this, have a very good plan of attack––know which stores you will go to (and no others), head straight for the right purchase points and do not deviate!
If a store sells nothing but Christmas items, stay out of it. If you haven't yet bought Christmas themed items, it's too late anyway and they don't make good gifts!
Avoid places throwing last-minute sales. It'll be bedlam.

, This means heading to places such as department stores, garden centers with gift shops, drugstores with great ranges of goodies, warehouses, and even the supermarket. If you can get as many gifts in the one place as possible, you maximize the efficiency of your shopping expedition. If you're really lucky, it'll be one-stop shopping.

, Before you leave the office, home or wherever you may be, put at least a half hour's thought into the Christmas gift list. This will keep you focused, calm and it will ensure that you don't accidentally miss someone's gift.


This is a great chance to come up with possible gift ideas, or at least ""genres"" of gifts that will help you to narrow down where you need to go.
The list will also help you to identify whether it's possible to head to just one or two stores or whether you need to deftly weave your way between numerous stores all before closing time.

, If you have any friends that you live far away, then consider creating a card or video wishing them a Merry Christmas. This can be done very quickly the day before Christmas, sent overnight, and be waiting for them when they wake up next morning. (Or, you can blame time zones for any late arrival!)

, People can always do with help of one sort of another but many people feel embarrassed or awkward about asking. Think about the sorts of things that your recipient could use help with that you're able to do, such as a house clean, a garden tidy up, walking their pet for a while, house-sitting while they go away, baking a cake every weekend for a month, etc. Your offer can be made by way of a quickly produced booklet of vouchers (use your computer, print them off and staple together) or simply write your one-off offer into the Christmas card and place the card under the tree as the gift.

, This may seem a little bizarre at first but if both of you like a bargain, enjoy shopping, and see the sense in conscious consuming, you can set aside the gift giving for later, enjoy Christmas for its real meaning and look forward to spending time together again during the sales. This is a great gift idea for someone you really enjoy hunting down bargains with!

, If you enjoy writing and the recipient is someone who is special to you, consider this highly personalized gift. Think about all the things that matter about this person, or an event where the two of you learned or shared something together that carries great meaning. Write your impressions and feelings in a poem or short story form as an ode to the recipient and what he or she means in your life. You can wrap it up like a scroll and add a seal, or you can frame it in a frame quickly purchased from the late night drugstore, or you can simply add beautiful fonts and borders before printing and wrap as is.

Start off smart by considering the type of tree you'll use.,
Select a strong and unwavering base for holding the tree.,
Choose a safe location for the tree.,
Consider not decorating the tree initially.,
Decorate the tree with your cat firmly out of the way.,
Choose ornaments less likely to be attractive to your cats.,
Place decorations that are especially delicate, enticing or dangerous high up the tree, in the top two-thirds of the tree.,
Attach ornaments onto the tree securely so that they cannot be simply pelted or lifted off.,
Be careful with electrical wires and lighting.,
Relax now.",How to Cat Proof Your Christmas Tree," Real Christmas trees are potentially more dangerous to your cat than artificial ones. This is because the needles on a real tree are sharp and can pierce or puncture the skin of an overly curious cat, while the pine needles themselves are irritating to mildly toxic if chewed (depending on the species of tree used). However, a chewed artificial tree isn't going to be that healthy either, so balance the choice of tree type with how you intend to keep the tree safe from your cat using the remaining steps.


Consider the size of the tree. A small tree will be safer than a larger tree because there is less of it to crash down if things go horribly wrong. For a kitten, a tabletop tree might be a suitable choice until it grows up and stops being so playful.
If you do choose a real tree, also choose a water container for the tree that is completely inaccessible to the cat. If she tries to drink from it, she risks poisoning.
For small kittens, wrap tinfoil around the trunk. They don't like putting their nails into it and it will keep them from climbing the tree.;
, Always err on the side of caution when selecting a tree base and get one that is guaranteed to stay firmly in place if the tree is knocked. This is as important for the safety of children as it is for pets. Ask your retailer for advice on the options provided in-store.


Even an artificial tree should have a firm and solid base.
Use a tree skirt to hide all ugly but practical safety fixes at the base of the tree (including electrical items, see below).
As well as a solid base, anchor the tree to the wall or ceiling to help prevent it from toppling over should your cat land in the tree or pull on it.

, There should be plenty of room around the tree so that it isn't too near climbing items. If there are tempting shelves or furniture pieces to act as launchpads for kitty, she's very likely to avail herself of them and jump onto the tree. Keep the tree in a clear space that makes jumping either difficult or unlikely.


If possible, select a placement for the tree that allows you to shut the door at night or when nobody is about, in order to keep the cats away from the tree. Obviously this isn't always possible or even doable but if it is an option, make use of it.
If the tree is shorter than 6 feet (180cm), you might find it handy to use duct tape to tape the legs of the holder to a piece of wide plywood and put the whole tree on a short but very sturdy table. This keeps the tree above the level of the cat and the cat won't be as interested. Of course, you still need to ensure that the tree is nowhere near any launching points for an opportunistic jump.

, The rationale behind this is to provide adjustment time to the tree, as well as a possible lesson for your cat in leaving the tree well alone. Fill a spray bottle with water and hang on to it. It is a good idea to set the tree in place, then let her in to investigate but hover in the background with the spray bottle, just in case. If your cat shows any signs of wanting to leap at or on the tree, a light spritz of water on her back and a stern ""NO!"" will get the point across. This should deter her from trying it again and should be enough to teach her that the Christmas tree is not her playground.


If you're still concerned prior to decorating the tree, spray it with a product called Bitter Apple. This will deter her without leaving a noticeable odor to human noses. Or, you might try a citrus spray, as cats are repelled by citrus odor too.
If it's a plastic tree, a small amount of Citronella oil shaken into a bottle of water and misted on to the tree makes it smell unpleasant to the cat but fresh and citrus-like to you.
You could also place orange peels under the tree to make your cat less likely to go near it. (Cats also dislike the smell of rotten apples but then you probably won't like that smell much either!)
Spray some pine cones with Citronella and pile them around the base of the tree. Cats do not walk on pine cones! (Pine cones also have the same effect in the base of your houseplants.)

, It's hard enough fiddling with trees, decorations and breakable ornaments without also having felines running up past you and pelting at the objects as you're gingerly hanging them up. Your cat will assume this is a game you intend for her to play, so it's just easiest to keep her out of the way until everything has been set up.


While decorating, if your cat is about, resist the urge to tease her with decorations as you're adding them. Doing so will only encourage her to see the glittery items as toys and things to swat at anytime she pleases.

, Some ornaments will prove irresistible because they sparkle, glow, dangle and shimmer. On the other hand, blander, less shiny or flat matte objects which don't dangle much will have less allure for your cat. Felt, paper and plain decorations might be the best choice. And avoid anything that dangles a lot, jumps about or spins.


Never put catnip stuffed items on the tree. That's just asking for it.
Consider not having certain decorations at all. Tinsel is potentially hazardous for cats who chew it and swallow it and it is not recommended for households with cats; it can cause choking or other internal problems if swallowed, such as intestinal blockage. So can ribbons and other items with length that dangle from the tree. Artificial snow is toxic and should not be used when you have pets and small children. Christmas is stressful and expensive enough without the emergency surgery necessary to save your cat's life if sharp-edged tinsel slices through the intestinal wall or causes a blockage.
It is recommended that you don't use real candles on a tree when you have pets. Things can all too easily go wrong with a quick swipe of the paw and flames upon flammable items as a result.
If you like decorating the tree with food, be careful what you add. Chocolate of any kind is toxic for cats and the odor may be tempting to them if hung from the tree. Lots of sweets aren't healthy either.

, Your cat is less likely to reach for higher parts of the tree (provided you've ensured there are no leaping ledges or spots nearby), which will help to keep these items safe. Tinsel, if used at all, should be placed up high as it is likely to be dragged off by a curious cat and as already noted, it can be very harmful if ingested, including getting caught in the stomach and intestines. Some people choose to not even decorate the lower third of the tree at all. That way, there is nothing of interest at cat's eye level.


Some cats cannot help themselves and will climb up high whatever you do. If your cat is like this, then avoid having any delicate or potentially dangerous items on the tree at all.

, Use metal hooks that clamp to the tree and avoid using string, rubber bands or anything else dangly to attach the ornaments with. When you've attached the decorations, give them a tug to check that the method of attaching that you've used is adequate and requires dexterous strength to remove.


Hang ornaments by using quality wire ornament hangers. Use a pair of pliers to clamp the hook part around the branch so that it doesn't dangle and cannot be simply pulled off.

, A Christmas tree is complete when its lights are on but the wires can prove too much of a temptation to a curious kitty. Be sure to tape down excess wire and to make it too hard for the cat to reach the power point and cord join. Do not leave any wires dangling – wrap wire around the base or tree rather than having it dangling anywhere. It can also be helpful to cover exposed wires in wire covers or piping to prevent the cat from chewing them.


Cords can also be coated in ""Bitter Apple"".
Plug the tree lights into a short indoor extension cord and tape the plug into the socket with electrical tape. Simply unplug the lights from the extension cord to turn off.
Consider using cords that shut off if damaged.

Always turn off Christmas tree lights when there is no responsible adult in the room to keep an eye on them.

, You've done all you can to secure the tree and to make it a safe experience for your cat. Some cats will climb into the tree whatever you do and provided you've made it safe, it's best to reach a place of acceptance about this and go with the flow. Decide to make it your cat's Christmas and decide that you are not going to get frustrated trying to outsmart your cat this Christmas. Provided you've secured the tree to keep it from toppling and properly clamped ornaments to the branches, you will be able to cope if your cat does hop into the tree. And if that happens, be ready to take pictures of your cat sleeping in the Christmas tree branches – and smile.

Accept that your birthday is competing with an important festive occasion.,
Look on the bright side.,
Talk to your parents, spouse, housemates or whoever else is responsible for throwing you a party.,
Put up birthday decorations as well as Christmas ones.,
Be appreciative of what you receive by way of gifts.,
Go online and commiserate with other Christmas Day babies.,
See if you can celebrate a ""half-birthday"" in six months time instead.",How to Enjoy Your Christmas Birthday," Part of the disappointment arises from feeling a sense of injustice or deprivation because you feel that you're missing out on what others are experiencing as an individual event for the rest of the year. By accepting that your birthday is sharing a spot with the highlight of the year's celebratory calendar, you can begin to look more positively at getting others to celebrate your birthday more enthusiastically.;
, Since it's your birthday, you have a lifelong excuse for not being the principal cook, decorator, or host on Christmas Day. That is something rather powerful! Moreover, people are in a festive mood and you're most likely to see more people for your birthday than other people get to see for their birthdays. Then there is the great bonus that you won't have to go to school or work on your birthday (well, unless you're a shift worker doing Christmas duty). It's also very hard for anyone to forget your birthday! And you have the choice of birthday cake or fruit cake.


Accentuate the positive. Your birthday is a good excuse to ask feuding family members to chill, in honor of it being your day and not just the usual Christmas get-together. Whenever people seem grumpy, narky or complaining, you can remind them that it's your birthday and that positive vibes rule. Point out that if Christmas bothers them, they can enjoy celebrating your birthday instead. Keep your jesting lighthearted, in the spirit of goodwill.

, Given that Christmas Day is already busy, it's unlikely that a full-blown party is going to be added to the day's list of events. However, there is no reason that you can't organize a special breakfast or brunch or an intimate meal for dinnertime that is focused on giving you birthday gifts, a cake and a few treats that have been purchased or made especially for you. And a large party can be postponed to later in the holiday week, which is great because a lot of people will be around on vacation.


Try celebrating your birthday on Christmas with your family, then with your friends as close to Christmas to possible, either before or just after.
Remember that other people who celebrate their birthday on Christmas Day have the same experience as you, so you're not alone. They're all postponing their birthday party to another day too.

, There is something decadently fun about doubling up on the celebratory messages and to have both birthday and Christmas decorations around at the same time is a great way to recognize that it's not just Christmas Day but also your birthday.


Hang a Happy Birthday banner near the Christmas tree.
Keep your birthday cards in a distinct part of the house and request that no Christmas cards be placed in the same spot.

, Sure, there will be some less-than-thoughtful people who will give you one gift for both occasions (combination presents) and smile smugly saying ""Well, we thought it'd be easier this way."" In some cases, perhaps you benefit from this approach because you might receive one much more expensive item than two cheaper and less interesting ones. However, most people will be at pains to give you separate gifts and if you've already arranged for a separate gift-giving time (such as at breakfast or brunch), then this is obvious and easy for everyone to cope with.


Have immediate family members make it clear to everyone else that the household rule is ""No birthday presents in Christmas wrapping"". Tell everyone that if it's in Christmas paper, then it's a Christmas gift and it will be presumed that a birthday gift is yet to be given. The best people to do this are your parents, whatever your age, as it doesn't look so egotistical coming from them.
If people ask you if you'd mind a combined present, already know whether or not you mind this and be polite but clear in your response. You might decide that it's fine provided it's substantial.
Some people might assume that it's unfair that you're getting ""more"" presents than them. Calmly reassure them that you are getting no more presents than they do, it is just that this happens to be your birthday as well as Christmas. Don't let such people get to you; it's their misunderstanding, not a reality.
In order to slow down a feeling that there is an avalanche of ""too many gifts"" on the one day, consider asking your family and friends to keep back the birthday gifts until a later date when you've arranged for a birthday party. This means that you'll get to have fun over two days. For example, perhaps you can have your birthday presents on Christmas Eve or Boxing day. Then they will be spread over two days instead of having them all on one day.

, There are plenty of other people in your situation and sharing your online tales of annoyance, woe, irritation and amusement can help salve the feelings that you're missing out on something special.

, This way you can celebrate in June and receive the attention and presents without conflicting with Christmas.

",How to Make Christmas Crackers,"


If you plan on using tissue paper, consider stacking 2 to 3 sheets so that it won't be see-through.
The paper does not have to be Christmas-themed. It can be winter-themed instead. For example, blue, white, and silver stripes are perfect for a Winter Wonderland themed party.
Consider matching the paper to your table settings. Your table will look nicer if the crackers match the napkins, plates, candles, decorations, etc.;
, If your paper has a patterned side and a blank side (such as scrapbooking paper or wrapping paper), make sure that the blank side is facing up.

, This will make your Christmas cracker pop like store bought ones. Place a long strip of double-sided tape down onto the paper, 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) down from the top edge.Next, place the cracker snap down onto the tape, make sure that it is centered, then run your finger across it to seal the tape. Make sure that both ends of the cracker snap are taped down.


Many craft and dollar stores sell cracker snaps during the holiday season. You may also be able to find them online.

, Make sure that the tape goes from edge-to-edge. You will be using this to seal your Christmas cracker shut.


If you added a cracker snap, the tape will be just above it.

, You should have about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) to either side of your toilet paper tube.If you can't find any toilet paper tubes, you can cut an empty paper towel tube in half. You can also get an empty wrapping paper tube, and cut it into 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) long segments.

, Try to roll it as evenly and as tightly as you can so that the paper is smooth.When you get to the top edge, run your finger along it to seal the tape down., You can use just about anything to tie the cracker shut, but it might look better if it matches your paper or your theme. For example:


If you want something fancy or elegant, use a piece of satin ribbon, sheer ribbon, or curling ribbon.
If you want something cozy or rustic-looking, use baker's twine, jute or hemp cord, or yarn.

, You do not have to fill your Christmas cracker with everything listed in this section. Instead, use this section to get ideas and inspiration. Choose items that suit your budget, party theme, and guests.

, One of the most popular items is the paper crown. It is great for adults and children alike. You can make your own out of gold poster paper or out of butcher paper. Here's how you do it:Measure your head and add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters).
Cut a 2½-inch (6.35-centimeter) wide strip of paper according to that measurement.
Cut a zigzag pattern into one of the long edges.
Overlap the two narrow ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and secure them with a piece of double-sided tape.
Roll the crown up into a tube, then tie it up with a piece of string. This allows the crown to fit into your cracker.

, You can find lots of Christmas-themed facts and jokes online; you can also make up your own. Write or print your greetings, facts, and jokes on little slips of paper. You can take things a step further, and decorate them with Christmas-themed stickers, stamps, or simple illustrations.Pieces of washi tape around the borders would be a nice touch too. Here are some other examples of messages that you can include:


A fortune

A riddle
A blessing or a spiritual message
A recipe

, You can find lots of small items that can fit inside a Christmas cracker in the goodie bag section of a party store. The dollar section of an arts and crafts store may also carry some suitable items. Many stores also have a stocking stuffer section once the holiday season rolls around. Browse through those sections, and pick out some items to stuff your crackers with. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Candies or chocolates
Costume jewelry, such as ""pearl"" necklaces and clip-on earrings
Mini manicure kits and mini bottles of nail polish
Mini stationary items, such as: notepads, pens, novelty erases, etc.
Plastic figurines, toy cars, etc.
Small toys such as a spinning top, dice, hopping frog, etc.
Vouchers or gift cards for music, cafes, restaurants, etc.

, Keep in mind that this can get very messy, so only do this if you don't mind cleaning up afterwards. It would also be best to open confetti or glitter-filled crackers after the meal is over to avoid getting bits of paper or glitter into the food.

, Keep the amounts small and equal between your guests. It wouldn't be fair if one guest got a lot of money while another did not. Choose coins that are clean and shiny, and paper money that is crisp and clean. Dirty, grimy, wrinkled money may quickly the appeal away.


Do not include money if you plan on including candy, even if the candy is wrapped.

, This will give your guests something to unwrap as well as prevent messes. A small, organza bag would work for a fancier Christmas cracker.Matching tissue paper would work for a simpler Christmas cracker., You can, however, take things a step further and add some decorations. You do not have to do all of the decorations listed in this section. Instead, choose the ones that appeal the most to you.

, This will give your crackers that final, elegant touch; it will also make them look more professional.


If you used curling ribbon, consider curling the ends instead, but running them between your finger and the end of a pair of scissors.

, Cut a 4 by 8-inch (10.16 by 20.32-centimeter) strip of contrasting paper, and wrap it around the middle of your Christmas cracker. Seal the edge with a strip of double-sided tape., This can be as simple as a Christmas sticker with a Christmas greeting on it. If this is for a party, consider using a ""To/From"" style label instead, and writing the person's name on it. Use this as a place setting for your dinner party in place of the standard nametag.

,, Many craft stores sell mini pine branches, holly leaves, and red berries for decorating gifts and wreaths with. These are great for Christmas cracker. Even though they are small to begin with, you might want to cut them down further so that they'd be more proportionate to your Christmas cracker. You can attach them to the body of the cracker, or to the ends where the ties are, with hot glue or pieces of clear tape.


If you are making blue, white, and silver Winter Wonderland-themed crackers, consider adding some mini, sparkly snowflake ornaments to them instead.

, An ink pad and a Christmas-themed rubber stamp can add a touch of old-timey design to a cracker covered with brown butcher paper. It will make the paper look more interesting, but it is simple enough to not detract from that cozy, rustic feel.

, This works great on construction paper, but you can use it on other types of glue as well. If you used wrapping paper or patterned scrapbook paper, you can use the original design as a guide. Glitter glue can take a while to dry, so it would be best to do this the night before your party.


You can also do this using puffy paint instead.

Think about what you know about your boss.,
Decide how much you want to spend.,
Gather up store ads in the newspaper or a generic website and browse through them to get ideas.,
Consider a humorous gift if your boss has a sense of humor.,
Craft an item with a group of coworkers.,
Personalize your gift.",How to Choose a Christmas Gift for Your Boss," Do they enjoy any particular activities, like sports cars, adventure climbing, or Roman history? Are they a bit geeky, a fan of certain shows, or obsessed with cooking? Hopefully you've had enough proverbial water-cooler conversations with to know the answer to some of those questions. This will help you form a small personality profile on them, allowing you to start brainstorming on what types of things they might like.


Take the time to have a personal conversation with them. Ask them questions about their family, their children, their weekends, their vacations. (Not all at once, it could look suspicious.) A personal conversation with your boss will give you a better understanding of their mannerisms and motivations as well as gift ideas.
Take a peek in your boss's office (if they have one). It is outfitted with a lot of technology? Think electronics. Does it have a lot of personal mementos? Think scrapbook or picture frame. Take a cue from your boss's work environment.;
, If it's a significant present, ask some of your co-workers if they want to chip in. Depending on your work situation, shoot to spend $100 or less. Any more and your boss might think you're trying to buy his or her favor.

, With their interests in mind and a set budget, you should find something that they will enjoy.

, If your boss is the kind of person who knows how to laugh at him/herself, especially, a funny gift could be the perfect opportunity to let off some steam and show your boss you care.


There are all manner of funny gifts you can get your boss. It's best to get something that won't make him/her feel self-conscious, so think of something that's non-threatening and may even stroke his/her ego:

A flying stuffed animal, such as a squirrel or a monkey.
A giant fist coozie.
A reindeer candy dispenser that dispenses candy out of its...backside.
A ""girlfriend"" or ""boyfriend"" pillow (A pillow shaped like the arm of a girl or a guy).
A giant ""impossi-puzzle.""


Consumable or disposable items also work well since your boss won't feel like the gift is just taking up space.
Avoid pranks, elaborate or otherwise. Stick to physical gifts if you can; pranks can turn sour if your boss isn't expecting them.

, Craft your boss something DIY or homemade, adding a little bit of a personalized touch, often for less money. Unless the craft item takes very little time to make, it's better to craft the gift as a group: You don't want your boss to think you're trying to curry favor or, even worse, romantically curious (if applicable).


Buy one of those ready-made gift baskets; even cheaper and more thoughtful is to gather items separately and create your own custom gift basket. This way you can truly personalize the basket and buy items you know they will not only like, but truly love (i.e. their favorite candy/beverage/snack).

, Whatever gift you decide on getting your boss, it's a good idea to add a personal touch. Personalization lets your boss know that you bought/made the present with him/her in mind. It's a nice sentiment, even if it's not exactly true.


Write a meaningful card. Don't simply sign it; say something you truly mean (i.e. ""I really enjoy our meetings,"" ""You make me smile when you talk about your children,"" or ""Thank you for your understanding when I was out sick"").

Gather the ingredients and equipment.,
Make the salt dough.,
Use cookie cutters to cut out shapes.,
Make holes in each ornament for hanging.,
Bake the ornaments.,
Decorate.,
Thread the ribbon.",How to Make Christmas Tree Decorations2," To make your salt dough ornaments, you will need one cup of plain flour, half a cup of salt and half a cup of water. You will also need Christmas themed cookie cutters (stars, Christmas trees, angels, wreaths, etc.) a cookie sheet, a rolling pin, some toothpicks, ribbon, and acrylic paints and glitter glue for decorating.

, In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt and water and stir until it forms a dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour -- though not too much, as this will cause the dough to crack., With a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough until it is about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) in thickness. Use your Christmas themed cookie cutters to cut out shapes in the dough. Place each shape on a floured surface as you cut out the rest of the dough.

, Before you bake your ornaments, you will need to make a little hole at the top of each where you can thread a ribbon to hang the ornament from your tree. Use a toothpick to make punch a hole near the top of each ornament, rotating the toothpick a little to make the hole wide enough for your ribbon to fit through.

, Place your salt dough ornaments on a floured cookie sheet and place on the middle shelf of an oven preheated to 250 °F (121 °C). Bake for two hours, then remove from the oven, place on a wire rack and allow to cool completely.

, Once the salt dough ornament have cooled, you can decorate them using the acrylic paints and glitter glue. Depending on personal preference, you can use a small paint brush to paint on intricate details, or you can simply cover the decoration in one block color. You can also glue on sequins, button and crystals for extra decoration.

, Cut a length of ribbon - preferably in red, green or white - and thread it through the hole at the top of the ornament. Secure with a knot and hang from the tree. If you like, you can write the date on the back of the ornament to remember when you made it!"

Stuff the snowman.",How to Make Christmas Tree Decorations3," To make your felt snowman ornament you will need pieces of felt in white, brown, orange and black. You will also need a piece of white ribbon (approximately 5 inches in length), a sewing needle and thread (in colors matching the felt), a pen, a scissors, some polyester fiberfill and a sheet of paper.

, Draw the outline of a snowman onto the sheet of paper. Make the snowman whatever shape you like -- two snowballs high, three snowballs high, fat, skinny -- it's up to you.


Cut the paper snowman outline, then place it on a piece of white felt.
Use your pen to trace the outline of the snowman onto the felt, then cut it out with the scissors.
Trace another snowman outline onto a second piece of felt and cut that one out too.
You should now have two identical snowman outlines.

,


Cut out five small circles from the piece of black felt. These will form the snowman's eyes, along with his three coal buttons.
Cut out a small triangle from the orange felt. This will form the carrot for the snowman's nose.
Cut out two stick shapes from the brown felt. These will be the snowman's arms.

, Take one of the white felt snowman outlines and hand-stitch the eyes, carrot nose and coal buttons into place. Use thread of a corresponding color for each piece, i.e. orange thread for the nose, and black thread for the other pieces.

,


Take the two white felt body pieces and line them up, placing the piece with the sewn-on features on top.
Take the brown felt arms and place them between the two body pieces, sticking out at an angle.
Take the length of white ribbon, fold it over, and insert the end between the two body pieces at the top of the snowman's head. This will form the hanging loop for the finished ornament.

, Take your needle and some white thread and hand-stitch the two body pieces together, leaving a seam allowance of only 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm).


As you're stitching, make sure to catch both of the snowman's arms and the looped thread in a stitch, in order to secure them in place.
Don't stitch the entire snowman closed just yet; leave a space of about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) to an inch open at the bottom.

, Take your polyester fiberfill and stuff it into the snowman, making him nice and plump. Once you've done this, you can finish the snowman by stitching the snowman closed. Hang your jolly felt snowman on the Christmas tree and admire your handiwork!"

Collect some clear glass ornaments.,
Remove the tops and pour in a little floor wax.,
Grab a selection of different colored glitters.,
Replace the top.,
Decorate the outside.",How to Make Christmas Tree Decorations4," They can be any size you like, just make sure that they have easily removable tops.

, Gently remove the tops from the glass ornaments (you don't want to damage them) and pour a small amount of floor wax or floor finish into the glass ball.


This may sound strange, but this is what allows the glitter to stick to the inside of the ball. Just make sure the product you use is acrylic based and clear drying.
Gently swirl the product around the inside of the ornament, making sure the entire inside surface is coated in floor wax.
Once you're done, you can pour the floor wax back into the bottle. Waste not, want not!

, Pour a substantial amount of your chosen glitter into the glass ornament and swirl it around until the glitter completely covers the interior of the ornament. Shake any excess back into the container of glitter.


You can choose any colors you like --gold, silver, red, blue, green, purple -- whichever ones go with the color scheme for your tree.
If you want to be really wild, you could even try mixing a few different colors for a real disco ball effect.

, Once the glitter has dried, you can replace the top of the ornament. Use a little to secure it in place if it feels in any way loose.

, If you like, you can leave the glitter ball ornaments as they are. Alternatively, you can decorate the outsides using snowflake- or star-shaped scrapbook stickers and some diamante sequins."

Take eight wooden clothespins.,
Glue the two halves of each clothespin together.,
Make the snowflake.,
Paint the snowflake.",How to Make Christmas Tree Decorations5," Eight wooden clothespins will make one snowflake ornament. Carefully separate each clothespin, removing the metal springs.

, Take some hot glue or wood glue and stick the flat sides of each clothespin together. Take a piece of ribbon, fold it in half, and insert both ends between two of the wooden pieces before you glue them. This will allow you to hang the ornament later.

, Assemble the snowflake as follows:


Take two of the glued-together pieces and align the flattened edges at the top to form a right-angle. Attach two more pieces to form an X shape.
Take the remaining four glued-together pieces and stick one in between each right angle. You should now have a snowflake.

, Paint the snowflake using white or gold spray paint. Paint with a slight, glittery shimmer can look very nice. Stick sequins or jewels onto the ornament as you see fit."

Make your Christmas tree cat-friendly.,
Buy or make presents for your cat.,
Prepare food and treats that are out of the ordinary.,
Play and spend time together.,
Avoid seasonal plants that may be poisonous to your cat.,
Make sure your cat is safe from other seasonal items.",How to Make This Your Cat's Christmas," To do this, hang no easily-breakable ornaments on the lower half of the tree. Place a tree in a room you are often in to avoid catastrophes. Put some of your cat's toys near or under the tree, and also a blanket or so under the tree, so your cat can enjoy sleeping there when you're in the room.;
, Ideas include:


A new chew toy, which makes tons of noise. This will give your cat lots of pleasure!
Some fancy food, or special cat milk.
A new bed
A new scratching post.


Buy presents according to your cat's personality, whether he or she is lazy or playful. There are also many ways you can make homemade toys that your cat may enjoy even more; see further How to make cat toys.

, You might want to buy or make some special food once or twice a week while it's December, so that your cat can feel the holiday spirit and joy. Make Christmas Eve the most exciting and special, offering a good piece of meat or fish for dinner.

, Play with your cat. He will have loads of fun and after all the fancy food could probably use the exercise. Let your cat snuggle up next to you in the couch and bed when you're watching TV or reading on Christmas day.

, Certain seasonally-common plants can cause illness or even fatalities in cats if chewed and/or swallowed. If you can't imagine your Christmas without these, consider purchasing silk versions.


Plants to beware of if you have a cat include: Poinsettia, ivy, mistletoe, holly berries, Christmas rose, Christmas berry and yew.

, Cats may be tempted by tinsel or string. If consumed, it can wreak havoc with their digestive systems, requiring emergency treatment. Although it is tempting to give Fluffy some of your Christmas leftovers, many Christmas dinner and snack items (see Warnings) can be hazardous to your cat's health. Keep tidy at Christmas -- you could save your pet's life!

"
Put gas in your SUV, or whatever it is you use to collect and deliver your gifts.,
Avoid the crazy crowds.,
Close your eyes (after you read this step).,
Decorate your house.,
Reach out to friends and loved ones.,
Enjoy Christmas television.,
Eat seasonal foods.,
Divide and conquer.",How to Get Into the Spirit of Christmas when You Don't Feel It Any More1," For you, the spirit of the season is about holiday parties at the office, finding a parking space at the mall, hustling and bustling to get the best deals, exchanging gifts with friends and loved ones, and best of all: the look of delight on your loved one's faces as they open the gift that's exactly what they wanted—even though they never said a word about it!


Maybe you've lost the spirit of Christmas, many others have, too. The over-commercialization of the holiday has sapped the pleasure from what should be a joyous time. It doesn't have to be that way.;
, Whatever your reason for the season, nothing can kill the holiday spirit quicker than being crushed against the front of a store by gun-wielding mobs of bargain-crazed shoppers.


Shop at the stores of local producers. Most of the things you can find in malls and big box stores are mass-produced, cheaply-produced junk anyway. Giving junk as gifts is almost as soul-sapping as being in shopping mob.
There are many gifts that fall outside the world of Christmas: handmade jewelry; artisan meats, breads, and cheeses; charitable gifts that donate money to a cause, given in the recipient's name; even gifts of things that you make well yourself, whether that's a hand-knit sweater, a work of art, a delicious dinner, or more. Simply ask yourself what you do well, and offer a bit of that as a gift.

, Now, imagine your best Christmas ever. It might have been when Santa got you that bike as a kid, or maybe that Christmas Eve that he proposed to you. Ask yourself: why was that special, and what did it feel like?


If it was simply that sense of wonder and how it felt like everybody was ""nicer"" somehow, then actively seek where that is happening. If it's the look of delight on children's faces, go find the best Santa in town, and soak in the total belief in a magic elf who delivers presents to children all over the world.
Keep a smile on your face, and walk with your head up, making eye contact as much as you can. Greet everybody—young and old, even people you might instinctively dislike—with a hearty ""Merry Christmas."" You may not even believe it yourself at first, but give it some time and effort.

, It doesn't matter if you have a house full of kids, or are just on your own. Enjoy the trappings of the season in any way you can.


If you have the space, head to the hills and harvest a tree. If that's not possible in your area, head to the local parking lot stuffed with trees.
Either way, get one a couple weeks before Christmas, turn on the Christmas music, put up the tree, and decorate it. Your home will smell like Christmas, and it's hard to be unmoved by that!
Add a wreath to your front door, so that every time you come home that's the first thing you'll see.

, It may be in the form of Christmas cards, or through the telephone or the Internet, if they're not nearby.


If you Skype or do a Google Hangout with video, set it up if you can so that your Christmas tree is in the background, all lit up.

, ""Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings!"" Whether your tastes run towards the traditional Miracle on 34th Street, the classics like A Christmas Carol by Dickens (or it's modern comedic take with Scrooged), stop-action animations like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer or Nightmare Before Christmas, or cult classics like A Christmas Story, holiday television is filled with nostalgia, humor, morality plays, and lots of simple, fun entertainment.

, It's the season of candy canes, eggnog, pumpkin pies, mulled drinks, and roasted foods. Whether you do it yourself, or pick up some yummies at the grocery store, the aromas from the kitchen combine with the aromas of the evergreens that can transport you back in time to that best Christmas ever!


Even if the kitchen is anathema to you, try it—make a batch of your favorite cookies, for you and your family. Snickerdoodles, peanut butter cookies, or just plain old sugar cookies are all good. And if you have kids, help them decorate those tasty morsels.

, If you dread the holidays because of all the work that has to be done—cooking, cleaning, wrapping, cleaning, more cooking, more cleaning, shopping, more cleaning...stop!


Share the load. If you have a spouse, make a plan. If you do the cooking, your spouse does the cleaning. If you do the shopping, they do the wrapping. Most Christmas chores are like that, so take advantage of your spousal unit to lessen the load. If you have kids, they can do the cleaning—and you have the perfect leverage. Just start whistling,
Oh, you better not pout, you better not cry,
you better watch out, I'm telling you why...
Santa Clause is coming to town!

Forget the crowds.,
Decorate your home.,
Turn on the music.,
Read the story of Christmas.,
Exchange gifts.,
Attend Christmas church services.,
Make the perfect Christmas dinner.,
Say this to yourself, and to all: ""Merry Christmas!""",How to Get Into the Spirit of Christmas when You Don't Feel It Any More2," For you, Christmas is about one thing, and one thing only: celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. Maybe the joy of the season has been lost by the secular nature of our society, or maybe you've been listening to the cynical entertainers on the radio telling you there's a ""war on Christmas."" None of that is relevant. Christmas is in your heart and in your faith. Everything else is noise and needless negativity.

, A beautifully-decorated tree, topped with a shining star, is as traditional as it is symbolic. Take extra care this year that your tree is everything you remember about the Christmases that used to inspire you.


Fill your house with the scents and lights of the season. Put candles in the windows (electric ones are safer than flame candles)—these were used by Irish Catholics to signal it was safe for priests to come and give them their sacraments, back during the Reformation when being Catholic could result in an early and generally painful demise.

, There is a wealth of holiday music that will bring forth warm memories of Christmases past, chief among those is the glorious Handel's Messiah. It is a work that is filled with familiarity, soaring themes, inspiring melodies, and brilliant passages.


Christmas carols are also wonderful and inspiring to listen too. It's hard to stay outside the spirit of Christmas when the spirit is flowing through you with these celebratory songs of joy. To make them even more meaningful, gather some friends and family this year, and go Christmas caroling in your neighborhood. Just stay warm, and have some hot chocolate or apple cider for when you get home!

, Instead of making Christmas morning a present-shredding frenzy, begin the day by reading Luke 2:1-20. You can memorize it, or you can read it alone, or share it with your family. Remembering the real reason for Christmas will do much to restore your faith in both the season, and in humanity.

, On the very first Christmas, the gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh were given to the baby Jesus, so you know gift giving is rooted in 2,000 years of tradition. Sadly, it's become almost completely about the gold, but that's not a tradition you need to foster.


Give small, meaningful gifts to those you love, whether or not you expect anything in return. Make it something meaningful, and something symbolic of your relationship and love.

, Christmas Eve services are special celebrations that are rich in tradition and history, and will help you be filled with love and joy.


Like the Christmas eve services, you will hear the story of Christmas, and share the celebration of this season with your faithful friends, neighbors, and family.

, That may vary, both on your tradition, your means, and your family. If you've always lavished your Christmas dinner with a great deal of attention and preparation and fuss, but you have grown weary of it, make it simple! Tell your family in advance, so they're not expecting the Christmas goose, and get grilled cheese sandwiches instead!


Make your family's favorite dinner—whether that's grilled tofu or your famous bacon-cheeseburgers, make what they love. Even if it's not a 4-course, gut-busting meal, they will be guaranteed to love it. And you'll love the lack of stress!
Take a cue from the Jews, and eschew the home-cooked Christmas feast. Go to your favorite Chinese restaurant, and please pass the soy sauce!

Happy holidays!

",How to Get Into the Spirit of Christmas when You Don't Feel It Any More3," You may not be able to escape it all—the holiday season is a cash cow, and every media outlet, new and old, will be pushing one message. As Tom Lehrer put it 50 years ago, ""Angels we have heard on high, tell us to go out...and buy."" To get back to the most primal reason for this season's festivities, start by modifying what you normally watch or listen to.


If you have cable TV, avoid the broadcast stations—the signal-to-noise ratio (noise being the Christmas marketing push) is very high. Instead, use your normal TV time to catch up on old movies you love, or the National Geographic channel or science channels for more celestial-type programming, or the History channel to learn how people celebrated the season before the rise of Christianity and later, Wall Street.
Turn off the radio. You'll be pitched every 10 minutes, or subject to Christmas music, or be harangued by talkers for participating in a ""war on Christmas.""
Shun the internet newsgroups, especially regarding topics that touch on any reason for celebrating the season. Somebody will always be there to rain on the parade, and usually with the most abusive attitude.
None of that will help you capture the spirit of the season as you see it.

, Whatever your solstice views are—be they pagan or secular—there are people out there who think as you do. A search in Google will give you a plethora of choices. If you live in a place where you're isolated, either by geography or by local culture, you can find like-minded people in Internet groups. Here are some things to look for:



Saturnalia. The Romans celebrated the return of the light by mandating feasting, gambling, ribaldry, and general merriment. The reason? This would vanquish Old Man Saturn, who was often depicted as Father Time, or even Death(not unlike how we ring in the new year now!). Saturnalia is celebrated from December 17th through December 24th.
If all that drinking, partying, and debauching is a bit much, December 25th—conveniently enough—is Juvenalia, a celebration of children. In old Roman times, children were entertained, given gifts, and feted.

Mithra. Not to be confused with either Mothra or Mithrandir, Mithra was the Persian sun god. Like virtually all celebrations of the season, it celebrates the return of the light, and the promise of renewal. According to legend, Mithra appeared from a rock, armed with knife and torch. Shepherds saw this, and greeted him with gifts.

Yule. Yule was the solstice festival of the Norse and Teutonic people of northern Europe. As part of the celebrations, a large green log was burned in the hearth. The festivities would last as long as the Yule log burned. The traditions of decorating the house with greenery—wreaths, trees, and boughs—originated with Yule. Like many other traditions, this was folded into the Christian celebrations of Christmas., As the winter solstice approaches, the days get much shorter. The further north you are, the shorter they get. Nature discards the old during this time, to make way for the spring.


You can rage against the dying of the light, or recognize that this is a simple celestial phenomenon that will give way to long days of renewal.
Set aside a half an hour every evening to meditate on that which you have lost during the year, and that which you wish to shed in the new year. Meditate also on what you wish the lengthening days to bring to your life.
If you're too busy to do a half an hour's meditation, do a full hour.
On the day of the solstice, spend the day in silence and reflection. Say a final goodbye to the losses, hurts, and regrets of the last year by writing them down on individual strips of paper, then burning them in the Yule fire.

, It might be for yourself, it might be for your family and friends. Incorporate any of the old celebrations, and understand that it's intimately tied to the concepts of darkness and light, death and birth, decay and renewal.


Have a feast! In most agrarian cultures, mid winter was a time of home and family and enjoying the bounty of the previous year. Create a feast for the season, with the kinds of food that would still be around from the autumn harvests. Cured meats, wildfowl, root vegetables, wine, hot drinks, fresh bread—all of it is fair game for your celebration harvest.
Give your celebration a name. It can be as simple as something like ""Feast,"" or as complex as ""The Carpren's Annual Celebration of Rebirth and Renewal.""
Create invitation cards that are like Christmas cards, only with your own theme.

, Put up a Yule tree, studiously avoiding an abundance of reds and greens. Stick with single-color lights.


White is nice, as it's reminiscent of sparkling snow.
Top your tree with a white orb representing the moon, instead of a star representing the star in the East that called the three wise men to Bethlehem.
If you have a fireplace, keep a fire going.
Give simple gifts. If you have to go to a mall, or if saving 25% is actually a significant amount of money, then don't buy it. Opt for small things from local artisans—be it a small wooden toy or an artisanal cheese.

, If you make the season (whatever you call it) a time of joy, and renewal, growth, and love, you'll find yourself having more spirit of the season than most people around you.

Be yourself.,
Merry Christmas!",How to Get Into the Spirit of Christmas when You Don't Feel It Any More4," No matter what your faith, belief, desires, traditions, or expectations, the season is about birth, about renewal, and about celebration. Look at it through the lens of those things that are most meaningful to you, and strive to make the days of this season reflect your own personal goals and desire. Remember: the spirit of the season resides, first and foremost, inside you.

, This will help when you put it back together. If possible, take a photo of the present pre-unwrapping.

, Most wraps are translucent, so you have a hint of what you got for Christmas. Also, if you already have a prediction of what you might be getting, feel around the package for any textures that might give it away. Take care not to feel around too hard or you might rip the wrapping paper.

, Don't completely sever the tape; use the knife or scissors to lift the edge of the tape away from the paper. Only do this on one side. Or simply use your fingers to carefully remove the tape. Replace the tape after you have seen the present. If you cut the tape, put another piece over the cut to make it less obvious.

, If you are lucky, you can see the present from one side. If not, carefully slide it out, don't rip the gift wrap. If you are having trouble don't unwrap it. Only because it may be obvious that you opened it.

, After you have seen the gift, put it back exactly how it was. Wrap the gift and tape it back up. Try not to leave any signs of tampering, and make sure to be very quiet.

And when attending church services and Christmas events, even if you don't speak the local language, it's still a great chance to soak up the atmosphere and see how other parts of the world celebrate Christmas.;
, An online search is a good place to start, as is speaking to locals., You can still make the day festive by doing special Christmas related things including reflecting on the occasion., It's a lot more enjoyable if you can celebrate with someone else at Christmas time. This might include your travel companion(s), people you've recently met and made firm friendships with, family and friends you know in the country you're in, etc. Just do your best not to spend the day alone but to share the occasion with at least one other person.


If you are alone that day, look at ways to be around people, such as attending church services, having a restaurant meal, etc.

, If you know you'll be traveling at Christmas time, it can be heartwarming to have a small memento from home that represents Christmas, such as a fabric ornament, a card, or a Christmas message from your family. Take it out on Christmas Day and display it or wear it as appropriate, to give yourself a little personal Christmas cheer.

, Let yourself be a kid again and enjoy the holiday spirit. Whether it’s leaving cookies out for Santa Claus, watching for Baba Noel out the window or leaving your clogs by the fire for Santa, indulge in a little holiday tradition and give into the magic.


Do some research about Christmas customs around the world. There are some great books that describe these traditions and give additional recipes and craft projects. The web is also a great resource for seeking out new and exciting traditions and new recipes.
Go to a local cultural center to learn about different Christmas customs. Many museums and libraries hold special holiday events and exhibits for the family to attend. Some Christmas tree festivals feature the usual tree decked out in ethnic ornaments and decor.
Do a little holiday time travel! You can also research holiday customs of American past. Christmas customs of years gone by are pretty much different than those of today. Popcorn and/or cranberry garland threading is a custom that is old as Victorian times. Before the glass balls in American holiday displays, came the ornaments made of paper and corn husks. Many moms fashioned granny dolls or yarn dolls for their daughters. Pick up any of these customs to put a twist on your modern celebrations.
Some customs however are not really practical or safe. Don't put candles on trees! You can use safer electric candles instead. Using real fruit or other edible items can be expensive and viewed by others as a waste of food. Select artificial or inedible ones instead.

, The possibilities for decorating are nearly endless. Put Christmas lights on your house. Hang mistletoe in the doorways (particularly if you know that special someone is coming over,) hang a homemade wreath on your door, or put Christmas figurines like Santa or Rudolph out on your counters.

, Go with your family to your local Christmas tree farm to cut your own or head to a lot selling pre-cut Christmas trees. Pick out a Christmas tree that fits your house. After you’ve gotten your tree situated, wrap it in lights and begin hanging the ornaments. Don’t forget to water it occasionally and safeguard it from pets!


You can decorate your tree with family heirloom ornaments or try something new by decorating a tree with Star Trek or superhero themed ornaments, or with little trains, or with Disney characters for example. It’s really up to you--be as creative or traditional as you like.

, For many people, Christmas is about gathering with friends and family to enjoy each others company and celebrate the holiday. The day is a national holiday and most folks get a day off work. Take advantage of this time to reconnect with friends and family. Create your own traditions or celebrate with the traditions that have been passed down in your family.

, Make it a potluck if you want to keep expenses (and the workload) manageable. The important thing is just to get together with people you love and make the winter a little warmer by sharing the warmth of caring with them. Consider making a traditional Christmas dinner complete with roast turkey, or create your own traditions by branching out and making whatever you want!

, Learn some Christmas or seasonal songs, and sing! It's fun, and even if your voice isn't great, hopefully, you won't be singing alone––you'll get some cover from your more talented friends! If you can’t go caroling for some reason, blast Christmas music throughout your house, while you’re wrapping presents, or during your Christmas party.


For song ideas, try songs like ""Frosty the Snowman,"" ""Holly Jolly Christmas,"" ""Silver Bells,"" “Walking in a Winter Wonderland,” “Jingle Bells,” “The Little Drummer Boy,” “Let it Snow,” or “It’s Beginning to Look a lot Like Christmas.”

, Have a movie night during which you invite friends or family over and serve hot apple cider and popcorn or cocoa and cookies. Play Christmas movies like “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” “It’s a Wonderful Life,” ""A Christmas Story"", ""Santa's Apprentice"" or any number of other seasonal movies.

, This is in the spirit of spreading joy, kindness, beauty and love during the Christmas season. Maybe you can volunteer at a homeless shelter, buy some vintage decorations at or donate some of your unwanted decorations to a thrift shop, drop spare change into the local charity drive bucket, help out someone with decorating like doing the tree for them and putting up outdoor lights, or maybe you could help with a local toy drive or food drive for those who have less than you do.

, You don't have to spend big bucks on gifts––small tokens are fine. Some families enjoy giving gifts to one another to show their appreciation for one another. You can buy gifts or make them yourself. Learn how to become an expert gift wrapper here.


Gather around the Christmas tree with your family on Christmas morning and exchange gifts. Or, sit by the fire with your loved one and enjoy Christmas together.

, There's nothing as fun to do on a Christmas night than to walk or drive around town and neighborhood looking at local decorations. Head down to the beach or the local park. In areas where it snows, go sledding or build a snowman! If there’s no snow, bundle up and go on a long walk or hike with your loved ones. It’s always great to get out of the house and breath in the fresh air.


If you live in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa or other countries in the Southern Hemisphere, your Christmas is likely to be a warm one. This gives you the opportunity to get outdoors and appreciate the beauty of nature and enjoy some of your Christmas Day swimming, walking, resting on the grass or playing a game outside together. Be sure to wear sunscreen and a hat!

, If someone says ""Let's cancel Christmas celebrations"" or something else negative, simply say something disarming, like, ""Sorry you don't enjoy this holiday. You're still welcome to come and join us for the day if you haven't got anyplace else to go."" No matter how they react, just blow them off as kindly as possible and continue your celebration, showing compassion to the poor Scrooge. Also, try and see things from their point of view. Ask them if they're going through a tough time or whether they have a specific problem. Don't be quick to judge.


Any one can get the holiday blues and become a Scrooge. Remember unfortunate things don't take a holiday even during the holiday season. Anyone can still experience problems with relationships at home or work/school. Teens and kids too be very emotional time bombs. Sometimes it's a death in the family or to a loved one. Hefty bills can cause many people on holidays to feel anxious. Any person can have a burnout or mental meltdown from having to do all the extra chores, shopping and decorating without help. If a certain element of Christmas sets off angry, sad, or emotional reaction try to eliminate that factor from the Scrooge's life if possible. Put yourself in the Scrooge's shoes how would you feel in his/her situation.
If a tradition starts upsetting you or anyone in your life feel free to adjust them or to omit them. Compromise, discuss and negotiate. Entire families or individuals within may grow out or be bored of family traditions, decor and customs.
Try or suggest some of other ways to celebrate Christmas in this article for a Scrooge.

"
"
Reflect on the reason for Christmas.,
Invite God to come and celebrate the day with you.,
Choose some activities that you and your friends or family will enjoy and which fit with the meaning of Christmas.,
Spend time with others to celebrate.,
Give to others.,
Spend time quietly being thankful for the gift of Jesus to the world that we celebrate on Christmas.,
Create your own nativity scene.",How to Celebrate Christmas2," If you're not sure about it or you're rusty on the background, do some research. In the Bible, you can find the Christmas story in the Gospel according to Luke, Chapters 1 and 2, as well as the Gospel according to Matthew Chapters 1 and 2. Consider reading these chapters aloud as part of your family's holiday. Ask members of the family for their own impressions of the stories given, to personalize their understanding.


Talk to children about the meaning of Christmas and tell them the stories about Christmas. Find beautiful illustrations to accompany the Bible stories to capture their interest. Also, keep in mind that doing this for too long might bore their pants off. Try to keep these sessions short, something they can cherish.
There are also many great children books and coloring books that illustrate the Christmas Story in an easy to read format. Some books take the Christmas story verses directly from the Bible others tell the story in the way that's different.
In many cultures it's a custom to have the youngest (able) child place the baby in the cradle or the cradle in the stable of the Nativity Scene. A religious store can supply also Tree of Jesse symbol activities and you can cut Christmas cookies into camels, angels, Nativity figures, stars, crosses using cookie cutters. If you look around in some old Christmas books there are easy and fun crafts for religious ornaments for the whole family.
Decorate a small 1 to 4 foot tree with angels, Nativity Scene figure ornaments, Nativity charms from a bracelet and jewel tone or metallic ornaments. A star, angel or crown can be placed on top of such a tree.
You can easily incorporate religious ornaments into the main Christmas tree, use religion as a theme or use suggestions from the previous paragraph. Don't be afraid to add actual everyday Christmas items and scenery to your tree that doesn't have commercial in it. Animals, flowers, fruits,bells,candles, houses are good examples.Poinsettias and holly don't have to be commercial icons or any flower or creature that's seen on Christmas. Not even a snowflake or the snowman. Choose a plain teddy bear not the Santa Bear. Queen's Lace flowers or something that closely resembles Frankincense and Myrrh can also be included in flower arrangements.
Frankincense and Myrrh oils can be purchased in many herb, candle or floral shops and used as fragrance instead of traditional holiday scents.

, Some people choose to do this by attending a Christmas Eve service. Some do it by sitting before the Christmas tree and silently inviting God to just be with them. However you decide to do it, for the Christian, making God a part of your day is vital.

, Consider preparing some special foods for the poor and needy, visiting people who live alone or have no family close or dropping in to see the sick in the hospital. You might even give handmade gifts to people who aren't likely to get much this season.

, Gather together at the homes of friends and family, and spend some time in fellowship with others who believe as you do during this special time.

, Whether to your family and friends, or to others less fortunate, spend some time this Christmas in giving. We give in remembrance of the gifts of the Magi to the Savior, but at the very heart of it all, recall that we are to give because He first gave to us.

, This is the day that Christians have set aside to celebrate the beginning of the greatest gift mankind has ever received. Coming into the Christmas season with a grateful heart is essential if you really want to make the extension from Jesus's giving of His amazing gift to your giving and receiving.

, A beautiful way to celebrate Christmas is to create a nativity scene within your house or on your front yard. If you have children, ask them to help you. They will (or might not, it depends) love making the little angels and other figures.


If you can't create your own nativity scene, consider attending a Nativity play at your local school or church.

Involve your children in your family’s traditions.,
Tell your kids Christmas stories.,
Help your children believe in Santa unless they are over eleven years old (By that time, they usually stop believing in Santa).,
Decorate Christmas cookies.,
Have your children help decorate the tree.,
Show your children how to hang stockings by the hearth.",How to Celebrate Christmas3," Wherever you live in the world, teach your kids your family’s traditions at a young age. There is something about Christmas time that is absolutely magical to children.br>

, You can do this by reading to them, telling them stories before bedtime, or watching Christmas movies with them. A great idea is to buy a book about all the Christmas traditions around the world. This will give your children an opportunity to learn about other cultures’ traditions.

, Explain who Santa is and how he is going to come visit your house. To really help your children's belief in Santa, help them leave cookies out for Santa on Christmas Eve. When they are asleep, eat the cookies, leaving some crumbs as evidence and drink the milk (if any was left out.) If your child leaves Santa a note, create a note from 'Santa' thanking your child or answering questions that he or she may have asked. Make sure you write the letter in a different handwriting than your normal one.


You can also leave carrots out for the flying reindeer. Have your kids leave carrots out for the reindeer and when they’re asleep, nibble on the carrots, leaving some gnawed pieces behind as evidence.

, Whip up a batch of sugar cookies or gingerbread cookies and have your children decorate them (heck, you can decorate them too!) Your kids will love making their cookies into colorful, delicious creations.

, Once you have put up the Christmas tree and wrapped it in lights, gather your family together to decorate it. If your children are very little, help them along by lifting them up. Assign them special ornaments that they get to put up on the tree.

, If this is part of your Christmas tradition, your children will love the anticipation of hanging their stockings by the fire and waiting for Santa. A cute idea is, when your children are asleep, to fill their stockings and then take them off the hearth and leave them at the foot of their bed. In the morning, ask them to bring their stockings into your room and you can all open your stocking gifts on your bed.

Choose ritual and tradition over gift giving.,
Avoid spending money you don't have.,
Learn some of the non-commercialized Christmas songs.,
Mute the ads.,
Avoid decorating for holidays in a commercial way.,
Keep Christmas in December or at least after Thanksgiving!,
Don't let commercialism steal the beauty out of things that occur around the holidays.",How to Celebrate Christmas4," Establish family rituals and traditions that honor the spirit of Christmas and involve all family members. It might be attending church as a whole family, it might be giving a meal preparation task to each member of the family, however young or old, or it might be writing heartfelt letters to one another describing how their acts of kindness have helped you through the year. Whatever your ritual (or set of rituals), place more emphasis on caring and sharing than trying to outdo one another with gift giving.

, Don't go into debt for the sake of one holiday. You don't have to give expensive purchased gifts; instead, you can make a gift. Many people feel a homemade gift is better because it shows thought and consideration for the recipient. Give within your means, people will understand and you set an excellent example that liberates others from the consumer treadmill.


Gift ideas include: bookmarks, framed family photos you have taken over the year, holiday cookies or breads, or ""cookie kits"" (the flour, sugar, baking powder, chocolate chips and other spices are layered in a plain Mason jar, and instructions attached to a piece of raffia or a ribbon letting them know what to add, whether it's water, oil, egg, or whatever). See How to make your own Christmas gifts for more ideas.

, There are some beautiful carols that you can sing together––maybe someone in your family or circle of friends can play the piano or guitar; if so, encourage them to play, and have a sing-along. Consider carols like ""O Come All Ye Faithful,"" ""Joy to the World,"" and ""The First Noel."" You can find the lyrics online if you don't know them.


Other songs with scenery like ""Winter Wonderland"", ""It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year""""It's Beginning to Look Lot Like Christmas"" "" Sleigh Ride"", "" No Place like Home for the Holidays"". Also consider the Antarctica movie theme song . These can be great non commercial additions to any playlist.
""Ring Christmas Bells"" ""Give Love on Christmas Day"" ""Jingle Bells"","" O Christmas Tree""""Where Are U Christmas"" ""This Christmas"" ""Baby It's Cold"" ""Let it Snow"" ""Alone on Christmas"" ""Somewhere in My Memories""""Holly Jolly Christmas"" ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"" don't have a strong commercial message in them even thou they are often played in Christmas commercials or accompany promotions during the holiday season. Even thou some songs may mention ""Santa"" once or twice. He's not the main focus of the song. Also the Nutcracker Ballet Suite and ""Feliz Navidad"" have nothing to do with commercialism. ""12 Days of Christmas"" is not a going shopping song but the ""gifts"" are really religious symbols.
Also you can play philanthropic songs that also are about goodwill toward others and that inspire a good feeling ""Stuff That Dreams are Made Of"" ""Heal the World"" ""Earth Song"" ""Seeds of Love"" ""I Hope You Dance"" for example ""We are the World"" makes a great holiday song as well!

, Try to stop the ""buy this for Christmas"" ads from invading your home life. The consumer economy has its place but it shouldn't really be in your living room during a sacred season. Teach kids to mute the ads and do it yourself. Or, record your favorite shows and fast forward your way through them. Everyone will feel more peaceful, and there is less incitement to go shop till you drop.


Avoid blindly obeying the encouragement of retailers to make Christmas all about consumerism, as that is far from the true meaning, regardless of whether you're religious or not.

, You don't have to decorate your home or Christmas tree with presents, stockings, or the traditional figures of Christmas like elves and Santa or even Licensed Characters. Do we see these enough on TV or DVDs? Simply your home and yard doesn't have to become another advertisement for the next new decoration trend or look like a Christmas mall display. This doesn't mean not to decorate with the latest technology but don't make it so obvious. Look around and consider using other decorations that represent real life items of the season or artistic ornaments. If you must use Santa or commercial icons try not to make it the focal point of the decor. Santa although a well loved Christmas icon for many people, may be viewed as a commercial tool of retailers by others. It can also like commercialism take away from the true meaning of the season and cause stress and discomfort for some people. Make note how Red and Green, Sparkling Flashy decor or Candy Cane stripes can be viewed the same way.


Also try to keep the light displays tasteful and not have your house looking like the Vegas Strip. Thousands of lights,an over flashy or overly bright display can for some people symbolize the ""more is more"" commercial message.If you have an outrageous outdoor display try to limit the time it's on or how long it's up to avoid neighbor disputes and high energy bills. Humble Decor may make the local Grinch or Scrooge smile and give you a compliment. It can also help avoid neighborhood light competitions that can get out of hand easily.
Your color scheme doesn't have to be the traditional red, white, and green thing. Any color theme can work for any holiday. Freddy Krueger's sweater is well red and green stripes!

, Another disturbing trend that retailers and some people are doing is called pre-Christmas decorating. Some know how to do this slowly and gracefully by taking it few items of Christmas Decor at a time per weeks. This sounds fun and great at first but it will cause much more stress and headaches than an outrageous light display because people full forced into ""have to be the Christmas spirit"" rather it's Thanksgiving, Halloween, 4th of July. You won't be spreading joy but instead spreading discomfort or stress for you, the community, and your family. Considerate decorating can also cure the Scrooge or Grinch syndrome.


Also make note how some seasonal decor and new marketing schemes are becoming too much like Christmas. Some toy stores are starting to turn the Easter Bunny into Santa Claus! What idiot came up with Christmas in July? Do we really need an entire Halloween tree complete with a ""black evergreen""? Lights and other small decor is not so obvious. Tinsel Jack-o-Lantern and Tinsel Snowman is not a big deal.

, A pristine snowflake, the flaming red poinsettia, the festive shiny leaves of holly or the beautiful evergreen tree. Reindeer are an actual real creatures. The nutcracker actually is tool used to crack nuts instead of guarding presents. Toy soldiers, trains, villages, bears, doggies, the sweet sound of jingle bells, or the sweet taste of candy canes don't always have to be associated with Santa or commercial logos. Every snowman doesn't have to be named Frosty.

Prepare early.,
Help your children write the letter if needed.,
Choose how you will send the letter.,
Prepare the Santa letter for sending.,
Wait patiently.",How to Send Santa Letters," When the Christmas rush begins, it can be easy to overlook sending Santa's letter on time. Doing it early can help you learn what your child is hoping to get for Christmas and gives your child something else to look forward to.

, If they do not know what to write, suggest they say hello and hope Santa is well, introduce themselves, and let Santa know what gifts they are hoping to get this year (leaving them to decide how vague or detailed a list they care to make). Try to make it an exercise in being polite, organized, and learning that we do not always get what we ask for. This is better than going on about being a ""good boy or girl,"" which is both subjective and open to misinterpretations by the child about his or her own worth if they don't get what they asked for.


Read through the letter in case there is anything that does not make sense. Have your child correct anything that does not make sense, but do not worry about spelling or grammar errors.

, The method of sending will impact the method of its creation.


If the letter will be sent by snail mail, have your child write it on paper and place the letter in the envelope. Let your child decorate the envelope if he or she wishes to do so.
If it will be sent online, it will need to be typed into the online form. If your child needs help with this, pull up another chair and have him or her sit next to you as you type; otherwise, just have them type and ask for you to check it before they submit. (This also gives you a good opportunity to take a screenshot for a keepsake.)

, The following outlines how to post or email the letter.


Send it by post. Write the following address on the envelope:

Santa Claus, Arctic Circle, 96930 Rovaniemi, Finland. Or,
Santa Claus, North Pole, H0H 0H0, Canada
Post it. Do not forget to add sufficient postage. A big part of the fun is to have your child place it into the letterbox. Make a ritual of it.


Send it online. Look for ""Write Santa Claus at Home"" at http://www.santa-at-home.com/writesanta.shtml. This is a free service.

Fill out the basic information needed stating whether it is for a boy or girl and his or her age.
Under ""Send Santa Your List for Christmas"" type the Christmas list.
Below the text box is an envelope, enter the child's first name and your (or the child's) email address.
Once you have completed the envelope form, click on ""Send Your Letter to Santa.""



, Santa will get back to you soon.

Identify your own triggers in advance.,
Take it all in stride.,
Remain pleasant even if this means gritting your teeth.,
Be polite and then move away.,
Emphasize all the things your family has to be grateful for.,
Be tough on alcohol consumption.,
Be understanding and compassionate instead of angry and ""right"".,
Take a breather.,
Prepare yourself to enjoy the festivities.",How to Avoid Fighting on Christmas," You know yourself better than anyone; you also know which family members have the ability to set you off. Often it's a case of like versus like, in which you choose to pick on the other person because they personify something you don't like about yourself. This is unhelpful and certainly only serves to make the other person feel defensive. If you know what sets you off, you can remind yourself that it's your feelings getting worked up and that you have control over how to respond.


Remind yourself that you don't have to prove anything. Pride inside the family den can be bad for family relations. If cousin George has a bigger car than yours, so what. If Aunt Betty wants to cook the Brussels sprouts her way, then don't interfere. There are a lot of things you can let slide without having to make a fuss over it.
Quit being stubborn. What is the point of haranguing a family member on the same point over and over again? Just what are you trying to prove? And if you do manage to prove anything, just what does that solve?
Identify a ""warning word"" with your spouse. As soon as your spouse thinks you're drifting into dangerous territory, they casually work the warning word into the conversation. This will let you know that you've gone too far and should start backing off if at all possible.;
, Christmas involves seeing a lot of people you ordinarily avoid, or at least appreciate not seeing much. Begin by accepting that you don't see these people very often, so stay calm and restrained when you do; it's only for a few hours, or a few days. When they make remarks that rile you, let them pass and don't give them the attention the person is seeking. Be ""zen"" about things.


Ignore hypocritical remarks about yourself, your family members, your gifts, your home, etc. Realize that such comments usually say more about the the person saying them than about the intended target.
Find ways to relax during the holidays. It can be a stressful time for even the most efficient and unflappable, so don't get down on yourself if you happen to be worked up. Exercise, go to performances or take part in entertainment, and find a little time for yourself.
Practice the art of detachment. Sure, nasty things are being said but why give those things credence by believing or accepting them? Stay detached, meaning that you can remain considerate of the thoughtless person without trying to rescue, trump or oust them. Instead, you just let them be, and let their own issues show them up for the person they are. They are probably trying to get a rise from you.

, This is of especial importance if it's your home and you're the host. The duty of the host is to ensure that everyone is comfortable and having a good time, not nurture sparring matches. Think about the purpose of the day and the importance of maintaining harmony for everyone present.


Avoid getting involved in gossip or picking on anybody. Even if this is a family tradition, it soon devolves into nasty words and becomes contagious, taking in the people around the table as well. If someone does try to gossip, cut it off quickly and politely.
Don't fight fire with fire. If someone is hankering for a fight, it's best not to give them the satisfaction of getting angry, flustered, or offended. If fighting is what they want, give them unmitigated politeness. This will make it useless for them to continue seeking trouble.

, If you know that things will only degenerate into a fight, say a few nice greetings and then stay away from this particular relative. This may include sitting away from them, buffering yourself by sticking to other people and blocking your ears whenever any rude comments are deliberately made too loudly. Simply keep your distance all day but be polite at any stage of an encounter.


Stay busy. Even if you're not the host, you can offer to do things all day in order to flit in and out of conversations. Pour the bubbly, keep an eye on the roast chicken, care for the little kids, etc. As well as getting you out of everyone's hair, you'll be appreciated for being the ""helpful one"".
If the person in question consistently ruins the family engagement, consider offering them a warning about their behavior. Tell them that if they cause any trouble, say nasty things, etc., that they'll be asked to leave and won't be invited again. It's tough love, but it's still love.
Avoid competitive games or any other artificial excuses for tensions to bubble up to the surface. It's fun playing Monopoly or Apples to Apples, but the competitive spirit can take hold and ruin the atmosphere. Don't play unless you're sure that everyone will be able to survive the game with high spirits.

, While it may seem a little Pollyanna-ish, it is important to remind everyone about the importance of your family ties and the things that are good about your family. If you want to, take turns selecting one good thing to say about every single person at the table.


Give lots of hugs. Hugs have healing power and can help to lighten up even the angry soul.
Greet everyone effusively upon first meeting them. A loving and inclusive greeting can do a lot to set off relations in the right direction for the rest of the day, especially for relatives you haven't seen for a while.
Do the unexpected. Help someone out with supper; calm the kids down when they're antsy; take the dog out for a walk. The holidays are about doing something extra for people you care about. That kind of effort is infectious.

, If you're the host, keep alcohol to the bare minimum so that it can't be an excuse for antagonistic behavior. Remind all-comers of their responsibility to not drink and drive and to be considerate of everyone else by not becoming drunk. The same goes for yourself; refrain from drinking.

, Christmas time can be a very hard time of year for some people. If family members have lost a job or loved one, experienced financial or emotional hardships during the year, or are suffering from an illness or depression, Christmas time tends to be hard on them.


Since everything stops and it's about ""making merry"" and giving gifts, it can often serve as a time of reflection for such family members, who worry about their losses, lack of money, sadness, etc. while everyone else seems so well off. Instead of winding them up, try to engage them in conversation about their year and commiserate with them over their hardships.
Respect them, even if they don't respect you. You don't have to love them or like them, but you should make an effort to respect them. What this means is accepting that they have a different opinion than yours, and that they are entitled to it, however nasty or curious they act. It will make you a stronger person.

, If you feel like it's all too much, take time out. When one side of the family starts ganging up in what they feel is a good-natured session of teasing, simply excuse yourself and dash off to another room for a break. You can have a cry, write furiously on your Facebook page or simply do some deep breathing.


If you're visiting, make your visit short and sweet. Leaving everyone wondering is better than leaving no stone unturned.
Socialize with the people that you do get along with. Just because there's someone you don't get along with doesn't mean you have to quarantine yourself from the whole group. Eat, drink, and be merry with the people you love.
Remind yourself of how good you have it. Take a breather by reminding yourself of how much you actually have: Friends, family, opportunities. It's a quick mental exercise that will leave you feeling relieved and non-confrontational.

, If you go into Christmas thinking it'll be a fight-fest, you've already primed yourself for the worst. Instead, be determined to enjoy yourself regardless of other people's miserable or nasty attitudes and their negativity can slide right off you.

Just treat it like a normal day.,
Keep busy to make time fly and keep yourself preoccupied.,
Make sure you save some work (like cleaning and wrapping) for this day so you have something to do!",How to Pass Time from Christmas Eve to Christmas Morning1," Don't think about tomorrow, as you will become more excited and anxious for the joys that await, and you won't be able to concentrate on doing anything, and when you're waiting for something to happen it'll feel like a lot longer than it actually is.;
,


To do this you should treat the day like it's just an average day. Activities such as meeting up with friends and doing something (NOT shopping as you may accidentally purchase something someone has already got for you.) or walking/running, swimming or even staying at home and doing homework, cleaning your room will keep your mind off the christmas and on the task at hand so you don't feel super christmassy.

, If you find yourself without any work (any type of work or activity is homework, cleaning, wrapping etc.). Your mind will find it's way back to christmas! So this is probably the first time you'll ever read this, but skip a nights homework! It'll give you something to do.

Follow a routine.,
Tire yourself out.,
Give yourself a spa treatment, if you're a girl or have a good idea of what to do as a guy.,
Use the reading method.",How to Pass Time from Christmas Eve to Christmas Morning2," Make it feel average, just like in the day.

, Lie down and relax. Curl up on the couch with hot chocolate and a movie to watch. Don't get up, but get comfy. Don't watch an action movie!

, If you don't have anything, or you're a guy who can't think of anything, take a hot bath with bath salts and rose petals also listen to calming music, maybe even light a candle. File your nails, or get a massage.

, Snuggle up in bed with a good book, preferably one you've read and one that's very easy. Read until you don't want to anymore or until you can't keep your eyes open. Then, go to the bathroom and read more until you're extremely tired out. Falling asleep should be a breeze.

"
"
Sleep for as long as possible.,
If you can open your stocking, do so.,
If you decided to make breakfast and you know your parents would let you, make an elaborate breakfast.,
If you have to stay in your room, read this.,
If you can leave your room, read this.",How to Pass Time from Christmas Eve to Christmas Morning3," If you wake up, unless you have to use the bathroom, don't look at the clock or even open your eyes. Sleeping is an ideal way to pass time.


Pretend that you have to wake up when your parents wake up, so you want to fall asleep and sleep in. If you are up hours, or even just an hour before you are allowed to wake up your parents/open presents it will feel like a lot longer as you are waiting in suspense, so keep yourself (quietly) occupied.
If you wake up and can't get back to sleep then do a quiet activity that doesn't involve electronics (ie reading, writing, tidying your room).

, Open it very slowly. Now, you have more new entertainment.


If you have to wait until everybody's up to do stockings then follow the suggestions in the previous step to keep yourself occupied. By now other excited siblings (if you have siblings) are probably starting to wake up as well. Tell them that you can't wake your parents up yet and suggest things to do such as: make the family breakfast (if you are allowed to use the toaster, jug etc), play a board game, play video games together (quietly!)

, Not just microwave pancakes, go big. French toast, eggs, homemade pancakes/waffles, etc. Then, savor each bite like it's your last.

, Siblings are a great way to entertain if you can't leave. You can tell each other stories and play games and do endless things. You could also use electronics. Watch TV, browse the web, etc. You could also read or do homework. Find entertainment in the things you've got. Cleaning might be your best bet because you need room for your gifts.

, The steps above are also available. Watch something in the living room. Look around at the gifts. Observe the tree.


If parents/guests/pets/siblings are sleeping refrain from things such as TV, talking on the phone and anything noisy as you may wake sleeping people.

Don’t feel obligated to attend every family event.,
Help out when you’re able to do so.,
Tell older family members when they are being too controlling.",How to Maintain Boundaries with Family Living Nearby1," The best part about living close to family is that you’re able to be a part of each other’s lives. This includes attending meaningful events, such as birthday parties, bar mitzvahs, and soccer tournaments. That said, it’s important to realize that you are not obligated to attend all of the events your family members invite you to.You don’t need a specific excuse either. It’s totally fine to say something like, “I’m gonna head home and catch up on some rest tonight, but I’m looking forward to catching Jimmy’s match next week.”
Understand that you might receive some backlash or a guilt trip when you decline. Make your needs clear in a respectful manner and, if pressed, remind them that you don't need to justify yourself.
Many people experience feelings of guilt when they consider turning down family events. Consider writing down your values (such as ""self-care"" or ""maintaining balance in my life"") and referring to this list when you begin to feel guilty. Family, certainly, is one of your values, but reminding yourself of your other values may help.;
, Another benefit of living near people you love and trust is the assistance that you can offer one another. Even little things, like stopping by a relative’s after a snowstorm to help them clear the driveway, can go a long way. At the same time, you are not obligated to do everything a family member asks of you.In fact, it’s worth remembering that helping someone too much can prevent them from taking care of themselves to their full ability.
Whatever your reason, of course, feel free to say something like, “I really can’t swing by right now. If you’re still having trouble with your router this weekend, I can maybe come check it out on Saturday?”

, Sometimes, your parents (or your in-laws) may believe they know better than you about something. While people often continue to learn from their parents throughout their lives, there is also a point at which you are fully capable of making decisions on your own, especially regarding social boundaries.In short, don’t hesitate to reassure older relatives by saying something like, “I really do appreciate your desire to be involved in my life, but I’ve made up my mind. It feels like you’re trying to control my life, and I do not need you to do so.”

, Be nice of course, but don't go around hugging and kissing him if you just met him. After a while you can start doing these.

, You're gonna be living together, so even if you hate him, try to be nice and if necessary, keep your distance.

, Haven't you ever thought: how awesome would it be to live with my best friend? Well if you like him and you have a good time together, you can really enjoy living together.

, Nobody expects you to love him right away, you don't even have to be friends. But if the time comes where you do love him( or love spending time with him), don't be afraid to tell anyone, its perfectly normal to love someone you spend a great amount of time with.

, It's great if you have one, but if you have another brother( especially if he's younger) you might want to keep talking and spending time with him, don't let him feel left out.

, If you are still not very close and you have a big fight, it can really tense things up in the future. In this case, keep your distance or apologize if necessary and try to forget about it as quick as possible.

, If it gets to the point where you always feel the need to be with him, slow down, you shouldn't feel like this in early periods of the relationship, he also has a life, so don't be with him all the time, like when is friends come over or he's spending time in his room, if you do this to much, he will get tired of you.

",How to Get to Sleep on Christmas Eve," Doing this will make you more tired when you want to go to bed.


The night before Christmas Eve stay awake as long as you can. Set your alarm clock for a very early time like 6 o'clock. When you wake up you will be very tired and want to go back to sleep, but resist the urge. When you have to go to sleep on Christmas Eve, you will fall asleep easily because you are so tired.
If you have a calendar in your bedroom, turn it back to a different month and pretend it's that month during the night. Make a playlist on your iPod of songs you liked listening to in that time to capture the feeling even more.;
, Do some jumping jacks, go for a walk or do some cycling. If it's too snowy outside to exercise, play an exercising game, such as Wii Fit.

, This will wear out your brain and make you tired.

, Keeping busy and being helpful will take your mind off the excitement but will still help you to feel involved and happy.

, Tracking Santa's progress around the world is always a great way to get you excited for Christmas on Christmas Eve! Use websites such as NORAD Tracks Santa or Google Santa Tracker.

, Tell yourself that tonight is not Christmas Eve. Do the same things you always do in your bedtime routine: brush your teeth, read a book, chat with your friends, etc..


Say to yourself: ""What am I gonna do tomorrow?"" -- like it's any normal day: ""Oh, hey, tomorrow maybe I will hang out with my 'bud', ______"".

, A technique that, strange as it sounds, works well is to play a quiet game you can play alone (or with another hyper and excited friend or sibling), such as Mad Libs, while in bed. This will help take away your energy and help you fall fast asleep. Santa come a lot quicker than you thought!

, Although this may seem counterintuitive, exercise can help to calm you down. A couple hours before you go to bed, see how many push-ups, crunches, or jumping jacks you can do in your room. Exercise only for thirty minutes, though; you don't want to stay up too late. Exercising is a great way to help you feel physically tired so that your body will want to sleep. Better still, it will take your mind off Christmas for a little while.

, Having a warm bath will relax your muscles and make it easier to fall asleep. Squirt bath toys at imaginary targets, submerge yourself in bubbles, and relax your muscles. Try scented bubbles and soap.

, This might spoil any surprises and will keep you very excited and awake! Remember, Santa Claus knows when you are sleeping and when you are awake. He won't come if you are peeking.

, The milk provides calcium, magnesium, and L-tryptophan, which can help you sleep. You can also try hot herbal tea; it is very soothing and calming to drink Just make sure it's decaffeinated!


When you're setting up a cookie plate for Santa is a great time to have some warm milk.
Or, drink hot chocolate after you are in your pajamas. This will also help you to relax and keep warm! Don't drink coffee. The caffeine in it can keep you awake.

, If you are just jumping up and down and feeling hyperactive, you need to calm down; you're only feeding a buildup of excitement that it'll be hard to come down from. Read a book. Listen to music. Whatever makes you calm down and relax.


Read a book. It can be about Christmas, although it doesn't really matter. Try reading a school textbook, a really boring one from your least favorite class. Read a boring book to induce sleepiness; read an exciting one to get lost in and to help take away the urgency of thinking about Christmas things. Some good non-Christmas books are Harry Potter, Twilight, School of Fear, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid. They are fairly long and can keep you occupied for a while.
Burn a sweet scented candle for a little while in a safe place in your room. The scent will help you to relax, particularly if you choose a scent like lavender or jasmine. Just make sure to extinguish it before you fall asleep!

,, Scrunch up really tightly—as tightly as you can. Hold that position for 30 seconds, then relax again, trying to stay still. You will become tired. This is important for anytime you try to get to sleep; but relax and close your eyes.


See some of the related wikiHow links in this article for more ideas on helping you to fall asleep, or visit the whole category on better sleeping.
Fluff your pillow. If you fluff your pillow, it will give you something more comfortable for your head to rest on and make it easier to fall asleep.

, If the pet is small enough to fit in your bed (or wherever you are sleeping), try to fall asleep with it. It helps you to sleep when you have someone else in the room with you. It will make you fall asleep a bit faster, although if it is a hamster of something of that size you may squish it.

, If cold, turn a heater on, put on some warm and comfortable clothes, or put some extra blankets on your bed. Just make sure you don't make yourself too hot, or it will be just as hard to fall asleep as it is when you're cold. If too hot, turn on the air conditioning, or open a window and sleep with just a sheet on you.

, Any of these methodical, centering and calming methods will help to move you out of being too excited into a calmer state, which may help you to feel sleepy. Try focusing on each of the sheep as they jump over the fence (or any other high platform). What do they look like? What type of fence are they jumping over? How high are they jumping?  Focusing on these details will let your mind trail way from the idea of Christmas and will help you fall asleep.

, (Wiggle them for a moment.) ""Relax my arch. Relax my ankle. (Flex your ankle.)"" It might sound corny but it really does work through the power of suggestion. Continue, working all the way up to your head. Even keeping up the effort of concentration on doing this is a great distraction from the night's excitement. You may not even get up to your head before you're snoozing away!

, This seriously helps.


Make a playlist on your iPod ""sleep songs."" Soothing music will definitely help take your mind off Santa, and lull you to sleep.

, The light actually fools your body into thinking it's not bedtime.


If you watch TV before bed, try to turn off or down all the other lights, so the room is darkened. That will get your body ready to sleep.

, If you still have trouble going to sleep, watch a movie. Some good Christmas movies that play a lot during Christmastime include: A Christmas Story, The Polar Express, Elf, Home Alone 1, 2, 3, and 4, How The Grinch Stole Christmas, A Charlie Brown Christmas, A Christmas Carol, It's A Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, The Santa Clause: 1, 2 and 3, Frosty the Snowman, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

, Make sure that the whole family agrees with it. That way, when it turns (for example 7:00) everyone is prepared to get up. If you get up earlier than this, have some breakfast, go to the washroom, get ready so that you actually look OK on video.


If you know you are going to be videotaped in the morning, prepare your best set of PJ's. You don't want everybody to remember you wearing that raggedy old t-shirt and a pair of shorts on Christmas morning, do you? Don't forget to brush your hair in the morning before galloping downstairs!

Communicate what you are feeling.,
Articulate specific boundaries.,
Insist that your wishes are respected.,
Establish boundaries one step at a time.",How to Maintain Boundaries with Family Living Nearby2," Ultimately, the boundaries that will work for you must be determined based on your personal feelings. Stated otherwise: the better you can communicate how you feel, the more success you will have setting and maintaining boundaries.Consider examples of times that your emotional or mental limits have been pushed by family member's statements or behavior. These are areas in which you might want to articulate more specific boundaries.
When something that you are not comfortable occurs, voice your concern by saying something like, “I feel stressed when you stop by unannounced. Please respect our privacy by giving us a call before you come by.”

, Most of the time, people who know one another are able to tell how they ought to behave in each others company. However, sometimes specific boundaries needs to be discussed clearly and directly.For instance, maybe you enjoy seeing a particular family member as often as possible, but they often overstay their welcome.
In such a scenario, state a specific boundary as a clear request.
Say something like, “Jared, it’s great that we’re able to hang out a few times a week, but it’s important that I’m able to get to bed by eleven every night. I still want you to come over and spend time with us, but we’ll have to say our goodbyes a bit earlier in the evening moving forward.”

, Some family members may resist boundaries, perhaps even without realizing it. For example, you may ask a family member to respect a certain boundary. They comply most of the time, but still violate the boundary you requested from time to time. In these cases, it’s important to reiterate your request.Don’t allow yourself to feel guilty or doubt the validity of the boundary you want to see maintained. Repeat your request whenever necessary.
Sticking to the boundaries you request will keep you from feeling like you’re being taken advantage of or not begin listened to, and will help your relationships with the relevant family members positive.

, Establishing boundaries and maintaining them is a process. Especially in scenarios where there are a lot of things you want to see changed, it’s important to realize that other people’s behavior won’t change overnight.If you feel uncomfortable about requesting a certain boundary you’d like to see established, make a different, less stressful request first. This can help the other person realize that they need to be aware of your feelings and desires.
For instance, start by asking your cousin to stop parking in your driveway every time they come over, as they keep blocking the sidewalk and upsetting your neighbors.
Requests like this, with specific, simple reasons, are a great way to practice establishing boundaries.

"
"
Be firm and respectful.,
Remove yourself from an escalating disagreement.,
Reduce the amount of time you spend together.",How to Maintain Boundaries with Family Living Nearby3," If someone continues to violate the boundaries that you have asked them to respect, it’s important to stand up for yourself. Of course, it’s important to remain respectful, in the interest of keeping the peace as much as possible.For instance, feel free to say things like, “I’m always happy to see you David, but we need some time to ourselves tonight. I’ll let you know the next time we’re having guests over.”

, Sometimes, establishing and trying to maintain boundaries can lead to conflict between your values and those of one of your family members. Further, you may both become invested in arguing about your perspective, in part because you want an issue to be resolved. However, sometimes it is simply best to walk away and let tempers cool down.This is especially important when a family member is hard to talk to about things like healthy boundaries. It may take several conversations to get through to them.
Remind yourself that other people’s anger is not a reason to compromise on your values. You may even want to say something like, “I understand that you’re upset, but I’ve been very clear about how I feel about this and I’m not going to change my mind simply because you’re angry. Let’s talk about it again when we’re all a bit more calm.

, If a boundary that you are serious about maintaining continues to be violated, you may need to spend less time around the violating party for a while.For instance, if you’ve spoken to someone about drinking less around your kids but they continue to over-serve themselves, you may need to ask them not to visit your home, and/or avoid visiting theirs.
Though this may feel cruel, it’s more than fair to give someone the time and space to decide whether they are willing to adjust their behavior to respect a fair boundary that you request.

Make a budget.,
Buy or make a stocking.,
Consider whether you would like to do a theme stocking or not.,
Consider the size of the items.,
Always keep the child in mind.,
Some families enjoy wrapping the presents they put in stockings.,
Fill the stocking!,
Hang or deliver the stocking.",How to Decide What to Put in a Child's Stocking," Figure out how much you can afford to spend on the stocking fillers and the stocking itself. Since stockings are filled with small, inexpensive items this doesn't have to be much. More expensive gifts, even if they come in small packages like video games, should be under the tree not in the stocking.;
, You can't fill a stocking without a stocking. Red with white trim is traditional but you can also reflect the child's interests with it as well, such as a stocking that looks like a dress up boot or one that is Spiderman themed.

, If you know a little girl who just loves dress up, you could theme a stocking around that with a stocking that looks like a shoe or is made out of very ""elegant"" feeling fabric (such as plush or velvet) and filled with play makeup, costume jewelry, little accessories like scarves, and some princess themed candy. Using a theme can help you to sort out what you want to do, but it isn't necessary.

, If you buy only small items you can buy a ton of them but not fill much space. If you buy only large items, you can only fit one or two. It's best to have a mix of one large item, two or three medium items, and as many small items as you see fit. There are ideas for stocking stuffers in the Tips below.

, Before you buy or make anything ask yourself if the child would like and use it. Be honest with yourself. Even if you think Jenny would be adorable in the pink scarf, if she hates pink don't buy it! If you're filling multiple stockings, break it down. If you're going to the toy store, go through once thinking just about one child, getting items just for their stocking, then go through another time thinking just about another child. It may be more time consuming but it allows you to focus on just one child.

, If you choose to do this it's more fun if you only wrap some of the presents and leave a few without wrapping paper.

, Once you have everything you're going to put in, it's time to fill the stocking. Spread all the items out on a table or the floor so you can easily see everything. If you are including an apple or orange put that in first. If not, pick something small-ish and round, square, or squishy to put into the toe. This could be balled up socks, scarves, doll clothes, or a stuffed animal. Adjust it in the toe of the stocking until it looks good to you. Add another item of the same shape to fill in the heel area, then add a sprinkling of small chocolates or other small toys. Put larger or rectangular items, such as books or craft supplies, in next, coming up the leg of the stocking. Add the smaller items in around the larger. Try to leave something sticking out of the top, such as a stuffed animal with its arms over edge or a candy cane.

, If you have filled the stocking because Santa was too busy this year, hang it on the mantel or lay it out in front of the fireplace or tree. Some people hang stockings from the child's bedpost or put it across the foot of the bed. Whatever works best for you and your family is okay! If you've filled the stocking as a gift for a friend you don't need to wrap it, the stocking itself serves as wrapping and all you have to do now is give it to them.

Ignore negative comments and focus on the compliments your family gives you.,
If your family is teasing you a lot, talk to them about it.,
Make some family time.,
Remember all the good times you've had with your family.,
Write down a list of what you love and don't love about your family.",How to Love Your Family," If someone in your family insults you, know they are just giving you a hard time and recognize that they don't mean to hurt you. Also, when they compliment you, take it to heart. They are your family and they are the toughest on you.


Remember that no matter what your family says they always have your best interests in mind.;
, If you explain how your feelings are being hurt, they may stop. After that, it will easier to love them.

, You may feel you don't love your family because you haven't been talking to them much. Carve some time out in your schedule for family board games, movies, etc. Also, find some time to talk one-on-one with members of your family.


Try not to get mad if your parents say they are too busy. Understand that they too have work to do and know they will try to make it up to you later.
Sometimes creating something (such as a new recipe) can be fun and helps you get to know your family better.
Make sure to pick an activity that isn't to strenuous so you can still talk and enjoy your time together.

, Maybe you aren't on good terms right now, but when you were younger, you were probably really close. Try looking through photo albums and seeing all the good times you've had. Notice how many pictures of you are there. There will probably be a lot. Your family takes pictures of you because they're proud of you.

, Recognize that everyone has flaws. Count how many good and bad items you have on the list. If you have at least five more bad items on the lists, try addressing some them with your family.


If your parents get upset, realize that this is normal. It may hurt them to know that you are not happy and they will blame themselves. This would make them appear to be upset or angry.

Create seven columns on a piece of white construction paper.,
Label the columns with the days of the week.,
Colour the columns.,
Enhance the calendar.,
Hang this calendar in an easily visible location.,
Include any elements of your kid's daily routine.",How to Make a Weekly Calendar for Kids (Visual)," Make one column for each day of the week, starting with Sunday and ending with Saturday. Use a ruler to make the seven days even and the lines straight.;
, You can either write them out or use stickers. It all depends on the look you want to achieve. Remember to keep it simple so kids can read it easily. A calendar that is filled with too many stickers and colors will be distracting.

, It helps to color the columns so the calendar is easier to read visually. Use the colours of the rainbow if you like (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, or pink). You can use light crayons or colored pencils, making sure that you don't color in the boxes too dark, or you won't be able to write over them.

, This is the fun part. You can use pictures from the internet or magazines to fill your calendar with your kid's daily schedule. If you have older kids, then use labels and just print the activity on them. This calendar lets your kids look at the day and know what is going to happen (school, afterschool activities, or chores). It works wonders for visual learners or kids who need to have a structured routine. It is also a great way for them to keep track of school clubs and library days. Here are some ideas:


For example, at the top of each column, you can write the word ""school"" or place a picture of a school, or you can even use your kid's school logo if you wish.
Then you can add pictures or symbols of your kid's activities.
You can even include a picture of a pile of laundry for laundry day.

, Pick an area such as a playroom, kitchen, or laundry room. Your children will benefit greatly from this tool.

, This can include reading at night, Friday nights with Grandma, or a number of endless possibilities. The most important thing is that you have fun with it.

Run a UNIX-like OS, such as Linux.,
Write HTML.,
Learn the language of programing.,
Think creatively.,
Learn to love solving problems.,
Learn to recognize and fight authority.,
Be competent.,
Write open-source software.,
Help test and debug open-source software.,
Publish useful information.,
Help keep the infrastructure working.,
Serve the hacker culture itself.",How to Become a Hacker," UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems are the operating systems of the Internet. While you can learn to use the Internet without knowing UNIX, you can't be an Internet hacker without understanding UNIX. For this reason, the hacker culture today is pretty strongly UNIX-centered. There are many types of UNIX-like operating systems, the most popular being Linux, which you can run alongside Microsoft Windows on the same machine. Download Linux online or find a local Linux user group to help you with installation.A good way to dip your toes in the water is to boot up what Linux fans call a live CD or USB, a distribution that runs entirely off a CD or USB without modifying your hard disk. This is a way to get a look at the possibilities without having to do anything drastic.
There are other UNIX-like operating systems besides Linux, such as the *BSD systems. The most popular *BSD systems are FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Dragon Fly BSD. All are open source just like Linux, however, it's important to remember that they are BSD and not Linux.
MacOS is based on Darwin, a UNIX operating system that's based on FreeBSD. Darwin is fully free and open source and is available from http://opensource.apple.com. Because the core of the system is UNIX, and macOS is very popular, many people have ported over Linux applications to macOS. You can get those programs with a package manager like homebrew, fink or MacPorts. Alternatively, you can just run Linux on a Mac alongside macOS.
If you want to get super niche, you can even run an operating system like Open Indiana, which is based on the open source release of the Solaris operating system before it was acquired by Oracle and made closed source. OpenIndiana and Solaris are based on UNIX System V, and, as such, are not compatible with Linux applications. That said, there are many ports of Linux applications. You're probably better off just using macOS, BSD or Linux because they are much more popular and have many more programs available for them.;
, If you don't know how to program, learning basic HyperText Mark-Up Language (HTML) and gradually building proficiency is essential. What you see when you look at a website of pictures, images, and design components is all coded using HTML. For a project, set out to learn how to make a basic home page and work your way up from there.


In your browser, open the page source information to examine the HTML to see an example. Go to Web Developer > Page Source in Firefox and spend time looking at the code.
You can write HTML in a basic word processing program like Notepad or Simple text and save your files as ""text only,"" so you can upload them to a browser and see your work translated.You'll need to learn to format tags and learn to think visually using them.""<"" is used to open a tag and ""/> is used to close it. ""
"" is the opening for a line of paragraph code. You'll use tags to signal anything visual: italics, formatting, color, etc. Learning HTML will help you to understand better how the Internet works.


, Before you start writing poems you have to learn basic grammar. Before you break the rules you have to learn the rules. But if your ultimate goal is to become a hacker, you're going to need more than basic English to write your masterpiece.



Python is a good ""language"" to start off with because it's cleanly designed, well documented, and relatively kind to beginners. Despite being a good first language, it is not just a toy; it is very powerful, flexible, and well-suited for large projects. Java is an alternative, but its value as a first programming language has been questioned.If you get into serious programming, you will have to learn C, the core language of Unix. C++ is very closely related to C; if you know one, learning the other will not be difficult. C is very efficient with your machine's resources but will soak up huge amounts of your time on debugging and is often avoided for that reason, unless the efficiency of your computer is especially important.
It is probably a good idea to use a good starting platform such as Backtrack 5 R3, Kali or Ubuntu 12.04LTS.

, Now that you've got the basic skills in place, you can start thinking artistically. Hackers are like artists, philosophers, and engineers all rolled up into one. They believe in freedom and mutual responsibility. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved. Hackers take a special delight in solving problems, sharpening their skills, and exercising their intelligence.


Hackers have a diversity of interests culturally and intellectually, outside of hacking. Work as intensely as you play, and play as intensely as you work. For true hackers, the boundaries between ""play,"" ""work,"" ""science,"" and ""art"" all tend to disappear or to merge into a high-level creative playfulness.
Read science fiction. Go to science fiction conventions, which is a great way to meet hackers and proto-hackers.
Consider training in a martial art. The kind of mental discipline required for martial arts seems to be similar in important ways to what hackers do. The most hacker-ly martial arts are those which emphasize mental discipline, relaxed awareness, and control, rather than raw strength, athleticism, or physical toughness. Tai Chi is a good martial art for hackers.

, No problem should ever have to be solved twice. Think of it as a community in which the time of everyone is hackers is precious. Hackers believe sharing information is a moral responsibility. When you solve problems, make the information public to help everyone solve the same issue.


You don't have to believe that you're obligated to give all your creative product away, though the hackers that do are the ones that get the most respect from other hackers. It's consistent with hacker values to sell enough of it to keep you in food and rent and computers.
Read older pieces, such as the ""Jargon File"" or ""Hacker Manifesto"" by The Mentor. They may be out of date in terms of technical issues, but the attitude and spirit are just as timely., The enemy of the hacker is boredom, drudgery, and authoritarian figures who use censorship and secrecy to strangle the freedom of information. Monotonous work keeps the hacker from hacking.


Embracing hacking as a way of life is to reject so-called ""normal"" concepts of work and property, choosing instead to fight for equality and common knowledge.

, So, anyone who spends time on Reddit can write up a ridiculous cyberpunk username and pose as a hacker. But the Internet is a great equalizer and values competence over ego and posture. Spend time working on your craft and not your image and you'll more quickly gain respect than modeling yourself on the superficial things we think of ""hacking"" in popular culture.

, Write programs that other hackers think are fun or useful, and give the program sources away to the whole hacker culture to use. Hackerdom's most revered demigods are people who have written large, capable programs that met a widespread need and given them away so that now everyone uses them.

, Any open-source author who's thinking will tell you that good beta-testers (who know how to describe symptoms clearly, localize problems well, can tolerate bugs in a quickie release, and are willing to apply a few simple diagnostic routines) are worth their weight in rubies.


Try to find a program under development that you're interested in and be a good beta-tester. There's a natural progression from helping test programs to helping debug them to helping modify them. You'll learn a lot this way, and generate goodwill with people who will help you later on.

, Another good thing is to collect and filter useful and interesting information into web pages or documents like Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) lists, and make those generally available. Maintainers of major technical FAQs get almost as much respect as open-source authors.

, The hacker culture (and the engineering development of the Internet, for that matter) is run by volunteers. There's a lot of necessary but unglamorous work that needs to be done to keep it going — administering mailing lists, moderating newsgroups, maintaining large software archive sites, developing RFCs and other technical standards. People who do this sort of thing well get a lot of respect, because everybody knows these jobs are huge time sinks and not as much fun as playing with code. Doing them shows dedication.

, This is not something you'll be positioned to do until you've been around for a while and become well-known for one of the four previous items. The hacker culture doesn't have leaders, exactly, but it does have culture heroes and tribal elders and historians and spokespeople. When you've been in the trenches long enough, you may grow into one of these.


Hackers distrust blatant ego in their tribal elders, so visibly reaching for this kind of fame is dangerous. Rather than striving for it, you have to sort of position yourself so it drops in your lap, and then be modest and gracious about your status.

",How to Become a Programmer2," Web applications are software components designed to work on top of the internet architecture. This means that the applications are accessed through a web browser software such as Firefox or Internet Explorer. Being built on top of the Internet architecture does not necessarily require an active connection to the internet. It means that Web applications are built on top of standard web technologies such as:


HTTP
FTP
POP3
SMTP
TCP

IP protocols
HTML
XML
Coldfusion
ASP
JSP
PHP
ASP.NET;
, (Right click, then click View Source or press F12.) Look for diversity in the type/content of the website, not the quantity of websites visited. Generally, you will need to visit at least one of each of the following types of websites:


Corporate presence sites (commercial corporations, not-for-profit corporate/organizations, governmental organizations)
Web indexing engines (search engines, meta search sites, specialized search engines, directories)
Data mining sites
Personal sites
Informational/encyclopedic pages (wikis, data sheets, technical specifications, and manuals listing directories, blogs and journals, news and news agencies sites, yellow pages, etc.)
Social sites (social portals, bookmarking sites, note-taking sites)
Collaborative sites (this includes other categories mentioned above, such as wikis and blogs)

, For example: brainstorming diagrams and MS Visio.

, This is creating conceptual web diagrams, site-maps, and navigation structures.

, Try to learn at least one graphics editing/manipulation software package (optional, but strongly recommended)

, This includes getting a basic idea about:


Base Web services protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and POP3 or IMAP4)

Web server software (preferably, one for the platform you will be working on mostly)
Web browsing software.

Email server and client software

, You might also want to get the ""What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)"" software package for editing HTML.

,,, Most users learn JavaScript. Some learn VBScript, but this isn't compatible with most browsers.

, Try to reach your potential using only that language. Only go to the next step after you've at least become familiar with your client-side scripting language.

,
Search for other packages/libraries of visual elements for your programming languages and learn them.

,
Take a course in graphics (not graphics design).,
Become a games programmer (optional).",How to Become a Programmer3," Most desktop programmers write code for business solutions, so getting an idea about businesses, their organizational and financial structure will be a big time-saver.

, An introductory level course in digital circuits design and another in computer architecture is useful; however, some see it as being advanced for a starting point, so reading two or three tutorial articles (such as this one and this one) might suffice. Then you can go back to this step later, after you learn your first programming language.

, Don't be shy to learn such a language just because you're older than being called a ""kid"". An example of these programming languages can be Scratch. These programming languages can ease up the pain in learning your first programming language tremendously. However, this step is optional. It can also be done before the preceding step.

,, No matter what language you choose later to be your language of choice, it will require procedural programming at some level. Also, procedural programming is reported by most programmers to be the easiest to use as a starting point to get the idea of programming in general.

,, You can make use of common small exercises in programming languages books. For this, choose a tool for writing programs in the programming language you are writing in.

, Make sure you understand the following concepts well and that you can apply them with relative ease before going forward:


Inputting and outputting information to users of a program.
The logical flow and the execution flow of programs in procedural languages.
Declaring, assigning and comparing variables.
Branching programming constructs such as if..then..else and select/switch..case.
Looping constructs such as while..do, do..while/until, for..next.
Your programming language syntax for creating and calling procedures and functions.
Data types and manipulating them.
User defined data types (records/structs/units) and their use.
If your language supports overloading functions, understand it.
The memory accessing methods of your language of choice (pointers, peeking, etc.)
If your language supports operators overloading, understand it.
If your language supports delegates/function pointers, understand it

,


Object-oriented paradigm.

, It is recommended to learn one programming language of each paradigm, and most advanced programmers do, however, you usually start with one, work for a while applying your knowledge and practicing it, then learn the other later on, after you already had a real-life experience in programming. Try one of the following language areas:


Logic programming paradigm.
Functional programming paradigm.

, Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each one. Usually this is done by:


Taking simple samples of your early work in the first programming language and re-write it using the second programming language.
Creating a new project and try implementing it using both languages. Sometimes, depending on your choice of project and languages, you might not be able to implement the project in one of the languages!
Writing a cheat-sheet or summary-table comparisons between similar constructs in the two languages and features unique to each of the languages.
Try finding ways to mimic features that is unique to one of the two languages using the other language.

, Almost all programming languages have versions/libraries that support visual programming and others supporting console or console-like programming. This can be accomplished by:


Get an introduction to event-driven programming. Most visual programming relies in some level on events and events handling (using the programming language you choose).
Try as much desktop software as you can and understand what the software does. Most software development companies offer beta-testing versions of their products which you can use to test the software. Keep up-to-date on user interface advancements.
Read some articles or tutorials on graphical user interfaces.

, Try applying your programming expertise on problems you face in your day-to-day life. For example, write programs that rename files in mass, compares text files visually, copies the names of files in a directory to memory/text file, and things like that. Keep it simple at first.

, Complete this to the end, applying the techniques of visual programming you learned so far.

,,, It will be very helpful for programmers wanting to write appealing user-interface elements.

, Game programming is considered, in most of its parts, desktop programming. If you intend to become a games programmer, you will need to learn more about game programming after you finish these steps. A graphics course is a must for game programmers and the second language of choice in the preceding steps should be a logic/functional programming language (preferably Prolog or Lisp).

Start with a reasonably well-defined task before you sit down.,
Agree on one tiny goal at a time: something you can complete within a few minutes.,
Rely on your partner, support your partner.,
Talk a lot!,
Sync up frequently.,
Take a moment to celebrate as you complete tasks and overcome problems.,
Switch roles often—at least every half hour.",How to Pair Program," The task should be something you are confident that you can complete in an hour or two. For example, ""Add 'maintenance history' to the moving-van database code."" You may find it helpful to outline what you plan to do before you begin to code.;
, Stating the problem in words to another person helps focus your mind and helps engage your partner's mind. It also ensures that you both know what you are working on right now.

,


When you're the driver, complete the current tiny goal as quickly as you can, ignoring larger issues. Trust the observer to be your safety net.
When you're the observer, read the code that the driver is writing as he or she writes it. Your job is code review. You should pay total attention, aiming to let nothing get by you. Think about possible bugs, larger issues, and ways to simplify or improve the design. Bring up errors and code that you find unreadable right away. Wait until the current tiny goal is done to bring up larger issues and ideas for design improvement. Jot these later tasks down so the driver can stay focused on the present tiny task. For example, if you see that the current code fails to account for a null input, write down on a piece of paper, ""Add unit test for null input.""
When you're the observer, don't dictate the code. The driver should be actively thinking about how to achieve the current task, not just typing passively. And as the observer, you should exploit the fact that you don't need to invent the small details; you can and should think at a higher level. Saying ""That looks right. How about handling the case where we're passed a null pointer now?"" is better than ""OK, now type 'if (s == NULL) { return ...'""

, Say what you are about to do, ask for an implementation idea, ask for a better way to solve the problem at hand, bring up alternative ideas, point out possible inputs that the code doesn't cover, suggest clearer names for variables and subroutines, suggest ways to implement the code in smaller steps, tell the driver that little bit of API knowledge that they need right at the moment they need it, etc. Listen a lot, too, of course. When people are pairing well, they are talking back and forth almost non-stop. Here are some common things to say while pairing:


""Do you think this is a valid test?""
""Does that look correct to you?""
""What's next?""
""Trust me"" (when it's easier to write a little code to make your point than to say it out loud)

, As you are working together, you will find yourself getting out of sync: becoming unsure what your partner is doing, or becoming unclear about the current task. This is normal. When it happens, sync up again. The key to good pairing is to sync up very frequently—within seconds or a minute of noticing that you're out of sync. If you are spending five minutes (or more) out of sync, you might as well be coding solo, because it's the frequent re-syncing that creates the synergy of pairing.


When you can, say what you are about to do before you do it. Better yet, ask your partner; for example, ""Shall we write the test for the null case now?"" Sometimes, though, you have to write code in order to understand your thought, and that's okay. Then you can say you are doing that: ""I need to type this to see if it's a good idea."" Best to keep that kind of exploration to less than a minute, though.
When your partner asks if you agree with something, like ""Shall we write the test for the null case now?"" or ""I think this method can be deleted now. Do you agree?"", say ""Yes"" or ""No"" clearly and immediately.
It's okay to pass the keyboard back and forth very frequently. For example, sometimes it's much easier to ""say"" something by typing it in code than by trying to explain it out loud. So let the observer grab the keyboard and type. Then you can switch back, or let the observer keep driving, whichever makes more sense right then.

, For example, each time you get a test to pass, give each other a high five. If you also high-five each time you get a new test to fail, you'll really get into the groove of collaborative programming and test-driven design.

, This keeps you both fully engaged, both of you in tune with the low-level details and the big picture. Also, driving full-blast can tire you out, and it's hard to maintain the vigilance required of the observer role for longer than half an hour. Switching roles recharges you.

, In the Playback Engine window, you can customize settings such as your CPU usage limit, the RTAS (Real Time AudioSuite) processors, the hardware buffer size, and the DAE (Digidesign Audio Engine) Playback buffer size to free up memory.

, From Pro Tools, click on ""Setup"" and select Playback Engine.


Change the CPU usage limit. In the Playback Engine window, click on the drop-down menu next to CPU Usage Limit in the HD TDM Settings section to modify the amount of memory you are allocating to Pro Tools. Pro Tools will allow you to set allocation at a maximum of 85 percent if your computer only has one processor.
Modify the number of RTAS processors. In the Playback Engine window, click on the drop-down menu next to RTAS Processors in the HD TDM Settings section to modify the amount of processors you want to use for Pro Tools allocation. The RTAS Processors setting allows you to allocate more memory for Pro Tools by utilizing your computer's multiple processors, if applicable. This setting works with the CPU Usage Limit setting in that you can set allocation at 99 percent with multiple processors.
Change the hardware buffer size. In the Playback Engine window, click on the drop-down menu next to Hardware Buffer Size in the HD TDM Settings section to increase or decrease the buffer size. Large buffer sizes are ideal for editing and mixing processes because they allow the computer more time to process audio samples and help enable your computer to work with larger sets of data. Smaller buffer sizes are recommended for recording processes to reduce latency.
Modify the DAE Playback buffer size. In the Playback Engine window, click on the drop-down menu next to Size in the DAE Playback Buffer section to increase or decrease the buffer size for this setting. If you are experiencing slowness during playback or recording, then setting smaller buffer sizes may improve your computer speed. Although larger buffer sizes may improve session performances containing a large amount of edits, they may also increase your time lag before initiating the playback or recording functions.

Take a course in networking protocols and essentials.,
Learn the XML language and familiarize yourself with it.

,
Start by learning a shell scripting language.,
Apply only procedural programming using your scripting language of choice at first.,
Use the scripting language you learned to write scripts that perform communications between machines.,
Make a transfer to a desktop scripting/programming language.,
Concentrate more on the core features of the language, especially those supporting networking.,
Take a course on distributed applications design and architectures.,
Learn about building serviced components and services using your programming language of choice.

,
Learn one or more of the following technologies.",How to Become a Programmer4," Distributed application programming is considered by many to be one of the hardest to learn and requires diverse knowledge in computer and communication technologies.

, This step is optional. However, it is very useful in understanding network topologies.

,, You need a good understanding of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP and HTTP before you start programming distributed applications.

,, For Windows-based programming, that would be any script that works with Windows Scripting Host. For Linux-based programming, Bash scripts and Perl will be sufficient. JavaScript is strongly recommended for this in both platforms for the following reasons:


It is supported by almost any scripting host in any operating system (Windows Scripting Host supports JavaScript by default, most Linux distributions has a package for JavaScript scripting console support).
It is considered to be easier to learn by many developers.
It has an ALGOL derived syntax which familiarizes you with much more other programming languages when you need to choose a second programming language (C, C++, C#, Java and J# all have ALGOL derived syntax).
By learning JavaScript, you familiarize yourself with client-side scripting of web pages which is a bonus side-effect!

, Later, you can use more advanced programming techniques and paradigms according to your scripting language and what it supports. All scripting languages have some procedural programming aspects at some level.

, Learn what is necessary for doing that. Simple communications will suffice.

, Preferably, one that is a multi-paradigm language such as Python. Take a simple introduction to that second language. Java is considered by most programmers to be the language of choice for many reasons. However, C# is gaining momentum fast in this field. Java and C# are preferred for the following reasons:


They are object oriented programming languages which shields programmers in large teams from implementation details as they both supports components (units of code, pre-compiled, that perform a certain task and can be used in other programs).
They support event-driven programming, as well as OO and procedural programming at some level.
The framework that the language is built upon is distributed by nature (in the case of Java).
The availability of many ready-made packages that deal with networking, both as open-source code and framework built-in packages; this makes it easier for programmers to build upon the work of others.

, Pay less attention to user-interface elements such as outputting, window design and techniques, and user-interface elements.

, This can be done using books, online tutorials or academic courses. However, understanding the architecture of distributed applications and its concepts is necessary.

,, It is recommended that you get at least an introduction to all of them. Most distributed application programmers do not stop at one or two programming languages, but learn at least one programming language on each operating system. That is because if you want your application to be ""distributed"", you should provide a version of it at least for each major operating system.


Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)
Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX)
Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)
.NET Remoting

Know what core programming is.,
Learn a programming language that supports building reusable components/packages, if you have not done so already.

,
Take an advanced course in UML and ORM.,
Take a course in software engineering.

,
Learn at least modular, component-based, object-oriented, and event-driven programming techniques and concepts.,
Learn more about the different operating systems and programming frameworks supported by these operating systems.

,
Focus your learning efforts on platform-independent frameworks, programming languages and technologies.

,
If the programming languages you learned so far have ANSI/ISO/IEEE/W3C standard versions, master the standards.,
Try to mimic simple, already established libraries, especially open-source ones.,
Search for and try open-source packages in your field of programming.,
Learn the different approaches used to distribute and deploy components to programmers.",How to Become a Programmer5," Core programmers are merely advanced programmers who made the transfer from programming applications to programming code units to be used by other programmers.

,, Most library developers use one or both of them.

,, The more programming paradigms and languages you cover, the more successful you become as a library/package programmer.

,,, Try to use standard code whenever possible.

, This is useful during the early phase of becoming a library/package programmer. Start with simple packages like units conversion and intermediate scientific calculations packages. If you are a college student, make use of your non-programming courses by trying to implement their equations and scientific core as libraries.

, First download binaries/executables of the package. Try to use it and find its strong and weak points. After you've done that, download the source and try to figure out how it was done. Try to recreate those libraries or parts of them. At first, do that after you've seen the code and later before you see the code. At later phases, try improving those libraries.

,


Usually, library/package programmers tend to think recursively and/or iteratively of all problems they are presented with. Try to think of each problem as a collection of smaller problems (a sequence of simpler tasks) or as a repeated process of reducing the problem's scope to smaller scopes and then piling those scopes upon each other.
Library/package programmers tend to generalize. That is, when presented with a simple specific problem, they usually think of a more general problem and try to solve that general problem which will automatically solve the smaller one.

Learn languages in the most helpful order.",How to Become a Programmer6," System Programmers deal with the science of programming not the specific implementations of it. Do not tie yourself to a specific platform.

,,,,, This can be done by:


Getting an idea on how operating systems are installed.
Learning how to install different operating systems on one PC (optional, but recommended).
Installing more than one operating system. Do not install any helping packages on the systems; instead, use the bare functionalities provided by the operating systems.

,,, You will later learn the assembly of other platforms/systems.

,, Pay particular attention to Standard Template Library (STL) and maybe Active Template Library (ATL).

,,,,, This will be easier if you choose a Unix-based operating system. Understand the system you will be working with later very well.

, First create small system utilities. It is usually useful to:


Trying to recreate small tools that are already there on your system.
Trying to port utilities available in other operating systems to yours.

, This is the only place where the first programming language matters. Learn ANSI C first, not C++, not C#, not Java and not D. Then learn C++.


Restricting the first language to C and C alone is because systems programming requires that the programmer be familiar with the following concepts:

Real and full compilation of source code.
Low-level object output files.
Linking binaries.
Low-level machine-language/assembly programming. The C language is said to be a disguised/easier to learn assembly by some. It also supports inserting assembly language code in code whenever you please and it is only procedural (like assembly).

Know what a programming scientist does.,
Accumulate the scientific knowledge equivalent to a four-year degree in computer science.,
Decide a field of specialty.,
Consider getting a higher academic degree.,
Learn the technologies and programming languages related to your programming field of choice.

",How to Become a Programmer7," Programming scientists are very advanced programmers who, instead of working on developing applications, work on developing computing technologies such as encryption, programming languages and data mining algorithms. This level is seldom achieved without academic study and dedication.

, This can be done either by:


Taking an actual academic degree (which is what usually happens).
Getting the courses' outlines for such a degree from one of the modern universities and taking the courses either by self-study or as separate courses. This could be achieved theoretically, but the recommended path is the first.

, The more specific, the better. This depends on your preferences. However, here is a list of some of the major topics in computer programming science:


Algorithm design (searching, sorting, encryption, decryption and error detection in communications are some examples)
Programming languages/compiler design/optimization
Artificial intelligence fields (pattern recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, neural networks)
Robotics
Scientific programming
Super computing
Computer aided design/modeling (CAD/CAM)
Virtual reality
Computer graphics (Computer graphics is usually wrongly confused with graphical design or graphical user interface design. Computer graphics is the field of studying how to represent and manipulate graphics in computer systems.)

, You might wish to pursue a master's degree or a doctorate.

Edit or delete any frames you don't want in your final GIF.,
Click ""File,"" then ""Save for Web..."" to bring up the conversion menu.",How to Convert a Video Into a Gif Animation1," You'll need a copy of the video to convert into a GIF. Once you have the file, open Photoshop, but do not select the video file just yet., This will bring up a menu box allowing you to change your settings when important the video. A GIF is basically a very fast slideshow. Photoshop takes your video and breaks it into these still images, allowing you to choose which ones are played together and turned into a GIF.


If your file is already an .AVI movie file, skip ahead to the last step of the method.


, These will change from person to person, but the basics are easy to understand and adapt. The only crucial setting is that ""Make Frame Animation"" must be checked. Click ""OK"" when done to start your conversion.



Selected Range Only allows you to move the sliders under the video preview to just the area you want to keep. The less video you use, the faster it will be.

Limit to Every... allows you to cut out every other frame of the video, or more. The final GIF will be a bit choppy, but it will also be a smaller, faster file. The higher this number, the faster the final GIF will be and the easier it will be to work with. Uncheck it for the best, smoothest video quality., Each layer will be a frame of the final GIF. You can remove some, move the order around, or add text and other shapes and colors to the frames. You can recolor them, change to black and white, or add effects. Anything done to the layers now will be reflected in the final GIF., Under ""Presets"" in the upper-right corner, choose a GIF option that works for you. You can then adjust everything from the transparency to the color mode, though sRGB is generally your best bet. After you've chosen a name, hit save in the bottom-right corner to finish your GIF.


Before saving, you can use the ""Optimize"" button in the Timeline view (brought up by ""Make Frame Animation"" to slightly shrink the file size of the GIF. This is usually important for websites that want to stay fast and lean."

Use your favorite search engine to look one up -- there are plenty of viable options on the first page alone. While you can use any conversion site you like, some tested sites include:


Imgur
EzGif
MakeaGif.com

, You generally have two options -- you can either copy and paste the URL of the video from YouTube or Vimeo (Imgur), or drag and drop your video file from your computer (EzGif, MakeaGif).

, Find what part of the video you want to capture and pause it a few seconds before that position. Also, decide how big you want the GIF. In most web browsers, you can hold control and press plus and minus (+ -) to zoom in and out. If you're using a media player, you can re-size the window to change the size.

, 12 FPS (frames per second) is a good frame rate to capture faster movements. However, if your GIF is too big, your computer may not be able to run everything smoothly at a higher frame rate. Most videos are shot at either 30 or 60 fps, but GIFs are meant to be quicker, smaller, and a little jerky looking.


The smaller the framerate, the faster the GIF will take to play and load. 10-15 FPS is usually perfect.

, All of these sites are different -- still, the button used to save or convert your video should be easy to find. You'll likely be asked to select where to save your finished GIF when it is converted.

This may take a while if you have a large video. If you are attempting to take a small part from a large video, cut the video to only that part before opening it in MS GIF Animator.

, These images show you the different frames of your video as you scroll down, like a flipbook. If you click the Play button, your video should play. It may not be the speed you'd like yet, but this can be changed.

, Select all frames by clicking the Select All button. This is the button with three squares on it. Click the Animation tab, select Looping, and set how many times you want it to loop. Select forever if you want it to loop continuously.

, Every time you change the duration, play it again and see what it looks like. Generally, 2-6 works well, but depending on the frame rate of your video you may need more or even less.

It doesn't matter if the image contains things you don't want to include in the final icon; you will be deleting everything you don't want to keep.


Keep in mind that icons are square, so your image should fit well into a square. If it is too long, the icon will likely look squished.
If you are creating Mac OS X icons, they can be 512 X 512 px in size.
You can create your own images from scratch using your favorite drawing software or you can use any photo, drawing, or other image file.;
, In order to create an icon file, you will need a slightly more powerful program than Paint. You can use Photoshop, but free image editors such as GIMP and Pixlr will work perfectly well.


This guide uses GIMP, as it is a free program available on all operating systems. The process is very similar in Photoshop and Pixlr.

, Open the downloaded or created image using GIMP. The image will appear in a window in the middle of your screen.

, The alpha channel is a layer of transparency. This will allow the icon to have a transparent background when you erase the parts of the image you don't want. To add an alpha channel, right-click on the layer in the Layers window on the right side of the screen. Select ""Add Alpha Channel"".

, The Quick Mask will allow you to easily get rid of the parts of the image you don't want to keep. To insert the Quick Mask, press ⇧ Shift+Q. A red layer will appear over the image.

, Select the Eraser tool from the Toolbox window on the left side of the screen. Use the tool to erase the red layer over the part of the image you want to keep. For example, if you have an image of a phone lying on a table and want to use the phone as the icon, erase the red layer from the phone only.


Use the Tool Options tab in the Toolbox window to adjust your eraser size. You can also zoom in to ensure that you erase exactly what you want.
When you erase the mask, you will only be removing the mask, not the image beneath it.

, Once you are finished clearing the mask off of the part you want to keep, press ⇧ Shift+Q again to remove the mask. The part of the image that you erased will be selected.

, Press Ctrl+I or click Select → Invert. This will select everything in the image except the part you erased the mask off of. Press Del to delete the selection, leaving just the subject of your icon.

, Click Image → Canvas Size. In the window that appears, click the chain icon to unlink the width and the height. Change the canvas size to a size that shows the subject well, and ensure that both width and height are set to the same number.


Use the Offset values to center the image in your new canvas before clicking the Resize button.
Once you've resized the image, right-click on the layer and select ""Layer to Image Size"". This will change the layer boundary to match the canvas size.

, If you want, you can use GIMP's color tools to change the coloration of the image. The easiest way to do this is to click Color → Colorize and then play with the settings until you find the color you feel looks best.

, The final step in creating an icon is ensuring that the image supports all the different icon sizes. This is essential if you want to be able to use the icon in different areas of the operating system and want them to scale when icon size is increased or decreased.


Copy the layer. Click the Layer in the Layers window and press Ctrl+C.
Scale the original layer. Open the Scale tool by pressing ⇧ Shift+T and change the image scale to 256 X 256 px. Click Image → Fit Canvas to Layers. (Note: if you are creating the icon set for OS X, start with a 512 X 512)
Create the first copy. Press Ctrl+V to paste the layer. Click Layer → To New Layer. Open the Scale tool and change the size to 128 X 128.
Create the second copy. Press Ctrl+V to paste the layer. Click Layer → To New Layer. Open the Scale tool and change the size to 48 X 48.
Create the third copy. Press Ctrl+V to paste the layer. Click Layer → To New Layer. Open the Scale tool and change the size to 32 X 32.
Create the fourth copy. Press Ctrl+V to paste the layer. Click Layer → To New Layer. Open the Scale tool and change the size to 16 X 16.

, You should have 5 layers, each one with an image smaller than the last. If any of them look blurry, open the Sharpening Tool by clicking Filters → Enhance → Sharpen. Adjust the slider until the image is clearer.

, Click File → Export. In the Export Image window, change the extension in the top field to "".ico"" and choose a location to save the icon. A window will appear, asking if you want to compress any of the layers. Check the box to compress the two biggest layers, unless you are using Windows XP., Once you've exported the image into .ico format, you can use it to replace the icon for any file or folder you'd like.


See this guide for changing the icons on your Windows computer.
See this guide for changing the icons on your Mac OS X computer. You will need to use a free online converter to change the ICO file to an ICNS file (Mac's icon file format).

Choose a series of images or a video.,
Visit an online GIF generator.,
Cut out a video segment (optional).,
Upload the images or video.,
Edit the GIF.,
Create your GIF.",How to Create an Animated GIF1," Make a folder on your computer, containing the images you want to animate. Each image will be a separate frame of the animation. Alternatively, you can convert a short video into an animated GIF.;
, There are many free online GIF generators, including imgflip, makeagif, and gifmaker. These do not have as many features as GIMP or other image-editing software, but can be used quickly and easily without any downloads or registration.

, If you are making a GIF from a video file, you probably want to select a small portion of the video, instead of uploading the whole thing. You can easily do this for free by downloading VLC, then following these instructions:


Open VLC, then use File → Open File... to open the video file.
Find the beginning of the segment you want to turn into a GIF.
Select Playback → Record in the top menu.
Play the video until the segment you want to ""GIF-ify"" is over. Press Record again to stop the recording. The new, smaller file is now saved in the same folder as the original video.

, Look for an Upload Images link. If you are converting a video, look for an Upload Video link instead.


Video upload may take a long time if your internet connection is slow or the video file is large. Uploading no more than a few seconds of video is recommended.

, These online tools usually let you change the order of the images in the GIF, in case you uploaded them in the wrong order. You may also be able to add text, change the size of the images, and set the animation speed.

, Look for a Generate GIF, create your gif, pr Create Now link. Your images or video will be turned into a GIF animation. Usually, a list of available options will show up, including links to post the GIF in forums, download it, or embed it in an HTML web page.

Select cell J64 and enter ""=VLOOKUP(Spheroids,LemniscateLooker,4)"" and Format Cells Font Red Fill Sky Blue Border Black Bold Outline and Insert Name Define name Unadjusted_Radius for cell $J$64. Return to the Lemniscate worksheet and Edit Go To cell range H3:H2882 and with cell H3 active enter the formula w/o quotes ""=H2"" and Edit Fill Down.

SPECIAL NOTE: The Unadjusted Radius needs to be adjusted depending upon how many spheroids are entered on the DATA worksheet. Overnight, a Lookup Table was constructed and developed into the formulation, i.e in the first column is the number of Spheroids, and in the fourth column are the values found to provide the roundest spheres for that number of spheroids. Then the variable Unadjusted_Radius is set to ""=VLOOKUP(Spheroids,LemniscateLooker,4)"" and the Lookup Table has the Defined Name LemniscateLooker. It was a project because there are a minimum number of spheroids really necessary to make up the curve at all. One should feel free to make adjustments to the table at their own discretion. Find it via Edit Go To LemniscateLooker.


Edit Go To cell range I2:I2882 and enter 1 and Edit Fill Series Columns Linear Step Value 1, OK.

Select all input columns A:J and do Format Columns Autofit Selection.
Edit Go To cell range F2:G2882 and choose Charts from the Ribbon (or use Chart Wizard) and choose All/Other and scroll down and select Scatter Smoothed Line Scatter. Bernoulli's Lemniscate should appear which should be moved atop the data but not the first few rows. Select cells F1:J2882 and Format Cells Fill Sky Blue, Border Black bold Outline. Format Cell H2 Fill Orange, Font White, Border Black bold Outline.

, I suggest reading through this first and comparing it to one of my other articles you've completed to see if you can copy that sheet, as would be much quicker (see related wikiHows below). In that case, insert 5 columns at column I and move the Looker Table to the right please. Copy and Paste the Lemniscate data from Step 5 F1:J2882 then into the newly inserted columns.

A1: AjRows
B1: GM (for Golden Mean)

, Work was done to get an overall pleasing effect, not to be consistent. A series approach probably will not work as well as IF Statement bracketing but it may certainly be tried. The formula for a series approach for the increment hasn't occurred yet to the author. It may lie in a TREND Series perhaps which gets smaller and then is resorted to become larger and is pasted in. Needless to say practically, very small quantities of Spheres (x<6) present a particular dilemma in attempting to form a lemniscate with so few. The character limit for an IF Statement is 256 if memory serves, including spaces, if any. Please see the PercentRing solution below.
Fractional quantities of spheres may be entered, with various results, as seen on the far right of the chart and the example of 2pi below in Tips.

, Select cell F64:F65 and enter -.25 IN F64 and Format Cells Number Number Percentage Decimal Places 2 and Font Size 14 (if 9 or 10 is standard). Format cell F64 Fill Yellow Font Color Red. Insert Name Define name PercentRing for cell $F$64. Insert Name Define name Interpretation for cell $F$65 and Format Cells Font Fill Sky Blue. Select cells E64:E65 and Align Right and enter Entry in E64 and select cell E65 and enter =IF(Interpretation<1,""Shrinkage Interpretation"",IF(Interpretation>1,""Expansion Interpretation"",""No Change"")). Select cell F65 and enter the formula w/o quotes ""=1+PercentRing"". It's set up to take values between 100% AND -500%, depending on the Spheroids count, else the axes must be adjusted for logarithmic values (perhaps). So, there will be a facility for Shrinking (or Expanding) the background ring of spheres right on the Charts worksheet. Activate the DATA worksheet and select cell H3 and enter THE DIVISOR and align center and select cell H4 and enter the formula w/o quotes ""=1.5*(1-PercentRing)"" This may seem backwards but it isn't because it's a divisor, rather than a factor. In subtracting -.25, we add it to 1 and get 125%, which increases 1.5, and so increases the divisor and makes the resulting chart smaller, being more divided. Format Cells Fill Sky Blue.

If a zero is entered in the Chart worksheet PercentRing cell, the result will be 100.00% below and so ""No Change"".
Thus, to produce a graph that looks like the graph at the top of this article, enter 25 Spheres and -.25 Entry for PercentRing, (approximately). The graph will have changed in total size but will have improved in sphere roundness a good deal.

,

Edit Go To cell range E6:F2886 and either with the Chart Wizard or with the Ribbon make a new chart by selecting Charts on the Ribbon, All/Other, scroll down to Scattered Smoothed Line Scattered and a small chart should appear next to the LOOKER Table. The spheroids may look somewhat flat. There's a fix for that.
Copy the small chart to the Chart worksheet and pull open the chart at the lower right hand corner when the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow upon hovering or clicking there, and expand it so that it reaches just beyond column L and down to row 62.
Then activate the Data worksheet and Edit Go To cell range G6:H2886 and copy it. Activate the Chart worksheet, click inside the chart and do Command+v Paste. It may very well appear wrong as the series =SERIES(,Data!$E$6:$E$2886,Data!$H$6:$H$2886,2) instead of as the correct series =SERIES(,Data!$G$6:$G$2886, Data!$H$6:$H$2886,2), so ShrinkExpand2 didn't work right, but it is the version in the picture at the top of this article. What you do is double-click on the ring of spheres and make them 75% transparent purple, which one is free to make 100% transparent if so desired, line weight 1. The lemniscate is also line weight 1 in the article chart. The latter version was corrects to the correct series and the PercentRing adjustment fixes the problem with ShrinkExpand2.

Download it for free at gimp.org/downloads. Using GIMP, you can edit each frame of your GIF, customize the speed of your GIF, and save it in an optimized format that will be quicker to load.

, Go to File → Open in the top menu and select an image saved on your computer. If you'd like to draw your own GIF from scratch, use File → New instead.


If you are using an existing GIMP file with multiple layers, use the Image → Flatten Image command to merge them all into one layer.This layer will be one frame of the animation.

, If you already have several images to turn into a GIF (such as a series of screenshots), open them using File → Open as Layers. If you only have one image and wish to edit the animation yourself, use the Duplicate Layers function in the ""Layers"" window on the right of the screen. You can do this by right-clicking the image icon and selecting Duplicate Layer, or by selecting the icon and clicking the icon that looks like two stacked photographs.


Each layer will be one frame of the GIF. The image on the bottom of the list will appear first, then the images above it. Drag them around to change the order.
Every image must be the same size, or the larger ones will be cropped when the GIF is saved.

, If you plan to edit the images or add text to them, you'll need to hide all layers higher up on the list than the one you're editing, or you won't be able to see your work. There are two ways to accomplish this, both found in the ""Layers"" window:


Click the ""eye"" icon next to a layer to hide it. Click the same spot again when you're ready to show it again.

Or select a layer and adjust the Opacity bar near the top of the Layers window. Low Opacity makes the layer more transparent. This is helpful if you're adding text or other additions to multiple frames, so you can line them up with each other.

, You can learn about many GIMP editing features if you like, or just use these basic techniques. Select the image you wish to edit from the icon in the ""Layers"" window to the right, then use the following tools to adjust your GIF frames:


In the ""Toolbar"" window to the left, select the ""Scale Tool"" (one small square with an arrow pointing to a large square) to resize the image. Make all your layers the same size.
In the Toolbar window, select the ""A"" icon and click the image to add text. Type in the text and use the popup tools to adjust the size, font, and color. When finished, use the Layer → Merge Down command to combine the text with the layer beneath it.

, Once you've completed your edits, select the Filters → Animation → Playback... command from the top menu. Click the play icon in the window that appears to view your animation.

, Go to the ""Layers"" window, and right click (or control-click on some Macs) a layer. Select Edit Layer Attributes. After the name, type (XXXXms), replacing the Xs with the number of milliseconds you want that layer displayed.Do this with each layer. Open the Playback again to view the animation with your new changes, and continue to adjust until you are satisfied.


Most GIFs made from videos are close to 10 frames per second (100ms per frame).
You can skip this step and select a default speed later, when you export the file.

, Use the top menu to select Filter → Animation → Optimize (for GIF). This will create a copy with a much smaller file size. Continue working in the copy for the remaining steps.


Before optimization, each frame is loaded completely (""replaced""). After optimization, only the areas of the image that change are loaded (""combined"").You can skip this step and optimize during export in the step below.

, Select File → Export As.... Click Select File Type at the bottom of the window that appears to view more options, then scroll down to and select ""GIF"". Click Export and a new window will appear, described below.

, In the new window, titled ""Export Image as GIF,"" check the box next to ""As animation."" Finish by clicking Export, or change your options first:


Uncheck ""Loop forever"" if you only want the animation to play once.
If you skipped the timing adjustment step, set the delay here. By default, this is set to 100 ms, or 10 frames per second. Reduce this number for a faster GIF, and raise it for a slower one.
If you skipped the optimize step above, look for a ""Frame disposal"" option while exporting and select ""Cumulative layers (combine).""

When Top=1, the result in cell A363 at the bottom will be -1, the series having decremented thru 0 (in cell A183). If instead Degrees=360, then Top=360= cell A3's new value in the formula. A3=360. So 360-((2*360)/360)= (360-(720/360)) = 360-(2) = 358. Cell A362 near the bottom = -358 and cell A183 still = 0. The decrementing is uniform. If Degrees=Top= (-1), then the formula increments up to A363=+1 uniformly.""., But the cell-formula below is different!""; B4: Into cell B4 enter w/o quotes the formula ""=-A4/(1-(1/A4))"" and do Insert New Comment and edit in ""B4: This cell's formula, ""=-A4/(1-(1/A4))"" is also a Neutral Operation -- that of a-b = a/b.

B5: Enter in w/o quotes the formula ""=A5/(A5+1)"" and insert New Comment and edit in ""B5: This cell's formula, ""=A5/(A5+1)"" is another Neutrality., of a-b = a*b."" B6: Enter into the cell w/o quotes the formula, ""=A6/(1-(1/A6))"" and Insert New Comment and edit in ""B6: This cell's formula, ""=A6/(1-(1/A6))"" is another different Neutrality of a-b = a/b. Edit Go To cell range B7:B363 and Edit Fill Down, which will repeat the 4-sequence formulation above to the bottom., The ±Top and Decrement in cell-column A, e.g. In A3, is divided by twice the Neutrality-result in B3, so that's ""A3/(2*B3)"". That result is multiplied by both CFactor, say = -5, and Converter, say = 1.7725501863 or =(PI()/180)^-0.1414. Then the SIN() function is applied to that result. The SIN() function returns a value from 0 to 1, having to do with a point on a curve, say a circle or an ellipse or a flower's edge. The above result is multiplied by a COS(ine) function performing the same way. So it's multiplying together 2 parts of the same angle. If sine is y/r and cos is x/r than it's achieved XY/r^2, right?  Then, by adding to the above total product the LAST formula term, ""+COS((ROW()-3)*PI()/180)"", it's setting the result in a path around a circle (or cycle). For cell C3 in Row 3, the ROW() function returns the row the formula is in, row 3, and subtracts 3 from it; 3-3=0, so I'll get the COS of 0 which is 1. The ""*PI()/180"" part of the formula is Excel's way of converting sine formulas from angles to pi-radians and vice versa.  Performed over 360 or 361 rows, the full circle is completed by the last term, as modified in form by the previous XY/r^2 relation ... that's it in a nutshell. Why's it called ""sin(a)""? To fool intruders? No, that's just how the sheet formulas evolved, so it helps keep track of the Form-Evolution-Path."" , The formula, ""=(SIN(CFactor*A3/(2*B3)*Converter)*SIN(A3*CFactor*Converter))+SIN((ROW()-3)*PI()/180)"", is different in 2 respects: 1) the 2nd term, ""SIN(A3*CFactor*Converter)"", for sine = distance Y over radius r, i.e. y/r, is fully squared, so I get Y^2/r^2, instead of XY/r^2 as explained in cell C3; 2) the last term ""SIN((ROW()-3)*PI()/180)"", works with and against the final COS() function in cell C3 to complete the points around the circle, since elements of set {X=COS(), Y=SIN()} give the coordinates of circle points on the circumference (unless and until otherwise modified, as done here by the other terms), relative to a constant radius r. But the whole point is to modify the constancy of radius r to get the fun design! To understand this better, see the explanation of the formula in cell C3's comment please, or ask."", These next two steps may be skipped therefore, but they're easy. Into E1, enter ""Sin(C3)"" and Edit Fill Down to E3:E363. Do Insert New Comment and edit in ""E3: The new formula, =SIN(1/CFactor*C3*(1/Converter)), is an attempt to see a Side View -- see Chart at bottom in blue and white. This formula, ""=CFactor*C3"" merely re-applies whatever's the value or formula-value-variable in CFactor in cell F1 to the formula in C3 … from the outside, as it were. Whereas earlier, Cfactor gets used internally in cell C3's formula. The column title, ""Factor sin a"" tells the story of what I'm doing. Currently the formula is set to =SIN(C3)"" instead. , Charting cell range E3:F363 I leave as an exercise to do. Perhaps Cos and Sin should be switched. , Edit Go To cell range C3:D363 and use either Chart Wizard to create a new chart page or use the Ribbon and select Charts, All, scroll down to Scatter, Smoothed Line Scatter and OK and Cut or Copy the chart to the Chrys Chart worksheet's A1 cell. Hover over the lowest right corner until the double headed arrow appears and pull the chart open into a large square, Click on the Plot Background and choose Radial Fill dark Green right and Black left radial from Center, Double click on the series plot line and change the Line weight to 1 and color white. In Chart Layout, get rid of the axes and chart label, etc. unless you want to leave formulation notes and that is done via Chart Title Text Box options for MS Excel 2011 for the Mac. You are Done!

,,,,,



Windows Movie Maker is no good, it has way too many limits and tends to freeze due to an overabundance of factors.

AviDemuxis a free video editor designed for simple cutting, filtering and encoding tasks. It is available for Linux, BSD, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows

Pinnacle Studio(by Avid) - This is very easy to get started with and grow into later. Uses the Avid rendering engine for pristine looks. It's one of the only programs you can drag and drop AVCHD files from Sony hard-drive camcorders and begin editing right away. Works real smooth with standard def, but hi def will run your PC to it's limits. One disadvantage is that it uses a tremendous amount of hard drive space for rendered files. Rough Price - $50 for the basic, $100 for HD capability and $130 with tons of extra bells and whistles.

Sony Vegas- A very solid editing program. Not the BEST, but it has a lot of solid components. Good editing structures. Overall not bad, however could be better. Rough Price: $550

Adobe Premiere- Solid software. There are many different versions, if you get the best then you're in good shape! It has a lot of good video transitions and many audio overlaying options. The only downside is there are limits to text animations. Rough Price- $799

SmartPixel Producer- An easy to use editing software for beginners. It is not powerful, but it has an effects library for the unskilled users to add subtitles, background music,effects, etc. Rough Price- $23.9

Apple Final Cut Studio- Very Very reliable software. It is rumored that Napoleon Dynamite was edited on this software. This program is only for Mac OS so keep that in mind. Very professional looking, many advantages. The only downside is the price which is well over $1200.


Apple Final Cut Express is another option and is considerably cheaper.

Apple iMovie is a popular and free consumer-level editor which comes with new Macs as part of the iLife suite.

Pick a show.,
Pick a song.,
Get DVDS.,
Time to edit and create the AMV.,
Time balancing is also very important.,
Share it with the world!",How to Make a Simple and Easy AMV," It doesn't really matter as long as it's anime, but try to make it a show you actually watch and enjoy. If you don't know anything about the show, it may throw you off track.;
, Actually this should be done before picking your show, as you may not be able to find the right song to go with your show, but switched around it would be much easier. Grab the song from any source you can.


Listen to the song almost non-stop for about a day. This will give you the knowledge of where certain things in the music are for you to sync to, meaning you don't have to rely on audio pikes to create your AMV.
Think about what type of AMV you can make to the song. You can't make a sentimental AMV with long running clips to a screamo song. Think about flow at this time; are you going to sync to words? Drums? Guitars? How are you going to transition at different times, crossfades? Black fades? Effects? Think about all of this thoroughly, for this is what's going to make your AMV worth watching.

, You can use torrents to get the VOBs/Mpeg2 files that you want to use. Knowing your footage is a must for an AMV. Also, learn how to convert the VOBs to something that is usable in an AMV, which requires outside programs.



Note: VOBs are large; a single disc goes up to 1 gig of hard drive space. So if you have an external hard drive, now is the time to use it. If you don't have the space for VOBs, get high-quality .avi files with no subtitles on it.

, You can use a lot of editing programs for this step, though preferably a non-linear editing program such as Adobe Premiere, Final Cut, Magix, and Wax. Adobe After Effects is not a good choice for this part (but creates great effects for final touch-ups). If the recommended software are not affordable, Wax is free, and has a lot of the features that its more expensive counterparts have. Be prepared to spend a long while on this step, as long as it takes to reach perfection.

, You don't want to edit for 6 hours on an AMV; otherwise you are going to get bored. A good schedule would be: four hours AMV, then anything you want to do. If you have time, spend another two hours on your AMV.

,


A good place to put your first few videos is Youtube. Here, you can receive a lot of positive feedback on your videos, as well as a few honest opinions and constructive criticism. This can get your confidence up. Also you may want to take the time on getting extremely good experienced editors to comment your video telling you their opinion, which will most likely be a lot more useful than the common Youtubers.
In addition to YouTube, you may also consider visiting AnimeMusicVideos.Org. There, you will find that everything is more competitive and refined than a YouTube AMVers world. It would also be a good idea to read the tutorial about uploading a video to A-M-V.Org, since it is a lot different than Youtube's system. You can make use of the forum there to announce your latest AMVs, perform an ""opinion exchange"" with other members, or review the many guides available that may improve upon your editing skills or add to what you already know. When you feel that you are ready, you may want to send a video to a Japanese culture and/or Japanese anime convention that hosts AMV contests. This way, a huge audience consisting mostly of your peers and animation fans will be able to see your AMV on a giant screen.
Remember there is no right or wrong way to create an AMV. Being a ""good"" AMV editor comes with experience.

Once you are set up and starting to live stream, make the most of your video by enabling and adding some of the many other features available on the platform.

,
Broadcast live.",How to Monetize Your Video Online," The source can be either digital such as webcams or analog, which requires digitizing through a capture card before it can be streamed.;
, This step is mandated to stream with any streaming platform. This needs to be a broadband connection, preferably wired as wireless is prone to have dips in performance.


Overall speed of the connection should be at least double what you plan to stream at. So a 500kpbs stream would need a 1,000kpbs connection. If you are streaming at half your connection speed, do not try to watch your own feed at the same time as that will exceed your Internet's capabilities.

,, Choose an encoder that can output in RTMP live streaming (Flash). This includes broadcasting video software encoders such as Wirecast, Discover Video and also Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder, which is a free download. Professional hardware encoders can also be used, such as the Niagara line, TriCaster, VBrick and TouchStream.

"
"
Choose a theme or visual motif.,
Decide if you want to tell a story.,
Scout out cool locations for your rapper to perform in front of.,
Round up extras through friends, family, and advertisements.,
Pick up a few dancers to flank your rapper, or a ""feature dancer"" to star in the video.,
Consider who will handle the choreography for dancers.,
Ensure that you have the necessary equipment for a professional shoot.,
Use your desired shots and equipment craft to make a budget.",How to Make a Professional Rap Music Video1," This simply a common set of colors, locations, or a mood that guides all of your shots Professional rap videos tend to rely on creative visuals while the rapper spits his lines into the camera. These themes can range from a lavish hip-hop lifestyle (2 Chainz's ""Birthday Song"") to a simple but striking visual theme. Craig Mack's ""Flava in Ya Ear,"" for example, uses stark black and white shots on a white background that makes each rapper a unique, screen-filling phenomenon.


The song's mood -- do the visuals fit alongside it or seem contradictory?
The budget -- more locations means more time and more money.;
, Not all rap songs need to tell a story, and most don't. But some videos will even split the difference, interspersing a short story throughout more traditional shots, like in T.I.'s ""Whatever You Like"" video. T.I. starts with a short skit, showing our feature dancer working at a fast-food joint, before using the video to show her ""rise"" to stardom and riches. It is simple, but effective, especially with the ending skit that reveals it was all a daydream.When writing a music video story, keep it simple. Remember that all film stories come down to three questions -- who is the protagonist, what do they want, and how do they try to get it?
Keep stories bound to one or two locations and actors. The more complex the story, the more difficult your shoot will be.

, This is the main event of most professional rap videos, and higher-budget videos might have 4-5 locations each. Watch a few of your favorite videos and note where they place the rappers. Some of the most common locations include:


Hometown streets or neighborhood joints (if in public, call the Chamber of Commerce for film permits).Party locations, like houses, pools, or the beach.
Rooftops
Graffiti tagged walls or deep city environments (be sure to check with the original artist, when possible).
Green screens, allowing you free rein of backgrounds.

, A great rap video looks a lot like a party, and will be played in the background of parties and clubs. So don't leave your rapper all on their own. Round up as many people as you can to have fun in the background, especially your more attractive friends. Put out an ad on Craigslist or visit the local colleges to try and round up warm bodies.


It is good practice to buy the extras and crew lunch, as that alone entices many people to get involved.

, There is no rule that a video must have dancers, but there aren't many that don't. Why? Because sex sells! If you don't want to work with background dancers, consider getting a feature dancer -- the one woman or man who your rapper and camera focus most of their attention on. They can be a love interest or just a good-looking dancer, but either way they give you a little more shot variety right off the bat.


Feature dancers are the second ""star"" of the video, which usually means they need to be in the ""story"" shots too, if you have them., Remember that, if you have dancers, someone will have to choreograph them. There are several options if you don't know how to dance, or have too much on your plate to choreograph yourself:


Ask the dancers you hire if they are willing to choreograph as well, especially for a higher fee.
Keep the dancing loose -- let the dancers improvise as if they were at a party.
Hire or consult a dedicated choreographer. College dance departments are a great, low-cost place to start asking around.

, Luckily for you, all you really need for a music video is at least one camera and some lights, since all of the video's sound will come from the song. That said, the type of amount of equipment you have will make a big difference on the videos you can shoot:


Cameras & Tripods: You want something that can shoot at 720p minimum, and preferably 1080p or higher. 2-3 cameras are often best, allowing you to catch multiple angles at once, but only if they all can shoot at the same settings.Lights: Never underestimate the power of good lighting -- you can always darken a video later, but it is very, very hard to make it lighter without ruining picture quality. In a pinch, get a bunch of bulbs and clamp lights from a local hardware store.
Essential Miscellaneous Equipment: Speakers (to play song), extension cables, power strips, black tape, tool set, back-up batteries and memory cards, necessary permits., No filmmaker likes budgeting, but it is the difference between many amateurs and the professionals. Keep your budget simple and realistic. Do you need 10 fake guns, or can you live with 2? Can you shoot closer to the stage and use 5 extras instead of 15? Solve these issues now, not the day before shooting. Things to remember include:


Equipment you must rent
Location and permit fees
Props and costumes
Crew fees. It is possible to get crews for free (check local colleges), but it rare to get help for more than a weekend without pay
Food and transportation costs per day of shooting.
For a truly ""professional"" shoot, with an all-paid cast and crew, you should budget at minimum, $2,500 a day. Double this if you want to capture sound (like dialogue in a story scene).

"
"
Diagram any story shots in advance.,
Stage each scene with actors/rappers/extras, then set up lights accordingly.,
Keep your direction simple and loose, especially with extras.,
Shoot 2-3 takes with the song playing and rapper rapping first.,
Make sure the rapper is the focus of most shots.,
Grab any story shots without sound to speed up the process.,
Pick up B-roll, or extra shots that look cool, in the end.",How to Make a Professional Rap Music Video2," Grab a pen and paper, or print out some storyboards from the internet. A storyboard is simply a comic-book version of your video, which allows you play with the shots and ideas without wasting time or money on set. Remember that a story, at minimum, needs three parts, which you can diagram or illustrate any way you want. For an example, check out the humorous story in Das Racist's ""Girl,"" which almost anyone could shoot on a minimal budget:


The Problem: First, we meet the characters -- a gorgeous girl and a working class boy who is immediately in love with her. She doesn't notice him.
The Struggle: Second, we realize the boy doesn't have the courage to talk to her, so he follows her instead. Using purely visual jokes, the video explores his increasingly funny attempts to get close to her.
The Resolution: He gets beaten up for his love by some thugs, but he doesn't give up. In a hilarious reversal of expectation, he makes his move finally -- on Facebook.
Note how this is only about 50% of the video -- your story doesn't have to be long, as rapping and dancing can fill up the rest of the time., Use the cameras to find your angles for each location, then set the actors up in a ""dry run."" Once you know where they'll be and where they need to move you can set lights to ensure everything is visible and well-lit. In general, your goal when lighting is to have a few deep, dark blacks, small sections with clear whites, and a large range of grays and other colors in between.


The 1-2 hours before sunset and after sunrise have the best lighting of the day. Overcast days, however, are the most useful, since the light is calm but widespread under the clouds.
While three lights with even shadows are the norm, don't discount more adventurous lighting patterns, like Coolio's ""Gangster's Paradise,"" which uses interrogation-type lighting for a extra dramatic feel.
It can help to prep shots in black and white mode to see how the lighting looks without color. A good shot in black and white will look great in color, usually.

, This isn't a feature film requiring precise, coordinated movements. Let people have fun and keep your direction simple. In general, you'll have the best results by letting people bring their own personality on camera instead of micromanaging.If you're in with friends or trusted collaborators, consider having someone ""in charge"" of the extras, providing light instruction while you set up shots or lights.

, If something happens to your production you want to be sure you have enough footage for a full video as soon as possible. Pick your favorite 1-2 locations and run through the whole song several times, ensuring you could put a video together even you can't film again for some reason.


Take multiple angles here instead of shooting the same shot three times. If you know the first one is good, move the camera before doing it again.

, Rap is a personality-driven art form, where the individual rapper is the main force behind albums, videos, and sales. Make sure that they are the focus of all the rapping sections, and they don't leave the video for too long during any one section. Good ways to keep them involved but still have an interesting, changing video include:


Costume or outfit changes.
Rapping while ""in action"" (driving, counting money, flirting, etc.)
Using extreme or interesting angles, like very low/high shots, fisheye lenses, etc., Because you don't need to sync dancing or rapping with the story shots and there are no lines of dialogue or microphones to set up, you can usually ""run and gun"" story shots quickly once the main shots are finished. When shooting story shots:


Keep a checklist of the shots you need and cross them off as you work -- nothing is worse than getting into editing and realizing a key ""chapter"" is missing.
Take 2-3 takes of each shot, ensuring at least one of each will work.
Keep the shots short -- think of linking a lot of little images instead of filming one continuous story., B-roll shots are images that you don't have a place for yet, but will eventually fill in any gaps you have while editing. Think of a feature film, where many scenes start and end with artistic shots that aren't strictly necessary, but tie the whole thing together. Some ideas of B-roll include:


Solo or up-close shots of important props.
Shots of the dancers or extras having fun.
Cool shots of each location, helping the viewer see where you are."
"
Use the music in the track to line the videos up with each other.,
Handle any ""story"" segments first before moving to the general footage.,
Keep edits quick to make the video move.,
Avoid falling directly on the beat with each cut.,
Add a clean, perfect version of the track when done.,
Use your video editing software to do basic color correction, a hallmark of truly professional videos.,
Try something unique and break the above rules.",How to Make a Professional Rap Music Video3," Since everything moves to the same words and rhythm, you can cut from one video to another smoothly once you have your videos synced. In your editing software, stack all of the videos on top of each other, then slide them left and right until they are totally synced up. Since you'll be able to hear the song in each video take, you'll be able to easily match them up by hearing when the song is just a little off.

It can help to put a clean MP3 version of the song in the video editor as well, using this as your baseline when syncing videos.
High-end video software, like Adobe Premier, often has a sync feature. There are also professional sync programs, like PluralEyes, but they are generally used for shoots with many cameras and microphones.
If you took tons and tons of video you may decide to do this in smaller pieces, only syncing up the segments you are currently editing and then matching it all together later. Both strategies work., Try to make this footage as interesting as possible without any music at all. Remember, you're trying to tell the story visually. Consider it like a flipbook, or a story told in slideshow -- if one shot is the girl getting ready for the club, the next should be here going to the club or arriving. Don't show her getting ready over and over again. A good example of how not to do this might be Twista's ""Overnight Celebrity,"" which resorts to the same or similar shots over and over again.


You can fine-tune the cuts to match the music later. For now, just focus on telling a good story. The music, when added, should make a good edit better. It shouldn't be the only reason it works.

, The best practice for editing a music video is watching a ton of them. Note how short each cut is -- music videos rarely hold on the same image for more than 2-3 seconds, and rap is no exception. Quick cuts keep the audience engaged and keep the song moving along quickly, whereas long cuts tend to make the song feel slower or like the video is dragging. There are always exceptions, but this is a good ground rule to start with.

, Falling on the beat means that each cut comes in a regular, rhythmic ""1, 2, 3, 4."" It is tempting for young video makers to cut everything right to the beat, but for an audience member this quickly becomes tiring and predictable. Instead, pick the 5-10 moments where coming in on the beat really highlights a big moment -- such as when the song ""drops"" or comes back in, or for select montages during climactic moments.


It can help to cut the whole video to the beat, then trim away and edit it later once you can tell the places where it works and the places it doesn't.
Alternatively, some editors will cut most of the video with no music, then go back and see how it lines up later, adding ""on-the-beat"" sections as desired.

, Watch the video with this clean version and make any last adjustments. Don't rely on the song recordings you got while shooting -- you want the best, most professional-quality version of the song you can get for the final video.

, Color correction separates the amateurs from the pros, which is why most young filmmakers forget or ignore it. Color correction, however, is easier than you think. To begin as a color corrector, pick your absolute favorite visual clip, and use the Brightness/Contrast and Hue/Saturation effects to adjust it until it is perfect. Then, use the same effects to make every other video look as much like this ""master clip"" as possible.


The primary goal of color correction is to ensure that the clips all flow smoothly together, as if they were all shot at the same exact time.
As you get better, you can use color correction to influence the mood of the video as well, using blues and greens for calm or darker tones and reds and oranges for happier shots.

, Check out Cyhi the Prince's ""Cold as Ice"" video. It is simple -- just 2 locations, a costume change, and a feature dancer. But the editing style, which overlays multiple shots at once, makes it immediately recognizable and unique. If you feel confident as an editor, rap videos are a great way to show your chops and make something wholly new and original.


Maybe you want to do one long take, without any cuts. This doesn't even have to be difficult, as Bob Dylan's seminal ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" video attests.
What video effects can you play with and push to their extremes?
Try crazy color schemes, black and white, etc. These changes are very simple to change back in editing."

Understand the Virtual DJ that aims to replace physical turntables.,
Know if your computer meets the minimum system requirements.,
Download the software from the Virtual DJ Download Center.,
Subscribe to Virtual DJ to stream songs to your computer instantly.",How to Use Virtual DJ1," In the same way that the CD players used by DJs have more options than a regular Hi-Fi CD player, VirtualDJ has more options than a media player like iTunes. It lets you ""mix"" your songs by playing two or more tracks at the same time. You can adjust their speed so that their tempo will match, apply effects like loops or scratches, and crossfade from one side to the other.


While Virtual DJ is an expansive, useful software, many professional DJs like having the physical controls of turntables as well.;
, Virtual DJ is not an big program, but it will need a little computing power to mix and match your songs. You can see a complete list of recommended computer specs here, but the minimum requirements are pretty easy to meet:


Windows XP or Mac iOS 10.7.
512 (Windows) or 1024 (Mac) MB RAM
20-30 MB free hard drive space.
DirectX or CoreAudio compatible sound car (usually standard).
An Intel processor., Follow the on-screen installation guide to install the software onto your computer. You can find the software for free on the Virtual Dj website.


Virtual DJ 8 requires a fast computer that is closer to the ""Recommended"" specifications, because it is newer and has more features. Virtual DJ 7, however, was updated and improved for 18 years, and runs smoothly on almost any computer.
If you meet all of the requirements for installation but cannot access the Virtual DJ website, you can also download it through a mirror link.

, If you're actively DJing than this is an invaluable feature. Any song that is missing from your library, from an audience request to a song you don't happen to own, will be seamlessly integrated into your set. It costs $10 a month to subscribe, $299 for a one-time payment.In order to connect Virtual DJ to physical DJ equipment, you must pay a one-time licensing fee of $50."

iTunes users can click on the file labeled ""Itunes Music Library.xml"", found under ""My Music"" → ""iTunes Library."", There are three main areas that you need to learn to start DJing:



Active Waveform: this is where you can see the rhythm of the song. Active waveform consists of 2 parts: the waveform and the Computed Beat Grid (CBG). The part on top (the waveform) shows the musical dynamic. The (often square) marks below represent sharp, loud sounds, like the hit of the drum or a screaming vocal note. This helps you follow the main beat of your mixed track. Line up these squares to line up songs. The CBG, on the lower half, shows your song tempo so you can follow the beat even when you can't hear it.

Deck: These match the songs you are playing. Imagine you had a record with a song on each deck — Virtual DJ mimics this control with digital songs and turntable imagery. The left deck is represented with a blue display on the waveform. The right deck is a red display.

Left Deck: this is a virtual version of a DJ deck on your left. The left deck simulates the functions of a conventional phonogram.
Right Deck: the right deck is the same as the left deck, but on your right hand side. This allows you to play and edit tracks simultaneously.



Mix Table: you can adjust the volumes of the right and left decks—as well as left/right speaker balance and other aspects of your audio—using the mix table.

, You can drag songs to either turntable. In general, the left deck is for the song currently playing and the right is for the song you want next. You can use the file-browsing section at the bottom of your screen to find your songs and audio files .

, Config is where you can personalize your DJ experience so that it is good for DJing, remixes, song production, or even editing. Click on ""Config"" in the upper right-hand corner to bring up your options. While most of them are advanced—""Remote Control,"" ""Network,"" etc.—click on ""Skins"" to bring up some helpful and accessible options.

, Check out the Virtual DJ website for a list of free skins and features you can download. These features help customize your set so that you are comfortable and efficient when working. The downloads are automatically checked for viruses, and they are rated so you can find the one you want., Most of the virtual buttons are marked with easy-to-understand symbols.



Play/Pause: Allows you to pause a song and play a song from the paused position.

Stop: Stops the song and rewinds it to the beginning.

Beatlock: Locks the tempo of the song, and makes sure that all of your performed tasks are synchronized to match the beat. For example, if you try to scratch a disk on the left or right deck, beatlock will make sure that the disk continues playing with the rhythm of the song. Beatlock is the feature that gives Virtual DJ the advantage over conventional disc jockey equipment.

Pitch: Lets you increase or decrease the speed of the song, also known as BPM (Beats Per Minute). Moving the control up slows the song, and moving the control down increases the BPM. This sound-editing feature is useful when you want to increase or decrease the speed of combined tracks to make them line up perfectly.

, There is an infinite number of possibilities on Virtual DJ, and the only way to learn about them is to start studying. Luckily, Virtual DJ has a wide variety of lessons online to help their community members.

Use Virtual DJ to organize your music.,
Use crossfades to blend one song into another.,
Match up the wave forms of songs to get them in sync using the pitch bar.,
Equalize songs on the fly.,
Play with the song effects.,
Use the BPM analyzer to get a permanent readout of your songs and their tempos.,
Use live feedback to turn Virtual DJ into an automatic playlist maker.,
Attach Virtual DJ to other equipment for total control of your music.,
Experiment.",How to Use Virtual DJ3," The program lets you organize your collection of tracks and group them easily in a DJ-friendly way. You can use filters to find the hot songs, find songs with a compatible bpm or key, access your previous playlists, and more. This is essential if you want to do any live DJing, as you need quick access to the right songs, and you may need to cater to audience requests.

, This is the bread and butter of DJs: keeping the music going without pauses. Use the ""crossfader"" to set the time at which you want the songs to switch, as well as how quickly you want it to change. The horizontal bar between the two decks is your ""Crossfade bar."" The further it is to one side, the more you will hear that song above the other.

, You should try to keep the high peaks on the waveform synchronized and overlapped (one above the other). This usually means that the beats are ""in sync"" and the mix sounds good. You can use the two vertical pitch sliders to adjust the BPM on each song, making it so that the waveforms match up and the songs are in sync.


Sometimes Virtual DJ does not analyze a track correctly, and the CBG can be incorrect, so you should learn to beat match by ear and not rely on visual aids.
Syncing up songs makes transitioning from one to the other much easier.

, There are three EQ knobs next to each deck that let you change how the songs sound. They correspond to Bass, Middle, and Treble.



Bass: The low end of the song. This is the rumbling, deep parts of the songs.

Middle: This is usually where the vocals and guitars hang out—not super deep or high-pitched.

Treble: Usually this knob affects the drums most heavily, though anything high-pitched will be affected.

, You can use Virtual DJ to add tons of effects to your songs, creating house and electronic-style remixes anywhere. The program comes with a plethora of effects ranging from traditional flanger, echo, etc, to more modern ""beat-aware"" effects like beatgrid, slicer, and loop-roll.


The built-in sampler will let you spice up your mixes with a broad range of drops and loops. You can also use the sampler like a sequencer to create remixes on-the-fly, effectively merging live performance and production.

, BPM-analyzer: Before you start to play your music, select all your songs and > Right Click > Batch > analyze BPM. If you'd like to mix songs, you must choose BPMs that are close to each other. This will take a while, but will save you from having to compute the tempo of the song on the fly.


For example; If you have a song of 128 BPM on the A-deck and you want to mix it with a 125 BPM song on the B-deck, you should adjust 8 to +2.4. As soon as the other song isn't coming through the speakers, you can turn it back to 0.0 by clicking the dot next to that slider. Don't try to mix songs that lay too far apart—this simply sounds bad.

, Live feedback features recommend tunes that you can play to maintain the mood and the beat. However, you are free to play whatever you like regardless of the recommendation. The songs are usually chosen to match up the BPM, making the songs flow seamlessly together.

, VirtualDJ is compatible with most of the DJ controllers on the market. All you have to do is open Virtual DJ and plug the equipment in. If you want to change any of the default behavior, VirtualDJ has a ""VDJScript"" language that lets you re-code the program to your liking., The best way to learn how to use Virtual DJ is to use it. There are so many different features and ways to tackle problems that the focus should not be the software. Focus on you and your creative practice. Look up tutorial videos on YouTube, check out the forums on the Virtual DJ website, and ask friends for advice if you get stuck."

Set your pattern grid to accommodate varied time signatures.,
Label your patterns.,
Under this system, each pattern line should be strictly one specific time signature.,
Set each pattern to its associated time signature.",How to Use Varied Time Signatures in Fruity Loops (Fl Studio),"


Open up the pattern window.
Left-click on the grid menu (Button with a small 3x3 grid icon, next to the word 'Playlist').
Click on 'Line', then 'Beat'.
This step allows the user to place bars of music anywhere on the pattern grid beat-by-beat, rather than being confined to a predetermined bar-by-bar grid. From this point on, simply ignore the bar count along the top of the pattern and piano roll windows; or just use them for general reference; They no longer refer to your varied time signatures.;
,
It is good practice to name your patterns according to their content. In the case of varied time signatures, the content of each pattern includes the number of beats in the bar. #*Right-click a pattern name to rename it.
An effective method of neatness is to name your patterns in the following format:
...For example: 4.bass.chorus.buildup, 5.drums.verse1.crescendo, 3.bgd.break1.wizz

, It is expected that each non-identical part and ""sub-part"" of music would have a separate pattern; therefore this should naturally apply to parts with differing time signatures.
Furthermore, each pattern should strictly use the relative instrument and part names at all times. This is good practice to avoid mixing up patterns or doubling-up on channels (see warnings, below.)

,
In simple terms this means setting the number of beats per bar. Do so prior to composition to avoid confusing pattern-length problems.


Open up the step sequencer.
In the top left corner, a small digital dial should be visible (similar to this: )
Left-click and drag upwards to set the number of beats per bar for this pattern. Remember that this should be equal to the number of beats specified in the pattern name.

Set up your filming area with adequate lighting for your camcorder.,
Arrange lighting with three lights.,
Make sure that your subject or talent, as the individual is called, is a minimum of three feet from the screen.,
Position your camcorder far enough from the talent to attain the desired view: a full-body shot, a half-body shot or a seated shot, of the talent.

,
Film ten seconds or more of your blue/green background without the talent in the frame.,
Move your talent into the desired position and start shooting.,
Begin shooting your video, making sure to shoot a few seconds past where you will end in editing.

, You want to light the blue or green background evenly with your lights set at a 45° angle from the screen. The lights should be far enough back so they don't cause hot spots.

, Your talent should be lit by the third light in such a manner so there is no shadow cast upon the background.

,, This will be used to get a ""clean"" key with the software later.

, If you are going to use live audio, have a good lavaliere microphone attached to the talent's clothing, far enough away from the talent so that breathing is not captured on mic.

,, Note: A DVD camcorder must have the video transferred to the hard drive in another manner.

,,, Ultra allows you to auto key or manually key. Generally, with adequate lighting, auto key works fine.

, On TV, they are using the weather maps as the background coming from the PC.

, This is done because video coming from a camcorder will create a large file. A rough rule of thumb is that ten minutes of video equates to 2gb of hard drive space. The Codec (compress-decompress) used will reduce the size of the file depending on the Codec used. Be aware, there is no free lunch. When you compress, you are leaving something out so your quality is being reduced, though there are loss-less codecs available.

,, This could take some time depending on the length of the video and the speed of your computer and the resolution you have selected.

,, You could also use Microsoft Movie-maker that is a part of Windows but it is fairly basic in its capabilities.


In the editor, you can delete or rearrange the scenes as you see fit.
You can also add background audio as well as titles and credits. Special effects software is also available that will let you create such things as lightning, explosions, and other special effects.

Look for the Navigator panel, which displays a miniature version of your image, in its default position at the upper right-hand area of the image screen. Use the Navigator panel to zoom in and out and find your way around the photo. Click on the sliding bar and slide it to the left to zoom out or the right to zoom in. You can also manually enter a zoom ratio (ex. 50%, 100%) in the percentage box. If you’re deeply zoomed into a photo and having trouble navigating, click the box inside the Navigator panel, which shows you where in the image you currently are, and drag it around until you’re where you want to be.


Tip: Zoom out to do large-scale edits (ex. cropping) and in to do detailed work (ex. selecting edges).



Look for the Layers panel in the middle of the right-hand side of the image screen. Use the Layers panel to make, select, edit, and rearrange layers of adjustments to your original image. Many of the changes you make to your photo (including adding text, apply filters, and pasting other images) will automatically appear as new, individual layers. In addition to keeping your original image as intact as possible, this also grants you a high degree of control over the changes you make by allowing you to modify only one thing at a time. Select a layer you want to work with and modify it by reducing the opacity from 100%, clicking the up and down arrows to move it over or under another layer, changing how it blends with the other layers by choosing another option from the drop-down list next to “Normal,” throwing it away by hitting the trash can button, etc. Make sure you’re working on the correct layer while editing your image or your changes may not have any effect / have an undesired effect.


Tip: If you painstakingly select a certain part of your image only to realize that you’re working on the wrong layer (i.e. one that doesn’t actually contain the pixels you’ve selected), simply click on the correct layer. The selection will not disappear.

Tip: To be able to modify your “Background” layer (i.e. the very first layer made – often your original image), which is locked by default (see the padlock image to the right of the layer name), double-click it and give it a new name. This will unlock it, allowing you to edit it directly.



Look for the History panel at the bottom right-hand side of the image screen. This shows you a list of all changes you’ve made to your image. To navigate these edits, simply click on the one you’re interested in. Although you can go back and forth freely between these edits, note that going back to a previous edit and then changing your image will erase all edits after that point, replacing them with new ones.

Look for the Tools panel on the left-hand side of the image screen. It contains buttons for many of the editing tools you will be working with. If you aren’t sure where to begin, hold your cursor over a button for a few seconds and the name will appear. See below for more information on individual tools.


Tip: Whenever you select a tool, look at the options that appear at the top of the screen just beneath the toolbar. These options will allow you to modify things such as brush size, style, opacity percentage, blending mode, and many more.

At any rate, what to do is select the cell with the error, and after checking all those typical errors, do Tools Auditing Trace Precedents and/or Trace Error. If fixing all the topmost leftmost errors does not fix the rest of your errors on the worksheet, one may need to do it the hard way, from the bottom right upwards then leftwards; that is the slow but sure way to fix all errors.


Also, errors in the chart data will most likely plot as zeros. This may be acceptable or desirable even. However, if too many lines (or curves) are returning to 0, it may indicate a logical flaw in the data -- or too many tiny values and then perhaps rescaling the chart is needed by inspecting the horizontal and vertical axes and changing them to zero in on the problem. Hover over or click on a data marker on the series plot and then do a search in the proper column by value for that value, and identify its precedents.

Access Weavesilk.,
Start up Weavesilk.,
Look for the menu.,
Change the settings of your drawing.,
Draw.,
Save or share your drawing.",How to Use Weavesilk1," The Weavesilk website is weavesilk.com. It's free to use, but it's not possible to access the website on mobile web browsers, and you'll have to have internet access on your computer to use it.;
, You will start off on a screen with a small example thumbnail of what can be created with Silk. Click anywhere on the screen to start up Silk. You will automatically start on a new canvas.

, In the upper left-hand corner, there will be a small rectangular menu with the words ""New"" and ""Share"", and four symbols underneath it. This is important if you want to change up the settings of your creations. There are six options on the computer version's menu. You can hover over the icons to see what they do.


The ""New"" button refreshes the canvas, giving you a blank canvas to draw on. You can also press Space to refresh the canvas.
The ""Share"" button allows you to share your creation to social media. You can post it to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, or just send it to someone via email.
The icon with four arrows is the Fullscreen icon, and puts Silk into full-screen mode.
The camera icon is for saving photos. On the computer, clicking this will download the image you have created to the file directory of your choice.
The colored circle is the settings of your drawing, which includes the color you're drawing in.
The rounded arrow is the Undo button. You can only undo your most recent edit to the program; pressing ""Undo"" twice will just put what you removed back in.

, To alter the settings of what you're drawing and get different results, click on the colored circle in the menu. This will bring up a list of things you can change.


There are seven colors available to draw in - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and light gray (which shows up as black in the ""color wheel""). You can select one color by clicking on it, or draw in multiple colors by clicking and dragging one color into another.

Dragging a color such as hot pink across to blue will give you two colors - hot pink and blue. Don't be afraid to experiment around and find the colors you like.
To reset back to one color, click the color that you dragged.



Rotational symmetry is how many ""points"" the program draws at a time. Having no rotational symmetry will just create one line; setting it to higher rotational symmetry will create multiple lines and permit for different creations to be made.

""Mirror across center"" will enable or disable whether what you draw will be reflected across the screen. If it's set to ""On"", your drawing will be reflected the same way on both sides from the center of the screen; setting it to ""Off"" will allow for non-parallel creations.

""Spiral towards center"" changes the way that the lines are drawn; as implied by the name, the lines drawn will spiral towards the center of the screen.

, To begin drawing on Silk, click and hold your mouse button, or press and hold on your mobile device. Experiment around with the settings, colors, and different motions to see what you like and what you want to save.


Every time you click, the program will draw a new pattern. This way, you can't create the same drawing twice.

, If you really like what you've created on Silk, you can share your creation to social media, or download your newly-created picture to your computer.


To share your creation, click on the ""Share"" button and select the social media site that you want to share your Silk drawing with. If you share it to Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest, you'll be brought to the page of the respective social media site so you can add a caption before posting; if you choose to email it, you will be redirected to your email account and be able to choose who to send it to. You can also simply copy a link to your creation.






To save your creation, click on the ""Save Photo"" icon, which is the picture of the camera. A thumbnail of your image will pop up; right-click it and click ""Save image as..."". You'll be asked which file directory you want to save your image to - simply select the one you want and hit ""OK"" to save your photo.

Purchase Silk from the App Store or Google Play store.,
Open Silk.,
Familiarize yourself with the menu.,
Alter the type of drawing you're making.,
Change the colors of your creation.,
Draw.,
Save or share your picture.",How to Use Weavesilk2," There are two versions of the Silk app - one is called Silk, and the other is called Silk Legacy, the latter of which is meant for older devices. Both cost $2.99 on the App or Google Play store.

, Once you've purchased the app and it's finished downloading, find it and tap on the icon to open it. You can also open it via the App Store on an iOS device.

, Especially if you've only used the PC version of Silk before, the menu can be very hard to orient to. Take some time to get used to the menu.


The button with the rotating rectangles is the tool being used to create your drawing.
The curved arrow is the Undo button. You can undo as many times as you wish; tapping Undo will cause a Redo button to appear above the Undo button.
The black button centered between all of the options clears the canvas. You can also tap three fingers to the screen to clear the canvas.
The square with the upwards arrow is the button to share or save your creations.
The colored circle represents the color(s) that are currently selected.
The line in the upper right-hand corner is the ""effect"" that occurs when drawing the line. You can draw straight lines, create a colored hue in the background, or draw more curved lines - or draw lines while making hues! The intensity can be adjusted by a slider on the right-hand side of the screen.
The question mark is attribution information.

, Unlike the computer version of Silk, you have more control over what kinds of patterns you draw. Tap on the button with the rotating rectangles, and a menu will come up. Select the pattern that you want to draw in.


You can only draw in one pattern at a time, but it's possible to draw in one pattern, change to a different pattern, and then draw in your newly-selected pattern. This allows for more unique designs.
The asterisk at the bottom of the menu can be tapped on to enable the ability to draw on different parts of the screen, as opposed to just the center. Tap again to turn it off.

, Aside from the original seven-color color wheel (which has red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and light gray), there's also black, white, and a ""rainbow"" option, which allows you to use all the colors in the palette at once. There are also color wheels not on the PC version of Silk, all with different varieties of color.


To use two colors at once, tap and drag a color into another one.
There are five total color palettes available. To cycle through the color palettes, tap on the button with two arrows under the color wheel.

, To draw on the mobile version of Silk, just press one or two fingers to the screen and move your fingertips around on the screen to create patterns or drawings.

, If you want to put your creation somewhere, whether it's online or just on your phone, tap on the Share icon (the square with the arrow coming out of it). A menu will come up, and from that menu, you have several options. You can text or email your creation to someone, add your Silk creation to your Notes app, share it to social media, copy the image, or just save the image to your camera roll, either in normal or HD quality.

Navigate to waifu2x.udp.jp.,
Choose your image.,
Select the style.,
Select the noise reduction level.,
Select the upscaling.,
Click on the convert button.",How to Use Waifu2x1," For unknown reasons, the site may be down occasionally.;
, You can either copy and paste the URL, or select a file from your computer. There are limits to the image size.

Make sure that your image is taken from the source, as that will guarantee the highest quality possible. Websites that host such content include Pixiv, DeviantArt, Konachan (wallpapers), and Yandere (for general anime art). For Chrome and Firefox users, a browser extension makes finding sources very easy., ""Artwork"" is intended for anime art, but any type of minimalist art that uses simple textures and color gradients will suffice., There are four options, of which you should only use two: none and medium.

While Waifu2x achieves stellar results with this application, the side effect is that the image becomes more oil pastel-like, which is why the program is intended for anime art.
If your image is taken from the source, then the amount of noise guarantees that ""medium,"" which is already fairly powerful, will suffice. Anything higher will result in a greater loss of information, especially with highly detailed art (e.g. a background with the night sky).

, The web demo only allows for three options: none, 1.6x, and 2x. A combination of upscaling and noise removal will still slightly degrade the image quality, although the results still blow away the competition., You can use the web demo in multiple tabs simultaneously, as the process only takes a few seconds."
"
Download the program here.,
Open Waifu2x.,
Input your image to be upscaled/noise-reduced.,
Specify the conversion mode.,
If you chose ""noise+scale"" to remove noise, specify the noise level.,
Specify the scaling factor.,
Specify your processor.,
Run the program.",How to Use Waifu2x2," You will need a little over 100 MB of free space. After extracting the file, the application can be opened.

A major advantage of the offline version is the use of CUDA and cuDNN for much faster (around 15x) processing. CUDA can be downloaded and installed from the Nvidia website, but it is only available to users with a Nvidia graphics card that supports it. cuDNN is available after filing a developer's application on the Nvidia website with approval and is purely optional.
You can create a shortcut of the executable for easy access.

, The user interface has been translated into English from the original Japanese. In it, you can see the similarities and expansion of tools with regards to the web demo.

, Unlike with the web demo, you must download your image from the internet. You can manually type in the filepath, but drag-and-drop will be much easier (open up Windows Explorer).

The default output path will be in the same folder as your input image with a similar name.

, There are four options, of which you should only use two: ""scale"" and ""noise+scale."" Noise only has a default scale factor of 0.5 - that is, it will automatically downsize your image by half; while ""noise(auto)+scale"" is redundant., As with the web demo, you should only use level 1 if you choose to remove noise, as it is powerful enough. If you only need to upscale your image, leave this alone., With the offline software, you have much more freedom in how large your image can be. Many users commonly use an image cropping tool to complement Waifu2x for the desired resolution and aspect ratio. If that is the case, you must judge whether the image to upscale is wider than your desired aspect ratio or not. The following will assume that you have a monitor of 16:9 aspect ratio and 1920x1080 resolution (though yours may vary!)

In most cases, the image you are working with will not be as wide as 16:9. Therefore, to calculate the scaling factor, you divide 1920 by the image's width. For example, an image of 1500x1000 would have a scaling factor of 1920/1500 = 1.28.
In the case where the image is wider than 16:9, you divide 1080 by the image's height. For example, an image of 1000x500 would have a scaling factor of 1080/500 = 2.16.
Waifu2x always rounds down when it calculates the final image resolution. If your numbers are not round like in the previous examples, be sure to always round up in the third or fourth decimal place.

, As mentioned above, if you have a CUDA-supported graphics card, be sure to use it, as the processing times speed up tremendously. If you have cuDNN, you can check if Waifu2x will use it with the cuDNN check button. Otherwise, you can use the CPU., Do not touch the output file extension, model (unless you are using a photo, which is not recommended), extensions to be covered in the folder, or block size. The output image will be in the same folder as your input image. The image above demonstrates waifu2x against other upscaling programs.


The view log is still in Japanese, though you can see how long it took for the image to process.
If you need to convert multiple images, repeat the above steps starting from step 3.

, During installation, you will need to read and accept the License Agreement. You will also asked to enter your license key or install the program as a trial. If you have your key, type it or copy it into the field and enter your name.


When your purchase Camtasia, your License Key will be mailed to you. Be sure to check your Spam folder if you have difficulties locating the email.
Camtasia will attempt to validate your license during the installation process, so make sure that your computer is connected to the internet.

, After you enter your key, you will be asked to choose where Camtasia should be installed. Most users can keep this at the default settings. You will also be asked if you want to install the PowerPoint Add-in, which will allow you to insert Camtasia recordings into PowerPoint presentations.

, If you're recording a full-screen program, you probably don't have to worry about this, but if you are giving tutorials involving multiple windows you'll want to ensure that your desktop isn't distracting.Move all of the icons off of your desktop. Either put them in a folder or move them to a second monitor. You can move them all back when you're done recording.
Close any unrelated windows. Make sure any chat programs, emails, browsers, and anything else unrelated is closed and not drawing attention.
Change your wallpaper to something muted. If you have a colorful, busy wallpaper, or it's images of your family, set it to something neutral for the recording.

, Write a basic outline of your presentation, with notes on when to switch windows and important tips to remember. This will help ensure that you get all of your information across, and help you to avoid ""ummms"" and ""uhhhs"".


During the script writing process, practice the presentation to make sure that it flows well.
Some people don't need scripts, others do. Get familiar with the process and do what works best for your style of presenting.

, Viewers will get the most out of your Camtasia presentation if it is narrated. In order to record the best-sounding audio possible, you're going to want a decent microphone that connects to your computer via USB.


Consider the acoustical environment of where you are recording. A large room with big empty walls will create an echo like sound. Background noise will distract the viewer.You can also use a webcam to capture your face during a presentation as well.

, When you first start Camtasia, you will be taken to the Editor window. This is where the meat and potatoes of the Camtasia program can be found. You will use the Editor to start your recording and then clean it up after you are finished.

, This is located in the upper-left corner of the Camtasia window. Clicking the button will automatically minimize the Camtasia Editor window and open the control panel for the screen recording.

, If you are going to be switching between multiple windows, you will find it easiest to record your entire screen. Full Screen recording is enabled by default.


You can create a custom-sized recording area by clicking the Custom button.
A dashed line will appear around the area that will be recorded.

, If you want to use your webcam, enable it by clicking the Webcam button. If you have multiple microphones connected to your computer, click the down arrow next to the ""Audio"" button to select the one you want to use.


Use the Audio menu to toggle system sounds on or off. If toggled On, system alerts and beeps will be recorded with your presentation.

, If you are using a microphone, speak into it before recording to see the level appear underneath the volume slider. Adjust the volume slider until the input comes out around the middle of the slider.

, Before you begin recording, open all of the windows that you will need to access during the presentation. This will keep you from fumbling to find the window that you need.

, Take a deep breath, and press the REC button or the F9 hotkey. A countdown will appear on the screen. Once it disappears, everything that you do on the screen and everything you say will be recorded.


Speak slowly and clearly, and don't rush through your steps.

, Once you are finished with your presentation, press F10 to stop the recording. You can also stop it from the taskbar, but this action will be recorded and will need to be edited out.


Once you finish recording, a preview of your recorded presentation will appear. Watch the preview to make sure everything looks OK, and then press the ""Save and Edit"" button.
Give your project a name you will remember. Consider creating a new folder in case you end up splitting the project into multiple files.

, If you just finished recording and watching your preview, saving the project will automatically open it in the Editor. This is where you will be making your changes, cutting out anything unnecessary and adding transitions.

, Before you can begin editing, you will be asked what dimensions you want the final product to be. You can choose presets from the dropdown menu. These presets will be labeled with what they are recommended for.


Try to use one of the automatic dimensions. These are based off the initial recording dimensions, and are resized to keep the original proportions. Choosing one of these will help prevent the image from being squished or stretched.
You can change your editing dimensions at any time by clicking the Dimensions button at the top of the preview pane.

, Chances are, no matter how prepared you were, there are a few errors in your presentation. Luckily, you can quickly remove these errors with just a few clicks. Note: If your audio and video are on separate tracks on the timeline, deleting a section from one will not remove it from the other.


Use the timeline navigation tool to find exactly where you want top cut. Click the magnifying glass to zoom in on the timeline, allowing for more precise control.
Click and drag the red tab at the top of the Timeline navigation tool. Drag the red tab to the end of the section that you want to cut.
Press Space to play back just the part that you have selected.
Click the Cut button (scissors icon) above the Timeline to remove the selection.

, If you scaled down your video dimensions, Camtasia will apply the SmartFocus effect to zoom and pan around your presentation to focus on the active element. It will attempt to put focus on the cursor and active window.


You can see where SmartFocus was added automatically by looking for the icons in the Timeline.
Click and drag a SmartFocus icon to move when the transition occurs.
Click a SmartFocus icon and then click the Visual Properties button to edit exactly how the transition occurs. You can make the pan slower or faster, make the zoom more or less pronounced, or delete the SmartFocus transition entirely.
You can remove all SmartFocus animations by right-clicking on one of the icons and selecting ""Delete all visual animations on media"".

, Callouts are visual aids that help draw the attention of the viewer to important aspects of your presentation. Callouts can be text or they can be symbols or highlights. You can also use callouts to blur out parts of the screen.


Use the Timeline to navigate to the portion of your presentation that you want to add a callout to.
Click the Callout button above the Timeline.
Create your callout. You can use a variety of predesigned shapes, type your own text, or choose an animated callout.
Click the ""+Add callout"" button to add it to your presentation.
Move the callout around the presentation by dragging it around the preview pane. You can adjust the length of the callout from the Timeline.

, Once your video is edited and ready to be seen, it's time to export it and share it. Click the ""Produce and share"" button to get started.

, You can share directly to a few built-in services, such as Screencast.com and YouTube. You can also create a video file instead that you can share on your own or upload to another service.


When creating a video file, choose the ""MP4 Only"" option. This will create a video that can be played on virtually any device.

, If you are uploading to YouTube or Screencast, you will be asked for your login information so that Camtasia can connect to the service and upload the video for your account.

, If you need to create a video in a format other than the provided presets, click the ""Custom production settings"" option when finalizing your video. You will be able to choose from a variety of formats, including WMV, MOV, AVI, and even GIF.


MP4 is the most universal format for devices and web streaming.
Be careful when choosing the resolution of your final product. Upscaling (increasing the resolution) will result in quality loss. For example, if you recorded at 800x450, avoid publishing at 1920x1080.Strike a balance between size and quality. When setting video options, you will see a slider with ""Smaller file"" on the left and ""Higher quality"" on the right. Moving the slider will affect the final quality of the video. Keep file size in mind if you need to distribute the video to a lot of people.

, Camtasia can produce videos that open with the Camtasia controller bar. While you won't be able to upload these to a video streaming service, you can use them on your own site or distribute them through other methods.

, Try to run through your presentation several times before you start recording. Practice any difficult words or tricky window transitions. Make sure that everything you'll need is going to load. Refine your script to cut out any unnecessary information or fluff. All of this will save you a lot of time in the Editor later down the line., When recording your screen, move the mouse steadily and slowly between each task. Try to move in straight lines without jerking the cursor around. Move slowly enough so that viewers will be able to see where you are moving to and clicking.


Don't use your mouse to emphasize things on your screen! This will be extremely distracting to the viewer. Instead, use the Callouts feature in Camtasia to add effects that draw the viewers' attention to what you want to highlight.
Don't block what you are recording with your cursor. Use your mouse to navigate and open what you need to, then move it out of the way so that it doesn't obstruct the viewers' view of what you are doing.

, Slow down your presentation so that everyone can follow. Chances are, the reason you are doing this presentation is because you are good with the program you are demonstrating. Your audience, however, is unfamiliar with it, so your presentation should make sure that they have time to take everything in without having to pause and rewind all the time.

, When creating your presentation, you may find it really beneficial to break it down into smaller chunks. For example, if you are making a 30 minute presentation, you could separate it into six 5-minute sections. This not only makes it easier for the audience (if you decide to keep it split, which you certainly don't have to do), it also make sit much easier to edit and find the exact frames you need. You can easily splice your clips together at the end."

, Type a name you want for your image in the box labelled ""Name"" then pick the width and height you want in the boxes labelled ""Width"" and ""Height"".

, Play around with the brushes on the side to find one that you think fits what you need. The basic brushes are:


""Pen"", which is solid and doesn't blend,
""Brush"", which is similar to pen but blends with whatever colour is underneath it,
""Eraser"" removes any colour,
""AirBrush"" is like ""Brush"" but has blurry edges,
""Water"" has hardly any colour but can blend two together without adding any.

, If you scroll underneath the default brushes you will see empty grey boxes, these are spaces to add your own custom brushes.


Right click on one of these boxes and choose an option to base your brush off.
Either right click on your new brush and select ""Options"" or double click it, this will open the ""Custom Tool"" menu.
In the menu you can change the name, description, stroke and pressure stabilizers, and a shortcut key which you can press to automatically select your brush.

, Sometimes default brush settings aren't what you need so you will eventually need to change them. All the settings are underneath where you select brushes.


The four black icons directly below the brush selection control how blurry the edges of your brushes are.
""Min Size"" determines how small your brush can get when pressing lightly on a pen tablet. ""Density"" is how opaque or transparent the brush is.
The ""(simple circle)"" drop-down menu lets you choose the shape of the brush and the ""(no texture)"" one gives the brush an overlay, the sliders nest to the drop-down menus control how strongly these settings appear.
Blending controls how much the brush colour blends with the colours around it.
Dilution is how much colour your brush hold when it goes over other colours.
Persistence determines how long the brush holds the colour over unpainted areas when it blends with something.

,


""Min Density"" is the same as ""Min Size"" mentioned in the previous step but with density instead of size.
""Max Density Pressure"" is how much pressure it takes to get to 100% density.
""Hard <-> Soft"" is for how much pressure you use when using the brush, hard meaning you push down a lot and soft for more gentle people.

, Way above the brushes you will find a rainbow circle with a square inside it. Clicking anywhere along the circle will select a hue and clicking in the square will change the saturation and brightness. There are also a few options above the colour wheel:


An ""RGB Slider"" that lets you select a colour by mixing different amounts of red, green, and blue,
A ""HSV Slider"" is a different way to change the hue, saturation, and brightness,
The ""Colour Mixer"" gives you a slider to put two colours in to select and colour in between them,
""Swatches"" lets you save colours for later by right-clicking and selecting ""Set"",
A ""Scratchpad"" so you can test your colours and brush settings without touching your artwork.

, On the side of your window, there should be a large grey box with a small purple box inside it that says ""Layer 1"". Layers are like painting on sheets of glass and placing the sheets on top of each other to make a picture, this allows you to change parts of a picture without touching the rest and change how things overlap in your image.

Install the latest video card drivers on your device.",How to Stop Buffering," Other background processes and downloads will consume extra resources and bandwidth that could otherwise be attributed toward live streaming. Quit any games and applications that may be running in the background when doing live streaming., This allows your computer to download more of the video so you can watch the video in its entirety without breaks or pausing.

, Upgrade your Internet router or Internet plan with your Internet Service Provider (ISP), or routinely delete your browser’s cache and cookies to help reduce buffering and lag time.


Try using a dual-band router that offers a five GHz network with extra bandwidth. This router type is often most suitable for online streaming and is known to reduce buffering.

, The servers of content providers such as Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube may be slower or busier than usual depending on the provider’s resources and peak hours. For instance, research conducted by the FCC has shown that peak times for Internet traffic is between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. If your videos continue to buffer, wait until the services are less busy before watching videos.

, Multiple devices being used on the same Internet network will consume that network’s bandwidth and cause buffering, especially if your router is unable to support a heavy traffic load. When streaming videos, make sure Internet usage is limited across devices., Malicious software will often cause one or more processes to run in the background and slow down your Internet speed., Reducing the quality of videos helps decrease bandwidth and instances of buffering. If using third-party software or services to stream videos, modify video quality via the settings menu.

, Wireless Internet connections are more likely to be disrupted by problems with signal, frequency, and physical obstructions, such as walls or furniture. Try switching to a wired connection to help eliminate problems with buffering., Most video streaming sites use Adobe Flash, which means running an outdated version of Flash can cause buffering during live streaming. Navigate to the official website for Adobe Flash Player at https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/, and select the option to install the latest software version.

, Most video cards are updated automatically at the time you install Microsoft or Apple updates. However, if you installed your own custom video card, navigate to the manufacturer’s website to download and install updated drivers for your video card."

Take the camera off Auto.,
Read the manual.

,
Set the ISO lower.,
Make sure you set your White balance to the correct setting.,
Set your shutter manually and as a rule of thumb leave it at double your frame rate for regular shooting i.e.,
Get a fluid head tripod.,
When shooting, don’t be lazy and just continuously record.,
Make sure you use manual focus.,
Take your camera off Auto.,
Use good filters.,
Talk to who you are filming, build a relationship with them.,
Learn how to frame.,
Enjoy and experiment.,
Get hold of some basic accessories to make your life easier.",How to Shoot Video With Your DSLR,";
,, If you are shooting exterior in bright natural light make sure you set your ISO to a low setting to avoid unwanted grain. If you want a grainy image for effect, it is very easy to add in post-production. When you are filming in low light situations, experiment and only push your ISO to what looks acceptable for your individual camera.

, This is really important when moving from indoor to outdoor and between different lighting environments. If you shoot in indoor mode (3200K) outdoors your image will have a blue colour cast and your skin tones will look unnatural. This is down to colour temperature. Our eyes are amazing at dealing with change in colour temp, however, cameras need to be told this. Colour temp is measured in degrees Kelvin, any vague memory of the Kelvin Scale from Science class..? Daylight is approx 5600K. If you set the colour temp to the wrong one, unlike stills even with the most advanced colour correcting tools, this is incredibly hard and time consuming to correct in video and you will never be able to get it to look 100% natural.

, if you are shooting at 25fps (European standard) set your shutter to 1/50 of a second. Increasing the shutter speed is good for shooting high-speed action i.e. a racing car. Regular action shot with a high shutter will have a staccato effect and look unnatural. Horror movies often use this as an effect.

, Even though you are using a stills camera, you do need some video tools and accessories. A fluid head tripod is one of them. This will allow you to do smooth pans side to side and tilts up and down.

, You will end up with hours of rubbish to trawl though in the edit. It is better to turn over (record) 4-5 seconds before your action starts and cut 4-5 seconds afterward. If you are doing a move i.e. a pan of a landscape, then record 5 seconds of the static frame at the beginning then pan then continue to record 5 seconds of the end frame. This will give you 3 shots instead of just one.

, Auto focus, can be great on stills, but for the moving image it will continuously ‘hunt’ for focus. This is because the camera will be looking for what to focus on. This is especially true in low light situations when you have a much shallower depth of field. Practice following movement, the more you practice the better you will get at manually focusing.

, Learn about Manual Exposure. It is 100% better to manually set the aperture (F Stop). This way you expose for what is important in the frame and the exposure won't change when you pan from something light to dark. Exposure has a direct effect on depth of field. Read up on this and how you can select what is and isn’t in focus. A shallow depth of field will give your image a much more 3D quality.

, Buying a screw on neutral density (ND) filter will help you control the amount of light that enters your camera and hence the exposure. This will help you correctly expose using a wide aperture and regular video shutter 1/50 shutter speed ensuring a shallow depth of field even in bright light.

, Get them to feel comfortable with you and being filmed. Giving them encouragement will increase their confidence and in turn increase the quality of the end product.

, Framing is one of the most important aspects in filming. Watch movies and good quality TV series with the sound off - This way you will concentrate on how the images are framed without getting drawn into the story. Look at how the sequences are edited together and how different angles cut together.

, Try shooting hand held. Learn how to be comfortable with the camera. The more you feel comfortable and in-control behind the camera the more your filming skills will improve.

, A follow focus unit will make focusing much more accurate. A viewfinder will allow you to see your image much clearer so you can spot focus and exposure easily.

Think about how you would like the video to look when it is finished, namely, are you telling a story or recording an event?,
Go over in your mind the type of activities that are taking place at the family event so that you can make mental note of the things that you would like to capture on film.

,
Find out the scheduled timing of the event and when certain activities will occur so that you will not miss any opportunities.

,
Bring extra batteries and tapes so that you are well prepared.

,
Before the guests arrive, take some shots of the setting so you can use it as part of your introduction, conclusion and transitions (i.e., b roll).

,
Begin filming the event when guests arrive and make sure to capture all the things that you planned.

,
Consider including the following extra footage to make the video more interesting:



posterity - having the elders in the family talk about the past, family traditions

food - if the recipe has meaning
memorable or exciting gifts

memorable moments - funny stories, meaningful quotes or thoughts about what the holidays mean; and

skits - mini plays that the children might put on for the family.

Download an Instagram resizer app.,
Run the resizer app.,
Upload the image to Instagram.",How to Resize Digital Photos6," Since Instagram uploads take place entirely on your mobile device, it is much more convenient to edit the photos that you take directly on your phone. There are multiple apps available that can resize your photos so that Instagram does not crop them.


If you want to resize a photo on your computer before uploading it to Instagram, resize it to 612 X 612 pixels. This is the size of the Instagram format.

, Depending on the app, the features may change. Most will allow you to resize your image so that it fits, and others will allow you to crop your existing image so that the cropped section fits into Instagram.

, Open your Instagram app and browse for your newly resized image. Upload as you normally would and you won’t lose any part of the image due to cropping.

"

Check the size of your image.,
Go to file and scroll down to Save for Web & Devices.,
Adjust the quality of your image, it is best to keep it set at High and the number as high as you can afford, but note that the higher the resolution, the longer it will take to load.

,
Save the file.",How to Save a .Jpg File for Web," With your file open in Photoshop, the first thing you want to do is make sure that it is small enough for the web. Go to Image and scroll down to Image Size, this will show a dialogue that displays your current image size settings. In pixel dimensions, make sure that neither dimension is above 1000 pixels and for the resolution, be sure to make the image 72 dpi (the standard for web images).;
, In the bottom left corner of the Dialogue that appeared, the size of your file is shown, it is important to pay attention to this, because your goal is to get that as low as you possibly can without sacrificing the quality of your image (Below 120K.)

,, Now it should be ready for posting!

, Leave this chart on your worksheet for now. Here is an image of the Preliminary Chart with axes, grid lines and the legend removed. You may have to set the Scale to ±1.5 or so to get good roundness.
Random Beads Chart: Change the definition of Chgr from D3 to Insert Name Define Name Chgr for $X$10:$X$1450. Set Circle or Radius to = 4. You'll have to reopen the scale to defaults and perhaps reset the vertical to ± 5 or so. Your chart won't look like mine due to randomness. Hold down the Command key and tap the = key until you get an arrangement you like. Using Chart Layout, get rid of the default axes, legend and grid lines, unless you want to add shadow to the axis w/o numbers. That requires removing the linked to source checkmark and any pre-set number of decimal places and formatting them like this: ;;; Also get rid of the Plot Area and Chart Area default Line. You can set gradient to whatever you like, radial or path, centered, with as many colors as you like -- I used black at the tips and formatted the plot area to have a radial glowspot in blue and purple at the center. My line gradient went Black Red, Pink, Blue, Black. I set the Shadow to Perspective, Size 70%, Blur 0, Distance 0, Transparency 71% for Series 1. For the Plot Area, I also had A medium solid Blue at size 45 pt, 25% transparent, soft edges, 29 pt. And Plot Area Fill was left blue, then Pink in a tight band captured on the left by another blue and o the right by black. with 61% transparency, radially centered. 3D Format was Depth and Surface, Surface Material Powder. For Chart Area, I had Fill White with 0% transparency. I did a Copy Picture with the Shift Key and Paste Picture with the Shift Key and double-clicked on it and chose Picture Style as you see, once I had copied and pasted it atop my data worksheet and copied and pasted that picture. I had also added a Title about the file and the critical variable settings. Here is another view of that chart.
Overlapping Spiral Chart: Reset Chgr to Insert Name Define Name Chgr to $D$3. I had to rescale the chart to -.75 to .50 on the Vertical and -1, 1 on the Horizontal. Variable Factor was set to .50 and Radius was set to .50 -- Here are some pictures of that chart.
Asymptotic Axes Chart: Set Power to 3. Reset the axes to defaults if Radius = 1 and Factor = .5 while Power = 3.. Here is a picture of that chart. Of course the Title info is wrong, but those are the breaks ....

When you transfer your photos from your camera to your computer, immediately put them into a folder on your hard drive -- not just My Pictures, but create a subfolder by date (use reverse date format e.g.,
If you already have copious numbers of photos dumped into your My Pictures folder, take some time to create sub-folders as described above, and sort them into the appropriate folder.

Regularly back up your photos by burning them onto a CD or DVD.,
Log your best shots.,
Import these images into a library.,
As soon as the ink is dry, organize your photos into albums.,
Do the above step for all of the photos you already have printed out.,
Remember that if you back up your photos onto a CD, and leave them on the computer as well, you will eventually find you have multiple copies of the same photo in different folders.,One good method of organizing is to put only photos about a particular subject on each CD and label it as such, such as ""grandkids"" or ""reunion 98"" then if you want a particular subject you can find it easily because you don't have ""sewing projects"" on the same CD as ""Reunions""

,, Nothing is worse than having a hard drive crash and losing all of your pictures. Then, put your CD or DVD into a box, holder, or album (you can find 'photo albums' for picture CDs in photography shops) so you know where it is and have easy access. You can also use Online file backup services like Dropbox, Sugarsync or SkyDrive or use a dedicated Photo Share site that offers file synchronization like InmyPhotofolder.

, Open all your images from a shoot. On a mac you can do this in preview. Scroll through these images and jot down your favourite shots. By doing this you can reduce 200 images down to 20.

, On a mac you could import them into iPhoto.

, The sooner you do this, the fewer photos you will have piling up and cluttering your space, not to mention getting damaged.

, Use different albums to catalogue and categorize -- for example, you can keep separate albums for friends, events you attend, and 'artful' shots that you take.

After de-saturating the background, change the sponge tool to saturate and set it at a smaller value (7-8%) Paint over the subject to slightly bring out the colour.",How to Remove Cluttered Background on Your Photos," Cropping out as much of the background as possible is a simple easy, short-cut. Just make sure that you don’t detract from some of the basic rules of composition and symmetry.;
, Use the lasso tool from our toolbox to very roughly select around our subject. Make sure that you leave a little bit of space around his body. Eliminate some of the extraneous space by feathering our edge. In Photoshop, go to Select - Feather. The value will differ depending on the final size of our image. You want to choose a number of pixels that brings the marquee selection closer into your subject without crossing over any of their edges.

, To blur the background use the Gaussian blur tool. Go to - Filter - Blur - Gaussian Blur. Choose a value that blurs the background without totally eliminating our perception of the subjects. If you have the preview button ticked you can keep trying until you get something that works perfectly.

, In the final stage, desaturate the background slightly to further increase the emphasis on the main subject. Select your sponge tool and set it to desaturate 15%, then brush over the majority of the background.

, The final effect should be subtle - but should help the subject of your image - just pop a little out of the background.

Use Microsoft Paint for basic adjustments.,
Grab Serif Photo Plus.,
Use PhotoFiltre to add filters and effects with ease.",How to Modify Pictures for Free1," Paint is a feeble program in terms of photo editing and retouching, but it's not without its uses. Right-click and choose to open your photo in Paint, and you can easily rotate it, resize it, or crop parts of the image out. You can crop and zoom to “blow up” a specific part of the picture too, although image quality will suffer. Paint can save edited files in various popular formats, including PNG and JPEG.


Paint is also useful for adding text to an image. Be sure to select the transparent text box option so that the text box doesn't appear as an ugly white ribbon blocking out the image underneath.
Most of Paint's other options are fine for doodling, but useless for photo editing.
If you've lost your copy of Paint, download the superior Paint.NET program instead. It was started as a Microsoft project to replace Paint, and it has more features than the original. The link to download it is provided later in this article.;
, The free version of Serif's elegant photo editing software may not have the features of a program like Photoshop, but it's a dream for gently editing photos. Red-eye reduction, color correction, and several basic filters and effects make this an ideal program for the person who wants to make a family reunion photo look a bit better.


You can safely download Serif Photo Plus from the Serif website.

, If your photos don't require extensive touch-ups, but you suspect they might look better with a bit of basic filter and layer manipulation, PhotoFiltre is the program for you. The program features a large number of professional, easy-to-use transparency and contour effects that can change the look and feel of nearly any photo. It's also very streamlined, and takes up hardly any space on your hard drive.


PhotoFiltre is free for private use, but if you plan to use it commercially (creating advertisements, for example), you'll need to pay for a license. The licensed version is somewhat more powerful than the free version.
You can safely download PhotoFiltre 7 from the PhotoFiltre website.

Choose the photographs or other media you want to reduce to thumbnail pictures.,
Use photo editing software to make a copy of the illustration.,
Apply a dust and scratch reducing filter or a strong blur filter to your illustration.,
Optimize the photo and crop it.,
Reduce the original picture size.,
Increase the saturation of the thumbnail.,
Apply a sharpening filter to the thumbnail.,
Add a border to the thumbnail.,
Save the image.",How to Make Thumbnails,"



 ;
,






Perform all edits, with the exception of sharpening, in your editing program before making the copy. Sharpening will be done after the size reduction.

,






Select ""Filters"" on your toolbar and choose the filter you want to apply from the dropdown menu or toolbar. This process will reduce or eliminate any graininess or other imperfections to the photograph before it is reduced to a thumbnail.

,






Use the cropping tool in your editing program and select the area you want to crop away. This could be empty spaces or irrelevant parts of the picture.

,


This can be done by choosing ""Resize"" from the edit dropdown menu or toolbar. Most programs will let you choose how you want the size reduced, either by pixels or percentages. Use whichever works best for your needs.

,


Saturation is the amount of color in the illustration. The colors stand out better with thumbnails if you increase saturation. You can do this by selecting ""Colors"" from the toolbar and select ""Saturation"" from the dropdown list.

,


You will find ""Unsharp mask"" in the ""Filters"" dropdown on the toolbar. Contradictory to what you might think, this tool will actually sharpen the image. This allows for sharper detail and will bring out artifacts in the thumbnail that might otherwise be missed.

,


This element is optional, but it will help your thumbnails stand out from the page. Border options can usually be found in the toolbar dropdown menu under ""Select."" Usually a black border is ideal, but experiment with other colors to find a suitable border.

,






The most universally recognized format to save any thumbnail is JPEG. Make sure that you set your quality high (80 percent or higher) so you do not lose the details in your thumbnail due to JPEG compression.
Alternatively, you could use the PNG format, which saves the quality. It takes more room in your storage than JPEG, however.

Download GIMP.,
Try using Paint.NET.,
Give Photo Pos Pro a whirl.,
Pirate Photoshop.",How to Modify Pictures for Free2," Despite the weird name, GIMP (which stands for GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a widely-used and popular alternative to Photoshop. Though it's not quite as slick as its retail counterpart, GIMP can produce most of the same effects, and has another significant advantage in that it's completely free.


GIMP isn't easy to learn. Aside from basic functions, expect to spend a significant chunk of time learning how to work with the program's tools. The upside is that the program is very powerful – no other free program comes close to the level of manipulation GIMP offers.
GIMP is the best free choice if you'd like to make significant alterations to images, such as adding or deleting objects, drastically altering the appearance of a person, or adding realistic special effects. It's also the best choice for fine detail work, such as altering the properties of individual flower petals in a garden scene.
GIMP offers a thriving library of plugins written specifically for the program, which add textures, effects, and just about anything else imaginable. Like GIMP itself, these plugins are typically free. In addition, GIMP even has a plugin, the PSPI plugin, that allows it to handle Photoshop plugins, effectively giving it an even larger plugin library than Photoshop itself.
GIMP can be downloaded safely from the official GIMP website.

, Paint.NET is an old program originally designed to rival Microsoft Paint. It's been kept alive and continuously developed by a devoted community of enthusiasts, and these days, the program has a surprising number of photo editing features. Paint.net is a more user-friendly (albeit less feature-rich) alternative to GIMP.


Paint.NET is a popular choice for many people over GIMP, because it provides most of the tools that non-professional image creators are likely to use, without any of the clutter or confusion of having extra options. It is able to apply filters, handle layers, and more, all with a fairly intuitive interface.
Paint.NET is moderately capable of handling advanced image manipulation (the type seen in many “Photoshop contests” around the web), but the results will generally look amateurish compared to GIMP's results.
Paint.NET can be downloaded safely from the official website.

, Somewhere between Paint.NET and GIMP in terms of functionality, Photo Pos Pro was once a pay-to-use program, and it shows. Since being released as freeware, it's become a popular choice for people who want a full suite of effects without the hassle of learning to use GIMP. The program features blurring, sharpening, noise control, red eye reduction, and all the other effects you need (even layers!) to give your images just the right look. It's also surprisingly easy to use.


Photo Pos Pro's installer is fairly innocuous, but it will try to set your homepage to a website called MyStart, which is known for an irritating (though not directly dangerous) add-on called the MyStart Incredibar that can be difficult to remove once installed. Be sure to disallow changing your homepage, as well as the installation of any software other than the program itself.
Photo Pos Pro can be downloaded safely from CNet's direct download link. Clicking this link will automatically start the download once the page has loaded, but it avoids CNet's pointless custom installation software.

, If you absolutely must have a copy of Adobe Photoshop and are unwilling to pay for the privilege, there are ways to acquire it without paying. You'll likely have to settle for an older iteration of the program than the current version, but even slightly dated copies of Photoshop are unbeatably powerful compared to other software.


The most reliable way to pirate Photoshop is by torrenting. To torrent Photoshop, you'll need to find a torrent of the copy you want (which should be as easy as a Google search), and then download the torrent file and open it with a special program that reads it, such as BitTorrent.
Downloading a copy of the software isn't enough to unlock it. You'll also need a license. The simplest way to get a license is to run a “crack” program that will generate a fake license code that fools the program into thinking you're a legitimate user. If you can, try to download the crack along with the program itself, as a single package; finding cracks separately is a dangerous and difficult procedure.
Although many people agree that Photoshop is overpriced, that doesn't justify stealing the software in and of itself. Be aware that you could get in trouble for pirating it.

Enjoy (some of) the gold standard at Photoshop.com.,
Choose your weapon at Pixlr.com.,
Get basic touch-ups done quickly at Fotor.com.",How to Modify Pictures for Free3," Photoshop.com's Express Editor is a streamlined, online version of Adobe's universally-known image manipulation software. It's got a paltry handful of options compared to the real thing, but that's still more options than most of its competitors can muster. Best of all, the site's interface is slick and practical at the same time. Photoshop.com has a range of sophisticated tools including dodge and burn tools, highlighting, and distortion and sketch effects, among many others.


The Express Editor's interface is somewhat different than that of Photoshop itself. Users familiar with one won't necessarily be able to jump right into the other.
Photoshop.com provides each user 2 gigabytes of cloud storage space for photos. As professionals know, this isn't enough to handle many serious, high-quality images, but it's great for ordinary, run-of-the-mill ones.

, Image editing site Pixlr offers three separate, interconnected tools for playing with images. The most powerful, Pixlr Editor, allows resizing, cropping, rotation, and a number of useful effects and filters. Pixlr Express, the next step up in terms of ease and efficiency, offers a range of premade effects that can be applied with the click of a button. The easiest of the three interfaces, Pixlr-o-Matic, simply applies filter and frame effects, in much the same vein as Instagram.


Switching from area to area is a bit awkward, so start with the most powerful tool you need first, and then mess with the less serious tools once you're done there.

, Fotor is a very streamlined image editing tool that provides filters and other basic touch-ups in a set, ordered series of steps. It's useless for spot-editing, but if you just want to quickly sharpen a photo without having to practice anything, it's quite handy. Fotor also provides some fun effects and frames you can try once you've cleaned up your picture.


To finalize changes you've made, you'll need to click the “Apply” button at each step. Unfortunately, the button sometimes moves around, and can be a bit difficult to find. Be patient and look carefully to find where it's gone.

Go check the DATA worksheet and see that all the errors have vanished. If not, see Tips or Errors below please.

,

Activate Data worksheet and Edit Go To under Main X and Main Y cell range E6:F2886. Either do Chart Wizard or select Chart on the Ribbon (activated in Preferences) and select All, Scattered, Smoothed Line Scattered. If using Chart Wizard, a new Chart worksheet will be created. Otherwise, copy or cut and paste the chart into the upper left corner of the Chart worksheet you created at the beginning, and hover the mouse over the lower right corner until it becomes a double-headed arrow and then use it to pull the chart into an expansion of a large Square. Format Selection Glow yellow transparency 25% and Line Weight 1 and Bright Blue from the color table. This is the chaotic planet surface.
On the Chart worksheet, do menuitem Chart Add Data. In response to the Range request, activate the Data worksheet again and Edit Go To under Second X and Second Y cell range H6:I2886. When I do it, it does not work right and it takes column E instead of column H. Click on the second standard ring series, or double-click until it appears in the formula bar and edit it until it reads as follows: =SERIES(,Data!$H$6:$H$2886,Data!$I$6:$I$2886,2). Edit the line of Series 2 to be dashed and 1 point line weight and Foresty Green to Lawn Green to Leafy Green in hue. It's a yellowish-green, not a blue-green with a very light yellow very transparent glow. This is the external planet ring.
The first series, after clicking on it, should read as follows: =SERIES(,Data!$E$6:$E$2886,Data!$F$6:$F$2886,1). Any other series which Excel creates should be deleted by clicking on it and deleting it from the Formula Bar.
DELETED: Edit Series 1 ( the one with the last digit = to 1 in the series formula, and the one randomized or input by you or spirallic) by double-clicking on it for line weight = .25, glow = canary yellow size 8 point 25% transparent, if you want to start off resembling mine.
On the Chart worksheet, do menuitem Chart Add Data. In response to the Range request, activate the Data worksheet again and Edit Go To under RoseX and Rose Y cell range J6:K2886. When I do it, it does not work right and it takes column E or something instead of column J and K. Click on this next/center series3, or double-click until it appears in the formula bar and edit it until it reads as follows: =SERIES(,Data!$J$6:$J$2886,Data!$K$6:$K$2886,3). Edit the line of Series 3 to be 1 point line weight and very light pink to light maroon in hue. It's a very light orange very transparent glow. This is the central heart of the planet and it's a charming radial rose.
On the Chart worksheet, do menuitem Chart Add Data. In response to the Range request, activate the Data worksheet again and Edit Go To under EGGIES X and EGGIES Y cell range M6:N2886. When I do it, it does not work right and it takes column E or something instead of column J and K.This time, that is the effect we want, so click on the series formula in the formula bar and edit it until it reads: =SERIES(,Data!$E$6:$E$2886,Data!$N$6:$N$2886,1). Edit the line of Series 1 (it's been reset to be series 1 visa that last digit in the series formula) to be 1 point line weight and very bright blue in hue.. These are the visiting spheroids and they're very glad to be home.
To make the other picture we want EGGIES X and EGGIES Y cell range M6:N2886. When I do it, it does not work right and it takes column E or something instead of column J and K.This time, that is NOT the effect wanted, so click on the series formula in the formula bar and edit it until it reads: =SERIES(,Data!$M$6:$M$2886,Data!$N$6:$N$2886,1). Edit the line of Series 1 (it's been reset to be series 1 via that last digit in the series formula) to be 1 point line weight and very bright blue in hue.. These are the visiting spheroids and they're very glad to be home.
Double-click on the Plot Area and set the Gradient to be Radial, Centered, Dark Purple on left and Prussian Blue on right. My pigments are all put away right now or it would be easier to say if it was Prussian, Cerulean, Ultramarine, Cobalt or some other blue. Sorry - get them mixed up. I have No Line set for either the Plot Area or the Chart Area, no Chart Titles, No Axes which are all controlled by Chart Layout (which appears on the Ribbon when you click on the Chart Plot Area).
Copy the formulas  from A1:X34 to the Saves worksheet and then, below the formulas, paste them again, and then do Paste Special Values right over them. Then with the shift key held down, tale a picture of the chart under each of the two series definitions, Pasting Pictures with the shift key depressed into the Saves worksheet under the data.
Save the workbook.

When you have the base, load it in your graphics editing program of choice.

,, A palette is a range of colors, dark to light, to create a sense of 3D and shading. Again, you can usually find these on doller's websites. Or you can make your own by taking five or six samples of different shades of the colors you'll be using.

, Use the darkest shade of the hair color to make the outline of it. Start with an easy hairstyle, or find an example of one on the web. If you mess up, you can undo by pressing Ctrl+Z.

, This will be your base, and the rest of the colors will later be used for shading.

, Once you feel you've had enough of it, select the third-lightest shade and add in streaks of that as well. You don't need to have very many of these. Now, draw a halo-like circle over the hair with the second-lightest shade, and add in tiny bits of the lightest one into it. This is the light reflecting off the hair.

, Again, start with something simple, or go online to browse for ideas., If they look too bland and boring, add in designs - stripes, bubbles, flowers, words, - make it original!"

Decide the style you want: thin fiber style or blocks style (extra wide line thicknesses).,
Decide whether you will have just the front group of fibers, or both front and back groups and, if so, how detailed the back group needs to be.,Decide if you need an ""exploding flower"" as part of your design -- if so, research the designs of the Eggies Spiritual Adventures series of articles written by xhohx and you will find a rose pattern with a hole in the center to get you started -- try Create a Dakini and Boddhisattva Aspect of the Mother Planet or see the Related wikiHow below.,
Decide how many fibers you want per quadrant -- this example uses 30 per quadrant of 90 degrees, or 120 in all 4 quadrants of 360 degrees.,
Do Data Series 2 and chart it:

Using the Command key between selections and the Shift key within selections, select cell ranges G1:H1, G2:H3 and G4:H14 simultaneously and do Format Cells Border Red Bold Outline per section.,

Tap within the circle on the chart to select the plot area and do menu item Chart Add Data. Select cell range G5:H13 in response to the Query Box that arises. Do not be alarmed if the results are wrong. There may be two lines, one of which is extra. Find, by tapping on each series plot, between the two the one which ends with ...$H$5:$H$13,2) because that's the one you want and the other one is to be deleted. Correct in the formula bar the beginning of the series to $G$5:$G$13 from the C's or whatever it was in error. The line should plot now at about the 3 PM position in approximately a straight line with a bend at the end. Do Format Series and select the Line width to be 1 or .75 (at most 2), the Glow to be 2 and 50% and choose the color gradients of blues or browns or whites at the tips -- whatever your model picture shows in that position, OK;

, This will cue you as to the row number to use in the top section, e.g. in I2:J3 -- (the 3 was used to keep track of numbers of lines plus glow lines already added previously)(in truth, however, often a line thickness of .75 or 1.75 was used simply because 3.75 was the default, and 1 + 2 glow lines had not been figured out yet until it was seen that the center pupil was not coming out as a near-perfect circle at all, due to such variations as line thickness and glow variances -- much re-tracing of steps was done; an error which you hopefully needn't repeat);

, Keep doubling in this way until you reach 128 and stop and trim off until the total number of data series, including 2, is 240 columns (120 series of x's and y's).
Do Edit Replace routine per row 15, without any errors, for rows 2 and 3 -- for example, if in Row 15 column G, there is a 5, then replace the common row number in cell range G2:H3 with 5, Replace All, OK; do that for every single series, all the way across!
Construct the chart carefully by selecting the cell range to chart of G5:H13, or I5:J13 for the next series, etc, all the way across, and patiently as per the above step(s); it was found that 30 data points took about 2 hours to do, so the whole chart took 8 hours over 2 days to complete, prior to error cleanup; here is an example of a gradient as you must set the line width and gradient by clicking on the series plot each time you chart a series, all the way across! Remember line width should be .75 to 2 and the gradient and glow size and transparency percentage are set individually per iris fiber in accordance with your individual pupil photo you're copying, but generally should remain constant or the pupil will not come out a nearly perfect circle. The Modifier formula also bears on the situation, so keep that difference pretty tiny, like 1.007 vs. .993, for a total difference of .014, or less. Generally speaking, this author thinks a change of .005 is visible, but is not sure exactly. Visual acuity varies between individuals. On the other hand, Excel has set the minimum line weight at .25, which is definitely thicker than their glow or transparent objects. The situation pictured below, of an imperfect circle, was corrected by keeping glow size to 2 and transparency to 50%, constantly. Otherwise, it is a Gradient Example.





Here is an example of a data chit reconciliation for columns A:D -- just making sure everything was on track;


 A281 to D281 example



, Make it semi-transparent, and change the color to White (and it's best to start with a white object in this author's opinion); place it on the main chart;





Hold down the Shift Key and do Copy Picture to your Saves worksheet where you will again hold down the Shift Key and do Paste picture. Your picture should resemble the one below but if the reflection doesn't show, even though you've grouped it with the chart, then try Grabbing the Image and exporting a jpg from Preview:

Decide on a reputable video-to-GIF conversion app.,
Choose your source video.,
Load the video into the converter.,
Define the length of your GIF.Each site has different options for editing, but all will let you define a specific section of the video to convert to a GIF.,
Add text to your GIF.,
Create the file.",How to Make GIF Files1," There are many to choose from, such as Giphy GIF Makerand IMGUR Video to GIF, both of which can be used right in your web browser (no download necessary!)


If you prefer to download an app, make sure to read lots of reviews in your device’s app store. Never download and run software from a site you don’t trust.
The two apps mentioned can create GIFs from up to 15 seconds of online video. This is common.
Most converters require that your video be uploaded to an website like Youtube or Vimeo that allows you to publicly share videos. Others, like Giphy, also allow you to upload your own video.;
, Find a video online (or on your device if using a site like Giphy) that has anywhere from 0.5-15 seconds of movement to turn into a GIF. If you’re using a video on the internet, open it in your browser.

, This step will be different across different apps.


If you’re using a video on a site like Youtube, open the video in your browser. Copy the entire URL of the video file from the address bar, then paste it into appropriate the box in the video-to-GIF converter app. The box should say something like “Paste URL here.” Press ↵ Enter or click OK.
If you’re uploading video, find the button on the video-to-gif conversion tool (it should say something like “Browse Your Video Files”) and select the desired file.

, In Imgur, for example, your video will appear with a slider beneath it that allows you to set a “start” and “end” point for your image.

, Nearly every video-to-GIF maker allows you to add some text or other flair to your GIF. Look for a button that says something like “Add Text” or “Add Caption.”

, When you’re done with the creative process, click “Create GIF” or “Save GIF” in your web app to launch the Save menu. Choose a name for your GIF and save it to your computer in a folder you’ll remember later.


If your GIF is over 10MB, web app converters will create a file that ends with a “.GIFV” instead of ”.GIF”, though you will still be able to use it as you would a normal GIF.
You can test your GIF out by opening it in your web browser. Navigate to the folder where you saved the GIF and drag it right into your browser window. Or, if you’re on a mobile device, browse to the file and tap it open. The animation will play instantly.

, There are lots to choose from, such as GifCreator and GIFMaker Video Maker. Both of these apps, and many others, are accessible on the web—no downloads required.


These converters generally have similar features, including the ability to modify the size of each frame and control animation speed. They can also be used on all mobile devices with web browsers.
There are also apps available for download that allow you to create GIFs, but many of the free ones are bogged down with ads. If you want to download an app, make sure you read reviews of each product before downloading.

, With the converter open in your browser, find the button that says something along the lines of “Upload Images” (depending on which converter you’re using). A browse box should appear, allowing you to select your first image. Double-click the image or select it and click “Open.” You should see a thumbnail appear in the converter.

, Most converters will also display some adjustable settings below the image, such as size or repeat times. You can move the sliders around to adjust these aspects now. You can also come back to them later by clicking the thumbnail of the image.

, Upload additional photos by clicking the “Upload Images” button. Most converters allow you to drag the images around to arrange them in different orders, so don’t worry if you upload them out of sequence. You can also adjust the size of each image. If your converter doesn’t already show a preview of the animation, look for a button that says “Preview” or “Play” to check your work.

, Once you’re done making adjustments to the order and size of your animation, click “Create GIF animation” or “Create GIF” to open the Save dialog. Select a memorable file name, as well as a folder on your device that you’ll remember. Click “Save” or “Download” to save your creation.

Preview and export your animation.",How to Make GIF Files3," If you’d like to create an animated GIF from scratch and are comfortable using GIMP, this method will work for you. Install Gimp if you’ve not yet done so, then launch the software.

, If you are more comfortable visualizing inches, choose “in” from the list and type your desired image size.
Next to “Fill with,” choose a color to use for the background of your GIF. There are two boxes beneath the side tool bar filled with colors—selecting “Foreground color” will use the color of the front square as the image color, and “Background color” will use the rear square color.
Click “OK” to create your image.

,, Click the small square piece of paper at the bottom left corner of the Layers box to open the New Layer dialog.


Type a name for your layer next to “Layer name” so you can easily switch between layers later.
To ensure a seamless animation, set the color to “Transparent,” then click “OK.”

, If you want to draw on this later, click the paintbrush icon in the sidebar, select a color, and draw your picture. To insert text, click the “A” on the sidebar, then click somewhere to begin typing.


Anything you put in this layer will be animated together. In other words, if you type some text and draw an image on this layer, these two elements will be in the same frame of the animation.
After you’re done putting images or text on this layer, look at the layers dialog and notice the “Opacity” option. To make a layer less opaque, slide the knob down until you see your desired results.

, This step can be repeated for as many different layers as you’d like in your animation. Give this new layer a name that’s unique from the last layer, then click “OK.”

, Open the Filters menu and select “Animation,” then “Playback.” You will see a preview of your animation, which GIMP creates from each of your layers.

, Open the File menu and click “Export,” then select “GIF image.” Make sure the box is checked next to “As animation.”


If you want the animation to loop continuously, put a check next to “Loop Forever.”
Next to “Delay between frames where unspecified,” enter the time (in milliseconds) you’d like each frame to display. By default, it’s 100 (which is why your preview looked rather fast). Change it to something larger, like 300 or 600, then click “Export.”

, If you don’t want each of your layers to appear for the same amount of time, you can edit the duration of each layer independently.


Right-click one of the layer names in the layers dialog and select “Edit layer attributes.”
Next to the layer name, type the duration (in milliseconds) directly, without a space, like this: LAYERNAME(200ms)

Click “OK to save that layer, and modify any additional layers in the same way.

, In the Filters menu, click “Animation” and select “Playback” to see how your changes have modified the animation. When you’re ready to save the image, click “File” then “Export,” and choose “GIF image” once more. Give your animation a name and click “Save” to finish.

Open the “File” menu and click “New” to view options for your new file. Type a name for your animation in the box next to “Name.”
In the “width” and “height” boxes, note the measurement types after the value boxes. It’s either set to inches or pixels, depending on what you’ve used in the past. If you feel comfortable specifying pixel size, change the measurement type to “Pixels.” If it’s easier for you to visualize inches, choose that option. Type your desired measurement in its corresponding box.
Choose a background color for your animation. Click the menu next to “Background” or “Background contents” (depending on your version of Photoshop) and choose from the color options.
Click “OK” to create your new image with these settings.

, Click the Window menu and check both Layers and Animations. The panels will then appear in your workspace.

, In the Layers panel, click the plus sign (+) to add a new layer. Next to “Name,” type a name for your layer, such as “Frame 1.” Set the Fill color either to Transparent or the color of your background. Click “OK” to create this new layer.


Each element of your animation needs to be on a unique frame. Anything you put on this new layer will animate as one frame.

, If you want to draw on this layer, choose a color from the swatch panel (the panel with all of the colored squares) then click the paintbrush tool. If you want to add text, click the “T” to launch the text tool.

, Create another layer and build the second frame of your animation.


If the next frame of your animation will simply be a slight modification to the first frame, you may want to “Clone” your layer instead of creating a new one. To clone the layer, right-click on that layer in the Layers panel and select “Duplicate layer.”
Continue creating or cloning layers until you have each individual frame of your animation on its own layer.

, In the Animation panel at the bottom of the screen, click the icon that is a small rectangle with a smaller square on top of it (the New Frame button). This will create one new frame. Click this button as many times as there are layers in your animation. If your animation will have 7 layers, create 7 frames.

, Click the first frame in the panel. As you can see from the thumbnail, this frame presently consists of every layer in your animation.


Notice that each layer in your Layers panel has a small eyeball symbol next to it. This symbol tells you that the layer is currently visible. To make the first frame in the Animation panel display only the first layer, remove the eyeball symbol from each of the other layers.
Change the duration for this frame by adjusting the time (in seconds) beneath the thumbnail, which currently reads “0 sec.”

, Click each additional frame and remove visibility from all layers other than the one you want to be visible in the frame. Remember to adjust the time at the bottom of each thumbnail.

, The Play button is located beneath the animation frames at the bottom of the screen.

, Click “File,” then “Save for Web and Devices.” Make sure that GIF is selected in the top pulldown menu beneath the word “Preset” and click “Save.”

Recognize the art of presentation is key to a sale in many industries.,
Know that it's always a good idea to have printed samples.,
Find a good portfolio book from a photography supply or art supply store.,
Pick only about 15 to 20 of your best pieces.,
Good luck and practice your presentation and observe people's body language and reaction to each piece.",How to Make a Graphic Design Portfolio," Many people nowadays still like to see a physical sample, and some don't. Extremely busy people usually make very quick assumptions based on a website. If they like what they see, they might stay longer and check out more samples. So yes, a website means you have web ability and it's just plain easy for anyone to see. Plus, you can always mail the link to people. In these growing digital times, a website is a must for any designer. Power point has its purposes, but a website does this anyway and works on any computer. I wouldn't want the embarrassment of handing them a file that won't work or load for some technical mac vs. PC issue or whatnot. Like this article said, a website is more professional.;
, The better the print, the more professional it looks. Like you had something printed on a press. Digital prints (like a high-end color laser printer) are now pretty clean and professional looking too. Inkjet samples on poor paper are not good choices. If you are just starting out, spend the money to have a print made at Kinko's.

, An 11x17 book is good because it's physically easy to manage and doesn't plop a giant unfolded beast onto someone's desk. There's no need to buy black boards and spray toxic adhesives to mount projects. I think boards are cumbersome anyway. A book with clear sleeves is good enough and allows you to easily slide your pieces into place or remove them.

, That's enough for anyone to assess your graphic abilities. Show range of style, paper choices, clients, and types of design (logos, brochures, packaging). For logos, you can always put all of them nicely spaced on a single 11x17 sheet for a sampling. For packaging, a professional photo of the 3D package will suffice.

, Remember, many people are not ""right brain"" and don't understand the process involved or for that matter even care. They just get a gut feeling that you can handle it or not. Don't explain graphic design. Do inquire about the employers marketing objectives and if you can handle it. Consider designing a custom sample of their business if you really want the job. This says you're motivated and willing to go the extra mile.

, Try to get a photo that's roughly the same resolution and size as the one on the valid ID.


Zoom in or out of the new photo so that the head will be about the same size as in the original photo.
You can also adjust the contrast and brightness to match the original photo. As long as the new pic isn't too bright or too dark, you're probably fine.

, Try to find a font that's close to the one on the current ID. (Courier, with slab serif, was used on a lot of older licenses.) Also, adjust the font size and spacing so that it matches as closely as possible.


Enter a full name, without abbreviations. The only instance in which you might use an abbreviation is for things like ""Albert Smith Jr."" or ""Thomas Jones III.""
Put in a realistic birth date. If you're using a particularly old ID as a template, you don't want to keep it so that it says the new person was born in 1951 but looks 20.
Match the hair and eye color fields to the photo. See below for a list of abbreviations.

, Be sure to print both the front and back.

,, Trim any overlapping edges.

, If you'd like to add an extra layer of authenticity to the ID, you can add a hologram. See the Making Your Own Hologram section below for more help, and be sure you do it before you laminate the ID.

, Trim the laminate so it's about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the edge of the paper.

Teslin paper
Butterfly laminate pouches
A pouch laminator
An encoder to encode the magnetic strip on the pouch (optional)

, You can search for templates by state or province. They'll help you make sure you're making a product that's as realistic as possible.


Search a Peer-2-Peer (p2p) network such as BitTorrent to find a template.

, By using Adobe Photoshop or Macromedia Fireworks - or a free program like GIMP - you should easily be able to edit the templates. (Adobe Photoshop is the most common photo-editing software program used today, but can be expensive to purchase; however, a free, full-featured trial version is available on Adobe's website.), Most standard IDs use the font 'Arial' that comes with Windows. If you prefer to use specialty fonts that do not come with Windows (such as a font for signatures), you can see how to download and install them by reading this article: How to Install Fonts on Your PC., Here are the standard three-letter listings for eye and hair color used in the United States:

Eye color:

BLK - Black
GRY - Gray
MAR - Maroon (usually used for albinism)
BLU - Blue
GR – Green
PNK - Pink
BRO – Brown
HZL - Hazel
MUL – Multicolor


Hair color:

BAL – Bald
BRO – Brown
SDY - Sandy
BLK - Black
GRY - Gray
WHI - White
BLN – Blonde
RED – Red



, Some are rarely used but others, like restriction code B, are quite common. Here are a list of some of the more popular codes in the US:

Restriction codes:

A - No restriction
B - Corrective lenses
C - Mechanical aids
D - Business only
G - Daylight only
H - Employer's vehicle only
J - Prosthetic aid
Q - No passengers
R - Motorcycles 500 cc and under
S - To and from school
T - To and from medical
U - All motorcycles except Class X
2 - Personal vehicles only


Endorsement codes:

M - Motorcycle endorsement for any motorcycle regardless of engine displacement.
P - Passenger vehicles designed to carry 16 or more persons, including the driver.
T - Double/triple trailers allowed.
Y - Farm endorsement (Class A).



, The signature on your ID might not get much attention, but the photo definitely will. Consider these guidelines:


If you take your own photo, try to do it against a blank background in bright or neutral lighting, and keep the frame focused around your face. You shouldn't be able to see your shoulders in the photo.
Use your passport photo. If you've taken a picture for a US passport, you can try using that for your fake ID. After scanning the passport photo into the computer, the person's face will need to be separated from the background so it flows seamlessly with your ID card template. #**Programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Macromedia Fireworks or GIMP, provide you with an image editing tool called ""Magic Wand"". This tool will allow you to click a color in the image and it will select all surrounding colors that are similar or the same. There will be a slider that will allow you to select the amount of variance from the color you select. The higher the variance, the more of the image that will be selected.

Once the background is nearly fully selected without containing any of the person's face, press 'Delete' on your keyboard to erase it. You can then magnify the image and use the eraser tool to clean up around the person's face. At this point, zoom out and copy the image. It can be pasted onto your ID card template. It will then flow seamlessly into your template design and you can choose any background color you want!



, The unusual-looking scrambled barcode on the back of most driver’s licenses is known as a PDF417 barcode. This barcode contains most of the information contained on the front of the license. By editing this readout, you can encode your information into this barcode. You can generate these barcodes by finding a free PDF417 generator online.

, If your license requires a magnetic stripe and you want it to be scannable, it can be encoded with an encoder. Generally these are very expensive and are difficult to find. Search online for discount suppliers if you like.


There are two types of magnetic stripes, HiCo and LoCo. HiCo and LoCo differ in that HiCo are much more difficult to demagnetize. The encoders for these typically were much more expensive than for LoCo. Most HiCo encoders encode LoCo stripes as well.
The best way to program the stripe is to decode a working driver’s license, edit the data, and then program it back onto the stripe. Encode the magnetic stripe after the card is finished.

, There are two types of synthetic paper that are nearly the same. Teslin and Artisyn paper are single layer, silica-filled, polyolefin printing substrate with unique microporous and temperature resistance features that make it the product of choice for laminated ID badges.


Teslin is more expensive than Artisyn and much less versatile.
If you want to use a desktop inkjet printer, you will achieve better results with Artisyn or Artisyn NanoExtreme synthetic paper. Printing on Teslin with an inkjet does not work well and tends to look grainy and smeared.
The Artisyn and Artisyn NanoExtreme papers are coated with chemicals to absorb the ink effectively. They are cheaper than Teslin, and work well with all types of printers including inkjet and laser printers. It also tends to produce better print-quality results.
Both types can be found from sources online. Arcadia also sells perforated sheets that punch out in the size of the ID cards.

, The preferred method is to use a pigmented-based inkjet printer like an Epson printer with DuraBrite ink. This tends to produce incredible results and works well with Teslin, even though it is not a laser printer.


If a pigmented ink printer is not available, a laser printer will give you a good result. Laser printers produce sharp and clear images, but the ink tends to look waxy.
Any dye-based inkjet printer will work fine. A dye-based inkjet printer is that standard color printer that most people have in their homes. Again, if you use dye-based inks, make sure to use Artisyn. You should print on the highest quality photo settings.

, Print on one sheet of paper, both front and back., If you are using microperforated Artisyn, you can skip this step. Otherwise, start by cutting out the ID from the paper. Tracing the dimensions of the ID using a butterfly pouch is generally helpful. A paper cutter or X-Acto knife is also helpful., You must use thermal laminating in order to bond the butterfly pouch to the synthetic paper. Once laminated, the card will harden and resemble a PVC card. You must use a thermal (heat) pouch laminator.


Avery, Arcadia EasyIDea, or GBC are common manufacturers.
If you can't afford a laminator then you can use a standard home iron. This is a little more tricky as you have to make sure the iron doesn't get so hot that it melts the laminate plastic, but is still hot enough to bond the laminate to your ID. Also be sure the iron does not have any water loaded into it, as this could damage the ink on the pre-laminated ID and the steam could warp the ID card. It is recommended, when using an iron, to cover the card with a towel or t-shirt, or paper bag, so that the plastic does not melt to the iron.

, Place the insert into the butterfly pouch. You must place the card into a carrier. Run the carrier through the laminator.

Immediately following lamination, it is helpful to place the card under something flat like a book so that it cools flat.

, Generally, it is acceptable to use a generic hologram. Very few people actually examine the hologram and read what it says on it. If you’re concerned about making something that looks truly authentic, there are other methods to replicate holograms.


The Shield and Key hologram is the most commonly used generic hologram and is a transparent rainbow hologram. This means that it looks transparent when looked at directly but when tilted to the sides the hologram lets off a rainbow spectrum. This type of hologram is pretty much impossible to duplicate using the Pearl-Ex method below.
Make your own hologram (optional). See the method below for making your own hologram.

, It is recommended that you sand the edges of the hologram with a very fine grit sandpaper. This removes the jagged edges of the synthetic paper.

To give the ID a more worn look, you can lightly sand the front and back of it.

Make your own binary hologram (optional).,
Make a stencil.,
Make a multicolored hologram.",How to Make a Fake ID3," The gold holograms on many ID cards are called binary holograms. These holograms can be easily reproduced using Pearl-Ex paint and Photo-EZ paper., This product is for making stencils. A stencil is basically the outline of a picture with the negative part missing.

Scan the hologram off your ID, then convert it to an all-black image.
Print the image on a transparency. A transparency is a transparent sheet of plastic meant for inkjet printers or lasers.
Take the transparency and tape it to the Photo-EZ.
Put it out in the sun and all the areas of the material not covered by the black negative of the holo will cure. When washed, the part covered by the negative washes away, leaving you with your stencil. You will want to order the high resolution material.
Paint the hologram. As for the painting material, the two main ones are Interference Gold (Fine) made by Golden Acrylics and Perl-Ex Duotone. The latter of the materials work best because it reflects two colors of the spectrum.
Perl-Ex comes as a powder and preparation is needed.
These paints are transparent when viewed from straight on. When viewed from different angles you see different colors depending on the particular colors of the paint.
Perl-Ex comes in Duo Red-Blue, Duo Blue-Green, and Duo Green-Yellow.
You have to buy a Transparent Base made for paints to prepare the Perl-Ex. A good one is Speedball Transparent Base. You mix in a 1:50 ratio: one part per-50 parts base. If you are using Golden acrylics then you use a 5:1 ratio: five parts paint to one part base.
When applying the paint in the stencil, you should use, if possible, one of those brushes made for screen printing. It looks like a pencil but has a flexible tip. A sponge can be used but extra care needs to be taken when applying. You want to apply a very thin amount, and practice will be needed to get it right.

, On a lot of the new IDs there is a multicolored hologram that reflects the full spectrum (like a rainbow). This is especially true of most of the Canadian IDs.

Pick the two most dominant colors and buy the matching Perl-Ex colors. This will be good enough to reproduce the holo.
The holo can be put directly on the finished ID or before lamination on the inside of the pouch. If you choice is the inside, then remember to put it in the reverse.

Draw the grid.,
Decide your labels.,
Be careful of spacing.",How to Make a Graph1," You will first need a grid on which to draw your graph. You can either purchase grid paper or you can draw it yourself using a ruler. Make sure that the lines are straight and evenly spaced. They should be a distance apart as is appropriate for the graph you intend to produce.


You can have an L-shaped graph or a t-shaped graph. It will depend on whether or not you need to show negative values. The L or t base will be your main axis, or the baseline for your values. The horizontal line is called the x-axis and the vertical line is called the y-axis.;
, You will need to determine what will go on the x and y axes. This will depend on the type of data you are trying to show. The two should be correlated and accurately present the data you are trying to show. Assign the label to the axes and then label the intervals of change in evenly spaced increments along the axes.


One common example would be for the x-axis to represent time and the y-axis to represent a value that changes over time.

, You will want to carefully determine the increments by looking closely at the data you need to represent. Be sure that you have enough space to clearly show all of your data. Both axes should go beyond the last datapoint you need to show.

"
"
Make a bar graph.,
Make a line graph.,
Make a pie chart.",How to Make a Graph2," A bar graph, usually used to show how much of one thing exists compared to another, is easy to create and looks like a series of vertical or horizontal rectangles of different lengths. The y-axis will indicate how much of something there is and the x-axis will represent what you are measuring (if you want your rectangles to be vertical). If you would like them to be horizontal, switch which type of data goes on which axis.


A histogram is a special bar graph designed to show the distribution of data. On this type of bar graph, both axes will have number values, since numbers will be the value being measured.

, This type of graph shows data as points and connects those points with a line. It is useful for showing how a particular variable has changed over time, like weight, height, salary, or a company’s GDP for example.


An area graph is a special kind of line graph, which shows multiple sets of these changes on the same graph so as to make them easy to compare. The area below each line will be filled in a different color. This allows people to easily see which data sets were more negative or positive. An example of the type of data used on such a chart is showing the change over time in average house prices in three separate neighborhoods.

, This is a circle graph which is comprised of a circle, broken up into individually colored sections which represent data. These sections or slices are sized relative to the amount of data they represent. This type of chart is useful for showing how the different parts of a whole compare to each other. It is difficult to draw accurately by hand, however, since you need to be able to calculate the angles necessary to represent percentages of a whole. Drawing one will require a protractor, though there are many computer programs and websites which will make a chart for you if you enter the data. For example, you can use a pie chart to show relatively how many members of a class are of a particular ethnicity or what types of colleges or work forces students from a particular high school went on to after graduating.

Enter the column formulas

In cell B5, enter 25680.,
From here on, we will be following the little note in cell H1: ""0,P to P,P then P,P to P,0, then P,0 to 0,0, then 0,0 to 0,P."",
Create the Chart

Select cell range E5:F1445 and either do Chart Wizard Smoothed Line Graph or select the Charts item from the Ribbon (if you can't find Charts on the Ribbon go to Excel Preferences Sharing and Privacy Ribbon and have everything turned on or checked except ""Hide group titles"").,
Make use of helper articles when proceeding through this tutorial:

See the article How to Create a Spirallic Spin Particle Path or Necklace Form or Spherical Border for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation.",How to Make a Square of Spherical Helixes," Depending on which version of Excel you're using, when I get to the steps concerning creating the new chart, you'll either use Chart Wizard and a Chart page will be created for you, or you will cut and paste the chart from the Data sheet.
,, Make the cell borders bold and individual in the color of your choice. Do Insert Name Create in Top Row. After the p, to its right in cell H1, aligned left, make the note, ""0,P to P,P then P,P to P,0, then P,0 to 0,0, then 0,0 to 0,P."" That forms a square when we Fill in series.,, Select cell range A4:H4 and Align Center and Underline text., In column B, select cell range B6:B1445. With cell B6 as the active hi-lighted cell, input the formula, without quotes, ""=B5"" and then do Edit Fill Down. The constant 25680 should appear now in the range from B5 to B1445, as the formula copied the value each time from the cell just above itself.
Select cell A5 and Insert Name Define ""Top"" for cell $A$5. Input the following formula without quotes into cell A5: ""=B5*12*PI()"". The value 968,113 should appear. Do Format Cell Number Custom without the brackets and widen the column if need be.
Select cell range A6:A1445 and with cell A6 as the hi-lighted active cell, input the formula, ""=(A5+(-top*2)/(AdjRows))"" and do Edit Fill Down. The value -968,113.19 should appear in cell A1444 and the value -969,458.73 should appear in cell A1445. By multiplying the top times 2, we took care of both the negative as well as the positive values while decrementing each time with the negative sign.
Select cell range C5:C1445 and with C5 as the hi-lighted active cell, enter the formula, ""=COS((ROW()-5)*PI()/180*Factor)"". Do Edit Fill Down. We multiply by pi/180 to convert to degrees from pi radians. The value in (ROW()-5) relative to C5 is 0; therefore, we are taking the cosine of 0. We are adjusting this by a Factor of -.25 having to do with the 25 spheres we will plot within the given graph space -- it makes the spheres a tiny bit rounder. You may try a Factor of 1 and see what you think.
Select cell range D5:D1445 and with D5 as the hi-lighted active cell, enter the formula, ""=SIN((ROW()-5)*PI()/180*Factor)"". Do Edit Fill Down. The value 1.0000 should appear in cell C1445 and the value 0.0000 should appear in cell D1445 after selecting range C5:H1445 and Cell Format Number for 4 decimal places.
Select cell range E5:E1445 and with E5 the hi-lighted active cell, enter the formula ""=((SIN(A5/(B5*2))*GMLL*COS(A5)*GMLL*(COS(A5/(B5*2)))*GMLL)+G5)^(N)"". Do Edit Fill Down. We will not be using Multer1 or Multer2 -- they are used for warping and other effects inside or outside this formula. Basically, this is the formula for a spherical helix in a ring defined by adding C5 instead of G5, but by adding G5 we're creating a square instead. ""GMLL"" stands for ""Golden Mean Long Leg"" and it has a tendency to keep things proportionate no matter how much they're scaled up or down in size, so each term is multiplied by this factor. Notice that for the x values, the basic scheme is SIN*COS*COS. We are raising to the power of N, currently set to 1, which you may play with and note the interesting effects of the N=.5 or N=2 or N=3 on the space inside of 1^2 in the graph space. It would seem that what they taught us about 1 raised to any power equaling 1 is not true, when in fact it is, but it sure doesn't seem that way here.
Select cell range F5:F1445 and with F5 the hi-lighted active cell, enter the formula ""=((SIN(A5/(B5*2))*GMLL*SIN(A5)*GMLL*(COS(A5/(B5*2)))*GMLL)+H5)^(N)"", then do Edit Fill Down. This would form a ring of spheres if we added D5 instead of H5 near the end of the formula because columns C and D, being the cosine and sine, form a circle. That option might necessitate a Factor of .125 and of course new Edit Fill Downs for the formulas in columns E and F. Notice that for the y values, the basic scheme is SIN*SIN*COS. The final COS element is the Z or 3rd dimension for both E and F. The graph is a fractal and is neither truly 2-dimensional nor 3-dimensional per the actual staining medium on the paper. You may think of it like an architectural drawing where the height dimension has been taken down to nearly zero, but not quite zero.

, There are 4 sides of the square to do in about 1440 cells, so that's 360 cells per side. Do one side at a time: first the x's, then the y's.

Enter 0 into cell C5. Select cell range C6:C365 and with cell G6 as the hi-lited active cell, enter the formula ""=p/360+G5"". Do Edit Fill Down. Select cell range H5:H365 and with cell H5 the hi-lighted active cell, enter the formula ""=p"" and Edit Fill Down. This completes the first part of the graph or the first side, from ""0,P to P,P"". Select cell range G5:H365 and Format Cell Border Black Bold Outline.
Select cell range G366:G725 and with cell G366 as the hi-lighted active cell, enter the formula, ""=p"". Do Edit Fill Down. Select cell range H366:H725 and with cell H366 as the hi-lighted active cell, enter the formula, ""=-p/360+H365"" -- the minus sign is very important. Do Edit Fill Down. Select cell range G366:H725 and Format Cell Border Red Bold Outline. This completes the second side, from ""P,P to P,0,"".
Select cell range G726:G1085 and with cell G726 as the hi-lighted active cell, enter the formula ""=-p/360+G725"" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell range H726:H1085 and with cell H726 as the active hi-lighted cell, enter the formula, ""=0"". Do Edit Fill Down. This completes the third side of the square, from ""P,0 to 0,0"". Select cell range G726:H1085 and Format Cell Fill Canary Yellow and Border Bold Dark Blue.
Select cell range G1086:G1455 and with cell G1086 active, enter ""=0"" and Edit Fill Down. Select cell range H1086:H1455 and with cell H1086 hi-lited and active, enter the formula ""=p/360+H1085"" and do Edit Fill Down. The last fourth leg or side of the square is done, ""0,0 to 0,P."" Phew! You did it! See how it turned out. It should look something like the following chart:







, Go to All at the far left, scroll down until you come to Scatter and then select Smoothed Line Scatter. A small graph will appear on your Data worksheet. Cut and Paste or Copy and Paste it to the Chart worksheet you created at the beginning of the steps. Grab the lower right corner when the double-headed resizing arrow appears and pull the chart open and larger down and to the right. The default line thickness is too thick, so double-click on the series plot (the graph itself), select Line, Weights and Arrows, and set Weight to 1 point. Your taste may vary.
Creating a Clear Graph: 1) Click on Chart Layout, Axis, and set No Vertical Axis and No Horizontal Axis; 2) Click on Gridlines and set No Horizontal Grid lines; 3) Click on Legend and select No Legend; 4) Resize the graph so it is again approximately square unless you plan to use it for an invitation or something with long horizontal phrases or sentences; 5) Double-click just inside the outermost chart border and set Fill to Color: No Fill; 6) Set Line to No Line; 7) Double click within the graph and set Line and Fill to No Line and No Fill; 8) Go to Excel Preferences and select View -- un-checkmark Show Gridlines. Lastly, double-click directly on the graph series line and set Line Color as you please and Transparency to say 25% if you'd like it to show through to another design underneath it in your final project.
Placing the graph within a Picture Format: 1) Use the worksheet tabs Plus Button and create a new worksheet and name it ""Picture""; 2) Select the Chart worksheet with your graph on it and, holding down the Shift or Option Key, Edit Copy Picture or Copy, and with the same key depressed, select the Picture worksheet, Edit Paste Picture; 3) In the Ribbon, click on Format Picture (or Smart Art and Layout until Format Picture comes up); 4) In the middle you will see some pictures in frames with an arrow indicating more -- move underneath the box and a down pointing arrow will appear -- click on the arrow; 5) You should see 28 models to choose from -- try the one in the first row, 4th down; 5) Play around with shadow, glow, Material Depth and Bevel Style, etc, etc! Have fun!!  Here's an idea of some effects that can add a real 3D feel to your graphic, though now I wish my line weren't quite so thin!

Remove the background from your photo.,
Drag the newly-cut image of yourself onto the celebrity picture.

,
Make adjustments.,
Make sure you have a story ready.",How to Make a Fake Picture With Famous People to Impress Your Friends and Family1," Do an image search for the celebrity (or celebrities) you want to be with in the photo.


Look for a high-resolution image. You can always go down in resolution (that is, save a high-res image as low-res), but it's hard to go up.
Images taken against a solid colored background will work a lot better than a dynamic or moving background.
When you find one you like, right-click and save it to your computer.
For maximum believability, choose a seldom-seen photo of the celebrity. A casual snapshot might be better than a professional photo that's been plastered all over the Internet.
;
, Once you have the celebrity photo you want, find (or take) a picture of yourself to put into it.


If you can, try to find an image that will blend well with your celebrity picture. For example, if there is a spotlight coming from the right on your celebrity image, choose a photo of yourself where there is a strong light source on the right. Also, pay attention to contrast - if the celebrity image is high-contrast, make sure the photo of you matches.


, Photoshop is popular but you can also find free image editing programs online such as Gimp. Gimp has all of the same popular features found in Photoshop and it doesn't cost a dime.

, Use the Magic Brush or Magnetic Lasso Tool to cut yourself out of your picture. use a remove brush to ""erase"" the background. You want the background to become a light white and gray checked background, this means that you are removing any background which will make it lay on top of the second photo better.

,, No matter how closely you tried to match the celebrity image, you'll probably need to make a few adjustments to the final product to make it look more realistic. Here are some things you could try:


Use the eraser tool to get rid of extraneous pieces of background that came along with the image of yourself.
You may also need to adjust the lighting or contrast of the photo.
Make sure you look proportionately sized next to the celebrity (that is, not too short or too tall). You might need to shrink or enlarge the image of yourself. If this is not an option, try placing yourself in the foreground (if you're too big) or the background (if you're too small) of the image.
Blend the edges. Drag the blur tool around the image of yourself. This will help your edges fade into the photo, making it look more realistic.


, People will have questions about the picture. Come up with an amusing anecdote or believable story about how the photo came into existence. People will want to know what was in the gift.

Locate a cardboard cut-out of the celebrity, or visit a celebrity wax museum.,
Take a photo of yourself next to the wax figure or cut-out.,
Edit the photo.",How to Make a Fake Picture With Famous People to Impress Your Friends and Family2," Here's how to find what you're looking for:


Movie theaters, radio stations, and promotional agencies will often have cardboard cut-outs of celebrities on hand, especially if the one you're after has recently starred in a movie. Ask around and see what they have in storage.
You can order cardboard celebrity cut-outs online. This might be a good option if you're looking for a celebrity who is older, more obscure, or hasn't recently starred in a big movie. Be ready to pay for the product, though.
Visit a wax museum that features celebrity figures. Madam Tussauds is a popular international wax museum chain, located in many large cities. There's also the Movieland Wax Museum and the Hollywood Wax Museum, both located near Los Angeles, California. Be prepared to pay an admission fee to get into the museum.

, Try to pose in a way that looks as natural as possible, or mimics how the celebrity is posed (there are many funny photos like that, and it looks more realistic)

, If you want to make the photo look even more realistic, open it in a photo-editing program. (Even cheap or free programs, such as iPhoto or Picasa, will work for this.) Here are some ways to doctor the photo:


Get rid of any red-eye. If you have red-eye and the celebrity doesn't, that's a dead giveaway.
Make the photo blurrier, or lower-resolution. This will help obscure the differences in the way the light hits the fake celebrity and the way it hits you.
Try using black and white or sepia toning. As with making the photo lower resolution, this will help hide subtle differences in color or shading.

Click in the plot area and do Chart Add Data and in response to the query dialog box, respond with B6:C2886 from the Data worksheet.

Use Shift+Option to create another one like it atop the other lower branch of the cactus, then create two smaller versions at the tips of the taller cactus ""fingers.""
You can observe what was done and use your own imagination to make your own cactus flowers. Inner yellow line weight of yellow 10 was used, with a red and then orange glow on left and right respectively. On the top ones, soft edges were used a little bit, with left green and right yellow glow to left white and right blue inner 10 pt weight line.
For the Plot Area Fill, use the Color Wheel and select Blue at the very outside center then on the Lightness-Darkness (Value) Bar, darken to a dark blue(-purple?) at about 60% of the way down the bar towards black. Here is a picture of the Color Wheel:
I then used Grabber app to get a picture of the entirety but another way to go is to select on the main cactus and hold down the shift key and use Format Arrange and GROUP the various data objects in the chart and then they will all copy under a shift+copy = Copy Picture and shift + Paste = Paste Picture. Then you can use Format Picture and Picture Styles to get the coaster effect, plus add beveling under beveling effects (at 16 width and height as I recall).

,, You can change the color of the circle by clicking on it with the Selection Tool, and choosing the Fill color in the Color palette (Window – Color), and Stroke color to None. It will be the Matryoshka’s headscarf.

, Make a second circle, smaller than the first with the Free Transform Tool and holding Shift. It will be our Matryoshka’s face.

, When you are drawing overlapping shapes in Flash on the same layer and with same color, Flash will convert these shapes in one. To pick the color from the headscarf, use the Eyedropper tool.

, You can still change the face or headscarf shape separately, because we draw them on separate layers.

, Create the new layer. Choose the Brush tool and change the size if you need. With the Zoom Tool you can zoom on the face. Start to paint the eyes and hair, small mouth and two dots for the nose. You can fill the lips and eyes with the color using the Paint Bucket tool. When you are ready, and want to see the rest of the stage, you can scale your Workspace back.

,, To select shapes on the stage, use the Selection Tool and hold and drag around the shapes, or select each shape holding Shift key. You also can select a layer, and it will select all the shapes on that layer.

, Then, we need to select these shapes and copy and paste them on the same layer.

, If you want to select particular layers or shapes not touching rest of the picture, just lock the layers that you don’t want to use.

, You will see that shape of the sarafan will be on top, it is because our layer is on top of the other layers. Simply drag the layer down to the desired position.

, Create the new layer, and draw one or two flowers with the Brush Tool. When using the Free Transform Tool, change and copy the flowers. Keep your flowers on one layer and move the layer down and on top the sarafan layer. We finished with drawing part.

, For example, I added some details to headscarf. To prepare the Matryoshka for animation we will change the shapes to movie clips. I will show you how to do that and how to animate Matryoshka in next tutorial.

Obtain a suitable digital photo editing program, or use an online site for editing.,
Start with free software.,
Pay for software.",How to Edit a Photo Like a Pro1," You have a near endless list of options when it comes to your photo editing software. If you’re serious about being a professional photo editor, then you should look into the Adobe Creative Suite which offers several programs like Photoshop, Elements, and Lightroom. These programs work in tandem and offer the largest toolset for photo editing. However, you can find plenty of less expensive or free alternatives.


Before you spend a lot of money, download a free program or use a trial version of a paid software to see if you like it and to get the hang of basic photo editing.
Editing a photo to look like it was done by a professional doesn’t always involve fancy software as the basic elements are the same. Adjusting white balance, fixing color, reducing noise, and playing with levels are techniques that can greatly enhance your photo and can be done on most photo editing software.;
, If you’re new to photo editing, or just need an application to touch up the photos you’ve taken, don’t jump right into paying for expensive software. There are plenty of free options that will still give you plenty of tools to edit and touch up your photos like a pro.


Picasa is a quick and easy to navigate photo organizing tool that also comes with plenty of non-destructive editing features. Picasa is created by Google, so you can easily save and share your edits. The non-destructive editing means that you can add or undo edits easily, and your original photo is never changed.Mac users can try Apple Photos. Your photos and edits can sync with iCloud, and there are plenty of options to edit your photos in terms of color, noise, retouching, temperature, and more.Fotor offers a wide array of tools and effects to turn your photo into a professional grade work of art. Fotor will also let you import raw files and even add layers, like Photoshop.
On1 Perfect Effects is like a free version of Adobe’s software. With over 150 one-click photo effects, brush tool, and quick mask tools, and more, On1 Effects allows you to manipulate your photos extensively.
GIMP is an open source photo editor. It stands for GNU Image Manipulation Program. GIMP offers a lot of the same features that a paid software like Photoshop would offer such as painting tools, color correction, cloning, selection and enhancement., If you are serious about editing photos, and may even make a career out of editing, consider paying for software. Paid software typically gives you more tools to use, has better support, and allows you to edit your photos more in depth than a free editor. The Adobe Creative Suite is the most popular software for creating, editing, and illustrating all kinds of digital art from photos to movies. However, other, less expensive options exist that give you plenty of tools to edit your photos like a pro.Photoshop is typically the software used by professionals as it allows you to manipulate one or many photos in almost any way you can imagine. However, the learning curve can be steep, and it is expensive.
Adobe Lightroom is an alternative to Photoshop that also works alongside Photoshop. Lightroom is a bit easier to use and allows you to backtrack on your edits much easier than Photoshop.
Phase One Capture One Pro is an alternative to Lightroom that is less expensive. Like Lightroom, PhaseOne allows you to upload your photos into a library and make non-destructive edits easily without modifying your original image."

Create new layers.,
Adjust your white balance.,
Edit your photo’s color.,
Reduce the noise in your photo.,
Enhance your photo by adjusting levels.",How to Edit a Photo Like a Pro2," If you have a software that can create new layers, it’s always a good idea to create a new layer for each type of edit. A new layer will allow you to make edits and changes without disrupting the original layer. This way, if you mess up, you can go back without having to start over.


Not all programs let you create new layers. However, these programs usually offer a way to undo the effect easily so that you can backtrack a step or two without starting over.

, Getting the right white balance can be one of the best improvements you can make to a photo. Sometimes, you might not even have to do much else if you adjust your white balance correctly, especially on your camera when taking the photo. Start by adjusting the temperature of your photo, then adjust the tint for smaller corrections.


If your photo is too cold, showing more blues than you would like, bring the temperature up to counterbalance those blues with more red tones. If your photo is too warm, bring the temperature down.
The tint slider controls your magenta-green shift. If you need to cool your photo, bring the slider higher into the magenta range. If your photo needs to be warmer, lower your tint to the green spectrum.

, Certain colors pair well together, others do not. There are several types of color, but a basic understanding of how these types work together can help you immensely in the editing room. In the real world your primary colors are red, yellow, and blue. You mix these colors together to get other colors. However, on a computer, we deal with red, green, and blue (RGB) as primary colors.Start with a curves layer. Your curves will adjust your color by making your photo warmer or cooler. There’s no set answer to playing with color as each photo will require something different. Using a midpoint grey eyedropper tool, you can click on an area of your photo where the color seems off. The tool will change the color balance of that color or area so that balances with the rest of your photo.
Adjust your light and color with a color overlay channel. Take a single color channel, red, green, or blue, and create a new layer with that channel by copying it over your original photo. Then, adjust the opacity of that layer to find a nice contrast.

, Sometimes you’ll notice that your photo has a lot of grainy colored dots. This is known as noise. It’s easiest to adjust and lower the noise before you make most other adjustments, other than playing with white balance and color. One of the most effective ways to reduce noise in your photo is to sharpen the image. However, too much sharpening can bring back more noise.


Certain photo editing software like Adobe Lightroom provides a “Detail” panel that provides options for both sharpening and noise reduction. These two tools work together because reducing too much noise alone can make your photo blurry and you have to sharpen it. On the flipside, too much sharpening can cause more noise.If you have a noise reduction option, start with that and increase the luminance level. Adjust the slider and pay attention to how far you can go before the photo gets too soft or blurry., If your photo looks like it was shot with an old camera or has a lot of flash, you can adjust the levels of the photo to make it look much more polished. Adjusting levels will counteract the exposure from the camera. Whether your image is underexposed and too dark, or overexposed and too light.


The ability to adjust your photo’s levels isn’t the same on every program. On some programs like Apple’s Photos app, you can’t adjust levels the same way you can in Photoshop, but you do have eight options for adjusting different aspects of your photo. Level adjustment essentially gives you control over brightness in three levels: shadows, midtones, and highlights.When adjusting a photo’s levels in any program for clarity, the goal is to create the widest tonal range allowing the brightest pixels in your photo to be pure white, and the darkest pixels to be pur black.Adjusting your levels allows you to edit your photo so that the darkest pixels convert to black and the lightest pixels convert to white. This enhances the contrast to your photo. If you have the option to adjust the midpoint, the grey area, you want to lighten or darken your midpoints based on the color of the focal point of your photo. For example, if you are adjusting a photo of someone’s face, you may want to make the midpoint lighter if your subject’s skin tone is lighter. If your subject has a darker skin tone, you want to make the midpoint darker.

Adjust hue and saturation.,
Use a radial blur.,
Create smooth skin and remove blemishes.,
Use Patch and Fade Tools to fix smaller adjustments.",How to Edit a Photo Like a Pro3," If you have a dominant color in your photograph that you really want to stand out, adjust the levels of hue and saturation. For example, to make your greens pop more, if you have a photo that takes place outside, increase the hue to add a bit of blue to make your greens pop out more and turn your saturation up. This will add a more vibrant color to your green. Because green and blue are primary and complementary colors, adding a hue of blue to your green will enhance the vibrancy of the green, making it richer. By saturating the hue adjustment you bleed the colors together more creating a vibrant blend.
To make any photo pop more, adjust the hue and saturation of the most dominant color in your photo.

, A lot of professionally edited photos will employ a radial blur which keeps the focal point in your photo in focus while gently blurring out everything outside of the radius.The radial blur is great for photos that focus on a person’s face, because it will keep the face in crystal clear focus and blur everything around it gently, creating a nice effect and professional looking photo.

, A major factor in editing photos like a professional is editing your subject’s face to remove bumps and blemishes, creating beautiful smooth skin. There are a number of ways to do this on most programs, and not every program allows for comprehensive editing.


In applications like Picasa or Apple Photos, you can use the Retouch Tool. Select a radius size for your brush that is small enough so that you don’t retouch areas that don’t need it. On software like these, retouching essentially works by blurring and blending the pixels together to make the area look smooth.
In more advanced software like Photoshop, you can do more intensive retouching. Use a Quick Selection Tool to select the area of skin that you want to edit. Create a new layer with a Layer Mask so that you don’t affect your original layer in case you mess up. Then go to your Filter option > Blur > Surface Blur. This will smooth out the selected area much like the retouch tool works on other programs.Then, use a Spot Healing Brush Tool and click on your small selections of blemishes that still show up. The spot healing brush will perform a similar task as the blur, but instead of applying the effect to a larger area, you can pinpoint it to smaller, more specific areas.

, The Patch and Fade Tools are great for fixing larger areas like bags under the eyes. The Patch Tool works by selecting one area and then another. The first area gets patched to look like the second area.The Patch Tool is great for skin because instead of just blurring an area of skin to smooth it out, it makes a patch that’s taken from another area.
To smooth out any weird or uneven edges that you may get from the patch tool, use a Fade Tool that fades a patched selection and blends the area.
Try to match the skin texture on an area you are working on. For example if you are patching an area around the nose, don’t draw a patch from the forehead as those areas might be too dissimilar, especially in certain lighting.

Recognize the standard form of a linear function.,
Find at least two points.,
Plot the points.,
Connect the points.",How to Do Linear Functions1," Linear functions are typically written in the form f(x) = ax + b. The a represents the gradient of the line, which gives the rate of change of the dependent variable. This is also known as the “slope.” The b represents the y-axis intercept. It is the value of the dependent variable y or, in other words, f(x) when x = 0.


Say, for example, that you have a function f(x) = x + 5. This is a linear function in standard form.





;
, You know your graph will be a straight line because you have a linear function; therefore, you really need only two points. In general, though, you should find three points instead, to check for accuracy.


In the example above, you might choose to use -1, 0, and 1 for your x values. Solve as shown.







, Plot your points on the coordinate system, using the values you got from solving your three equations.


In the example above, your graph would look like this.







, For any two points, there is only one way to connect them with a straight line. Use a ruler to join them with a straight line. Note that if you graph three points, and they don’t all lie on the same line, then you’ve made a mistake somewhere. Go back and calculate again.


In the example above, your graph would look like this.

Rearrange the function to make y the subject.,
Find at least two points.,
Plot the points.,
Connect the points.",How to Do Linear Functions2," If you have a linear function that’s not in the standard form, you’ll need to rewrite it before you can make a graph.


Say you have the function 6x – 2y = 4. Move everything but y to the left, as follows.






Then divide both sides by -2.
You now have the standard form of a linear function: y = 3x – 2.

Go to ""Panels"" and then ""Mixer"" to see the Cubase mixer.,
Use the buttons above the volume faders on the mixer to bring up the effects board.",How to Use Cubase,";
, The layout consists of 4 main elements.


Audio tracks: these are the tracks that show at the top of your track lists. They are stereo or mono channels that represent analog audio data such as sound clips, riffs and loops. Cubase allows you to add pre-recorded audio tracks or record your own audio tracks through a microphone or input device.
Midi tracks: you can see the midi tracks under your audio tracks in the tracks list. Midi tracks are different from audio tracks because they are digitally transcribed using virtual instruments such as a virtual keyboard or drum machine. Some instruments come with a midi-out option or you can use midi software if you want to convert audio tracks to midi tracks. Although the quality of midi tracks is usually poorer that audio tracks because they have been digitized, midi tracks do offer more flexibility for musicians to edit placements of music notes even after the track has been created.
Locators: the right and left locators are near the top of your screen. They are like a beat counter that lets you set the beat for your song (ranging from 4 to 8 bars). You can loop your beat after it has been created between the left and right locators. Use your right mouse button to set the right locator and similarly set the left locator using your left mouse button.
Transport bar: the transport bar is where all the main controls are located. Here you can use buttons to play, stop or record your audios. You can also increase or decrease the speed of your audio using the transport bar.

, Once the audio file has been imported, you will be able to see the wave data for the imported segment. You can right-click on the audio segment to see the tool menu that allows you to edit the audio. Different tools in the tools menu allow you to erase, crop or move parts of the audio segment. You can also vary the volume to create fade-in and fade-out effects using the tools.

, Double-click within the midi segment to bring up the midi sequencing window. Here you can choose from a list of midi instruments and position notes that will play on your computer once you run the midi sequence.

Therefore, between the formula in C6 and the one in D6, the {x,y} coordinates of the first cell would be {1,0} if nothing else were affecting them. It proceeds counterclockwise from there. so that is how to read the chart, from 0 degrees counter clockwise back to 360 degrees. Even though there are basically 2880 rows being charted, and 2880/360 = 8, Factor1 = 1/8th at .125, so a level of detail is achieved while keeping everything normalized for a single cycle in the typical case.

Edit Go To cell range F7:G1447 and, using either the Chart Wizard or the Ribbon, select Charts, All/Other, Scatter-Smoothed Line Scatter. A chart will appear atop the data unless using Chart Wizard, in which case a new Chart sheet will appear.
Assuming the former case, Copy or Cut the chart from atop the data and paste it to the Chart worksheet, then expand it by hovering over the lower right corner until the cursor becomes a double-headed arrow and clicking to drag the Chart Area until about a 6"" wide by 4"" tall rectangle is formed.
Using Chart Layout, select the Horizontal Axis and set Minimum to 2.72, Maximum to 3.5, Major unit to 1.5. Minor unit to 1.5 and Vertical Axis crosses at 2.72, in Base 10, OK.
Using Chart Layout, select the Vertical Axis and set Minimum to -.85, Maximum to .07 Major unit to 1.5. Minor unit to .3 and Vertical Axis crosses at 0.0, in Base 10, OK. There is a slight skew to the chart but it's pretty good as spheres go. It's done according to Min Max row formulas at the bottom of columns F and G kept there for just such an occasion.
The axes may now be safely eliminated (unless it's felt a better job can be done to eliminate the slight skew), as well as any grid lines and legend. A printer is not hooked up to this computer and the older computer cannot read the newer Excel files, so, for now, it's difficult to check with a compass and see if my eyes are telling me it's as nearly a circle as I think. It looks just slightly skewed to the lower left to me but it's such a small discrepancy, I can live with it.

Use the hi-pass and low-pass filter.,
Determine frequency.,
Determine the bandwidth.,
Cut or boost the band.",How to Use a Parametric Equalizer1,"


On many software programs, there is a high-pass and a low-pass function. The high-pass button will generally cut any frequencies below 100Hz and sometimes 80Hz.
The low-pass button will generally cut any frequencies above around 10kHz. Many live mixing boards have a high-pass button which serves the same purpose as the software version.
These buttons allow the user to cut out any unwanted high and low harmonics that can be troublesome in the mix.;
, Software programs make it possible for the user to cut or boost 3 to 7 frequencies simultaneously. These are called bands. Start by with just 1 band at a time. Turn on the bandwidth by clicking on the frequency spectrum screen.

,


The bandwidth is the frequency range in which the band will boost or cut. The bandwidth is also referred to as the ""Q"". The higher the Q the skinnier the bandwidth.
The Q can be set to as little as 1/30 of an octave up to 3 octaves. By having a wider Q you can get more of basic tone shaping out of the band.
By making the Q more narrow you can cut frequencies that may be an issue, such as an unpleasant sound or overtone.
Widen or narrow the Q by lowering or raising the number, respectively.

, Once you have set your frequency and Q width you can cut or boost the bandwidth. Use the gain function on the parametric and cut the band by lowering the gain below zero or boost the gain by raising the gain above zero. Make very minimal adjustments until the desired sound is achieved.

Connect the audio equipment to the mixer's inputs.,
Connect the recording or monitoring equipment to the mixer outputs.,
Turn on the channel inputs that will be used to make the sound mix.,
Turn on phantom power for the channel if the item connected to it requires it.,
Adjust the volume for each input as required.,
Adjust the treble, bass and mid-range bands of each channel with the equalizer controls.,
Route those channels needing special effects to an auxiliary channel.,
Pan each channel in the master mix as required.",How to Use a Mixer," Mixers are identified by the number of inputs, or audio channels, they provide. A 16-channel mixer offers 16 audio inputs, while a 4-channel mixing console has only 4 inputs. Microphones and other monaural (1-channel) instruments and devices such as audio interfaces connect to a single input, while stereo devices connect to 2 inputs, 1 for the left channel and another for the right.

Some mixers may have separate inputs for the microphones and for CD and tape players, which are called line inputs. These mixers feature switches to toggle between mike and line inputs.



 


Each type of musical instrument should be assigned its own input. While 2 trumpets can be recorded from a single microphone input in a pinch, a trumpet and a violin should be recorded on separate audio inputs so their sounds can be properly balanced. Some instruments, such as drum sets, may need separate microphone inputs for each component.






If your mixer has subgroup channels, you can group the microphones assigned to a complex instrument such as a drum set into 1 or 2 subgroups, mix them separately, then control the drum mix in the overall volume using only 1 or 2 sliders.






Generally, the more inputs the sound mixer has, the larger it is. Portable or wearable mixers used in the field by videographers may allow only 2 or 4 inputs, while 32- and 48-channel mixers are larger consoles that need to be transported from place to place in a vehicle or kept in a recording studio.





;
, Mixer output can be monitored on the VU meters, as well as by plugging in a pair of headphones to an auxiliary output jack.


Some mixers have outputs for a dedicated feed to a monitor separate from the master output, as well as output channels for the sound engineer to communicate with the recording booth or stage during the recording or performance.

, Each channel has its own on/off switch.

, Phantom power is direct electric current supplied by the mixing board to instruments or microphones connected to it. Phantom power is usually required by microphones (except ribbon microphones), amplifiers and some video cameras and so is available on microphone inputs.

, This can done with a knob called a potentiometer (""pot"" for short), although the controller may also take the form of a switch, pad or slider known as a fader. Each input source needs its own level for the overall mix to sound the best it can.


Individual channels can be turned on and off temporarily during the recording session with a mute switch so that the master mix can be analyzed without them. A solo switch can also be used to mute all other channels except a particular channel so that channel can be heard by itself.

, This helps improve the sound quality in each sound range. The quality of its equalizers often determines the quality of the sound mixer.


Mixers may have both equalizer controls for each separate channel as well as a global equalizer that affects the entire sound mix.

, Also known as ""aux"" channels, auxiliary channels create a copy of the original channel signal. Routing is done with a control called a ""send.""

, This is done with a panoramic potentiometer, known as either a ""pan pot"" or ""pan knob."" Turning the knob left moves the signal to the left of the stereo field, while turning it to the right moves the signal to the right.


For mixers with multiple outputs, the pan knob works in tandem with routing buttons. Each routing button enables a pair of outputs. If the pan knob is turned to the left, the signal goes to the left enabled output bus; to the right, it goes to the right output bus; and to the center, it goes out both outputs.

Read Things You'll Need;
,
Remove all batteries from the laser.

,
Connect a clip lead to the inside of the laser pointer where the battery touched.,
Connect the 1,000 ohm side of the transformer between the battery and the laser.,
Connect the earphone jack to the 8 ohm side of the transformer.,
The receiver is the simplest part.,
Make sure the transistor radio is turned off, and the laser is on.,
Connect the solar cell to the amplifier or stereo, and turn the volume up until you hear a hissing noise, then turn it down slightly until the hiss isn't noticeable.,
Aim the laser across the room so it hits the solar cell.,
Now carefully turn on the radio and slowly adjust the volume until you hear the radio station voices or music coming from the amplifier across the room.,
At this point you should be hearing the radio station coming in loud and clear in the amplifier across the room.",How to Transmit Audio With a Laser Pen,",, Usually there is a small spring to which you can attach the clip lead. The other end of the battery usually connects to the case of the laser. Since there are many different styles of laser pointer, you may have to experiment with clip lead placement to get the laser to work with the new external battery pack. You may also have to hold down the laser's push button switch by wrapping a rubber band or some wire around it. Test the connection before you attach the transformer, to make sure the laser works with the new battery pack. If it doesn't light, try reversing the battery. Battery reversal will not harm the laser.

, The 1,000 ohm side of the transformer has three wires coming from it. We only use the outside two wires. The inside wire is called a center tap and we do not use it in this circuit. Test the laser by attaching the battery. The laser should operate normally at this point.

, The schematic of the transmitter looks like this:

, You simply connect the solar cell to the microphone jack, and plug it into the amplifier or stereo phono input. It does not matter which way the wires are connected to the solar cell. Here is the schematic of the receiver:

, Plug the earphone jack of the laser into the earphone socket of the radio.

, The volume control should be fairly high, corresponding to an ear splitting level if it was playing music.

, You might hear clicks or pops coming from the stereo or amplifier as the laser beam passes over the solar cell. This indicates that everything is working fine at this point.]

, The radio should be just audible if the earphone jack is pulled out, not loud. If you can't hear the sound from the amplifier across the room, make sure the laser is shining on the solar cell, then try increasing the volume of the amplifier before you increase the volume of the radio.

, Put your hand in front of the laser beam to break the connection, and notice that the music stops.

Set the Q.,
Raise the gain on the channel.,
Find the frequency that is feeding back.,
Cut out the feedback.",How to Use a Parametric Equalizer2," This step is only relevant if the board has a Q knob on the channel strip. In a live situation you can set the Q as high as it can go to make precision cut.

, Boost the channels gain up until you start hearing the channel feedback.

, Turn the frequency knob until the feed back is most apparent.

, Lower the gain level on the EQ until the feedback stops.

Set up your PA system, and make sure it is working.,

Connect your playback device and play some music.,
Listen.,
Adjust your graphic equalizer.,
Listen again.,
Bypass the EQ, and compare.,
Adjust until it sounds good.",How to Tune a PA System," Including your graphic equalizer(s). Make sure that the inputs of your EQ are connected to the left/right outputs of your mixing desk and the outputs of the equalizer are connected to your main left/right power amps.;
, That is neither boosting or attenuating any frequencies.

, It is best to play a song that A. you are familiar with, because you need to know what the track is supposed to sound like, and B. that is similar in style and instrumentation to the music you will be mixing with the PA system.

, Take a walk around the room while the music is playing and note how it sounds different than it does when you listen to it in headphones or your home stereo (this is why you need a familiar piece of music). Your goal is to eliminate, or reduce as much as possible, these differences so that what is coming from your CD player is reproduced by the PA system as accurately as possible.

, With your music playing, start at the low end of the equalizer, and systematically boost each frequency, one at a time.


Evaluate the sound as you boost each frequency. If adding more of a particular frequency makes the music sound worse, turn that frequency down until the music sounds lacking in that frequency range. If adding more of a particular frequency improves the sound of the music leave it flat (neither boosted nor attenuated) for now.
Be careful when boosting high-midrange and high end frequencies, as they can be piercing if boosted too loud (it is not necessary to boost any frequency all the way up, just up enough that you can hear the difference).

, Walk around the room again once you have gone through each band on the graphic equalizer (with the music still playing). Again, you are listening to how the music sounds different than it does in headphones or another familiar playback system.

, Press the ""Bypass"" button (or toggle switch) on your graphic equalizer. Listen to the difference between the EQed sound, and the bypassed sound. This will show you exactly what you have changed with the graphic EQ and if some of your attenuation might be too extreme, or not extreme enough.


You may want to walk around the room while somebody else operates the Bypass control.

, Basically this entire article could be summarized as ""play with the graphic equalizer until it sounds good"". It sounds really simple and it is. It may take you a while to get the hang of it, but the more you do it the better you will get.


All that the fancy computer software for PA tuning does is play noise through the system, the frequencies and proportions thereof are already known, and then analyses the sound coming back and measures the difference between the sound it sends out and the sound it gets back. This is basically all that we're doing here, except a little bit less precise and with more room for personal taste.

Tighten it more.",How to Tighten a Beats by Dre Headphone," You’ll only need a long nose pliers for this. If you don’t have one, you can purchase it for under $5 from your local hardware store.


You can also use any item with a durable, pointed metal tip if you don’t want to spend money on the tool.;
, Take your Beats by Dre headphone and expose the hinges by extending the ear muffs away from the headband.

, Right on the point where the arms of the ear muffs are joining the headband, you’ll see a short metal rod. This is the pin of the hinge.

, Get your long nose pliers and gently lift the both ends of the metal rod/pin towards the headband one at a time. This will tighten the hinge and keep it from wiggling around.


Be careful not to damage the metal arm where the pin is place and the plastic part of the headband. Bend only the tip of the pin and not its entire body. Don’t pull the pin off of the metal arm too. Do the same to other arm if it’s also loose.

, Pull the ear muffs away from the headband and extend it as long as it can go.

, Spread out the earmuffs away from the body as if you’re going to put it on. Hold it by the headband and gently shake it to see if the headphone will hold its position.

, If the earmuffs fold back into position just by gently shaking it, repeat Part 1 and tighten the Beats by Dre a little bit more.

Acquire good quality headphones.,
Utilize transcription software.,
Use “correction” tools.,
Explore “auto-complete” functions.,
Use a foot pedal.,
Create templates.",How to Transcribe Faster1," Using quality headphones will ensure that your audio sounds clear, and is easy to understand. This will prevent you from having to go back over the audio again and again, trying to make out words that seem inaudible.Good quality headphones can go for as little as $20 at your local Radio Shack or Walmart Store.
Good headphones will offer comfort, sound isolation, and frequency range. Finding headphones with a solid frequency range will serve you well for audio transcription.;
, Good transcription software allows you to pause, rewind, and speed up/slow down your audio at your own discretion. This can be done using “hot keys,” or simple keyboard shortcuts, that improve your speed. Download a free transcription program, or find one for purchase.Some examples of free software include InqScribe, Express Scribe, and MacSpeech Scribe.

, Correction tools, such as Autocorrect on Microsoft Word or QuickCorrect in Word Perfect, can help reduce the number of keystrokes you make while typing. This can greatly increase your transcription speed and accuracy.


These tools are often turned on by default, but you may need to check your settings to ensure that these functions are enabled.

, Some word processors (such as Microsoft Word) offer “auto-complete” functions. These tools finish words that you begin to write, and understand certain abbreviations. Try turning this function on in your settings to improve your transcription speed.For example, auto-complete will type “thank you very much” for “tyvm.”

, Many transcription programs (such as Express Scribe) are designed to work with an optional foot pedal. These USB foot pedals allow you to start and stop audio playback with your foot. This has been proven to be even faster than using hotkeys. Consider investing in a transcription foot pedal to improve your speed.These foot pedals start around $20 and can be purchased at Radio Shack or online.

, Create some files with stock formatting that you can plug specific info into. (These are called “templates”). It is helpful, for instance, to set up templates when transcribing medical or legal files on a regular basis. Using a template will save you the time it requires to keep recreating documents with a similar format."

Set up your monitor system with graphic equalizers.,
Set up a microphone.,
Clear the stage.,
Gain your mic.,
Find the feedback on your graphic equalizer.,
Listen.,
Repeat the process for each monitor mix.",How to Tune PA Monitors," Make sure that, for each monitor mix, you have a graphic equalizer patched between the mixer and your monitor power amps.

Make sure that, for each monitor mix, a cable goes from the auxiliary send on the mixer to the input of the graphic EQ, and from the output of the EQ to the input of the monitor power amps.;
, Set up a mic in front of your first monitor. It is recommended to use a vocal mic on a stand, and at mouth height., This is going to be loud, but not in the pleasant way. Make sure that nobody is on the stage while you do this. If somebody must remain on the stage for any reason, make sure he or she is wearing ear protection., Send your mic to the monitor that it is in front of (using an auxiliary send). Turn it up until it starts to feed back, and then back it off so that the mic level is just below the threshold of feedback., Starting at the low frequencies, slowly turn each band up, one at a time.

If a particular frequency does not cause feedback when boosted, leave it at zero (neither boosting nor attenuating).
If a particular frequency does cause feedback when boosted, pull that frequency down. The higher you have to boost a frequency before it feeds back, the less you need to attenuate it. The less you have to boost a frequency to make it feed back, the more attenuation you want for that frequency band.

, Once you have gone through each band on your graphic EQ and are confident that you have some headroom before feedback, you will need to hear what the monitors sound like.

Speak into the vocal mic. Make sure that, in pulling out all the feedback frequencies, that you haven't rendered the stage sound overly muddy or lacking in definition.
If the sound is muddy or lacking definition, you can either attenuate more frequencies so that the non-feedback frequencies are not overpowering the rest, or you can add back some of the frequencies that you have attenuated in previous steps. The art of mixing monitors is finding the balance between definition and not feeding back.
At this point in the process, you may optionally play some music through the monitors and adjust it similarly to how you would when tuning the main front-of-house PA.

, You can copy the settings from your first mix to each other mix. There may be slight differences in the sound of each mix due to room acoustics, but your first mix gives you a good starting point."

Use all ten fingers.,
Learn to touch type.,
Memorize shortcuts.",How to Transcribe Faster2," Transcription is all about typing. If you want to improve your transcription speed, you must be an excellent typist. The first step in learning how to type faster is utilizing all ten of your fingers. Even if you are a pretty good typist, you may neglect your pinky fingers, or favor one hand over the other. Re-familiarize yourself with “home row” finger placement, positioning your pointer fingers on the “F” and “J” keys. Then, review which keys should be governed by which fingers.You can improve this skill by practicing with typing apps. Check out TypeRacer, Typing Maniac, or Keybr.com., “Touch typing” is typing without looking at your fingers. Once you have become familiar with home row and which keys are assigned to which fingers, you can begin practicing your touch typing. You can discipline yourself not to look down, or you may slide a blank sheer of paper into the slot above your keys and let it drape over your hands. Touch typing takes practice, but you will improve exponentially in time.Once again, practicing with typing apps is a great way to improve at touch typing and gain speed.

, Keyboard shortcuts can save you a great deal of time and keystrokes. Memorize the basic shortcuts and get comfortable using them regularly.For the following shortcuts, use Ctrl for a PC and Command for a Mac.
Ctrl/Command + C = copy
Ctrl/Command + X = cut
Ctrl/Command + V = paste
Ctrl/Command + Z = undo
Ctrl/Command + S = save
Ctrl/Command + F = search for word
Ctrl/Command + A = highlight everything

Use a keyboard.,
Position your body correctly.,
Place your feet flat on the floor.,
Use a long headphone cable.,
Take regular breaks.",How to Transcribe Faster3," A real keyboard with small legs (not a laptop) is an essential transcription tool. When you are typing at your computer for hours on end, you will need to take care of your wrists. Using a keyboard with a little height is the most ergonomic, most gentle on your wrists. Using proper positioning can improve your transcription speed., Situation your chair so that you sit straight up, with your head titled down just slightly to look at the screen. This should allow your forearms to slope down to your hands, and your hands to arch over the keys. This ergonomic position will be healthiest for your arms, wrists, and back, By staying healthy and comfortable, you will improve your speed., In order to ensure good posture, make sure that your feet lie flat on the floor under your desk. If they do not, place a box or footrest under your feet. This foot position balanced your entire body and supports you posture, so do not neglect this. By keeping yourself in best position, you will work more efficiently and effectively., You need your cable to be long enough that you do not need to tilt or twist your head sideways in order to sit comfortably at your keyboard. This helps ensure the health of your neck, keeps your head balanced, and ultimately improves your efficiency. , When you are transcribing for long periods of time, it is important to schedule regular breaks. This allows you to stretch your legs, refocus your eyes, and rest your ears. Taking breaks might seem antithetical to working faster, however taking short breaks will actually help you to work better and more efficiently.Try giving yourself a 15 minute break after every 75 minutes of work.
It may help to set a timer.

When your choose your preset shape tool, the shape tool options will load above in your workspace.
Click on the noted area in the tool options, and select the Corel Heart shape. (some versions of Paint Shop Pro do not have a heart shape, please choose another shape to practice with)

Set the settings as shown: Anti-alias: checked, Create as vector: checked, Width: 0.00

, Place your preset shape tool cursor onto your canvas. Practice using this tool so that you can get placement and size to your liking. To clear the canvas and try again, go to Edit, Undo.


In the image you will see a black heart shape. This is correct, as color does not matter at this point.

, Tool-tip note: Currently the preset shape is in a vector layer format. In most cases when you want to add an effect to an object within a layer it should be in the raster layer format. Why? If you try to add an effect or plug-in option to a vector layer, Paint Shop Pro, will post a pop up alert by default, to remind you the vector must be converted to a raster layer before you can continue. This is normal, and it is not an error.


Look at the layers pallet. This pallet is one of the most important pallets in your program. You must keep it neat and tidy.
The layer pallets shows that you have a raster 1 layer that is blank, and a vector 1 layer that contains the heart.
Click on the + sign next to the vector layer, you will see the sub layer that contains the actual heart. See the layers pallet image.
In the layers pallet, right click one time on the vector layer. From the list of choices, you will choose ""Convert to Raster Layer"". The layer will now be called Raster 2. Re-name the raster 2 layer to heart by double clicking the text.

The Gaussian Blur properties box will open. Set the settings as shown below or choose your own. Preview on Image: Checked, Radius: 1. Click OK

, Add a new layer (Go to layers, new raster layer, and name this layer Shading 2). Now add another layer of the airbrush effect.


Choose your airbrush tool, and this time change your color to a color that is a tad darker. The example color choice is #5e2e38. Make sure Shading 2 is your active layer.
Using the same technique as you did for shading 1, go ahead and do the same with the new darker color. (feel free to try different density, hardness, or opacity settings)
Time to blur this layer. Go to Adjust, Blur, Gaussian Blur. Use a manual blur setting of 0.50. This time you can set the radius to 0.50 to 1.00 (note that you must manually type in the 0.50)

, You have already made a few new layers, so you should be able to do this easily.


Go to Layers, New Raster Layer, and name this layer Highlight.
Select your Airbrush, but this time set your size down to 86.
Set your Foreground and Stroke properties color box to White (or a very light version of the lightest color in your heart)
Place your brush/cursor where you want to see some highlights and brush lightly in two areas.

Go to Selections, Select None.

, It is good to get in the habit of periodically saving your work in case the program crashes. To do so, click File, Save.

, The best thing about Paint Shop Pro is that you can work in layers. Because we have this layer option we can easily add different layer blends to give us a new graphic look.


In each layer, you will see an eye icon. That is called the Visibility Toggle. If you click on that eye icon, you will see the layer is now hidden in the canvas. To open that layer again you simply click the eye icon. To continue with the next steps we must toggle the highlight and shading 2 layers closed.
Go ahead and click on the eye icon next to the Highlight Layer, and the Shading 2 Layer. Stand on the layer named Shading 1 to make that your active layer.Please note you are not looking on the layer itself, but rather the pallet features towards the top.

In the layers pallet window you will see the word ""Normal"". If you click on that arrow next to Normal, you will be presented with several choices. These choices are are called ""Layer Blends"".
Set your shading 1 layer to have a special layer blend.
Choose the option ""Overlay"" as shown, and you will see that this layer blend option gave your shading 1 a new look.
Open up Shading 2 by clicking on the eye icon. Make sure Shading 2 is the active layer. Set that layer to Multiply. You will see this really made that layer dark! This is okay, because you have to still set your opacity levels for each layer, and the next steps will show how to do this.

, Stand on the layer named Shading 1. In the layer pallet, you will see the #100. If you click on that you will see you can set down the opacity of the current active layer. Set your shading layers as follow: Set Shading 1 to 69, Set Shading 2 to 26


Open the Highlight layer. If you want to try different layer blends and opacity levels go right ahead.

, It is good to get in the habit of periodically saving your work in case the program crashes. To do so, click File, Save.

, Quick talk on Tubes- Picture Tubes or also known as PSP Tubes, are extremely popular in the PSP community. Picture tubes are best explained as a stamper that never runs out of ink. Most tubes have a transparent background so that you can place the picture tube on any color background or any layer, and not have to see a color background with that graphic. Save your heart so that you can use it over and over again in the future. You will never have to re-make this heart again unless you want to.


Go to the main menu in Paint Shop Pro, and choose Window and then choose Duplicate. You will now have a carbon copy of your work. You do not want to confuse your original with the duplicate. You can safely close your original work or minimize it.
Merge your layers on our duplicate work. Go to Layers, Merge, Merge all Visible. You will see in your layer pallet that you have one layer named Merged.
To get rid of all the extra transparent space around our heart you can safely crop your work by following these simple steps: Go to Edit, Copy, Go to Edit again and this time choose Paste as a New IMAGE.
Go to File, Export, Picture Tube. Give your tube a name, and click save. You have just saved your tube, and it is ready to be used later. You can find your new heart tube by choosing the picture tube tool, and choose the heart from the picture tube options list.

Save the file as a GIF.",How to Use Pivot," Pivot is available as a download on several different websites. Since Pivot is a free software, those who want to acquire it for their desktop will not have to pay for it. Simply locate a file download center and get the newest version of the application.


Make sure you can trust the website where you download Pivot. Some sites are known to send malicious malware or spyware along with freeware.;
, Unbox the executable files, and run Pivot on your computer.

, Commands within the application will guide the user in constructing a single figure based on a series of connected straight line segments.

, Assess your stick figure and find out where the nodes or joints will occur.


In many screen shot renderings of the Pivot application, the pivoting nodes or joints are marked in red, where the line segments for the figure are black.

, Pivot will provide a process for moving each segment of the figure through various frames, which get sequenced to create a lifelike animation effect.

, Do a practice run and look at how the animation works. Evaluating the animation closely will help to identify its weakest points or items that could use improvement.

, Go back into frames as necessary and edit them, always relying on the entire sequence as the finished product.

, Make sure the animation is as good as you want it.


Make notes on where the animation doesn't flow right. As with more sophisticated products like Adobe or Flash, in Pivot, it's important to assess the specific frames where action simply doesn't look right. With this data in hand, the animator can go back to the drawing board to edit out errors or inconsistencies.

, The GIF, or graphics interchangeable format, is the preferred file format for finished Pivot files. This file format is easily used on the Internet and other modern technologies.

Use CAI as an alternative way to inspect a product.,
Note that there are two non-contact measurement systems for CAI: 3D laser scanners and laser trackers.,
Make comparisons.",How to Use Computer Aided Inspection (CAI)," Working together with CAD, CAI makes for a faster and easier process for comparing products to their digital counterpart.


Using 3D laser scanning, a product can be 3D inspected, and surfaced to compare the physical part to the design with the use of a color map and point clouds.
Producing point clouds gives the ability to measure everywhere instead of being limited to certain parts on a drawing.;
,


D scanners are fast and can be mounted to an existing CMM. It works by measuring the reflected image from an object with a positioning sensor.
Laser trackers calculate the relative distance between points on an axis. With that information and knowing the wavelength of the emitted light, the distance between two points can be determined.

, Using CAI with the CAD database makes it easier to compare the digital 3D product to the original, helping make the see whether the deviations are marginal or serious, and ultimately saving the product from failing inspection.

For this tutorial, let's start with a new, blank scene.,
Add a model to the scene.,

Optional: Adjust the camera slightly so we can see the entire Lycantar model.,
Let's add the mirror to the scene.,





Scroll down slightly and click on the thumbnail for the One-Sided Square.,

Move the square behind the Lycantar so we can see the reflections in it:

Open the Object Parameters Palette, making sure the name at the top says ""square_1"", and change the following settings to move it in place:

Scale: 300
xScale (width): 250
yScale (height): 210
yRotate: 18 (turned so we can see the reflection clearer)
xTrans (left/ right): -0.232
zTrans (front/ back): -0.381


Feel free to adjust these value to suit your taste.

,
Now, let's make the square into a reflective mirror.,
Switch to the Material Room (by clicking on the ""Material"" Tab at the top of the Poser screen).,

If the ""square_1"" is not already selected, select it from the pull-down list on the left (next to the word ""Object"").,
The Diffuse_Color and Specular_Color can be any color you like, but either full black or full white will work the best.,
Left-click on the plug icon next to the word ""Reflection_Color"" and drag to the the right: this will create a new shader node.,

On the Reflect node, set the following:

Color: white (255, 255, 255)
Quality: 0.2 (a higher quality will create longer renders times, though you may or may not see a difference in quality)
Softness: 0
RayBias: 0.002907 (this should be the default setting, which is fine)
You can also adjust these settings to suit your taste or to create various effects.

,
On the PoserSurface node, change the following:

Diffuse_Color: black (0,0,0)
Diffuse_Value: 0 (this means the ""mirror"" has no color of its own)
Specular_Color: black (0,0,0)
Specular_Value: 0 (this means the ""mirror"" has no sheen or highlighting of its own)
Highlight_Size: 0.05
Reflection_Color: white (255,255,255) (which is probably the default color)
Reflection_Value: 1

,

Next, let's set the box's properties to make sure it will reflect.
,Switch back to the Pose Room (by clicking on the ""Pose"" Tab at the top of the Poser screen).,Click on the ""Properties"" tab on the ""Parameter Dials"" palette.,
Make sure both the ""Visible"" and ""Visible in Ray Tracing"" checkboxes are checked.,Now, let's set the render options so Poser will create reflections.,

Go to Render > Render Settings.
,
Click the tab for ""FireFly"" to enable it.,To keep things easy, click on the ""Auto Settings"" button.,
Drag the slider from left-to-right (or from ""Draft"" to ""Final"") until the ""Raytracing"" box becomes checked, or at about the third notch from the right.,Click the ""Save Settings"" button (which has the same effect as clicking an ""OK"" button).,

Render the scene by going to Render > Render or click the ""Render"" button at the top of the Document Window (the button that looks like a camera).",How to Make a Mirror in Poser," Go to File > New.

Note: Although lighting is important when making an image, setting up the lights is beyond the scope of this tutorial. I recommend looking at the websites listed below for light sets or lighting techniques.
Note 2: The camera settings (angle, placement, and distance from the subject) are important to your final image as well, but for this tutorial, the default camera settings should be fine.
Note 3: Most of the controls in Poser can be moved around the screen- your controls may be in a different location than what's shown in the screen shots.;
, For this tutorial, we'll use the ""Lycantar"" (a robot dog), which is included, for free, with the installation of Poser 7.

Open the Library Palette by clicking on the ""handle"" on the right of the screen or go to Window > Libraries.
Click on the word ""Figures"" to open the Figures Library.
Scroll down and double-click on the ""CP Partners"" Folder to open it.
Scroll down and double-click on the ""VanishingPoint"" Folder to open it.






Scroll down slightly and click on the thumbnail for the ""Lycantar"".
Click the double-check mark at the bottom of the Library Palette (""Create New Figure"") to add it to the scene.






The Lycantar will be added to the scene.

You can either click on the camera ""trackball"" to move and rotate the camera... or you can use the values shown in the screen shot.

Make sure the Parameter Dials Palette is open- it's the ""window"" with all the ""dials"" and values.
Select the Main Camera : you should see the words ""Main Camera"" at the top of the Parameter Dials Palette.
Change a value, click on the number. Poser will display a text box so you can type in a new number.


Here are some suggested values:

DollyZ (move front/ back): 0.470
DollyY (move up/ down): 0.285
DollyX (move left/ right): -0.028
xOrbit (rotate up/ down): -7
yOrbit (rotate around): 35




,
Any object can be made into a ""mirror"" by simply changing its reflective properties. But, for this tutorial, we'll use the ""One-Sided Square"".
Go back to the Library Palette and click on the word ""Figures"" to show all the libraries.






Click on the word ""Props"" to open the Props Library.

You should see a series of blue folders. If you don't, double-click the ""up"" icon (the blue folder with the arrow) to move ""up"" a folder.


Double-click on the ""Primitives"" folder to open it.

,

Click on the check mark at the bottom of the Library Palette (""Apply Library Preset"") to add it to the scene.

,, To do this, we'll have to change the surface material settings., Then, make sure you are on the ""Advanced"" Tab., In the main window, you should see a box with the word ""PoserSurface"".

In order for an object to be reflective, change the following settings:

,

The Diffuse_Color is the color of the mirrored surface: in this case, we want it to look like a mirror, without any color at all. But, you could change it to blue or green to make the mirror look more like a metallic surface, such as car metal.

, In the pop-up menu, select: New node > Lighting > Ray Trace > reflect.,,,,,, (By default, they will probably already be checked.),,,

Note: the Poser 4 render engine does not support reflections or ray-tracing.

,,

Note: Ray-tracing and at least 3 ray-traced ""bounces"" are necessary to create reflective surfaces.
Note 2: On the right are a number of additional render options (such as ""Use displacement maps""). Enabling these options are not necessary for this tutorial, but you may want to investigate these options to increase the quality of your images.

,,

Sit back and watch the scene render. Depending on the speed of your computer, rendering could be finished in a few minutes!
Note: many factors can influence how long (or how fast) a scene renders, such as: the size of the image, the number of lights, the complexity of the shadows, the complexity of the models in the scene, the complexity of the textures, and the complexity of the calculations for effects such as reflections, transparency, and so on. And the most important factor is the speed of your computer's processor and whether there are any other programs running in the background. Optimizing your computer (and Poser itself) to render faster could be a tutorial all to itself!

Inverse Kinematics (IK) - Poser's Inverse Kinematics (IK) features help you achieve realistic poses and natural motion in animations. The effects of IK are most apparent when using the Editing Tools. Translate the hip- the legs bend to accommodate the new hip position without changing the foot position. Translate a foot- the hips and other leg stay fixed in position. The behavior of the arms under IK is similar. If you place a figure's hands against an imaginary wall, moving the hip toward the wall causes the arms to bend.
The arms bend while the hands remain fixed in position. If you enable IK on a pose created with IK turned off, the rules of IK can force the pose to change. IK determines how the objects joined to it (closer to the root) must respond to support the new placement. For example, if someone was to grab your hand and push, your arm would automatically bend at the elbow, while your shoulder would stay fixed in position.

,, This means confirming that all settings are at their default positions and that all parameter dials are set to zero (0)., You cannot perform the next function if you do not have something selected., The Joint Parameters dialog box appears.

We found the best solution was to import the reference photo and use it as a background., Then, find your photo and select it. As you can see in our example, it was smaller than the figure. Because of the nature of what we are creating, we can work with that, though.

Note: Poser may give you a message saying that the background window height/ width ratio is different than the current window. You can click either yes or no: the size of the document window doesn't matter for this project.

A negative number tilts the figure to the left and a positive number tilts it to the right. Click on the number and enter ""-24"" to tilt the figure like the character, Beast, in the background.

All camera directional references will be assumed to be ""Left"" or ""Right"". In other words, you are looking at it from the front.






All body part references are the opposite. This is how Poser labels the figure parts.


, Notice that the character, Beast, is hunched over... we need to match this by using the Bend dial. A positive number bends the model forward. Enter ""23""., Set its Bend dial to ""50""., Since it is hard to select the neck in this position, I suggest you change to the Left Camera using the Camera Controls. The figure rotates, but the background does not.

Note: Remember that you are working in 3d space: a body part may look like it's bending the correct way when you view the figure from one angle, but the body part may be completely twisted when seen from another angle. Always make sure to check your work with multiple camera angles as you go along.

, Since you are bending it back, you need to use a negative number. I suggest setting the Bend dial to ""-25""., This is an extremely awkward looking pose and a normal person may not physically do this, but remember - superheroes are at the extremes of their motion.,, Start by clicking on the left shoulder. Remember, if you are looking at the figure from the front, it is opposite. You are trying to match the arm that is pulled back. To do this, use the Front-Back dial. A negative number pulls the arm back. Enter ""-22"". To bend it backwards, use the Bend dial and enter ""-49""., Set the Bend dial to ""-26"". Pivot the arm slightly by setting the Side to Side dial to ""1""., Now for the right arm. Just like the left arm, start by selecting the right shoulder. Roll the arm (thumb towards us) using a negative number for the Twist dial. Enter ""-30"". Set the Front to Back dial to ""19"" and the Bend dial to ""-2""., Set the Twist dial to ""-2"", the Side to Side dial to ""-7"", and the Bend dial to ""29"".,, You need to bring it forward. To do this, use the Bend dial and set it to ""-97"". A negative number swings the leg forward, rather than backwards, like the arms. Your model should look very strange at this point, with his foot straight out at you., Use a Bend setting of ""153"" to bring the foot back down.,, Select the left thigh. Use the Bend dial and set it to ""19"" to pull it back a little., This will move the leg out of view, as it is in the reference photo., Select the left foot. Set the Bend dial to ""30"" to add a touch of realism., Select the Face Camera using the Camera Controls. This zooms in very close to the face so you can see what you are doing. The head has a decent selection of dials, which allows for a variety of expressions., Use the Worry Left and Worry Right to make his eyebrows look evil. A negative setting will do this. I used ""-1.61"" and ""-1.41"" for an extreme look. Try not make the left and right symmetrical. Perfectly symmetrical features are not found in real life and can be a dead-giveaway that your pose (or final image) is computer-generated., Set Mouth O to ""0.616"", set Open Lips to ""0.692"", and Smile to ""1.689"" to complete the evil grin., You now have a posed figure!
,

There is a lot of information regarding the hands, so we are leaving that for another tutorial.
Something else you can work with are the reality limits. When you create a superhero-type pose, you may not want limits on, but for a real person, this will lock the body parts into a normal range of motion. To turn these limits on, select Figure > Use Limits.

Find a subject with a foreground and background objects to give the photo depth.,
Take a photo 10 to 15 feet (3.0 to 4.6 m) away from the main subject.,
Move the images to your computer.",How to Make 3D Images Using StereoPhoto Maker1," Unless you're using two digital cameras at the same time, you're going to be pretty much stuck with taking still life shots for now. You can try asking a friend to hold still between shots, but good luck having it work with kids or animals. If you plan on viewing your 3D pictures with red-blue anaglyph glasses, it's best to avoid photographing things that are red or cyan.;
, Then slide the camera about 2.5"" to the right for the right eye picture.


Try to be consistent. If you sometimes take the right picture first and sometimes the left first, you'll have a hard time knowing which is which. Make it a habit to always take the left picture first.
It's best if your camera is on a tripod, but if you are doing this hand-held try to keep the camera as still as possible as you move to take the second shot.
Keep the overall framing of the pictures the same while you are shifting. Try to keep whatever is touching the bottom of the frame the same in both images to minimize vertical error.

, If you're using a digital camera, it's useful to organize the images for easier processing later. Create a folder called ""3D Photos"". Inside 3D Photos create some sub folders. One might be named ""Original Right"" or ""OR"" and ""Original Left"" or ""OL"". Create another folder called ""Anaglyph"" and perhaps another called ""Side by Side"". These are for storing your finished work.


Move the images from your camera into the 3D Photos folder, and then move the right shots into the ""OR"" folder and the left shots into the ""OL"" folder. There should be the same number of shots in each folder.






Rename the files. Suppose you've started by taking five pairs of images. You might name them Photo1-L, Photo1-R, Photo2-L, Photo2-R, Photo3-L, Photo3-R, and so on. If you've taken 10 or 20 or 50 or several hundred ""stereo pairs"" of images, renaming them individually would take a long time. There's a way to rename a whole folder full of files (Multi-Rename) in SPM that's described later in this tutorial.

,How to Make 3D Images Using StereoPhoto Maker2,
"
Go to the SteroPhoto Maker website and at the top you'll see:


StereoPhoto Maker Ver4.01 836KByte 22/May/2009
StereoPhoto Maker Ver4.01 include help file 11087KByte 22/May/2009

,
Click on one of those links to download StereoPhoto Maker.,
Save the file.,
Once it's downloaded, open it.",How to Make 3D Images Using StereoPhoto Maker3,", The program itself is amazingly small in size, at only about 700 Kilobytes. There is also a help file which can be downloaded, and it takes up about 5 megabytes. This has extensive illustrated instructions, and is strongly recommended both for help and tutorial.

, A box should pop up asking if you want to open or save a file named ""stphmkr310.zip"". Hit the Save button. A box titled Save As pops up, asking you where to save it. In the ""Save in"" section, save it on your desktop so you'll be able to find it easily.

, A folder containing the file ""stphmkre.exe"" should open. Drag it onto your desktop so that it will be easy to get to later on. You can now close the StereoPhoto Maker website window.

"
"
Choose File, Open Left/Right Images.,
Click on the ""Easy Adjustment"" icon (K)(the red square overlapping the blue square ).,
Preview the anaglyph.,
Save the image.,
Put it into your ""anaglyph"" folder.,
Experiment with the Auto-align.",How to Make 3D Images Using StereoPhoto Maker4," The program will guide you, asking where it can find the left image, and then where it can find the right image. After you've selected the images, both will appear side by side.

, It takes you to a window that displays both images semi-transparently. You can then drag one until it lines up well with the other.


Ideally you want to make the two images match up perfectly vertically, and match up horizontally for things in the very center of the picture. Line up the two images as well as you can and click OK.







, The multicolored icon to the left of the vertical red-blue icon is there to see your image as an anaglyph. Now that you've aligned them, click on that and put on your 3D glasses. To get a big view, click on the icon that looks like a rectangle with an X through it . That will give you a full screen view. After you've had a good enough look at it, to go back to the regular program screen, hit the Esc key. Make any adjustments in aligning the images until you're happy with it.

, Choose File, Save Stereo Image.

, You may want to change the name to that it doesn't have a -L or -R on it.

, Again, choose File, Open Left/Right Images, and tell the program which files to open. Then select Adjust, Auto-Align . If it ever asks if you want to use previous report files, always click No. The program will perform its magic comparing the two images and lining them up as perfectly as it can. If you want you can save this image also, perhaps with another name. You can later look at the two images and see how they compare.
"
"
Select your files.,
In the Look In box, browse to the folder where you stored your original LEFT files.

,
Select Full Rename.

,
Provide information about the files.",How to Make 3D Images Using StereoPhoto Maker5," Once you've chosen File, Multi-Rename, a box comes up.

,,, Suppose these are some desert images you just took, and/or maybe you want to indicate when you took them. For the moment let's suppose you've taken 25 stereo pairs, and that the left images are in a folder called OL and the right images in a folder called OR.


In the box that says ""Stereo"" you could replace ""Stereo"" with Desert2007February or with any meaningful notation you wish.
In the numbering box that shows ""0001"", you could replace the ""0001"" with ""01"", since you really only need two digits for 25 images.
In the box that contains ""_B.JPG"", leave the ""_"" and the "".JPG"", but replace the ""B"" with ""L"" or ""OL"" when renaming the LEFT files, and with ""R"" or ""OR"" when renaming the RIGHT files. Do this for both the left and right image folders, and now it will be much easier to identify your files.

"
"
Double check your images.,
Select File, Multi-Conversion.,
In the Look In box, browse until you've brought up the folder containing the LEFT image files you want to work on.,
In the Input File Type (Stereo) box, choose Independent (L/R).,
Check that box and a Browse window appears.,
Choose Output File Type.,
In the Adjust box, select Auto-alignment, Auto Crop after adjustment and Auto Color Adjustment.,
Near the bottom you set the Output Folder box.,
Hit the Browse button and choose ""anaglyph"" folder.,
Click on the Convert All Files button.,
The program will automatically adjust the images for a correct stereo window, corrects image rotation, size differences, and vertical difference errors.,
You can optionally save the choices you've made so that the next time you run Multi-Conversion you don't need to click on all the same choices again.",How to Make 3D Images Using StereoPhoto Maker6," If you've done a multi-rename of LEFT and RIGHT image folders in preparation for doing a multi-conversion, be sure to look at how many files are in each folder. It's not uncommon to have made a mistake or to have an unequal number of files in them. Doing a multi-conversion in such circumstances will be a mess. If you have an unequal number, you may need to look through them to remove ""stray"" single images, and then run multi-rename again.

, In Multi-Conversion you tell the program which files you want it to work on, how you want them to be saved, and where to save them. For this tutorial we're assuming that you're starting with two independent images files. As you become more advanced in working with StereoPhoto Maker this may not be true, but for the purpose of this tutorial let's start there.

, You don't need to choose a file name or file type.

, When you choose this, just below it a box saying Right Image Folder appears.

, Click on Browse and choose the folder that contains your RIGHT image files. Leave the L Normal and R Normal boxes as they are. You'd use these if you needed to rotate the images or flip them..

, For the sake of this tutorial, choose Color anaglyph . After you've run this conversion sequence you may want to do it again and choose Gray anaglyph , Side-by-Side , or Independent L/R, but for the moment choose Color anaglyph.

, There are lots of other options that you can explore later.

, This is where you tell the program where you want the new files you're creating to go. Remember at the beginning of this tutorial we suggested that you create folders called ""anaglyph"".

, Even if you didn't create those folders before, it's not too late. Go to Windows Explorer and create that folder, and browse to it.

, If it asks you whether you want to use the ""previous report files"", click on No. Now just walk away or watch if you must. You'll see no dramatic graphics, just the computer running madly through its paces, trying to make sense of your stereo pairs. Depending on the speed and configuration of your PC it can take from 5 seconds to 3 minutes per pair.

, If you've been careful taking the two images here should be no problem in the majority of the images it produces.

, Just click on the Save box on the lower right of the window, and give it a name. To use those setting another time you'll click on Restore(File) and choose the file you saved.

Navigating the basic user interface.,
Creating a cube.,
Using Object Modifiers.,
Adding Materials.,
Rendering the Scene.,
Manipulating Objects.,
Creating a simple animation.,
Adding Modifiers to animation.,
Adding Lights.,
Saving to AVI.",How to Make 3D Animations Using 3D Studio Max," The first step is learning what and where everything is. For now, all you will use are the noted sections of (Figure 1). The toolbar contains the Move, Rotate, and Scale buttons. These allow control over the position, angle, and scale of objects. The control panel on the right is used to create and modify shapes, as you will do in step 2. The viewports in the center show the user different angles of the scene. Think of them as cameras pointing from different places to the center of the scene. A few helpful buttons to control how the views display are located on the bottom toolbar, on the right. These allow you to move, rotate, or zoom the focus of the cameras. The last section on (Figure 1) covers the lower toolbar’s animation controls. These will be used much later.;
, To create a cube, go to the control panel on the right, and find the button labeled Box. When you click this button, the control panel will change. You now have an option of Creation Method. You want to make a cube, so select the Cube option. After you select Cube, click and drag with the mouse inside any viewport (See Note 1). It should look something like Figure 2 (Figure 2 is a rendering, which will be discussed later). In preparation for the next step, change the segments fields under parameters to 5 for length, width and height. These will make your modifiers apply more smoothly.

, After creating a cube, it can be modified in different ways. To add modifiers, open the Modify tab at the top of the control panel, and use the drop-down Modifier List. Under Object-Space Modifiers, find and select Twist. Notice that in the object list, the box you created now has modifier Twist attached to it. The control panel should now be working with the Twist modifier. Increase the angle, and watch what happens. The cube will twist around itself. Compare your cube to (figure 3). When you are finished with Twist, remove it by pressing the small trash can button in the control panel, under the object list.

, The Material Editor (Figure 4) allows the user to customize, and apply different materials to objects. By default, all the materials are gray. To make things a little more interesting, lets decrease the Opacity under Blinn Basic Parameters to 50. This will decrease the solidity of the material. This is only a very basic example of materials, as they can become much more complex. For now, you will assign this simple 'ghostly' material to the cube using the Assign Material to selection button (Third from the left, just below material spheres). To see how this material has affected the cube, create another small shape inside the cube.

, This step is very simple. To render a scene, you can use the Quick Render button located on the right of the upper toolbar. You may have to slide the toolbar to the left to find this button. A render allows you to view the final product of the scene, including materials and effects (See Note 2). Later, you use the full render function to create a video output file. You will notice here, that the cube you created earlier is partially invisible, and the shape you created inside is showing through (see Figure 5). You can delete this extra shape now, as it was only to provide a better visual example.

, In this step you will use 3 buttons: Move, Rotate, and Scale (See Figure 1). These allow the user to change the position, angle, and proportional size of the shape along the X, Y, and Z axis’. The axis’ will change depending on which viewport you are working in. It is not possible to move along the Z axis in most standard views, because it would involve moving along the line of sight, which is parallel to the view. To use these tools, hover over the cube with your mouse to display the axis' indicator. Now click the axis you want to use, and drag in the direction you want to move.

, Here comes the fun part - beginning to animate the scene! For this instruction you will use Auto-key. On the bottom toolbar, make sure the animation bar is at 0/100. Press auto-key, and the large key button to the left of it. This will initialize the starting key (where everything is at the beginning of the scene). Drag the animation bar to 10/100. Now move the cube around, using the buttons from Step 6. After you have changed the position of the cube in frame 10, drag the bar back to 0/100, notice that it will regress back to the original position. This process allows the user to specify exactly how the object will change at a certain frame, and auto-animate the steps in between. These points are called key frames.

, Now that you can animate movement, try adding modifiers to the cube. Begin at frame 0/100, and add the Twist modifier – use an angle of 0. Now go to frame 10 and increase the angle. The arrows beside angle will show red corners around them. This means the angle has been changed since the last key frame. Scroll back to frame 0/100 and notice the change.

, Adding lights is as simple as creating shapes. Under the Create tab in the control panel, look beneath the tabs. The small buttons here allow the creation of different types of objects (Geometry, Lights, etc..). Select Lights here and choose Omni. An omni light creates light at all angles (think of it as a mini sun). Click once anywhere in the view ports to create an omni light. Arrange the light however you like, to add shadow or contrast to objects (see Figure 6). You can animate this light to move through the scene as well.

, The final step is to save the animation into a file to view it later. From the top menu bar, find Rendering > Render, or press F10 from the main interface. This will bring up the Rendering Options window (See Figure 7). Setting Time Output to Active Time Segment or Range allow an output of the full scene, or a range of frames. Choose Range, and specify 0-10 to make this go more quickly. Scroll down further to find Render Output, and click Files. Specify a name for your animation ending in .avi (Cube.avi). This will send the file in avi format to the specified path. Choose Render in the lower right corner of the window to finish.

Take classes!",How to Make Your Own Animation," First, write down everything that you want to happen. This doesn't just mean dialogue, it means actions and facial expressions too. You need to have a clear idea of exactly what's going to happen before you start.;
, Story boards are the next step: these are drawings that show major actions and scenes throughout your animation. These tell the story overall and look much like a comic book.

, You'll want to have a reference to look at as you draw your frames, so that the character looks consistent and real from pose to pose. Draw your characters from every different angle and with a number of different expressions. You should also draw out what they'll be wearing, especially if what they're wearing changes between scenes.

, This is a single drawing on a single piece of paper that shows all of the major stages of movement in a single frame. This will often result in a picture that looks like conjoin quintuplets or something like that, but it's designed to make sure that your key frames are correctly aligned and that your motions look natural.

, The key frames are the major stations of the movement that the character makes. For example, if you're animating a character turning from left to right, the key frames would show the character facing left, then the character facing the camera, and then the character facing right.

, Flip between the key frames to see how the movement looks.

, The in betweens are all of the minute movements between the key animations. So, start by drawing the image that should go directly between two key frames. Then do the image that goes between the key frame and the first in-between. Keep doing this until you have the appropriate number of frames to illustrate the movement (this will differ depending on what your purpose is with your animation).

, Yeah, you should pretty much constantly be checking for flow.   

, Clean any sketch lines and stray marks that distract from the movement of the character. You may even choose to ink the frames of animation, depending on what you plan to do with your work.

, Stitch the images together in a computer program like Photoshop, in order to create the final video. You can add  this reel to a portfolio or just show it off to your friends and family!

, Flip books are a great place to start when you want to learn how to do animation. These are so simple, even little kids can make them. Flip book animation is actually really good because it mimics how real, traditional animation works.

, Stop-motion animation is where you take pictures of physical objects and then string the pictures together the same way you'd string together the drawings in a traditional piece of animation. There are lots of different ways that you can do stop-motion animation. Common materials include cut out paper (which was famously used in making Monty Python) or clay animation (which has been used in famous films like The Nightmare before Christmas).

, Animated gifs are a popular medium, used widely on the internet these days. Even wikiHow uses them! You can create your own animated gifs easily, so long as you have a computer and can get a hold of basic software. Usually gifs are used to take short clips of TV shows, but you can use the same method to string together your own, hand-drawn images.

, You can also do standard computer animation, but be aware that this can be very challenging and often takes years to learn how to do it well. There are a couple of different methods, including:


2d animation. You can do this at home using programs like Anime Studio, or make Adobe Flash animations.
3d animation. This is more difficult to do at home, as the computer power necessary to render 3d animation requires a much more powerful machine than most casual users possess. If your computer can take it, one basic program you can use is Smith Micro's Poser.

, Machinima is a type of animation that uses real time capture of existing computer models. Usually such works are created using video games (the popular web series Red vs Blue is a good example). Machinima is much easier for new animators to pick up and can give you a great way to learn basic animation skills.

, It's always a good idea to do your homework before trying something. Do some reading on animation techniques and what makes animation good before getting too serious about what you're doing. A good place to start is by studying the twelve basic principles of animation, as laid out by the Old Men at Disney.

, Even poor animation won't matter too much if the story that you're telling is good. Write an incredible story that blows people away and they'll overlook animation mistakes or lack of Disney-blockbuster graphics.

, The story itself isn't the only part of animation storytelling that matters. You also need to think about HOW you tell then story. How it's presented, what order the scenes happen in, and other factors like how the characters are used can significantly impact how people see your story and animation.

, Animation is at it's best when the viewers are emotionally connecting with the characters. This is much easier if you get your characters making faces that convey real emotions, instead of largely static faces. Practice drawing emotions on faces. You should focus on the motions of changing emotions too, not just the poses of sad-angry-laughing, etc.

, Another part of making even the most basic animation more engaging and seem more life-like is getting the motions to seem dynamic and tangible. This is usually conveyed through a process called squash and stretch. Squash and stretch is when you exaggerate motions to help the human brain perceive them as real. A common example would be when you imagine a ball. It's much more interesting to see a ball squish down to the floor a little when it lands, instead of just seeing a normal sphere. This helps the viewer feel the motion that the ball is making.

, Color theory is the idea of what colors look good with which other colors, and how colors can be used together to convey story and emotion. Understanding color theory is essential to making your animation look professional and appealing. If you want to really take animation seriously, it would be a good idea to have at least a basic understanding of color theory.

, Composition is the study of how an image should be set up on a canvas or screen in order to look good and draw the viewers attention to the important places. This is also extremely important, if you want you viewers to get the most from your animations. Do a little reading on basic compositional theory, such as the rule of thirds or golden proportions.

, When you see a ball, you don't see a circle: it's a sphere. While 2d and 3d animation are technically flat (our eyes don't perceive real depth there unless the animation is in actual 3d and secondary equipment is used), our brains will enjoy the image more if it looks like there is substance to the shapes. In other words, if you want your animations to look good, you generally want to get good at showing the substance of objects in your images.

, Of course, most cartoons show people and objects as looking very different than they do in real life. Women would be almost crippled if they had Jessica Rabbit's spine in real life! But having an understanding of how bodies work and how they're capable of moving will make your animation more enjoyable and give it a more natural feel. Studying anatomy also universally makes people better at drawing!

, Finally, don't forget: you can take classes for animation! There are often cheap courses offered at local community colleges and you might be able to audit animation classes from local art schools. You can also easily find classes and tutorials online, for free or much less than you'd pay for real life courses. If this is something that you enjoy, then take it seriously and devote some resources to it!

, It can be whatever you'd like, but can't use spaces.

, The label you entered will be automatically entered into the other applicable fields (they need to match).

, This will start burning your project to the blank DVD in your drive. The time this takes will vary depending on your DVD burner and the size of the video.

, After the DVD has finished burning, you can use it in most DVD players. Some players will have problems with burned discs, and may not load the video.

, If it has very low music (this makes the audience want to turn the volume up, so the scream is louder and scarier), or if it has very small text (which makes you want to go into full screen), that's a good indication that it's a screamer. Exit out!

, If it deals with scary things, like ghosts or supernatural things, this may be a screamer, but you cannot be certain. Be careful!

Give your camera a wedgie.,
Improve The Softness.,
Sometimes you have to run cables across a doorway or where people will walk.,
Adjust the camera level.,
Camera Stabilizer.",How to Make Your Own Video," Here's a great way to prop up your camcorder when you don't have a tripod and you want a low angle shot from the ground. A regular doorstop works perfect. You can move the wedge design up and back to set the shot higher or lower. And because it's made of rubber it stays put.;
, Here's a cheap way to get a soft look effect without expensive filters. All you need is a regular set of pantyhose. Cut out a small square with a pair of scissors and apply it over the lens using a rubber band. By adjusting how tight it is you can change the intensity of the softness.

, You don't want people tripping so you have to tape it down. You don't want to use duct tape, that leaves a nasty residue. Regular gaffer's tape can be pretty expensive, but an alternative is to pick up a roll of Scotch Blue Painter's Tape. You can find it at your home improvement store. It's easy to apply and remove, and its bright color makes it very visible.

, Unless you have a professional tripod, it's hard to tell if your camera is level. But instead use a small bubble level for under two bucks. Use some double sided tape, stick it to your tripod, then you'll know if your camera is level all the time.

, Here's a compact easy to use replacement for a tripod in a pinch. You can use an eye bolt that matched the threads of the camcorder. Then tying about a five foot length of bungee cord to the eye bolt you can make a convenient camera stabilizer. By stepping on the cord and pulling it tight while shooting it steadies the camera pretty well. It's easy, portable, and works great.

Familiarize yourself with how the AVI file format works.,
Download and install a media player packaged with many of the most common codecs.,
Download an install an all-purpose codec.,
Download and install a codec pack.,
Analyze the AVI file to figure out precisely what codec is needed to decode it properly.",How to Play AVI," AVI is what's called a ""container format,"" which means it doesn't specify how the video and audio contained within it was encoded. It simply ""contains"" the data in a shell that will be familiar to the user and to your software.


The first step to understanding why AVI files can be so fussy is to understand what encoding and decoding are. When raw video data is saved into a computer file, it needs to be encoded. This means that it will be compressed using a certain algorithm to reduce it to a manageable size.
To play back a video file, your media player software will have to decode the data using the same algorithm used to encode it. Basically, the data was compressed a certain way, and your computer needs to unpack it in the exact same way for it to be usable.
Encoding and decoding is performed using a ""codec."" A codec, which is actually an abbreviation for ""Coder / Decoder,"" is a small program that allows your media software to pack and unpack video files. Therefore, if you don't have the same codec that was used to make the AVI video, you won't be able to play it.;
, Before you try to find and install the codec you need individually, consider using a different media player. VLC is a free and open source media player that is packaged with a huge assortment of common codecs. Install VLC and then try to use it to open your video file. If the file plays, then the codec needed was provided by VLC.

, If VLC won't play your file, you can try downloading a single codec called FFDSHOW (which is also free and open source). FFDSHOW is a codec that can pack and unpack a variety of different media files, so there's a good chance it can handle the decoding for your troublesome AVI file. Simply download the codec and double-click the executable file to begin the installation wizard.

, A codec pack is exactly what it sounds like: a package containing hundreds of codecs. If you still can't play your AVI file, you can download a codec pack in hopes that 1 of the codecs included will be able to decode your file. This should be treated as a backup plan, however, because it represents a serious waste of system resources; you'll be installing hundreds of codecs that you'll never use. Some popular codec packs are K-Lite Codec Pack, XP Codec Pack, and Cole2K Media Codec Pack.

, If none of the above options work, you can download a program that will attempt to determine which codec was used to encode your AVI file. AVIcodec and Gspot are 2 popular applications for doing this. These applications are not very user-friendly, so consider consulting the associated ""Help"" files to use them properly. An additional difficulty can arise even when you determine what codec you need. You may not be able to find that codec online to download it.

A thick tedious book full of abstract scientific terms is needed to know what each video format means and the details how various video formats are created. But we don’t have to be a scientist in order to make a video conversion, some basic knowledge is enough.
Most video files have at least two different types: the container, and the codec.
A container format is a computer file format that can contain various types of data, compressed in a manner of standardized codecs. The container describes the structure of the file: where the various pieces are stored, how they are interleaved, and which codecs are used by which pieces. It may also specify an audio codec as well as video.
Codec, short for compressor/decompressor, allows you to store the digital music, photos, and movies in the form of compact, manageable files, which can then be opened or decompressed to deliver the original contents. The common video codecs include DivX, XviD, 3ivx, MPEG(MPEG-1,2,3,4), ReadVideo.
A video can be thought of as being made up of numerous snapshots, called frames. Frame rate is the number of still pictures per unit of time of video, and most often expressed in frames per second (fps). Motion pictures shot on film do so at 24 FPS. Both video and audio file resolution is measured in kilobytes per second (kbps) — that is, how many thousands of bytes it takes to store one second of sound or videos. This figure is known as the bitrate. A higher bitrate allows better video quality.
Aspect ratio describes the dimensions of video screens and video picture elements. All popular video formats are rectilinear, and so can be described by a ratio between width and height. The screen aspect ratio of a traditional television screen is 4:3, or about 1.33:1. High definition televisions use an aspect ratio of 16:9, or about 1.78:1. The aspect ratio of a full 35 mm film frame with soundtrack (also known as the Academy ratio) is 1.375:1.
Video is made up of static pictures being flashed before us in rapid succession. When we talk about picture resolution we are referring to the elements, pixels, which make up the pictures. For example, iPod classic video is 320*240.
Finally, theoretically video conversion won’t improve video quality. You shall not expect better quality than source video.;
,


A good video converter is vital to whether you can successfully finish video conversion. There are tons of available Mac video converter applications. Good Mac video conversion software can make you look like a video whiz with minimal effort. Since most video converters are trialware, you can try before purchasing.

,


A lot of the ugly-looking grainy clips you see online are the victims of bad conversion practices. Poorly encoded or converted video can end up looking horrible, which is an eye torture.
To avoid this, you need to make sure you take the correct output settings. Some video converters have provided some convenient way to optimize the output.
Those preloaded profiles cover most our requirements. But you can still modify some parameters according to your specialized requirements. As introduced in Tip 1, you can customize the frame rate, bitrate, video size, aspect ratio, etc., to get best result. For example, you can increase the value of video/audio bitrate to get a higher image/sound quality and for a compressed file you can decrease the value. You can save the customized profile for handier usage and quicker access in the future.

,


Stop thinking video editing requires professional expertise and only Hollywood geek could do it. Most video converters allow you to add a wide variety of eye–popping effects to your videos. You can clip, crop, apply visual effects, and add background music, subtitle and watermark to personalize your movies, transform it into a work of art. Good video converter tool usually provides detailed help information which is easy to understand. Feel free to try out the available editing functions then you will master them.

,


The best way to sharpen your video conversion skill is through practice. You may explore the video converter with different setting and apply more effects. In addition, though understanding everything about video formats just isn’t an option for most, knowing more knowledge will make your video conversion job better. You might want to take a look at some video knowledge websites like Videohelp.com etc. You can share your experience with others and also learn some advanced skills from other people. You may also publish you videos on some websites to show off your accomplishments.

Teddy shows viewers its sleeping and living area.
Teddy shows viewers how it gets dressed every day.
Teddy shows viewers around your room.
Teddy meets other stuffed toys in the room.
Teddy does some teddy bear DIY tutorials, such as how to mend a tear in a bear, how to make a dress for a bear or how to wash a teddy bear.;
, You will need a copy in front of you when filming, so that you can follow it with ease. Include directions for where teddy should stand or move to, whether teddy is to hold or touch anything and any other movements you want teddy to make. If other animals are included, also provide directions on where they are to be placed and what you want them to be doing during the movie.


Will you narrate the movie or will teddy do all the talking? If teddy is going to talk, what sort of a voice does teddy have? Practice teddy's voice before filming, until you're happy with it.
If other animals are included, do they speak as well? You'll need to practice their voices too, or have friends do these.

, You'll need this to splice the different shots together in a neat sequence. Otherwise, you'll be forced to film the whole episode from start to end, trying not to make any mistakes, which is hard to do. Editing opens up lots of opportunities for making a good movie without errors and with added effects.


You can use free or paid video editing programs. Talk to your parents, siblings or friends about this if you're unsure what to do.

, Where will you film? If it's your room, tidy everything up so that viewers don't see piles of clothes or toys all over it. If you need to make props, do this well ahead of filming as you can't just magic these up from nowhere once you begin to make the movie. If you are filming for public distribution, ensure that no personal information is filmed, such as passwords, addresses or identifying items like school clothing logos, etc.


Props might include a bed, dresser, toys, books, clothing, food, etc.

, What will the bear wear in the video? Choose the clothes, keeping in mind what will look good on camera. Avoid patterns that might strobe or be unkind on the eye and be sure to keep a color theme in mind, so that it has a distinct flavor of its own when viewers watch the videos.


Don't forget shoes and accessories such as hats, bows and gloves.

, Follow your script and directions written in that. Film each scene accordingly. As you film, aim to move teddy around in ways that don't reveal your hands or make teddy look jerky. It is probably useful to have a helper by this stage, as filming and moving the bear at the same time is very hard to do.


Decide whether to film silently and dub the voice in or whether to add the voice as you film.
Take it easy. There is no need to rush filming. If you need to take several takes, do so.

, Using appropriate software, edit the scenes to create a smooth and seamless movie that makes sense and contains all the voice and sounds you wish it to have. You may need help from an experienced person at this stage, until you get the hang of it yourself.

, You could upload it to a video site if you want it to be public, or to your blog or website. Get your parent's permission first. Or, simply keep the movies to share with family and friends.

, The more movies you make, the better you'll become at making them.

Make sure you aren't copying someone else's plot––your videos should be entirely your own. Be creative and try to come up with something completely original.


Watch well made ""Littlest Pet Shop"" videos for inspiration. Of course, only be inspired to make your own ideas; don't copy.;
, Will it be comedy, action, romance, etc. Think about the video's main theme. Will your video be about a robbery? A contest?


Think about the ending of the video. Will it be happy or sad? Typically, ""Littlest Pet Shop"" videos will have a happy ending, but it's your video, and your choice.

, This step is optional. Some people are good at improvisation but others need scripts. If you have trouble remembering your LPS's names, this is probably a good idea. You can type your script on your computer and then print it. Or you can write on some paper. Or you can type into the notes on either your phone or iPod.


If you want to have a flawless performance in your ""Littlest Pet Shop"" video, know every single word that you're planning to say. First, list all the characters that are going to be in your video, and name each role they are going to play. To get this done fast, get out all the Littlest Pet Shop characters you have, and line them up in front of you. Use this line-up to inspire your script writing.
Make sure the script is well organized, and that every word you plan for each character to say is located in the correct position.
Improvisation is also useful, you can combine it with a script.

, You don't need to make an elaborate video to get a bunch of wows and oohs! Simple is great, as long as your idea is cool and your own. Every great video-maker has to start simple in the beginning!

, It can be your bedroom, living room, spare room, anywhere just make sure there's no background noise. That way, people can actually hear what you're saying rather than hearing your sibling bickering or playing.

, Film on a desk or table to prevent shaky camera movements. Position your camera on a tripod or flat, sturdy surface for better stability.


Make sure that the frame contains the area you wish to focus on, and that the whole scene can be seen clearly.
It would be wise to press the record button, and run a test video to make sure that your camera is in the exact position you want it to be.

, Some people think lighting doesn't matter, but it does. A good idea for lighting is if it's daytime, maybe film near your window to get good lighting, but don't have the window in the background!


If it's too dark with no light, use a lamp.
If it's too bright in the video, try turning off some lights.
Film during the day, when it's sunny outside.

, Use props from other toys or make your own. For instance, if your LPS is supposed to be in a forest then make trees and bushes out of cardboard, or go outside and pick up a few fallen leaves.

, If you are uploading your video to YouTube, then you will need a nice solid background. For example, against a wall, a door etc. Having stuff in the background like chairs, boxes and extra toys wouldn't be the best idea if you're trying to get a lot of views. This is because the stuff in the background like pictures is distracting and the viewers could be trying to see what picture was on the wall than what you were doing.


On a scene with windows, stick pictures of towns, hills, forests, etc., so that it hides the room background.

, This includes things the pets are walking on, holding, eating from or looking at.


This includes costumes. For example, make a zombie costume by taping pieces of ripped toilet paper stained red with markers on an LPS pet.

, Choose a few main LPS for your video. Make sure you know all their names so there's not a big, long pause in your video where you're trying to remember one of your LPS's names. However, this may be a difficult step for some people if they have a lot of LPS and are very particular about which pets they choose for a video. So take your time! There is no pressure, as you can start filming any time you want. It is your video after all!

, It is helpful to a lot of people to do it before you start to record the actual thing. For example, while your video editor is loading the scene, act out the next scene to pass time. Then you will have more time to edit the scene and your video quality will become better.


Practicing with the characters beforehand helps you to be familiar with the whole show, and the chances of you stumbling through the video will be lowered. You don't necessarily have to have the script completely memorized, although having a basic knowledge of what is going to happen next in the video is very important. You don't want to get mixed up in the middle of recording!

, If possible, shut the door to block out any sounds your family makes. If this is not possible, politely ask your parents to remain as quiet as possible during your recording session. If you have a sibling, ask him or her to also remain quiet, and request that your parents make sure the sibling keeps quiet. However, if you do not ask in a nice tone, your parents and/or sibling may refuse to keep quiet!


If you plan to have music playing in the background while recording, make sure it is loud enough for the camera to hear. It is recommended you play the music next to the camera so that the camera will record it as well. However, be sure you do not have the music turned up so high that no one is able to hear you speaking!

, Get a camera, camcorder, or other device that can film, and film your video.

, Flip through the script to make sure that all the pages are in the correct order (numbering them would be good if you accidentally drop the pages in the middle of the video). It is best that you place the script out of the camera's view, but clearly in yours.

, It is a good idea to keep a bottle of water nearby in case you need to drink something, but make sure the camera cannot see the water.


Try not to place water near the camera, as it may spill onto it and damage it.
Drinking noisily will cause viewers to be not able to hear you.

, All you have to do is press record, say a line, press stop, move your camera, press record, say a line, press stop, etc. .


Make sure you press the record button firmly so that you are certain the camera is recording, for if you press it too gently, it may not receive the command to record. It is best to quickly and quietly check the screen to make sure that the camera is actually recording.
You can film from different angles.

, Just record a clip at a time. For example, if the first line in your video is the LPS saying ""Hi there!"", record the LPS saying ""Hi there"", plus any other lines you want him/her to say. Then stop recording, and do the next clip, and so on.


Stop motion is also a good idea.This can make LPS characters more realistic (in a way). Don't do it if you don't have a lot of time on your hands because stop motion requires a lot of work.
When your LPS is talking, make its head move to every word's syllable. For example, the word 'chicken' has two syllables, so when you make the pet say this word, move its head twice.

, Don't put your fingers over the Little Pet Shop's face otherwise the viewers will get irritated by the lack of connection. For example, avoid gaffes such as: ""I love your eyes, Sparkle,"" but filming so that the viewers only see fingernails and not the LPS's eyes.

, Now you have your footage, you need to edit. Use an editing software to put all the clips together, add special effects, and maybe some background music. Free trial video editors include VideoPad, Sony Vegas, Pinnacle Studios, AVS Video Editor, iMovie, and so on. Always ask your parents first. Research video tutorials if you have no idea at all how to do this. Each video editor has its own process.


If you have a long movie, removing unnecessary parts is recommended.

, It'll make a big difference. Sometimes, it blocks out some background noises, (dog barking, etc.). If there is a noise in the background, just reshoot the clip. It looks and sounds more professional.


Add sound effects if you can/need to. Just don't make it too loud or it will overpower the video.
If you add little animations, try not to add too many, as excessive use of animations can annoy viewers.

, Redo clips if you think it necessary. Save the clips that didn't work as a blooper. Everyone loves seeing those.

, Even if you make many more videos, you will regret not having the early ones that made your brand. If you want to take it further, publish it online. Save them onto your computer first, then publish (see next).

, If you are making a series, a good way to capture people's attention is to make a trailer first. A way to do this is to film your first episode and then take clips from that to make a trailer.


Make sure you use a good title so people can find your video easily. If you start with Littlest Pet Shop or LPS, when fans search those word they will find your video.

, Your video is ready to be uploaded. Go to YouTube or any other video account you prefer. Click the upload button. Choose your video and then type in a description, title, tags etc. Let your video upload and watch as your views stack up.


Make sure to give credit to any music that you've used in your movie, and - most importantly - give credit to the ""Littlest Pet Shop"" makers.

Decide how much you want to spend and what type of green screen you want; either hard or soft.,
To create a hard green screen, simply paint a solid material (balsa wood or cardboard) green and still get the same outcome.,
To create a soft screen, buy light, bright green material from a sewing or crafts shop.,
When you hang the screen (if you choose the soft option), there are several ways that you can do this.,
If you want your screen to be mobile, you will need two frames such as hat stands.,
When traveling with your screen, ensure that you roll it up rather than folding it, otherwise you'll get creases which will upset the consistency of the colour.,
Provide lighting.",How to Make a Green Screen for Shooting Video,";
, Or, you can paint a smooth wall.

, Make sure the material isn't light weighted or transparent as it will disrupt colour when the lights are on it.


There is no recommended size - just as long as it completely fills the screen

,


The first, you can tack it to a wall.
Second, attach a curtain rod to a wall and hang the screen from that. Remember, if you do this, you will need to make sure a strip drapes along the floor so that you can weigh it down with heavy objects.

, Prop the curtain rod up across the frames and hang the screen from that. Again, let a strip hang along the floor and weigh it down.

,


To roll it up evenly and tightly, roll it around a hard/heavy cylindrical object with a diameter or about 2-4"".

, You'll also need to light the screen differently on your subjects. Your best bet would be to set up a 500-300w light at each vertical side pointing inwards and then two spaced evenly apart along the bottom pointing up (these should be 100-250w).

Check your surroundings before you begin making your video.,
Pretend you are a celebrity and create a nickname and signature look.,
Ask friends and family members not to tag your videos with your real name or location.,
Carefully review each video you create before you upload and after it goes live.,
Share your video with a close personal friend, or a relative, using a private link, before you make it viewable to the public.,
Disguise your friends before you create your video.",How to Keep Personally Identifying Information from Appearing in Your Videos," To prevent potentially dangerous strangers from learning too much about you and your location, ensure that your surroundings give no indication of your specific location. For instance, if you want to make a video of yourself conducting an interview of a fellow student at school, make sure that you are not standing directly in front of a sign with your school name or logo emblazoned on it. Predators can easily look your school up, by logo or name, and you likely won't enjoy meeting this sort of admirer.


Things to look for in your surroundings include: vehicle license plates, park signs, buildings or open air art unique to your location, street signs, etc.;
, Add a conspicuous mole (or even a tattoo) to your face, sport tinted glasses, or wear a hat or cap that changes your look dramatically. Introduce yourself using a nickname that suits your video persona. Change your persona to best suit each video you create; the constantly changing appearance will make it more difficult for predators to identify you in person, and keep you interested in producing new entertainment for others to enjoy, safely.

, Excited friends and family members may be tempted to let the whole world know they know and adore you, so remind them that adding personally identifying information to your videos creates potential danger for you, and ask that they help you stay safe online.

, Checking each of your videos twice can prevent an inadvertent slip-up from compromising your safety. Look and listen for: any mention of your real name, or a sibling or parent's name, and any personally identifying information that might be visible in the background of your video. If you find something that you wouldn't be comfortable sharing with a potentially dangerous stranger, pull the video back into an editing program and make some adjustments.

, A friend or family member will likely spot any personally identifying information (or inadvertent location identification) you may have overlooked.

, Videos made with friends can be wildly entertaining. Make sure each of you has a nickname and a look that suits the topic of your video before you begin. Disguising each of the video participants will ensure that your safety is not compromised should they create their own videos for the internet without taking steps to ensure their personal privacy. If your video is already complete, change everyone's appearance at once by changing the color tone of your video to black and white.

If the text is there regardless of the button, it is part of the video’s picture itself, and can’t be downloaded separately. In this case, follow Method 1.

, This will typically be an open text field next to a button. On KeepVid, this is a white field with text that starts with, “enter the link,” next to a gray button that reads “Download”. On ClipConverter, The field is gray and black with no text, next to a black button that reads “Continue”.

, Modern video downloaders typically let you choose from a variety of video qualities and formats. Typical formats include mp4, AVI, and FLV.


On ClipConverter, these appear directly beneath the URL field, under the heading “Conversion Format:”. Once you click continue, you will have the option to choose video quality, then clicking “Start” will begin the conversion process and change over to the download screen.
On KeepVid, the options appear after you enter your link and click “Download”. The different quality and format options appear as a list of individual links.

, The video will be saved in your downloads folder by default, but if you right click the link, then click “Save As”, you can download the video anywhere you like, as well as rename it if you wish. Because the subtitles are part of the video, they will appear regardless of the format or quality.

DownSub is one example of a dedicated site, but KeepVid also offers this function. Before picking a download method, click the white box labeled “CC” near the bottom right corner of the video you want to download. If the text you want appears or disappears, it is either added or generated text. It can be downloaded separately from the video sound and picture. Use Method 2 to do so.

, On DownSub, this is a white field containing text that starts with, “Enter the link,” next to a blue button that reads “Download”.

, The files this generates will be SRT files. These files are text files with coded time signatures, telling videos what to display and when to display them. You will need an SRT-enabled video player in order to view the subtitles.


In DownSub, after you enter the URL and click “submit”, you will be given a series of “Download” links, each next to a language label, either the original language or a translation.
To download SRT files from KeepVid, go all the way to the bottom of the list of file format options it gives you after you submit the URL. You will be able to pick subtitles from the original language or from several languages of translated subtitles.
Note that substantial inaccuracies are frequent in automatically generated YouTube subtitles. If you have trouble understanding what someone is saying in your language, automatically generated subtitles aren’t likely to be much help. They can still be of help to the hearing impaired, or for foreign languages.

, This can be found through Google., Something that your computer does that frustrates you generally works. Having the Angry German Kid do a regular everyday task, but with a few minor inconveniences works well too., These can often be found on YouTube. The video should be shot from the first person view. If the Angry German Kid is operating a computer program or visiting a website, try to capture screenshots of the program or website on your own computer using a program such as CamStudio., A Blue Screen of Death occurs in almost every Angry German Kid video and you will most likely need one. One can be found by searching for blue screen of death in Google Images., Import the clip you acquired in the first step into your video editing program. Windows Movie Maker will work for this, although you may experience difficulty getting the subtitles the right length., The Angry German Kid is extremely controversial and many viewers will leave comments that the actor needs mental help and that your translation is incorrect. Insert a message along the lines of the following:

ATTENTION: The subtitles here are incorrect on purpose for humorous purposes. Everyone knows that they are wrong and that the real translation can be found by searching for ""angry German kid correct translation"". Do not post comments stating that the subtitles are wrong and that he is actually playing Unreal Tournament, either because you speak German or you have seen the real translation. Furthermore, do not post comments saying that the Angry German Kid has mental problems or needs help that ""can't be acquired from the Help and Support Center"". He is a very talented actor who simply wishes to entertain people. Also, it is not true that his father secretly videotaped him while he was on the computer to send the recording to a mental hospital. This was made up by the German media. Comments mentioning this will be deleted.

The message may take up more than one screen if necessary.



, The Angry German Kid video starts off with the Angry German Kid arriving at his computer and shouting at it to turn on. For this part, it is best to write something along the lines of Come on computer! Load up!. Then, the Angry German Kid should say what he wants the computer to do (e.g Load up Internet Explorer! or Start up the Pinball game! so the viewer understands what the video is about., There should then be a screenshot of the program that he has launched if you were able to acquire one. Following this, the Angry German Kid is now excited and his excitement shows. The Angry German Kid should make progress in whatever task he is doing, building up to the climax., The Angry German Kid video contains two parts of keyboard smashing: a short part when the Angry German Kid encounters a minor error but fixes it with ""positive thinking, and a major part in which the Angry German Kid severely damages his keyboard and leaves."" For the former, you should create a minor error that the Angry German Kid quickly fixes., The second part of keyboard smashing occurs at the end of the video when the Angry German Kid leaves. A major error should take place here. The major error is commonly a Blue Screen of Death. The Angry German Kid should then make some comments about Bill Gates before leaving., Export your video and upload it to a video hosting website such as YouTube., The warning that you added to the actual video is not enough.

Open the program.,
Create your title page.,
Add slides.,
Add finishing touches.,
Do a practice run.",How to Create a Slideshow2," This guide assumes that you will be using Microsoft PowerPoint, since it's the most commonly used software for making slideshows. You will see a blank slide with title and text prompts in separate text fields on it, plus various menus and buttons.

, Click in the upper text field and name your presentation, then add your name and today's date in the lower text field. This is also a good chance to get used to changing stylistic elements on your slideshow, like background color and font.


Choose a short title. Unless you're making a high-level academic presentation intended for a conference, it is better to think of a short, straightforward title that explains your general topic to the audience quickly.
Use a simple font. Visually complex fonts, such as “old English” fonts and puffy letters, are fun to look at on a computer screen, but hard for an audience to read. Feel free to experiment, but settle on a simple font with clean lines so that your audience won't have to squint to read it.

You can change fonts by choosing them from the drop-down menu along the top of the screen. If you have text highlighted when you change fonts, that text will change to the selected font.


Experiment with color. Your title page can have a different background color than the rest of your presentation, but most people choose one theme for the entire slideshow.

Right-click the background of the slide and choose the “slide background” or “format background” option from the menu that pops up. From there, you can play with the color as you like.
Be sure that your background color and text color pop from each other so that the slide is easy to read. Generally speaking, text should be black or white for maximum readability, and backgrounds should not be neon or extremely bright.

There is nothing wrong with a plain-looking slideshow for business or academic purposes; in fact, simpler is generally considered better in these environments.





, You can type control-m to add a slide to your slideshow, or you can choose the “new slide” option from the top of the screen. Try to keep your pacing to one idea or point per slide so that it's easy to follow.


Add layouts. Each slide has a large number of preset layout options, so choose the one that's best for each slide.

Most slides without pictures can use one of the two basic text slide layouts. One has a title bar, the other is simply a text field. Choose whichever one you prefer.
Choosing a slide layout designed to accommodate pictures, movies, or sound files is the easiest way to insert them. Simply choose the field you want to add a file to, click the icon that represents the type of file you want, and add it by selecting it from the window that pops up.

Try adding text in one field and a picture in another field for a professional look.
Don't go overboard on images, movies, or sounds. Less is more, in most cases.




Clean up. You can delete extra slides by right-clicking on them and choosing “delete slide.”
Organize. You can reorder slides by dragging them along the timeline and inserting them in the appropriate spots. The timeline is the overview list of your slides along the top or side of the screen.

, There are a few more things you can do to complete your slideshow project. Once you're satisfied, save it so that you can be sure you'll still have it when it's time to use it.


Be wary of transitions. PowerPoint and most similar programs come preloaded with a wide array of slide transitions. These are visual effects, sometimes accompanied by sounds, that occur when switching between slides. They're generally seen as tacky and distracting, but may be appropriate in some cases.

Never use sound effects with your transitions. They get in the way of your speech.
Use simple transitions rather than fancy ones. A page wipe from top to bottom is fancy enough; there's no need to use silly shapes or gradient effects.
Use transitions sparingly. Even if you've decided transitions are a useful element for your slideshow, avoid applying a transition to every slide. Instead, use them to denote different sections of your show, once per section.


Add sources and legal information. After your slideshow, add one more slide (or as many as are needed) where you briefly list all your information sources (for business or academic slideshows), image sources (if copyrighted), and any thanks or acknowledgments you wish to include.

, Typically, you can run the slideshow by pushing the F5 key on your computer. You can advance slides by clicking the left mouse button. Exit the show by pushing the Esc key at any time, or reaching the end of the slideshow and clicking again.


Go back and make any last-minute adjustments that need to be made. Watching your slideshow before you plan to use it can often reveal typos and other small errors you missed during creation.
Speak along with your slideshow. Make sure that the slideshow is streamlined enough so that it doesn't steal your thunder, but detailed enough that you don't run out of slides halfway through your speech. Practice timing your slide changes until you feel comfortable.

"
"
Create an outline.,
Use a simple theme.,
Add media as needed.",How to Create a Slideshow3," If you're making a slideshow for a school presentation, chances are you'll be providing a speech or lecture to go along with it. Kill two birds with one stone by starting with a clear outline for your presentation.


There are many ways to make an outline. The standard method uses indentation and a numbering/lettering system to organize information by level of importance, but feel free to use your own approach if you prefer.
Your speech will be more detailed than your outline, but your slideshow will be less detailed. Once you've got an outline ready, mark every major point, as well as every point at which you would like to have a picture or other multimedia element to serve as accompaniment. Plan to make a slide for each mark.

Use index cards or an outline for your speech. Don't use your slideshow as your guide, or you'll have to keep glancing at it, which looks unprofessional.



, Avoid bright colors, and stick to sans-serif fonts, like Arial, for titles and subtitles.


Black on white and white on black are the two least irritating color combinations for a slideshow presentation. They are easy to read and not distracting.

Neutral blue and gray shades with black or white text are also acceptable.
Avoid warm colors and clashing colors, as well as colors that are too similar to one another.


Serif fonts (such as Times New Roman) are acceptable for regular (non-titling) text, especially if many of your points will be longer than one line on the page. Whichever you choose, be sure to be consistent throughout the slideshow.

, Only add movies and music if they are directly appropriate to your topic, and keep them as short as possible. Pictures should be added when appropriate.


30 seconds is a good target length for movie and music files. You shouldn't let your media make your speech for you. Using longer videos and songs will get you a lower grade, because it'll seem like you're just trying to fill in a short speech so it hits the required minimum time.
There are two good ways to add pictures:

Add one picture per slide to slides that require text alongside the picture. Keep it reasonably sized and relevant to the slide.
Add up to four pictures per slide if the slide has no text, but only for the purpose of illustrating examples of something. This slide will be short; only flash it for a few seconds in your presentation and be sure to talk over it.
An image on the title page may also be appropriate, depending on the topic of your slideshow, but it isn't necessary to a good slideshow.



"
"
Use a tight format.,
Keep non-text elements to a minimum.,
Match your speech to your slideshow.,
End with a point.",How to Create a Slideshow4," Everyone who is viewing your slideshow is getting paid for their time. Most of them would probably rather be earning their money doing something other than watching your presentation, so make it short, punchy, and straight to the point.


Keep it brief. Unless instructed to hit a certain target length by your boss, make your presentation as short as possible. Don't spend a lot of time on illustrative examples beyond what you think is necessary to get your point across.

Prepare handouts for your audience so that you don't have to cover every small detail in your presentation. Put in-depth information in the handout, and use the slideshow and presentation time for painting the big picture.



, Charts and graphs are fine, where necessary, but other graphics should be simple and unobtrusive.


Consider using clip art. Clip art is a stock of simple, black-and-white images that are not copyrighted. Nearly every slideshow program comes with a limited clip art library. The simplicity of clip art makes it an ideal choice for accenting slides with graphical elements while avoiding a lot of clutter and visual noise.
Don't ever use movies or music in a business presentation unless you have an ironclad reason for doing so.
Don't use slide transitions. Nobody in your audience cares about them, which means they're just a waste of time.

, More so than in other environments, a business slideshow and its accompanying speech should be nearly identical in terms of substantive content. Aside from a brief introduction and connecting phrases, your speech should more or less follow the slideshow point for point.


Use handouts to your advantage. If you prepared a handout, as recommended above, tell people to refer to certain sections of it as you give your speech. They'll be able to easily get more information without you having to cram it into the slideshow.

, As opposed to an academic slideshow, the end of your business presentation isn't a simple conclusion; it's a clear and bold call to action, an imperative statement that is supported by your presentation rather than an educated opinion that is explained by it. This difference in tone is all-important in getting people to take your presentation seriously.

"
"
Choose a theme.,
Get your pictures.,
Add multimedia.,
Add whatever transitions you want.,
Review your slideshow.",How to Create a Slideshow5," Pick anything you want. Many people make slideshows out of family vacations, reunions, or other shared experiences. You could also choose to explore a favorite hobby or sport.


Add structure. You certainly don't have to have a clear structure for a slideshow you're making for your own enjoyment, but if you'd like to make a statement about something or present information you've learned, it helps.

Think about the way you would naturally explain your slides to a friend, and then organize them to reflect that.



, One of the best parts of making a slideshow for fun is that you can pretty much do whatever you want with it. For most people, that means a lot of pictures. Download them from the Internet or use your own photographs, as you like.


If you're using images that might be copyrighted, be cautious. Most people aren't going to hunt you down and sue you for making a “Day at the Beach” family slideshow with a copyrighted image of a beach ball and uploading it to YouTube, but use common sense.

Give credit at the end of the slideshow whenever you can find the appropriate information.
Don't use any images that are marked with the words “do not reuse without permission” or anything similar.



, Insert whatever sound and video clips you want. Go wild; this is your personal project.


Again, be careful when using clearly copyrighted material. Try to keep clips short, and give credit where it's due.

, Yes, they're tacky. They're also kind of fun, especially with the sound effects turned on. If you feel like loading up your slideshow with cheesy transition effects, go right ahead.

, Even though you made it for your own benefit, you should check it before you show it to anyone else.


Be sure the color schemes you are using don't hurt your eyes.
Check to make sure the slides are all in the order you want them to be in.
Add captions to images if it makes sense, so you don't have to explain every picture.

, There are real people working to create products or to reach out and talk to consumers and clients. Let your audience know who is working for you. Allow employees to share their take on the company and their individual vision and how it relates to the company. Including employees from different divisions/offices shows how far your company reaches out.

, Give a face to the name. Let the audience see who is in charge of the corporation, whether it’s a fresh clip or one taken from previous interviews.

, If an employee has been featured in an interview or the CEO has been on TV, show that footage to show that your company gets out there and is involved. Even footage during events or meeting other brands is important.

, Try not to stray from the point. With or without narrative, don’t fill the video with fluff. Whether it’s short or long, make sure the details of your company are being discussed in an impactful but brief way.

, Flashing logos of different partners, placing the business’ starting year in the corner, showing clips from important events or projects—whatever shows your company’s versatility and efficiency should be interesting and added into the video.

, If the typical narrative isn’t your fancy or if you’re just not down with the flying logos and spinning text, you can also try some interesting alternatives that aren’t quite as serious and are more personal.



Why do we work here? A video that talks with the employees and gives them a chance to say why they love their jobs. What about your business keeps them where they are and why they love doing what they do.

Understand how compression works.,
Learn the terms.",How to Compress Video1," Video is typically filmed with 24 or 30 frames per second. That means that every second, 24 or 30 still images are displayed to give the illusion of movement. Because the images are so closely linked, not everything in the image moves from frame to frame. Compression stores the changes in the frames as opposed to storing entire frames.;
, There are several key terms that you will come across constantly as you start compressing more videos. Learning these terms will help you make sense of the options you have while compressing a video.


Codec – This is a method that your computer uses to decide on the amount of change that occurs between frames.
Keyframe – This is a reference frame. The codec will determine a keyframe every few frames. This is the base frame for the next few frames of change. Your keyframe interval will have a large impact on the size of your finished file. Lots of keyframes will make the file large but higher quality. Infrequent keyframes will leave lots of artifacts.
Artifacts - These are blocky pieces of image that are the result of the keyframe not being updated correctly. The lower the quality of the compression, the more artifacts that will appear.
Bit/data rate - This is the amount of data that each second of video uses. Typically, this is measured in kilobits per second. Bit rates can be either Constant or Variable. A constant bit rate stays the same throughout the video, which can lead to larger video files. A variable bit rate changes depending on the amount of action on the screen, which will lead to smaller files.
Variable bit rates can decrease quality if the bit rate does not change dynamically enough with the video. Experiment with both bit rates to find a balance between size and acceptable quality.
Frame rate – this is the number of frames per second. Videos are typically shot in 24 or 30 frames per second. Keep the compressed copy’s frame rate the same otherwise playback will be affected and audio may not sync properly.
Resolution – This is the size of the outputted video. It is measured in pixels, width x height.

Understand why you need to compress.,
Open your raw video file in a video editing program.,

Select the file format.,
Select the video format (codec).,
Select the bit rate.,
Select resolution (image size).,
Adjust the keyframe and frame rate.,
Select encoding mode.,
Set your audio options.",How to Compress Video2," Raw video files, especially HD video, can run several gigabytes in size. While you can upload large files to YouTube and Vimeo, this can take a very long time. Also, these services will compress your file once it is uploaded, and often the results are not very high quality. Compressing your video yourself allows you to control both the size and the quality.

, There are free solutions available online, as well as professional products such as After Effects, Final Cut, and more. The specific menus will vary between programs, but the settings are universal across all programs.

, In order to start the compression process, you will need to export the video. This will convert the video into a format that is playable on all systems and devices, including formats supported by YouTube and Vimeo.

, The file format will change depending on what you plan on doing with the final file. Most systems and devices will play MP4 files, making it the most universally accepted file type. This includes game systems like the PlayStation 3.

, H.264 is the most widely used codec and is supported by the most systems. This is the preferred codec for uploading videos to be streamed online. HD video should be encoded in High Profile H.246.

, For SD video, use a bit rate between 2,000-5,000 kbps. 720p video should have a bit rate between 5,000-10,000 kbps. 1080p video should have a bit rate of 10,000-20,000 kbps.

, Try to keep it the same as your raw video. Streaming websites will add in their own resolution options after the uploading process.

, Encode your video in the same frame rate that you recorded it in. If you recorded above 30 frames per second, encode in half that (for example, a 60 FPS video would be encoded at 30 FPS). Keep the keyframe the same as the frame rate.

, In general, go for multi-pas (Best) encoding. This will take longer than a single-pass, but will result in a noticeably higher-quality video.

, Choose AAC-LC as the audio format, as this has the widest support and the best quality. For data rate, select 320 kbps. If you have music, choose Stereo. If you do not have music, select Mono. Your output sample rate should be 48.000 kHz

, You will be given three quality options when you export your movie. You can pick between Wi-Fi, Cellular, or Web. Choose the format that best suits the the method that you will be playing back the video.


Cellular will provide the smallest size and the lowest quality. Use this if you will be watching the movie on a phone or tablet.
Wi-Fi will provide medium quality and medium compression size. Use this if you will be streaming the video file over your home wireless network.
Broadband will provide the highest quality compression, but will result in a file that is not much smaller than the original. Use this option when uploading a video to be streamed online.

You can also choose to just extract the audio in the Setting menu.

, Adjust the slider in the Compressor section to adjust the final quality. Lower quality will mean a smaller file, but will have more artifacts in the final compression. Best quality will result in very little change in the file size, but will give the highest picture quality.


Select “Best quality (Multi-pass)” to produce the highest quality compression. This will result in a much longer encoding process. If time is an issue, run “Faster encode (Single-pass)”, though this will result in a poorer quality final product.

, Click the Options button and then click Sound Settings. In this window, select AAC as the format to make sure that most devices can play the audio. If the video has music, set Channels to Stereo. If the video does not have music, or does not utilize surround sound, select Mono. Mono will lead to a smaller file size.

But you have to be unique and true to yourself. Don't be a copycat - don't do what everyone else does.;

Consider Context.,
Evaluate Cost.",How to Choose a Projector Lens," A lens (derived from the Latin word for ""lentil"") is a transparent piece of glass with one or two curved surfaces. A lens uses refraction to bend rays of light as they pass through the lens. This refraction is what causes images to appear larger or smaller than they truly are.;
, What is the environment like? It is broad and spacious, or close quarters? Will you be able to position the projector directly in front of the screen, or will you need to put it at an angle?

, The more lenses you choose, the greater your investment. Can you rent a lens to try it out? How often will you need a particular kind of lens? What kind of maintenance, upkeep and storage are required for additional lenses?

Enable the subtitles.,
Enable two passes for the encode.,
Start encoding.",How to Add Subtitles to a Downloaded Video1," Make sure that the subtitle file has the exact same name as the video file. For example, if the video file is called “MyMovie.mp4”, the subtitle file should be called “MyMovie” plus the extension, which may be .srt, .ssa, or some other subtitle format. Both of these files should be in the same location on your computer.;
, There are a large variety of video conversion and encoding programs available online, and most can hardcode subtitles without too much difficulty. One of the most powerful and popular solutions is to use TEncoder, which is an open-source video encoder available for free download.

, Click the Add File button at the top of the TEncoder window to select the movie file that you want to add subtitles to.

, Below the file list, you will find several conversions options that need to be set before you can continue. Most of these options can be left to their default settings. You can change each of the options to suit the needs of your project, but to simply add subtitles to your video, nothing needs to be changed.


If you want to change the format of the converted file, choose a new format from the Video Codec list. If you want to keep it the same format, select Copy from them list.
If you want to lower the quality of the video to speed up the encoding process, choose a lower Video Bitrate. Setting this lower than the default can result in a noticeable reduction in quality.

, In the Other Options section, check the box labeled “Enabled subtitles”. Your subtitle file MUST be in the same folder as the video, and MUST have the same filename, otherwise the subtitles won’t load.

, If you want the final video to have a higher quality, then check the box labeled “Do two passes”. This will essentially run the encoding process twice, resulting in a higher quality file. The encoding process will take about twice as long as normal.

, Once you have your options all configured, click the Encode button to start the process. This can take a significant amount of time if you have a slow computer, so start the encoding when you know you won’t need to use your computer for a few hours.Longer videos and higher quality processing will take much longer than lower quality settings.

, A ""Lossless"" file (eg. a WAVE file) will have the best possible quality sound, but will also have a much larger file size. In addition, a ""Lossless"" file will be created more quickly due to the fact that no compression needs to be performed, which means that the computer needs to do much less work. For most uses, however, a ""Lossy"" file (eg. an MP3 file) will be sufficient. While they do take more time to output, they are a great deal smaller and more portable, and can still have excellent sound quality.

, Browse for the folder where you would like to save your WAVE file, choose a suitable file name (making sure that it ends in .wav) and hit ""Save"". Alternatively, you can adjust the default WAVE settings by clicking on the ""Setting"" button next to the ""Audio"" field near the bottom and choosing from the options available in the ""Attributes"" dropdown box (leave ""Format"" on PCM).

, Browse for the folder where you would like to save your MP3 file and then click on the ""Setting"" button next to the ""Audio"" field near the bottom. Change the ""Format"" to ""MPEG Layer-3"". You may wish to adjust the quality of your MP3 file by choosing the sampling rate from the ""Attributes"" dropdown box, or you can leave it on the default setting, which should be just fine for most uses. When you are happy with the settings, hit ""OK"" and then save the file. IMPORTANT: Make sure that your file ends in .mp3.

Turn on your outputs.,
Check your sound.,
Check your monitors.",How to Set Up a Sound Board," This is important because sound volume decreases as you get further away from the source of the sound and the way that sound reflects off surfaces in the room; you want to be in a place where you are far enough away from the speakers that you don't have sound blasting directly in your face all night, but close enough that you don't end up turning the mix up way too loud because you can't hear it at the back of the room. You will also need to consider the length of your mic cables and the location of the electrical outlets in the room.;
,, Connect cables from the 'Output' jacks on the power amp to the 'Input' jacks on your speakers. Note: If you have powered speakers (speakers that have a power amp built into them) you can treat all references to power amps as referring to the speakers themselves, as the amp and speaker are already connected.

, Connect cables from the 'Main Out' jacks on the mixer to the 'Input' jacks for your power amp (or powered speakers).

, If you have monitor speakers on stage for the musicians to hear themselves connect cables from the 'Auxiliary Output' jacks (nearly always labeled 'Aux Out') on the sound board to the input on the power amp for your monitors. Note: Most sound boards have more than one auxiliary output so make sure to keep track of which ones you use for which amp/speaker.

, Set up your microphones and stands as needed, along with any DI (direct Input) boxes you need for instruments to plug directly into the PA system (such as an acoustic guitar, or a keyboard).

, Write down a numbered list of each mic or DI box on the stage, from left to right when standing at the desk. For example: 1. Guitar DI 2. Keyboard DI 3. Kim's Vocal Mic.

, Take a strip of painter's tape and place it on the sound board just below the faders, use a marker to copy your input list on to the tape so that each fader has one item under it (you may have to use abbreviations in order to fit these labels in the space under each fader, write ""Vox"" instead of ""Vocal Mic"" for example).

, Connect your mic cables to each mic and DI box using your Input List from step 7 as a guide, in our previous example you would connect a cable from 'Input 1' on the sound board to the DI box for the guitar 'Input 2' connects to the keyboard DI and so on. Note: Many small format sound boards allow you to connect a 1/4"" instrument cable directly to the mixer without the need for a DI box. This jack would be labeled 'Line In' not to be confused with a jack labeled 'Inst' which would stand for 'Insert Point' not instrument.

, Make sure all of your faders are down as well as your auxiliary sends and 'Gain' or 'Trim' controls on each channel, if the sound board has 'bus assignment' controls make sure that the 'Main Mix' button for each channel is pressed down and all other bus assignments are up.

,, Bring the 'Master Fader' up as well as the master controls for any auxiliary sends you are using. You don't want to bring these controls all the way up, if there is a '0' or 'unity' mark next to your master fader start with it just below that.

, Have somebody speak into one of your microphones while you very slowly move that microphone's corresponding fader up. If the fader is up and the volume is too quiet, slowly raise the 'Gain' or 'Trim' control for that channel until you are satisfied with the volume. Do the same for each microphone and DI box until you have verified that everything is working.

, While someone is speaking into a vocal mic slowly raise the Auxiliary Send control on that channel for the auxiliary send to which you've connected your monitors ('Aux 1' probably) and have them let you know when they can hear themselves through the monitor speakers. Generally the volume of the monitors should be determined by the musicians as they are the ones listening to them.

Get to work on your next mixtape.",How to Release a Mixtape," The best mixtapes have a theme or concept that runs throughout, including the cover art. If your mixtape has direction, as opposed to being a collection of random tracks, your listeners will get more out of it.;
, A mixtape is supposed to build hype and word-of-mouth for you, so you want to ensure that your fans will hear something new. At the same time, you don't want to give away all of your new material for free.


Avoid reusing songs that you’ve already used on a previous mixtape. This will strike dedicated listeners as lazy. The only time you should be re-releasing songs is if you’ve done a significant remix.

, If you aren’t comfortable making your own beats, or don’t have anyone who can help you with it, there are thousands upon thousands of beats available online. Anything from instrumental versions of your favorite songs to commissioned tracks from up-and-coming internet producers, the options are nearly limitless., While it's pretty popular to record over another musician's track, not everyone wants to hear the same tired beats over and over. Try to keep things original. Your audience will appreciate your talent even more as a side-effect.


There's still plenty of room for rapping over someone else's beats. Artists like Drake and Lil Wayne have shown that smart sampling and lyrical skill can propel you to incredible heights. The key is to let your skills shine over the sample, or to use it in a unique or inspiring way.
Since you're not making any money off of your mixtape, you usually don't have to worry about copyright issues. Just make sure that you're not using the same overplayed sounds that everyone else is using.
Since a mixtape isn't released commercially, it can be your chance to use samples that would never clear for an album. The Beatles, James Brown, Steely Dan, Pink Floyd, and many other artists are notoriously difficult to get sample clearance from, but feel free to drop them on your mixtape., If you want to really sound professional, have a DJ/Producer friend cook up some tracks for you to rap over. Not only does it give you exposure and unique beats, it gives the DJ exposure as well. Who knows, you may even find a musical partner.

, Make sure you have a good microphone and some decent mixing software or hardware. A basic setup won't set you back too much and can do wonders for your sound.


See this guide for details on setting up a home recording studio for cheap.

, A good mixtape needs some striking art on the cover. If all else fails, a shot of yourself will suffice and work to solidify your brand. While you might think your mixtape is all about the music, many people pick up mixtapes based solely on the cover art. Make sure yours is striking!


Avoid plastering your cover with logos and URLs. Stick your website and contact information in the liner.

, DJs control the music scene. They decide what sounds good and what will appeal to their listeners. You want to get your mixtape into the hands of as many DJs as possible, whether they’re on the radio or spinning at the local club. If a DJ decides you song is hot, you’ll reach way more ears.


Many club DJs offer pay-for-play services. Find your local DJs’ promotional contact information and ask them about rates and services for hosting your song.
A mixtape technically isn’t a mixtape unless a DJ has mixed your tracks together. A partnership with a professional DJ will go a long way towards legitimizing your mixtape., Many DJs and promotion companies allow you to pay to have your mixtape hosted by them. Oftentimes this can include having professional DJs mix your tracks and adding drops. Hosting can include promotion help and some serious airtime. Hosting can get a little pricey, but there are lots of options out there.Viral Mixtapes is a popular online mixtape host that does a lot of social network promotion for hosted tapes.
DJ Noize is a popular hosting DJ, and prices can be negotiated to cover a variety of promotional services.
Coast2Coast Mixtapes is another popular online host, and boasts a very large audience.

, If you don’t have the cash to have a DJ host your tape, you can mix in your own custom drops and tags. These let the listener know what they’re hearing, ensure that your name is known when your songs start getting shared, and add to the hype of the tape. You can use your recording tools to make them yourself, or if you have a little bit of spare cash you can purchase custom drops.


Some popular custom drop sellers include Wigman and Knock Squared. You can usually get several tags and drops for less than $50.
Add your tags at the start, middle and end of your tracks. This ensures that people know who they’re listening to, even if they got the song from somewhere else.
Without a host, you’re going to need to do most of the promotion yourself. See the next section for some tips and ideas on promoting your tape.

, Hit the streets and start spreading the word at clubs around your town. Post flyers and get people talking. Make sure you have a handful of tapes (or CDs, USB drives, QR codes, etc.) to give out to anyone who looks remotely interested.

, You should be blasting all your available social media leading up to and immediately after the release of your mixtape. If people like what they hear, they’ll be sharing it with their friends, increasing your audience and name recognition. Social media is certainly not the only promotion you should be doing, but it’s very important these days.


Facebook – Everyone you know is on Facebook, and everyone they know is as well. Your Facebook audience is potentially limitless, so you should make sure that you are addressing them regularly. Create a Facebook Page for your music project, and post about your upcoming mixtape. Share those posts with all of your friends.
Twitter – Twitter is more than promotion for your music, it’s promotion for yourself. People follow people that they find interesting. Make your tweets personal and relatable and you’ll soon find yourself with a good-sized following. Once you have the followers, you can start dropping info on your mixtape releases.

, These two online services have large numbers of dedicated listeners, and shouldn’t be overlooked when promoting your mixtape. If you don’t have an account, set one up and upload a few tracks off the tape. The goal of these services is to whet the audience’s appetite. Give them a free track or two, and link to your mixtape or albums.

, Send out a press release to every music blog, magazine, and alternative publication you can think of. Drumming up press support can have a big impact on your audience. A good write-up in the local music rag can dramatically increase your presence.


Contact the local college station and try to get an interview on whatever program relates the most to your music. Even if it's at 3 AM, that's better than no airtime.

, If you really want to make a splash with your tape, make a music video for the hottest single on your tape. The mixtape/video combination can do wonders for increasing the word about you, and YouTube can be a real gateway to getting noticed.


The video doesn’t have to be high-budget. With some good directing and a decent camera, your video can look as professional as some of the most famous videos you’ve seen.

, The world of music doesn’t stop, and it’s rare that one mixtape will make you the next Lil Wayne. Dedicated rappers release multiple mixtapes a year, as consistent releases are the only sure-fire way to increase your audience.

Do not walk away from the computer for too long or it will keep hijacking/recording and you will end up with some nasty static playing. Keep in mind that Audio Hijack Pro only records audio from the program you have selected. So there's no need to be quiet yourself, or silence other programs.
, You should see a file with the application name and a number in your recording bin. From here you can edit the file with Audacity or you can go ahead and import it to iTunes.

'Audacity': Audacity is an easy to use audio editing program.

To set Audacity as the default ""Editor"" (the button with the scissors) go to Audio Hijack Pro>Preferences and select it. Then once you have the song selected you can press ""Editor"" and it will open the file in Audacity.





If you have recorded correctly you should see a lot of blue squiggles to represent the audio file. To play use the space bar, click and drag the mouse to select sections of the audio, and use the delete key to remove sections. In the example below, the flat line (silence) at the end all needed to be removed.





Make sure you have installed the Lame encoder, or you will not be able to export to mp3 files with Audacity. (This file is on the Audacity website on the same page as the application download link.) If you don't export to mp3, the file will be saved in aud format, which is not compatible with many things. To export your audio file to mp3 go to File>Export as MP3. Save it to your desktop, so you can easily drag and drop into iTunes. You're done!







'iTunes': Press the ""iTunes"" button to automatically import the file to iTunes. You can also manually drag the file from Audio Hijack into iTunes or an iTunes playlist, so you don't lose track of it. You'll want to give it a more descriptive name immediately, so you don't lose the file. Go to File>Get Info and and rename in the ""Info"" tab. You can also change when the song starts and stops, to remove static or silence, from the ""Options"" tab, although this requires guess and check and is not as straightforward as Audacity.

Convert your stereo file to 16-bit and 44.1 kHz.,
Burn the track to a CD.",How to Master Audio," To master audio, you must be able to accurately hear what is playing back. Studio monitors or headphones can be expensive, but they are essential tools.;
, ""Mixing down"" means taking all the tracks you've recorded and exporting them, or mixing them, to a single stereo track.


It is better to apply effects using a single stereo track than use the master bus on an entire session. The ""master bus"" is the master volume channel for all of the tracks you record. Some engineers decide to apply mastering effects to this channel, but it is not advisable for novices

, If you recorded at the recommended 32-bit rate, maintain this quality. You can convert the file to the CD-standard 16-bit rate once you've applied your effects and are satisfied with the track.

, Normalizing brings the highest amplitude to the maximum volume you have set. Many people set their peak at -0.2 dB, which means the waveform will be raised to a maximum of 0.2 decibels under zero.

, Depending on the quality of the initial mix you don't want to make a lot of drastic changes here. Experiment until you've achieved the desired sound.


Add more bass and lower mid-range frequencies to create body. Bring up the upper harmonics to produce more clarity. For example, cutting frequencies around 250 Hz will add some clarity to the sound; and boosting around 1kHz will make the vocals appear more present.

, Dynamic range is the amount the song varies from it's lowest volume to it's greatest volume.


Start with a 2:1 ratio and set the post gain at 0. Make very small tweaks until you achieve the desired effect. You should notice that quieter parts of the song sound louder and clearer, and that louder parts are not as loud.
Don't make the ratio too high or else you will get a very squashed sound. A squashed sound implies that the audio does not sound open and the subtleties of the piece are lost because every instrument is so close in volume.

, This is meant to be put in the chain after the compression and is helpful in shaping the tone. You probably won't need much equalization, but you can do some minor shaping to the sound after you apply the dynamic effects of compression.

, Reverb essentially models room spaces and gives the processed audio track more of a live feel. Reverb will add depth and give the stereo track a warm and complete sound. Add as much or as little as you'd like, depending on the effect you are seeking.

, Limiting the audio to a certain dB level will give you more volume. Begin by setting your limiter at -0.2 dB. You should notice a definite increase in volume. To avoid unnatural, unpleasant sounds, do not raise the gain too high.

, You can do this with your audio mastering program, so consult the program instructions for help.

, When burning your mastered audio track to a CD, set the write speed as low as possible to make sure the quality of audio is as high as possible. Many engineers burn at 1x or 2x. You can then duplicate the burned disk and be assured the sound quality will be replicated.

Tinker with your speakers to get better sound.",How to Make Your Own Speakers1," While there is a lot of calibrating that goes into high end speakers, the basic technology is actually pretty simple. An electrical current is run through a wire that is attached to a magnet. This current makes the magnet vibrate, and those vibrations are picked up by our ears as sound.To hear the sound well you should also get a small plastic tupperware or cup. This will amplify the sound much like yelling into a cone amplifies your voice.;
, You want to wrap the wire 6-7 times starting from the middle. Make sure you leave several feet of wire unwrapped on either side of the magnet. Tape this coil onto the bottom of your tupperware, but without the magnet., Using both ends of the leftover copper wire, make an even large coil and tape this on top of the smaller one.

Understand the components of a speaker.,
Buy a speaker kit.,
Solder the crossover together following the provided crossover pattern.,
Cut, stain, and assemble your cabinet according to your blueprint.,
Install your drivers and crossover.,
Fill the rest of your speaker with ""acoustic stuffing.""",How to Make Your Own Speakers2," While the basics of speaker technology have not really changed since 1924,audio technicians have been perfecting the design, electronics, and sound of speakers ever since. That said, all speakers contain a few basic components:



Driver: Transforms an electrical signal into sound. Drivers come in many shapes and sizes, but all share the same function -- they make noise. Many speakers have multiple drivers to handle many frequencies. For example, ""woofers"" are large drivers that work well for low-frequency sounds like bass, while ""tweeters"" handle high frequencies.

Crossovers: These small relays take complex electrical signals and break them up into smaller parts to send to different drivers, isolating bass, treble, and mid-range frequencies.

Cabinet: This is the shell of a speaker where the electronics are housed. In order to eliminate noisy ""resonance"" or to get greater volume they are produced in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials., While you can certainly buy all of the parts separately, it is incredibly difficult to build good speakers without years of studying the principles of sound and electricity. However, the budding DIY speaker enthusiast has another option -- buying pre-designed speaker kits with drivers, crossovers, and cabinets included. When searching for a good speaker kit, you should consider:


Is the cabinet is included? Many speaker kits only contain blueprints for the cabinet -- you will have to buy, cut, and fasten the wood together yourself.
Is the crossover pre-connected? Depending on your comfort level with electronics, you may want to purchase a kit where the crossover is already assembled, or you can attach and solder the pieces yourself.
How high-quality to you want your sound? Most audio professionals consult the Loudspeaker Design Cookbook or LDSB, for advice on choosing drivers and crossovers, and you can expect to pay more for better quality components.
How powerful, or loud, do your speakers need to be. In general, this is determined by the size of you drivers., You will need a soldering iron, hot glue, and a pattern to make sure your crossover works correctly. All speaker kits come with a chart illustrating how to attach everything, and sample patterns can be found with a quick internet search if you are working from scratch. This prevents your speakers from shorting or burning out.Make sure you completely understand how to read wiring diagrams before continuing.
Once your parts are attached, secure them to a small board with a hot glue gun or zip ties.
Finish by attaching your crossover cables to the drivers with speaker wire.

, If your cabinet is not provided for you, you will need to buy the wood and cut it to fit your drivers. Most speakers are rectangular, but talented carpenters can play with other shapes, from polygons to spheres, to get better sound. While all cabinets are different, there are a few guiding principles to their design:


Use material that is at least 1.5"" thick.Always measure your wood so that it fits together perfectly -- any sound that leaks out of the speakers will greatly diminish their quality. Fit the speakers together before adhering them.
Wood glue is the preferred adhesive, but you can also use a drill and screws or biscuit clips as well.
The paint or stain you chose for your cabinet will not affect the sound, but decorate your cabinet before installing components to protect your electronics.Be sure you are comfortable with carpentry equipment before building original speaker cabinets.


, If you followed your blueprints correctly the drivers should fit snugly into the holes you cut on the front of the cabinet. Adhere the crossover board to the cabinet so that the cables to the driver are not stretched or stressed.


The drivers are usually screwed into a plastic molding on the outside of the cabinet.
Use wood glue or adhesive to securely fasten the crossover to the cabinet.

, This specially designed fabric is meant to dampen sound inside the speaker so that you don't hear weird vibrations or echos. While not necessary, it can help the sound considerably.

You will need to have a computer.,
Though there are many companies claiming to be making the best beat making software, there are only two programs that a professional beat maker may use to compose a beat in today’s music industry.,
Now that we have the two best programs to compose good melodies, it could be really annoying not to have both programs rewired into one program.,
After the rewiring step, set up a tempo of the type of hip-hop beat you’re looking forward to create by using Fruity Loops 8.0.,
Use your ears when you’re composing a melody because if it doesn’t sound right to you what makes you think it’s going to sound to your audience?,
After you’re satisfied with your melody, look for the right percussions.,
One error most beginners tend to make is using one single pattern that contains everything.,
Finally when you’re done with your instrumental, make sure you mix everything and lay your patterns down into your playlist.",How to Make an Instrumental on Fruity Loops 8.0 or Reason 4.0," (It could be a desktop computer or a lap top). The computer should have at least Windows VISTA or Windows XP and they should not be a Macintosh brand (because the Macintosh platform is not supported). Another tool a beat maker should have, is a midi keyboard. The keyboard allows you to play notes by linking it onto your computer using a USB interface. A necessary tool to have if you want to keep up with the sound quality and to stay away from distortion is a good monitor speaker. I would recommend the “ALESIS m1-Active Mk2 Powered Studio Monitors” because I’m really familiar with it. Once all those equipments are available at your disposal, then you are ready for the next step.;
, The first program is called “Fruity Loops 8.0” and the second one is “Reason 4.0”. Those two programs have many tools in common and therefore they need to be bought together. Having the right programs to start an instrumental is vital for beat makers because as a hip-hop beat maker, one should be able to captivate an audience of hip-hop lovers as well as hip-hop artists. Those two programs both have the exact sounds, groove and quality that people in today’s music industry are using to make millions.

, That is where the third step known as “Rewiring Reason 4.0 into Fruity Loops 8.0” comes in handy. This technique allows the beat maker to drag Reason’s sounds into the Fruity Loops 8.0 software. To start rewiring, first open Fruity loops 8.0 and click on “channel” then “add one”. Now you’ll see a lot of options presented by the software but since we are rewiring something we need to click on “rewired”. There should be a red rectangle displaying “rewired” with a green light next to it appearing on the sequencer. Click on the “rewired” sign on the sequencer and you should see a big rectangle device named “channel settings-Rewired” displaying a rewire image in red. Look for “Client” and select “Reason” because we are rewiring it to Fruity Loops 8.0. Then after that, click on “show panel” to open Reason 4.0. Now Reason is opened, click on “create” and select “mixer 14:2”. After that step, click on “create” again and select one synthesizer or a sampler between “subtractor synthesizers, thor synthesizers, malstrom synthesizers, nn19 digital sampler and nn-xt advanced sampler”. In this case let’s say I choose subtractor synthesizers for example. Next step is to go back into Fruity Loops 8.0 and select “midi options”. Now you should have 3 channels that are “hardware interface II, mixer 1 and subtractor 1”.Now remember that the order of those channels matters a lot (notice how the synthesizer name subtractor is third). Click on the “hardware interface II” and then click “add/change” then close the box by clicking “ok”. Now you need to go to “channels” in Fruity Loops, click on “add one” again and this time select “midi out”. Click on “midi out” and change the channel to “3” so you could use the subtractor. Now if you use your keyboard and play some notes you should be able to hear some sounds from Reason 4.0.

, On your screen you should have a default tempo that is 140bmp; however, 140bmp is used for Techno beats, so you should reduce it by right clicking on it then choose 110bmp or less. Your tempo matters because it helps your timing to be more accurate.

, If you don’t like the sound you’re hearing, make sure you go to Reason and switch manually the sounds. For example the default sound of our “subtractor” is bass guitar but you can switch it into an acoustic guitar or a trumpet and vice versa. Every change you make on an instrument is going to affect your Fruity Loops pattern. It takes a couple of times for anybody to really know what instruments you want in your melody and therefore, it’s okay to play with it and get familiar with new sounds. The more time you spend on your instruments the more inspiration you’re acquiring. My main concern for beginners is that all sounds do not get along. Let’s say I picked an electric guitar and I add some harmonica into the melody. That type of mistake is usually made because beginners love a specific sound of a song or a beat that they heard and they try to add all of those sounds into their melody. Again Use your ear a lot because you cannot force sounds to get along. If they don’t get along by nature, there’s no way they will get along at all.

, A good way to make this step easy is to listen to your favorite hip-hop song with the exact tempo that your beat has for example and try to pay attention to the percussions only. You’ll notice that most hip-hop songs drums are repetitive but catchy. Once you know how you want your drums to sound like, go to Fruity Loops 8.0 and browse into percussions section on the left of the screen under hip-hop and drag drums, snares, and hi-hats into your pattern that contains the rewiring. Then for each one of those percussions use your metronome to help you set up a tempo that your percussions must follow. Again this requires a lot of tries, and familiarity and like I said earlier the more you try the more you understand the process.

, Fruity Loops 8.0 gives you enough space and an infinite number of patterns one could work on. Knowing how to generate the space Fruity Loops gives you is necessary because a professional beat maker would use up to 10 or more patterns for different instruments or percussions. For example you could set up a pattern for your guitar melody, a pattern for your drums, a pattern for your trumpet melody and a pattern for your snares. You’ll notice the more you advance into beat making, setting things apart is important and it allows you to set up different volumes for different instruments just by using the mixer provided by Fruity Loops. Let’s say I have my drums in pattern 5 but for some reason it’s not loud enough. All I need to do is just look for the mixer then click on channel 5 then add some the volume until I feel like it’s adequate for my beat.

, Listen to your beat over and over again or ask the closest listeners in your household to listen to it so they can give you their opinions. If you feel confident with your beat, click on “file” and export your beat as an mp3 file. Make sure you give it a name.

Open a text editor.,
Enter the artists and song information.,
Add the lyrics.,
Open the song in a media player.,
Start adding timestamps.,
Save the file as an LRC file.,
Place the LRC file in the same location as the music file.,
Adjust your file.",How to Make an *.Lrc File," Any basic text editor, such as Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for Mac OS X will work. LRC files are essentially text files with specific codes inserted.;
, At the top of your LRC file, you should include the song name, artists, and album. You will need to use special codes to enter these so that the player can recognize them.


Add the song title. Put it between square brackets and add ti: before it. A song called ""This is a Song"" would be formatted as . The song title should be the first line of your LRC file.
Add the name of the artist. This is formatted the same way as the Song Title, except with the code ar: before it. An artist named ""Artist"" would be formatted as Add the name of the album. Like the Artists and Song Title entry, this should be placed in brackets. The album code is al: before the album name. An album called “Album” would be formatted as Add any additional information. You can add your name to the LRC file by using the code , and you can add the song’s composer by using the tag . Not all players can read this extra information.

, You can either type in the lyrics yourself, or copy the text from a lyrics website. Enter all of the lyrics into the file, with each line of lyrics on a new line in the text document.

, You will need to find the time that each lyric is sung or spoken, so you will need to open the song in a player that you can start and stop as you please. Your media player should also allow you to see the playback time in hundredths of seconds.

, Play the song, and pause it each time a line of lyrics starts. Make note of the time in the player, and place your cursor at the front of the appropriate line in the LRC file.


Enter the time in square brackets. The format for time is broken into three sections: minute, second, and hundredths of a second. For a lyric that starts at 1 minute, 32 seconds, and 45 hundredths of a second, the tag would look like OR .Most players will only be able to display up to 95 characters per timestamp. If you have a long line of lyrics, you may need to separate it with another timestamp. If you want each word to appear when it is sung, you will need to create a separate timestamp for each word in the song.
Hundredths of a second can be omitted, resulting in a tag that looks like .
Sometimes lyrics repeat themselves throughout the song, especially choruses. You can add a different time tag right next to the original one so that you don't have to type it twice. For example: ”Chorus lyrics”.

, Once you have your timestamps all completed, you can save the file as an LRC file and test it out. Click File and select Save As.


The file name must be the exact same as the filename of the song.
Change the extension to .lrc. To do this, click the “Save as type” dropdown menu and select All Files. Change the extension of the file from .txt to .lrc.

, In order for the player to load the file, it must be located in the same directory as the music file. This is true for both MP3 players and media players on your computer.

, Once you have tested your file, make any adjustments necessary to the timing so that the lyrics appear at exactly the right time.

From this menu, find the “Packs” tab and open it. In here, you can select from different audio samples to build your beat. The different packs contain different combinations of instrument samples, so choose one that appeals to you.;
, Click on some of the samples to hear what they sound like. To create a basic beat, it’s a good idea to start with just a few drum sounds–a kick, hat, and snare is a standard combination. Choose one of each that you like and drag it to a sample slot in the step sequencer.

, In your step sequencer, you will notice that each slot is represented by four sets of four boxes, alternating in blocks of black and red. Each block of four boxes represents one beat, with individual boxes representing fractions of the beat. Each individual box is called a 'step'. Highlight individual boxes by clicking on them. The highlighted boxes signify where each sample will be played in the sequence. To unselect a highlighted box, simply right-click and it will go dark.

, Of course your beat is your own to build as you please, but much of rock and hip hop uses beats that are in 4/4 time. To create a basic 4/4 beat, highlight boxes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 on the high hat channel, 5 and 13 on the snare channel, and 1, 11, and 13 on the kick channel.

, Select pattern mode and press play. This would make your song play on repeat. If everything sounds good to you, you’re ready to move on to the next step. If you want to change the beat, repeat step three until it sounds the way you want it to.

, In your playlist, select the paintbrush tool and paint your sample pattern in the space beside “Track 1.” Paint as many bars of the sample beat as you want to hear.

, Make sure that you switch the play mode from pattern to song, then hit the play button. You will now hear your beat played on repeat as many times as it has been painted on the playlist. You can change the speed by clicking on the tempo number at the top of the screen and dragging up to make it faster, or down to make it slower.

, In the file menu, click on the “Save” tab. Name your beat and hit the save button. This way you will be able to use the beat for future projects.

, To play it on an iPod or CD, you will need to create an .mp3 file by selecting ""Export"" in the file menu, then selecting "".mp3"" and saving it to your computer.

Apply a little compression.,
Go in for some normalization.",How to Improve Your Voice for Podcasts and Recordings," When making a podcast recording, most people make the mistake of either coming in too close or staying too far away from the microphone. This will either cause distortions in the first case, or make you increase the volume and amplify the noise. The optimal distance between your mouth and the microphone is two to three inches. By doing this, you capture most of your voice and the least amount of disturbances and background noise.;
, A Digital Audio Workstation, or DAW, is a system designed for recording, editing and playing digital audio. There are numerous professional and amateur DAWs out there, and any one of them is quite fine for these purposes. The best ones are Image-Line FL Studio, Ableton Live, and Apple Logic Pro, and they are pretty pricey.

, Gates are useful for stripping away unwanted sound that falls below a user-determined level. You can tidy up your audio with these steps:


Install a DAW and upload the recording by selecting the “upload” button and browsing for your recording in the hard drive.
Locate and manually remove any noise in the silences between your words or sentences. This is great for removing louder noises.
Apply an existing gate provided by the DAW, which will get rid of noises that are softer than your voice. Simply find the gate function in your DAW, and set the noise reduction amount to around -20 to -75dB.
Play around with your recording until you find the perfect spot. This combination of manually removing strong noises, and gating the soft ones really gives the result of a quiet and clean vocal take.

, A filter is commonly used to eliminate any low-end frequencies and thin out a sound. Most people use it on to remove rumble, unwanted low-end material, and ""boominess."" Here's how you preset a cut-off frequency, above which anything will be allowed to go through and anything below it won't be:


Find the filter option on your DAW, and find a high-pass (low-cut) filter.
Make the cut at around 80-130 Hz. This should make the recording sound a lot cleaner and more enjoyable to listen to. This process is also called “cutting” using equalization (EQ).

, This is not a very important step if you’re simply recording a voice podcast, but if you want to clean up a song recording, this is a must to avoid sounding uneven. A couple of steps should do it:


The best number to use is around 0.8 for compress ratio, 0.88 for compression hardness, and -18 for floor.
You can leave the noise gate falloff in the middle. Doing so will really even out the volume of your audio, and these settings work on a great majority of recordings.

, Simply put, normalization is used to limit the loudest part of your audio at a certain targeted level. Depending on such things like the dynamic range of the content and your target level, normalization may result in peaks that exceed your recording equipment's limits. Your best option here would be -1dB.

Get To Know your Audience.",How to Keep Listeners and Readers Coming Back to Your Podcast," Internet users love bargains and deals, and sales are a sure way to capture their attention time and again. You might enact short sales periods to motivate people to take action. Giving them six months to make a final decision may just help them avoid making that decision at all. Let your audience know that the products/services on special are always changing to encourage them to visit your site often. Keep your site ""dynamic"", ever-changing and perpetually evolving. Try getting creative with your specials. For example, consider giving away a free token product or service rather than bopping them over the head with a direct discount.;
, Internet travelers often look online to learn more about interesting topics in the news. Creating a link between your PodCast/Blog/Business model and a hot news story can be an essential way to attract listeners and readers to your Web world. This is a common tactic used often by public relations firms to obtain media coverage for their clients, and could work equally well for you. For example, following a significant court ruling, an attorney could write an article or be a guest expert for your PodCast/Blog about the impact the ruling might have on your listeners/readers.

, Provide dynamic content. Why would a Web traveler want to return to a Web site that rarely changes? Keeping your information up-to-date and even up-to-the-minute sends a more defined message to visitors that your PodCast/Blog/Business model is serious about doing business.

, This is a great way to get visitors excited about your Web site and what you do. Consider asking users for (input) feedback, so that your contest can double as a market research tool. Keep in mind that prizes and awards need not to be extravagant, but should exude fun and be in direct correlation with your intended target market. As an added bonus, you can ask entrants whether or not they would like to be notified of any special news and/or information when they initially enter your contest. Was the contest you ran a total success? The answer can better help you home in on your online marketing, podcasting and blogging efforts.

, This popular promotional tactic is an effective one. Don't expect to build a list of thousands of subscribers, but focus instead on building a high quality list of targeted readers. When sending an e-mail newsletter, keep it short and informative. Company promotions are expected, but don't overdo it.

, If you have the time, participating in a targeted email list is a great way to connect with potential listeners and readers. The object is to keep your ""brand"" at the top of their minds. An email list is a community of subscribers who are interested in a particular topic, and may exchange between 1 and 100 email letters daily. Participation in an email group works best when you reach out to a niche' market. For example, the owner of a computer store might join a mailing list for computer owners. By participating as an expert, the store owner is able to promote his business to a community of prospective clients.

, A solid understanding of the needs and goals of your audience is the best way to ensure that your marketing efforts are maximized. Statistics and tracking reports will help you gauge the interests of visitors to your Web site, which is a good reason to utilize a site-traffic analysis tool. Web site usage statistics will help you understand how people come to your site, and what they do once they have arrived. Are they finding what they want, or do certain pages on your site trigger them to leave?

Make the mix is as loud as you can get it from the start.,
Use multiple stages of processing.,
Start small with low ratio compression.,
Know what type of compression to use for your purposes.,
Don't overdo any of the processes.,
Mix them all together.",How to Get Louder Masters," A quiet/unbalanced mix will be difficult to make loud;
, Using multiple stages of processing can result in more natural results that will allow you to get a louder master. These are explained below.

, This applies gain reduction to the very low levels as well as the peaks.

,


Multiband compression can be used to treat the frequency bands separately and give a more natural result. Try experimenting to see what works best with this process, and make sure to practise, practise, practise!
Parallel compression is a great way to bring the levels up without affecting the transients. This means you can get louder without it sounding as squashed.

,


Limiting is a process that is usually overdone. Try experimenting with release settings to minimise 'pumping' and try not to overdo this process.
Saturation/excitation/distortion. Used in small amounts these processes can achieve louder sounds. They are a little more friendly towards transients than compression but can make a mix sound harsh if overdone.
Clipping. This is something that's usually taught to be avoided (and for good reason) however, used in small amounts (usually just around half a db) this can get you just a little more gain than you would have got otherwise.

, Using a combination of the above, learning how they interact with each other and practising will take you a long way in getting louder, better sounding masters. Good luck!

Get the CD out.,
Put the CD in your CD player to play.,
In some cases, the hidden track may be at the beginning of the CD.,
In most cases though, hidden tracks occur at the end.,
Congratulations!",How to Find Hidden Tracks on a Music Cd," Search engines will come in useful for this. Simply put in the artist, the title of the CD, and the words ""hidden track."";
, Make sure what you have is an original copy of the CD and not a burned copy, because the hidden track might not always be available on a home-burned version of the CD. (See next step for explanation.)

, Most of the time hidden tracks are either at the very end of the CD or even hidden at the beginning. Home-burned CDs probably will contain the track at the end, but if the track happens to be hidden at the beginning, causing you to have to rewind backwards, it probably won't be there on a home-burned CD.

, Start playing the first track of the CD and then press the rewind button on your player. If there is a hidden track at the beginning of the CD, pressing rewind will cause it to back up into the hidden track. If you find that there is a hidden track, press rewind until you get the beginning of the hidden track, and then listen to it as normal.

, Play the last track on the CD, and then fast forward until you hear sound playing. It can be hidden behind as little as a couple of minutes of silence or as much as twenty minutes. Just keep fast forwarding the CD until you hear the song, or if you're patient enough, simply wait out the silence.

, You've just listened to the hidden track on your CD!

Edit your MP3s' information.,
Play your MP3s to ensure editing carryover.",How to Edit ID3 Tags1," Whether you're using iTunes, Media Player, or a third-party music service, you'll need to open the program to view the music files in question.;
, Most programs allow you to click and drag any MP3 files not already in your library into your media player of choice to add them.


You can also highlight any MP3s you wish to edit, right-click (or two-finger click on Mac) a highlighted file, and select ""Play"" or ""Play with... (default media player)"". This will bring up your MP3 files in your default program as they are.
Use this as a chance to consolidate all of your MP3 files. In the interest of efficiency, they should all be in the same location--your default music folder is the best bet.

, While most of the tagging you'll do on MP3s is text-based, you also have the option of adding album art. If this appeals to you, try searching the album art for your selected MP3s in an image service like Google or Bing Images.


Try to find the highest quality photos possible; they may look good in a thumbnail, but lower-quality photos can become granulated when they expand to fit your screen.

, Again, depending on what kind of media player you're using, your specific process will vary slightly; however, most media players require you to right-click the MP3 file you wish to edit, find some version of ""edit file"" in the ensuing right-click menu, and click that option.


For example, iTunes has an option entitled ""Get info"", which opens the MP3's tag input; Windows Media Player's menu, on the other hand, simply says ""edit"".
If you're using Windows Media Player and your MP3 files are from a legitimate or primary source, you can select ""Find album info"", which will normally fill in the details of the selected music automatically.

, Tags include items such as artist name, track number in an album, and genre of music; feel free to edit all of these accordingly.


Fields such as ""album"", ""year"", and ""artist"" can be edited in batches. To do this, highlight all relevant MP3s in your media player, right- or control-click one of the selected MP3s, and select the editing option. To ensure maximum accuracy, consider looking up the album or track details as you go. This is especially helpful when entering the track number details.

, Once you finish tagging all of your chosen MP3s, exit out of your media player, reboot it, and try playing some of the edited MP3s. The changes should have been saved, and you should now have fully-tagged MP3 files.


You should also re-sync any mobile devices post-editing, both to update your library and to ensure that all the tags carry over correctly.

Drag the movie file you created into the ""Video"" track.,
Now you repeat steps #4-10 until you have as many audio tracks as desired.,
At this point, all your audio tracks should be crammed into a single movie file.",How to Use Windows Movie Maker to Create a 'Multi Track' Soundtrack," Now look for an icon labeled ""Windows Movie Maker"" and open it. The application window should open up.;
, Click and drag whatever video and audio files you need (or want) into the large empty area. Now click ""Storyboard"". A menu should open up. Select ""Timeline"". If Timeline is already selected, you don't have to worry about this. Now there should be three tracks visible at the bottom of the window in the Timeline view: Video, Audio/Music, and Title Overlay. Now drag the desired audio tracks onto the Audio/Music track in the order you want them.

, Click and drag it into the video track.

, Optimally, you want to type in something you'll remember, such as ""Track1"". It doesn't matter too much where you save the project file, however. Now click the ""Save"" button. Note that this step is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT if you want to go to the trouble of making modifications to your project later.

, A window should show up asking you where you want to publish your movie. Select ""This computer"". Now press the ""Next"" button.

, Make the file name something you can remember, such as ""Track1"". If it's already the name you want, don't do anything. Also, by default, the drop-down menu labeled ""Publish to:"" should be on the ""Videos"" folder. If it's not, browse for the ""Videos"" folder by going into the folder labeled with your User Account name and looking for the folder labeled ""Videos"". If the Videos folder is already selected, leave the menu like that and click the ""Next"" button.

, If you don't know what to do here, it is recommended that you click ""Best quality for playback on my computer (recommended)"", not because the computer says it is recommended, but because it would probably be irrelevant to this this article to explain what the other settings mean. Now click the ""Publish"" button.

, Once it says ""Your movie has been published"", you're still far from done! Now open up the ""Videos"" folder (you did publish your movie to the Videos folder, right?). If you don't know where it is, open up the folder labeled with your User Account name. It should be in there. Now find the movie you just published. It should be a "".wmv"" file with the name you designated.

, Now hold down the ""Ctrl"" key on the keyboard and then press the ""N"" key, or just go into the ""File"" menu and select ""New Project"". If Movie Maker asks you if you want to save the changes you made to your project, click ""No"" unless you didn't save and want to save now, or made desirable changes to the project after you saved it the first time. The ""Video"" and ""Audio/Music"" tracks should be reset. However, you haven't lost anything.

, If you hit the Play button, you will hear the audio files you put in even though the track is labeled ""Video"". Why? Because the Video track has it's own ""Audio"" track, but in order to use it, you have to put a movie file into it that has an audio track, and then Movie Maker will automatically place the file's audio track into the ""Video"" track's ""Audio"" track. Now you see why you had to go though all of this, right? Now put the next set of audio files you want into the Audio/Music track, in the order you want.

, It was warned that this could be very time-consuming, correct? At step #4, be sure to enter a different project file name every time you add a new track. Also, every time you add a new track, it will be merged with the previous track. Lastly described by this step, at each step, try to be VERY SURE that you have the desired results because it can potentially be quite time-consuming to make any modifications to the final result (the reason is described under the ""Tips"" section).

, How to convert the movie file into just a plain-old audio file? Very easy. Click and drag your 'final' movie file to the formerly empty space in the Movie Maker window described in step #9. Now click and drag it again. However, this time, don't drag it to the ""Video"" track; instead, drag it to the ""Audio/Music"" track. Now repeat steps #5-8. 4 is recommended as well, but not as strongly. At step #7, there should be a few changes to the window that displays. If you're not sure, leave the settings as they are, but if you want a specific sound quality, you can select ""More settings"", click on the drop-down menu labeled ""High-quality audio"", and then select which quality you want. This should take much faster than it did with the movie files because this is a straight audio file without any movie. Now you're done. Find your finished file, open it up, and enjoy. Hopefully, this article was helpful to you. If not, make sure you followed the steps very carefully.

Download an MP3 tagger of your choice.,
Open your MP3 tagger.,
Make sure your internet connection is stable.,
Select your MP3s for tagging.,
Use your tagger to import tags.,
Play your MP3s to ensure editing carryover.",How to Edit ID3 Tags2," MP3 taggers range drastically in terms of quality of interface and functionality, but all taggers provide the same basic service: automatically filling in your MP3s' information en masse. You'll probably have to install whichever MP3 tagger you download, even if it is an add-on; be ready to restart your computer after doing so.


TuneUp, a highly-recommended add-on for iTunes, features a simple drag-and-drop interface; unfortunately, the most practical version of the software is $15. While this program is generally worth the money, if you don't want to pay the initial fee, you'll be restricted to tagging 100 songs and 50 album art pieces a month. MP3tag, on the other hand, is free for Windows and Mac alike. Its sparse yet accessible interface is ideal for editing large batches of MP3 files, and it is compatible with a huge amount of online databases for tag importing. , Once you've finished downloading and installing the tagger of your choice, open it and familiarize yourself with its settings.


Some programs will allow you to de-select any media that isn't an MP3; for the purposes of editing ID3 tags, you should enable this setting.

, Since the information MP3 taggers draw from is online-based, you'll want to have a strong connection to the internet for the entire time that your files are being tagged.


An ethernet cable connecting you to the router can help expedite this process.

, Locate your MP3s, select all that you wish to edit, and drag them into your tagger.


If possible, try to keep your MP3s relatively organized in small batches to make sure you don't have a cluster of poorly-tagged MP3s going into the tagger all at once. You'll want to limit your sample size if something goes wrong in the process.

, Since there are tons of available MP3 taggers for you to use, there isn't one universal instruction regarding this step; however, you should be able to view and edit a large amount of MP3 files within the program's interface, with the option to scan for and import music tags.

, Although most MP3 taggers are fairly accurate, there's always the chance that one of your files will be mislabeled.


You should also re-sync any mobile devices post-editing, both to update your library and to ensure that all the tags carry over correctly.

Windows Movie Maker 2.1 runs on Windows 7 and Windows Vista as long as you have Windows Movie Maker 2.6 installed.,
Windows Movie Maker 2.1 works on Windows 7, including the webcam feature,and all of the other features.",How to Work With Different Versions of Windows Movie Maker on Windows 7," Make sure you create a new folder in Programs on C drive and rename it Movie Maker 2.1. This is because the program file for Movie Maker 6 is also called Movie Maker,which is the same name as the Movie Maker 2.1 program file. So if you do not create a new folder and rename the Movie Maker 2.1 file,there will be two program files with the same name. And Windows will replace the older file(the Windows Movie Maker 6 file)with the new Windows Movie Maker 2.1 file that you have just installed.Leaving you without Windows Movie Maker 6. But if you already have Windows Movie Maker 2.6 installed,you do not need to rename the 2.6 program file. Because the 2.6 file is called Movie Maker 2.6 not Movie Maker.;
, This is because Windows Movie Maker 2.1 uses some of the dill and program files of 2.6 in order to run.In fact the two versions are very similar to one another. And if 2.6 is not installed, Movie Maker 2.1 will not work properly.

, And they all run side by side. But you cannot have more than one version open at the same time. For example. if you are using Movie Maker 6, and then you want to switch to Movie Maker 2.1.You must close Windows movie Maker 6 first,before you open 2.1.

, That is, the two are different. But you can run Windows Live Movie Maker alongside all of the other versions of Windows Movie Maker if you want to.

, It is also possible to run Windows Movie Maker 1.1 in both Windows 7 and Windows Vista.Which is an earlier version of Windows Movie Maker for Windows ME. Windows Movie Maker 1.1 can run alongside the other versions of Movie Maker but the functions are limited.

, Just like it does on Windows XP.

Write out a script.,
Understand the role of your voice in the video.,
Get a good microphone and computer for recording.,
Practice your part until you know it down pat.,
Take care of your ""instrument.""'",How to Do a Voice Over1," If you are doing commentary on something, like a YouTube video, you should at least view the video several times to get a feel for what happens. For all other voice overs a script is essential. You need to know how long you have to talk, if you are responding to any characters or cues in the video, and what you're going to say. This script may change when matched with the final video, but you can never go wrong with a little pre-planning.;
, There are, generally speaking, two types of voice acting, each used for two very different types of video. The style you chose to follow will be dependent on your script and the video you're shooting:



Conversational Voice-Overs are used in animation, films, and some commercials. The point is to sound clear but natural, as if you are dialoguing with the video/audience.

Hard Sell/Announcer Voice-Overs are used in commercials and events, and speak over people instead of to them. You are grabbing attention and feeding key information, and your voice is crisp and authoritative., Many laptops have built-in microphones that will record moderate-quality audio, but investing in a microphone is always the best idea. You can buy USB mics that hook directly into your computer, or get a more expensive microphone and mixer for high-tech options.


You will need a computer program capable of recording as well. For beginners, download Audacity, which is free. If you plan on recording often, you should get a program like Logic or Pro Tools for complete customization of your voice.
You can also get pocket recorders, like Tascams, for portable and efficient audio recording.
A windscreen, which prevents the air from your breath from reaching the microphone, is an incredible and essential tool that you can get cheaply online., You need to treat voice-over just like an acting gig. Each line you say is, in essence, like delivering a line for a movie, except you don't have your body and facial expressions to help sell the line. The best way to practice is to record your voice and play it back, making notes about how to change things. Above all, you need to get to a point where you are:


Clear and concise. Each word needs to be easily heard and understood.
Emotive. You need to get the emotion or idea of the line out only using the tone of your voice.
Consistent. This is especially important if you are playing a character. The best, most unique voice in the world is useless if you slip out of it every 3-4 words., Voice actors treat their throats like a good singer treats theirs. You want to make sure you have full control over your sound when you start recording, and that comes from taking care of your voice box:


Avoid yelling and screaming whenever possible.
Stay hydrated with a liter or two of water each day.
Avoid heavy dairy on the day you record, as it creates mucus around your voice box.
Avoid cigarettes and alcohol, especially a day or two before recording."
"
Set the footage you're reading over up on a computer screen.,
Stand while delivering your lines.,
Make sure your recording room is silent and free of echo.,
Wear headphones.,
Speak a bit ""larger than life."",
Focus on strong, varied inflection.,
Never say ""uhm"" or other filler noises.",How to Do a Voice Over2," If you are reading over a pre-shot video, make sure you can see the video from your recording area. You may also record the voice-over without the video, simplifying your job and allowing you to focus on speaking. However, if you need to react to the video then it is best to read with the video in the background.


Whenever possible hit play on the video and microphone recorder at the same time. Then, when you start recording, you'll be perfectly synced up to the video.

, Standing opens up your chest cavity, allowing you to speak with a clear, unencumbered voice. It also allows you to be more animated, acting out some events so that you sink deeply into the character.


You want to be 8-10 inches from the mic. Roughly the distance between your thumb and pinky if they are both extended out., If you do not have a sound-proofed room or recording booth you can still make one for yourself. The echoing sound will appear in your recording and keep your voice from sounding clear if you don't take the time to soundproof. Many amateurs have found that recording in a closet is easy: your clothes will naturally dampen the sound and you can put a towel or blanket on the floor and door to fully close it off.


The main goal is to get rid of or cover any hard surfaces, which reflect sound back to the microphone.
If your mic has a ""hyper-cardioid pattern,"" use it. This means that the sound is moving through the microphone and out the back instead of echoing around inside., You need to be able to hear your voice as you record, and quickly play back your audio to listen for any mistakes. Try and invest in good headphones, preferably over ear, that will provide the best playback of your voice over.

, This sweet spot is tough to find, but it is the basis of all good voice-overs. Your voice tends to lose some character in a recording, so overemphasizing emotions and enunciation brings back the natural energy of your voice. To test this, try out 3-4 lines in the beginning of recording at various levels of energy. Play them back and adjust your voice accordingly, finding the one that sounds best in the recording, not when you are saying it out loud.


You do not need to worry about speaking loudly into the microphone, just being clear and emotive., Inflection is the rhythm and tone of your speech. Many beginners like to start with all their sentences ending in ""up"" tones, like they are asking questions. Good inflection, however, is about varying your voice to sound natural and dynamic. A lot of this comes from ""Acting out"" your parts as you speak. For example, audiences can actually ""hear"" smiles, as it changes your tone of voice slightly into a happier register., These words only have a place in the voice-over if your script asks for them. ""Uhm,"" ""ahh,"" and ""uhhhh"" are all missed in everyday conversation, but they will be glaringly apparent in a recording, when the audience is only focusing on your voice. Focus on reading the script and nothing else. If you need to pause, just stay silent. This takes practice, but listening to your own recordings over and over again will help out.

"
"
Know that too much voice over ruins the flow of a video.,
Try multiple line readings.,
Breath as silently as possible.,
Adapt the script so that it flows naturally.,
Learn how to sound engineer.",How to Do a Voice Over3," Films are inherently visual mediums, and if you can't tell the story with your visuals, you may want to consider using a different art form. This doesn't mean voice over is bad. Rather, you need to use it to get across points that can't be communicated through video instead of beating the audience over the head with exposition.


In Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, Robert Downy Jr.'s narrator provides great, sarcastic commentary about the locations and fills in necessary backstory, allowing the movie to focus on comedy, action, and events instead of telling everyone's history.
In nature documentaries like Planet Earth, the narrator knows to remain silent for large periods of time, letting the gorgeous images take center stage., Don't simply re-record the same inflection, pauses, and emphasis every time you do the line. Test out new readings of the line, trying to get 3-4 versions of the line that you like and can play with in editing. This is a huge help if you are the editor, and it is also an invaluable addition for a director of the commercial or movie. This gives them flexibility when editing, and it helps you find the best way to portray the voice you are acting out., Good breathing for voice-over is similar to good breathing for singers. A big, audible breath in the middle of a sentence sounds unprofessional and is distracting, as are gasps of air at the beginning of every sentence. Focus on taking short, controlled breaths, turning away from the microphone when you need to take a big breath.


Breathing is much easier to remove from recordings than it used to be, but it still saves everyone time to avoid recording it in the first place.Focus on breathing in and out through your chest, moving your belly with each breath like a singer does.

, Sometimes the lines on the page just don't translate well to the microphone. If you've tried every line reading imaginable and it still sounds like verbal sludge, try cutting a few words to make it flow more smoothly. Feel free to adapt, adjust, or edit the script on the fly if it doesn't sound natural when you're saying it. That said, be sure that your new changes are small enough that the original aims of the script stay true.Be sure to read the entire script before making changes -- you never know if a detail you believe is small will come back later.

, This is a skill that takes a lifetime to master, yet is well worth it for a career in voice over. You need to be able to make your voice sound the best it possibly can, because it will change through the microphone. Balancing sound is not easy, but start by using a free program like Audacity and looking up tutorials online, which can help your find specific effects (like movie-announcer voice, gender switching, etc).


If you are serious about audio, you need a program like Pro Tools or Logic to really mix and master sound.
At the very least, play with the EQ and volume of your voice, which allows you to subtly balance the tone of your voice.

Variations in pitch are called inflection, and they keep the audiences engaged (it's hard to listen to monotone for very long). Think of inflection as the melody of your speech. Use inflection to emphasize key words, keeping in mind that emphasis affects audience interpretation.


Take the sentence ""The ball is on the table."" ""The ball is on the table"" conveys a different meaning than ""The ball is on the table. Use inflection to help get your message across to the listener.

, Be aware of the speed at which you speak. Make mental notes of how fast you think you're speaking while you record yourself. Then, play the recording back. Were you right? Remember that different voice overs will require different paces (think of an energetic hip hop dance club commercial vs a relaxing massage commercial).

, It's important to speak loudly enough to be heard without yelling. In addition, you should have good volume control—certain types of voice overs will require more volume than others.

, Rhythm and fluency refers to how smooth or choppy your speech is. You want the voice over to sound fluid, so practice being in control of your pauses—take advantage of natural stopping points, such as commas and periods, to breathe and read ahead.

, Be aware of whether or not you normally have an accent. If you do, know ""proper"" English pronunciation as well. This doesn't mean that your accent is a hindrance—often times a unique voice can be considered an asset, but it's important to be able to use ""standard"" English if asked. Practice reading aloud a lot so that you don't stumble over words or mumble.

, Depending on the script, you may need to sound sad, excited, or simply informative. Practice delivering with appropriate emotional tone and energy.

Have fun exploring the different ways of Green Screen.",How to Use Greenscreen on Windows Movie Maker," Make sure the colour isn't too dark or bright. It should be a lime sort of green.;
,, Remember NOT to wear any clothes with the same green colour as your Green Screen.

, Saving the video to your computer is a good idea, in case you accidentally delete it on your camera.

,
(If you are using Windows Vista or later, be sure to open Notepad as an Administrator.)

,,, Go into the transition section, and there should be a transition called Greenscreen.

,,,, This merges the two clips together.

, There may be some blotchy bits if the green background isn't good enough, and there may be some parts on yourself that are see-through because you are wearing a similar colour to the background.

, You can also use a Blue Screen, but the code you wrote into Notepad is not capable of detecting blue. For your information, the real name for Green Screen is Chroma Key.


There are advanced editing programs such as Final Cut Pro that have built in codes and can replace any background colour at all.

Open Windows Movie Maker.,
Take the time to upload the audio file you have chosen.,
Now that you’ve added your music, take some time to look at the sound wave bars that the music creates.,
Add your video file into the project in a similar way to how you added your music.,
Most videos you put in will already have an audio file associated with them, mute this audio track, so it does not overlay with the song you have picked.

,
Choose whether you would like to add the entire video, or individually add clips as you move through the song.,
If there is a brief moment of silence at the start of your video, you may want to try a fade in.,
Once you have your intro finished you can begin editing in your next clip.,
If you would like to split the video clip you are currently using, simply press the “M” key.,
In order to make your two clips fit in correctly you can either shorten or lengthen them or change their speeds.,
Select the new clip you’d like to merge, and drag it together with the previous clip (just like in step 7) to create a simple, synced fade transition between two clips.,
At the red circle there is a drum beat that you would like to sync to.,
One more technique you can use is the creation of a simple black or white flash.,
Split your clips directly on the beat, as opposed to right after it for the transition.

,
Now right click the first clip and open the “Effects” menu again.,
Right click on the second clip, bring up “Effects” again, and this time select the corresponding “Fade In from Black” or “Fade In from White” effect.,
With these two basic techniques, you can create some pretty interesting effects from rapid flashes, to long peaceful transitions, all in sync with music of your choice.

",How to Synchronize Video and Music With Windows Movie Maker," You can find it easily by searching it into your Start Bar, or by downloading the version I have provided in Things You Need.;
, If you are using iTunes, open My Music, select the iTunes folder, then iTunes Music, and find the artist and song you’d like.

, You can zoom in on the graph itself with the (+) magnifying glass see the changes in more detail. The places where this graph spikes and dips sharply are good candidates for syncing opportunities, whether you are simply transitioning between two clips, or adding flashes and more complicated effects.

, For windows, there is also a Video’s Folder.

,, If you are using a longer video, it is often easier to add the video in its entirety and clip each segment you will use individually. Regardless, start focusing on your first video clip.

, You can insert a still image of a plain black picture (easily created in Microsoft Paint or other comparable programs. Simply use the Paint Bucket Tool to create a solid black background, then under ""Import"" on the side of Windows Movie Maker, select picture) at the very start of the video, and then simply merge your first video clip into the black picture. Make sure the merge point is close to the point where the audio kicks in. To change the timing the black picture, simply click and drag at the edge of the picture on the timeline until it is the desired length.

, Find the next large bass beat, cymbal crash, lyric change etc on the audio graph.

, Or, under clip, scroll down until you find the “Split” selection. This will split the video segment you have into 2 sections at exactly the point where you have the cursor.

, By right clicking on the video clip, a menu will open up where you can select “Effects”. Under Effects there is are two options for both speeding up and slowing down your clip. Click “Add” on the desired one to change the length of your clip, but keep all the desired video. Make sure the clip once again ends close to the beat you’ve chosen.

, The longer the transition, the smoother it will look. The following picture will demonstrate where the clips will align with an audio spike for the best sync.

, Notice how the old clip extends a bit past that drum beat. This is to allow a bit of material to fade out to. If the video ended abruptly at the beat, then you would get an abrupt fade as opposed to a smooth one. For the same reason, the new clip is faded in to a point just before the beat. This way, the completed fade has an equal distance on each side of the beat, with the beat resting directly in the middle.

, Creating these takes a little more effort, but it gives off a sharp, quick effect for fast transitions.

,, From these effects, choose either “Fade Out to Black” or “Fade Out to White” depending on which color flash you would like. Then once again click Add.

, This will create a brief flash right on the beat between the two clips you have chosen. The shorter the clips, the quicker the flash.

Windows Movie Maker is included in Windows Vista and XP, but needs to be downloaded for Windows 7 and 8.;
, You can find it in your Start Menu under all programs, or you can search for “movie maker” and select it from the results.

, Windows Movie Maker 2012 is organized in a similar way to Microsoft Office. You can navigate through the various options by selecting the tabs at the top of the window.


Home – This is the main tab for Movie Maker. You can use this tab to add videos, images, and audio to your project. You can also select premade themes for the movie, rotate the image, and upload the project to websites such as Facebook, YouTube, and Vimeo.
Animations – This tab allows you to add transitions between clips.
Visual Effects – This tab will allow you to change the color and tone of the image. You can turn it black and white or turn the color saturation way up.
Project – You can make overall changes to your entire project by adjusting the audio mix and change the aspect ratio of the video.
View – This tab lets you zoom in and out on the timeline, change the thumbnail sizes, and view the waveforms for your film’s audio.
Edit – This menu appears after you add your first video clip. You can use this tab to trim the clip, set a new start point or end point, fade in and out, and stabilize the video.
Options – This tab shows up after you add a music file to your project. You can set start and end times for the music, fade it in and out, and split the file.

, Click the Home tab and then click the “Add videos and photos” button. This will allow you to browser your computer to find a video file. You can also drag and drop files into the main window to add them to the project.


If you want to make a slideshow, or add some still images into your project, you can add images in the same way you do videos.
If you have a webcam connected to your computer, you can click the “Webcam video” button and record a clip directly into your project.

, Once you’ve added a few clips, you can drag and drop them to rearrange them however you see fit. This can be especially useful if you need to add a clip later in the project but want to place it in the middle of the movie.

, Highlight one of your clips and click the Options tab. Move the cursor to the point that you want to trim the clip. You can then set that point as either the Start or End, or you can split the video at that point by clicking the appropriate button in the Options tab.


If you are having a hard time getting the cursor to a specific part, you can enter in the exact time into the field.

, Select the first clip and then click the Animations tab. The Transitions section will show animations that will play at the start of your movie.To add a transition between your first and second clip, select the second clip in your project. You can select from the available transitions. Use the arrow buttons at the end of the Transitions list to scroll through more options.

, Click the Home tab. If you want to add narration to your video, click the “Record narration” button. This will allow you to record your voice if you have a microphone attached.


To add a music file to your movie, click the “Add music” button. You can choose to download music from free online sources or add music files from your computer.

, You can add a title to the beginning of each clip if you’d like. This can be especially useful for presentations. Click the Add Title button in the Home tab.

You can add multiple cards to have multiple credits screens, and you can use the Effects section of the Format tab to create scrolling credits just like a real movie., Once you are finished putting it all together, use the “Preview full screen” button in the View tab to watch the movie from start to finish. Make note of anything that doesn’t work correctly or that needs tweaking.

, You can use the Share section in the Home tab to upload your video directly to sites like YouTube and Facebook. Movie Maker will ask what resolution you would like to save the movie in, and then ask you to sign in with your Microsoft Account. Once you do, you will be able to upload the video, as long the video fits the guidelines for the site you are uploading to.


You must have a verified YouTube account in order to upload videos longer than 15 minutes.

, Click the arrow underneath the “Save movie” button in the Home tab to open a list of preset formats that you can save your video as. Choose the device that you plan on watching the video on, and Movie Maker will do the conversion automatically.

Write a script or outline of your movie.,
Plan out your shot composition with a digital camera and tripod.,
Eliminate any shadows from outside light sources.,
Design, build, or ""recruit"" your characters.,
Take a few practice photos and view them on the computer.",How to Make a Stop Motion Film in Windows Movie Maker1," Stop-motion is incredibly time-consuming -- you need at least 10 photos per second of footage, so having a plan in place before you begin will save you a lot of headaches. While there is no limit to what you can do with stop-motion, there are some practical concerns that you should be aware of before beginning your story.


It is very hard to zoom, pan, or move the camera smoothly in stop motion, so keeping everything in one frame/scene will be much easier to film professionally.
Unless you can safely leave your camera in position overnight you will need to be able to shoot all of your footage in one day.
The more characters and moving pieces you have, the longer everything will take.;
, The tripod is essential to keep your camera in the same spot, otherwise your movie will look shaky and jumbled. Set your scene in a place where it cannot be easily disturbed, as it will be nearly impossible to put everything in the right place if something gets knocked out of sorts.


A good memory card, one that can hold at least 4-500 photos, is essential unless you want to constantly remove the card and reset the camera in the same position. You can set you picture quality to ""Low"" if you are worried about space and do not care about having a professional quality film.
If you don't have a tripod, tape your camera down so that it doesn't move when you take a picture., Making your movie will take a long time, meaning the shadow that starts at the edge of your scene might cover the entire shot by the time you're done. Unless this is the effect you want (to show time passing, for example), you should close the shutters or curtains and light the scene with lamps and ceiling lights. This will ensure even, consistent lighting throughout your movie.

, You can animate almost anything using stop-motion, from people and action figures to drawings and old appliances. You simply need something that you can move slowly and will hold it's shape while you take the pictures. Some ideas for stop-motion subjects include:



Dolls, action figures, and toys are bendable, expressive, and easy to adjust. You can use them to enact any scene you want, and they are easy to manipulate, stick, and move.

Drawings are time-consuming, as you need to draw every frame (10-12 a second) by hand. However, this is how traditional cartoons were done before computers. You can also do a stop motion movie as you draw something, taking a picture as you add the lines, shading, color, etc, to show the drawing as it is brought to life.

Household objects can be brought to life quickly and easily. This is often the best place to start, as you have the materials on hand and can quickly get them moving. Paper can toss itself in the trash, pencils can spontaneously dance, and bread can slide itself out of the bag and into the toaster.

, Put your subjects into the frame or start a simple drawing using the lighting and camera position you want for your final movie. Take 5-10 quick shots and then import them into the computer, making sure they are clear, well-lit, and show everything in your scene. You do not want to edit 500 photos or re-shoot them later because you realized too late that the scene was lacking in light.


Your goal is to avoid editing any of your individual photos. Take your time with the photography and you will save countless hours later."

Learn the basics of Windows Movie Maker (WMM).,
Import the clips you want for your trailer.,
Choose a theme or direction for your trailer.,
Find your ""key moments"" and build the trailer around those.,
Start the trailer with your best, most gripping clip.,
Explain the premise of the movie after your hook.,
End the trailer on a bang, tempting the audience to see what happens.,
Edit your trailer to under two and a half minutes.,
Set the entire trailer to music.,
Add your titles last.,
Click ""Save Movie"" in the upper right corner.",How to Make a Movie Trailer on Windows Movie Maker1," WMM allows you to order video clips and pictures into a movie, put on some basic effects and titles, and share your trailer with the world. There are a surprising number of features available to you, but there are only a few key aspects that you should know well for a trailer:



Import: This is how you bring in footage to edit. You must import your movie or clips into WMM to work with them.

Timeline or Storyboard: This is your work space. You drag the clips onto the timeline, then cut and order them into your final movie trailer. Your timeline becomes the final film when you save the video. Some versions refer to it as the ""Storyboard.""

Titles: This is how you put all text onto your video, not just titles. WMM has presets titles for beginning and end credits, as well as a variety of fonts and movement effects.;
, Click on ""File"" in the upper right corner, then click ""Import."" You can also drag and drop the files from an open My Computer window. If the you've already shot the entire movie, grab the actual film and import it.


Always pull in more footage than you think you'll need. You want to have options as you edit, and it is always better to have extra footage as your work.

, Trailers tell the audience what to expect when they see the movie. Since it is only 1-3 minutes long, however, you don't have nearly enough time to tell the whole story. You need to choose 1-2 compelling aspects of your film and use the trailer to intrigue the audience quickly and succinctly. Watch trailers for movies similar to yours and notice what they play up -- Batman, trailers focus on dark, brooding characters and epic fight scenes. Rom-coms like Trainwreck cracks some jokes, show some dancing and romance, and features superstar actor LeBron James, a big draw and good way to sell tickets. Think about what will sell your movie to your audience and focus on that in the trailer. Some ideas include:



The Hook: If your movie has a wild or original premise, you might want to focus on explaining it to the audience. If you had to describe your movie in one sentence, what would it be? How is your movie going to be unique or different from the rest?

Genre Focus: Does your movie appeal to a very specific group of movie goers? Horror trailers, for example, generally mimic the movies, starting calm and peaceful before hinting at something terrible under the surface. Comedies usually feature 2-3 jokes that represent the general sense of humor in the movie.

, Once you know what your theme is, start finding the clips that best show it off. Of course, you do not want to reveal any spoilers from your movie, but, generally speaking, you want a few clips from every section of the movie, as well as shots of every major actor. A general overview of ""essential"" clips for a traditional movie trailer would be:



The Conflict: What is the basic story of the movie. Usually this is a character or narrator saying ""we have to do _______.""

Main character introductions: A line or two of dialogue from the major characters, or a few shots of them in the movie showing them in action. Include both the heroes and villains.

Tone & Genre: Use the rest of the clips to show what type of movie it is. Action movies need to show action, comedies show jokes, documentaries show the issues at hand, etc. If it is a serious movie, show serious faces. If it is light hearted, show off bright, sunny footage and happy people.

, You want to put in a short, exciting, and eye-catching scene. It needs to be something quick, like a joke, a surprising shift in tone like the one in the Cloverfield trailer, or a jaw dropping image or character. Make sure your first clip captures the audience's interest and you're trailer will be on it's way to success.Check out the trailer for American Hustle, which starts with an unedited scene that conveys the tone, plot, and appeal of the movie perfectly in just 30 seconds. It is so good the rest of the trailer is a montage of great shots and music with very few words. The point of the trailer was already proven, even if you changed the channel or turned it off.

, Let a character or narrator breakdown the general plot of the movie once you've grabbed the audience's attention. You want people to know what your movie is about, as this helps them talk to friends and drum up free press for you. Oftentimes you might make a ""conversation"" between a few different characters to quickly get the point across. Other times you might use text, or a narrator, over silent clips to explain the story.Whatever you do, do it quickly. You want to get the story out in 10-15 seconds, using 1-3 sentences at maximum.

, The best trailers are 2 minutes that build anticipation for 2 hours. You need to compel your audience to see what is going to happen, making them so curious they rush out to see the movie. To do this, you could cut right before a climatic moment, introduce a twist or serious setback, or show off the funniest joke or moment in the trailer so far.

, This is the cutoff length for a trailer in movie theaters, and audiences are conditioned to expect trailers to be this long. Any longer and people will likely start tuning you out. You should even feel free to go shorter, as it makes it more likely that someone will stay until the end.Think of your trailer as a peak into your movie's ""greatest hits."" By focusing on the best moments and leaving the rest to imagination, it entices people to watch and learn more., Music is an essential part of a movie trailer, and is just as important as the images. Music tells the audience subtly what type of movie they are watching a trailer for. Because you're only working with 2 minutes of footage, the music sets the mood and gives the clips context. For example, Guardians of the Galaxy's hit trailer succeeded in large part because of the upbeat, irreverent song in the background, which makes the sci-fi action seem accessible, fun, and comedic.


Remember that you generally need to own the rights to music to use it in a video if you plan on making any money off of it. When in doubt, search online for ""copyright-free"" music that you can use in any clip.Many trailers use multiple types of music, an effective strategy if you want to show off a couple of different genres. Again, Guardians of the Galaxy is a great example, using modern rock music, heart-pounding action scores, and trippy science fiction music.

, At the bare minimum, you want to put the title of the film up and the day it will be released. You should also consider putting up the film's website, the stars, the writer, and director. Usually these go near the end, right before the final, gripping clip.

, Clicking the normal ""Save"" button will save your workstation, but it won't save the movie as an independent film. To do that, click ""Save Movie"" and choose the option that works best for you. More likely than not you'll want to choose either .mov (for Youtube and Quicktime) or .mp4.

Know that stop-motion is a collection of still images, played back-to-back, to create the illusion of movement.,
Set your starting scene.,
Take your first shot.,
Slightly move your subject, then take another shot.,
Continue moving the subject bit by bit and taking pictures.,
Find ways to suspend or hold the objects in place when necessary.,
Review your last few shots if you get lost.",How to Make a Stop Motion Film in Windows Movie Maker2," Stop-motion is similar to the flip books many people make as kids, where a small drawing on the corner of the pages is brought to life by flipping through them rapidly. This makes stop-motion a long process, as you need to take a lot of photos to make the film.

, Say you are going to have some bread walk itself into the toaster. Your first shot would likely be the bag of bread sitting next to the toaster. Set everything up, lights and props, and get ready to roll.

, Check it quickly to make sure there were no issues, but do not move the camera. If you move it, there is a chance you'll need to restart, as it is nearly impossible to get it back into the same spot it started.

, Continuing the bread to toaster movie, you might open the bag a quarter of an inch. Take the shot, keeping the camera in the same place.


Some cameras have ""auto-shutter"" features, which take shots every 5, 10, or 15 seconds. If you only need a few seconds to adjust things this can be a great way to prevent accidental camera movement., Open the bag a little more, and take a photo. Start to move the bread out the bag, take a photo. Keep moving and snapping, trying to keep your movements brief and making sure the camera stays in place.


The smaller the movements between shots, the smoother the animation will look. As a guideline, most early animation, like Disney shorts, took 24 shots per second of movie footage, and they look incredibly smooth as a result. You can get away with between 10-12, however, for home stop-motion., Getting the bread out of the bag and scooting it towards the toaster is easy. Getting it in the toaster, however, is a lot harder, since the bread will likely not wait for you halfway up the toaster without something to keep it from falling. Luckily, because you can take as much time in between shots as you want, you don't need any crazy special effects. For most stop-motion movies, some clear fishing line or tape will help you accomplish most of your goals., If you're unsure where the next motion is, check the last few photos you took and compare them to the current image on the camera screen. This is also helpful for larger actions, like suspended or ""jumping"" figures.

Depending on the size and number of the photos, importing may take some time. Don't be worried if the computer freezes up temporarily, as it just needs time to process.

, In the Movie Maker, use Ctrl+A again to select all of your photos. Now, any changes you make will affect every single photo at the same time, so you could make the movie black and white, sepia-toned, or play with the color settings if you desired.

, This means that each photo will only be on the screen for a tenth of a second, giving you 10 frames per second of footage. With that, your movie is complete., Hit the play button under the preview window to watch your movie in action. If the entire thing seems to slow, adjust your duration to play even faster, trying out .09 or .08 seconds. If it moves too quickly, make the duration a little long, like .11 or .12 seconds., If there is a part that moves quicker than the rest, or seems jump forward, add a frame or two to slow it down. To do so, simply click on a picture in the spot that seems too slow, and then right-click copy and paste (or Ctrl+C and then Ctrl+V). The identical photo will take up an extra .1 seconds, slowing down the action.

If a part is creeping along too slowly, delete an individual photo or two to speed it up. Make a note, however, of the file name in case you decide to add it back in later.

, Once you have the timing right, add in your audio effects, such as dialog or music, as well as any titles or credits that you want in the beginning and end. Your movie is finished.

You may still make some changes, adding or deleting frames, to sync up your footage to some music, but it is best to do this last, after you have a movie you enjoy on its own."

Focus on the rhythm, not just images to keep the audience engaged.,
Make the trailer a mini-movie.,
Use original footage instead of clips from the movie.,
Retain an aura of mystery.",How to Make a Movie Trailer on Windows Movie Maker2," The best trailers propel you along, leaving your begging to watch more. They do this through a perfect attention to rhythm. Trailers are often edited like music videos, meaning that the cuts line right up with the beat of the song. Once you know what song you're using, return to the video and cut it so that each transition fits your backing music., Can you tell a short story in the trailer? Think of great trailer's you've seen and how they function. The start with a bang, slow down and explain the conflict, then gain steam until a climactic final shot. This is, in essence, the structure of many real movies. Having this mini roller-coaster ride can make your trailer more compelling, which makes the movie seem more interesting as a result., Not all trailers need to show clips from the actual movie, though most do need a few seconds of footage. The trailer for Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind features a fake commercial for the memory-wiping technology. The Social Network Trailer starts with a minute or so of someone browsing Facebook. Sometimes, starting with clips or images that aren't from the movie helps build suspense, capturing audiences used to hearing ""In a world where..."" every time.

, Too many trailers try and fit in everything-- the best jokes, scenes, and plot points-- and end up ruining the entire movie. You want the audience to be curious about the movie, not like they just sat through the spark notes version of it. The best trailers will focus on 1-2 elements, exploring them well, while still hinting that there are other aspects of the movie worth seeing. This is mostly about feel, but you should always ask yourself while editing: ""Does this give too much away?"""

You want your horror film to really be horror.",How to Make a Scary Movie on Windows Movie Maker1," Since you are making this on Windows Movie Maker, it's best to know not to film the whole movie in one scene (duh). Instead, film it into different scenes and give each scene a specific name you can remember. Make sure they are short and simple so you can carefully arrange them to your liking. Example: Make one scene of someone just screaming or a scene where your just walking through the graveyard. Also, if you have a sound recorder, record some creepy music or hissing sounds. This way, you can add sound to a regular scene.

, You can choose from many different colors.

Develop a plot and storyline before you start filming.,
Think of a snappy title!",How to Make a Scary Movie on Windows Movie Maker2," While improvising can be compelling, it rarely works in the horror genre.;
, Whether it's ""The Haunted Mirror"" or ""Room 1"", make sure it sounds relative to the movie. Example; If your movie is about a ghost trying to possess you, you shouldn't name it ""Zombies in the Graveyard"". Try something like ""Possession"" or ""Paranormal Brainteaser"".

, Also, to make floating objects, attach a really thin string to it so it looks like nothing is holding it. This may take a while, but when its done, it will be worth it.

Download as many scenes as possible; for example, if you are making a Kingdom Hearts GMV then it's best to go to Kh-vids.net because they have pretty much every Kingdom Hearts cut scene to ever exist.,
Pick the song.,
Once you have the song in place, don't forget to put the clips together in beat with the song.,
Never forget to set the sound all the way to 'Audio/Music' under the Set Audio Levels to the left, so you won't hear a little bit of the cut scene behind the music.

,
Make it organized.,
Have variety.,
Never overuse effects.,
End your GMV with a message and a logical ending.,
Save it with at least under 100 GB if you want it on Youtube.",How to Make Good Game Music Videos with Windows Movie Maker," Don't forget to download a lot; variety is professional!;
, If you already have a song in mind, you have to build a storyline around it. Nothing is more annoying than a completely pointless GMV with no storyline and random clips.

, For instance, using another Kingdom Hearts example, if your storyline is a simple SoraxKairi match, you may want to start off with some clips of them alone in separate cut scenes, but put it in to match the beat of the song.

,, If the song is like most and separated into stanzas, do a clip per line. Make sure that it fits the mood; no fight scenes during a pretty line unless you're trying to make it funny.

, This may be repeating a couple of ideas, but absolutely do not use one clip for about forty seconds straight, or even twenty seconds. That looks very lazy and unprofessional, and will take about three clips to finish the GMV, and no effort at all.

, It's alright with AMVs, but with GMVs the game cut scenes already, usually, have many nice effects with them. Film Age: Older, Black and White tone, Sepia tone, etc. aren't that bad, but only when not overused. No choppiness. When your video is choppy, it means a new clip will start for less than a second when another clip starts, it usually means you did not cut the clip well. That's very easy to trim under the Timeline mode, which is recommended for the whole process to help with timing. If you're having problems with your clips running smoothly, try simply moving a bit of the clip into another through the timeline to fade it. Another way to make it smoother is to fade the previous clip out to black and fade the current clip in from black. If it's a fast-paced clip, just fade the current clip in from white. It may cause seizures, but it looks VERY good.

, Going back to the KairixSora idea, don't have Kairi die at the end of your AMV unless the storyline makes sense to lead up to it.

, If you want it only for yourself, then save it under the best quality. We can't all have Mac graphic quality.

You can set the Equalizer settings here, enable or disable the Compressor feature, and use the Spatializer feature, which enables you to get a surround sound quality if your computer sound system offers the feature.
Video Effects can change the display settings of your video file here. Just like editing photos, you can adjust the brightness and contrast, hue and saturation, crop the video itself (yes, it’s possible), change the colors, geometry, and even add logos using the Overlay feature.
Synchronization enables you to change the synchronization of your audio, video, and subtitle tracks. If you notice that your subtitle or audio plays faster or slower than the movie itself, you can opt to change the settings here to sync them together.

If you've already downloaded your Audible files (.aax, .aa) from other sources, skip down to the next section for instructions on converting them.;
, You'll need this program in order to download files from the Audible website if you're using a Windows PC:


Visit audible.com/sw.
Click the ""Download"" button in the ""Windows PC"" box.
Click ""Select"" above ""Download to my computer.""
Click ""Install Audible Manager"" and follow the prompts to install the program
Run Audible Manager after installing it and then sign in with your Audible or Amazon account.

, Once you're logged in, click the ""Library"" link at the top of the Audible page, or visit audible.com/library.

, This will display additional options, including the Download options.

, If you don't have the Audible Download Manager installed, you'll download the setup file for that instead. If you do have it installed, you'll download a special file which will automatically open the Download Manager. If you're on a Mac, the file will download to your iTunes library.

, This may take a while, especially for larger books.

, This is a program designed to remove DRM from Audible files and convert them to MP3 (or other common formats). InAudible is not an official program, and does not have it's own website. Due to its dubious legality, it cannot be linked in this article. You can find it through various torrent sites.Run the installer after downloading InAudible to install it on your computer.
There is a beta version of InAudible available for Mac computers, though it may be even harder to find than the Windows version. If you can't find a Mac version of InAudible, you can use Wine to run the Windows version. See Open EXE Files on Mac for instructions.

, You'll see most of the options are grayed out until you select a file.

, This will open a file browser.

, Browse your computer for the Audible file you downloaded in the first section. In Windows, the default location is:


C:\Users\Public\Documents\Audible\Downloads

, By default, the converted file will be placed in the same directory as the original Audible file. You can change this by clicking the ""..."" button next to ""Output File.""

, MP3 format is selected automatically, though you can choose from several other options.


If you're planning on adding the file to your iTunes library, select ""AAC / M4B"" as the format.
Check ""Embed Cover"" if you want the cover image included in the converted file.

, If you want to retain the original chapter splits, check this box to split the file up. This will create a separate audio file for each chapter of the recording, so it may not suit your needs.

, The rest of the settings can be safely ignored for now, at least until you're more familiar with the quality of file that the conversion produces. Once you click ""Begin Conversion,"" InAudible will begin converting the Audible file into the format you specified.

, The conversion process will take roughly two seconds for every minute of audio. This means that longer books may take quite a while to convert. You can monitor the progress at the bottom of the InAudible window.

, Once the conversion is complete, you'll have a new audio file without any DRM restrictions that you can play on any compatible device. If you selected MP3 format, this means you can play it on virtually any device.

,, Explore the buttons, and try using the ""help"" menu. Usually, with a piano-roll view, you find the notes along the piano that are appropriate and click and drag on that line according to a time measure in seconds. In score view, it usually involves a more visual way of making music. There is usually a menu with different notes to select, and you place them on the score.

Step 0: Is This Legal?,
In short, I don't know if it's legal or not, but consider the following.,A Discman from Sony ,A Wall-Mounted CD Player from Muji ,A DP-470 DVD Player from Kiss Technology ,My Linux box from Dell ,
It turned out the CD contained ‘copy control technology,’ which prevented it from working on the players listed above.,
To solve this problem, I created a copy of the CD as described here.,
Because I don't usually copy CDs, I found it a little ironic that the ‘copy control technology’ required me to make a copy of the album in order to use it.,
In the meantime, I hope this guide will help people who are in a similar situation.,
Step 1: Download IsoBuster

,
The first step is to download and install IsoBuster, a program used to salvage data from damaged CDs and DVDs.,
Step 2: Create a Folder for the Audio Tracks

,
The idea is to use IsoBuster to extract the hidden audio tracks from the protected CD and burn them to a normal CD, so the first thing to do is create a folder somewhere to store the audio tracks.,
Step 3: Open the Copy-Protected CD with IsoBuster

,
First, start up IsoBuster and hold down your shift key while inserting your copy-protected CD.

,
I recommend that you hold down the shift key because it blocks the Windows ‘autorun’ feature, i.e., prevents the CD from launching programs automatically.,
After inserting the CD, you should now see something like the following:

,
As you can see, the CD has two sessions, unlike a normal audio CD, which only has one.,
To get at the audio tracks with IsoBuster, click on session 1 on the left in the IsoBuster window.,
Step 4: Extract the Audio Tracks

,
Use your mouse to mark all the audio tracks in the right part of the window, then right click and choose ‘Extract Objects’ from the menu:

,
IsoBuster will ask you for a destination directory; choose the one you created previously:

,
Now wait for the files to copy...

,
When the copy has finished, you can shut down IsoBuster.

,
Step 5: Burn the Audio Tracks onto a Blank CD

,
Now open your favourite CD burning software and use it to create an Audio CD.,
Enjoy!

",How to Copy Protected Cds,";
, After buying a music CD called 80s Alternative: The Darker Side of the Decade for €9.99 in Tower Records in Dublin, I discovered that it only played in two of the four CD players I use on a regular basis:

,,,,, In all fairness, the CD was clearly marked ‘COPY CONTROLLED’ but I failed to notice this when I picked it up. I buy CDs quite often but I find they are actually quite resistant to scratches, so I rarely make copies. However, it was a problem that the 80s Alternative CD only worked in two of the four players. Also, the songs couldn't be MP3-encoded.

, The copy plays in all of the four players listed above, and will also allow the songs to be MP3-encoded. In short, the copy is a completely normal audio CD. Since creating the copy, I haven't taken the original out of its case, except to write this guide.

, Since my experience with the 80s Alternative album, I have bought many other CDs, and the ones with copy control technology are the only ones I have copied. To figure out whether this was legal or not, I wrote an open letter to EMI, who are the publishers of the 80s Alternative album. In the letter, I pointed out this paradoxical situation and asked EMI if they would consider what I had done fair use of the album. I also sent the letter to a couple of newspapers, but I don't think they published it. All of this was in March 2004. As of February 2008, I have still to hear from EMI, but I will update this page with details as soon as they get back to me.

, Until I hear from EMI, I suggest you make up your own mind about whether you think following these instructions is legal or not.

,, IsoBuster is a commercial program, but you can run it in freeware mode, where it has limited functionality, which is fine for our purposes. I used IsoBuster 1.6 for this guide.

,, I suggest your Windows desktop.

,,, The reason this is necessary is that some copy-protected CDs (for example Contraband by Velvet Revolver) automatically install suspicious Windows drivers, which people have reported cause problems when you later want to play normal CDs. If you don't want to hold down the shift key every time you insert a copy-protected CD, there is also a way to disable autorun altogether.

,, The actual audio tracks are stored in session 1. Session 2 contains files, which are used when you insert the CD into a Windows box or a Macintosh. For our purposes we are only interested in the audio tracks, so we'll ignore session 2 completely.

, You should now see the audio tracks displayed on the right:

,,,,,,, Drag the tracks from the folder where IsoBuster placed them into your Audio CD project, make sure they appear in the right order, and then burn. When you are finished, the resulting CD will contain all the tracks from the original copy-protected CD, but in a non-protected format. It should play on all players and can be MP3-encoded for use on your portable MP3 player.

Understand the bit rate and its affection on the audio quality.,
Understand that the bitrate tag of audio files may not tell the true bitrate.,
After you understood these two facts above, know that the audio spectrum can tell you about the real quality and bitrate of an audio file.,
Import an audio file in a spectrum analyzing program.,
These following are spectrums of some popular bitrate and its cut-offs:


MP3 file, Bitrate 64 kbps.,
This is an example of an upscaled audio file.",How to Check the Real Bitrate of Audio Files," Though audio quality depends on many elements such as frequency, compressing method, up-scaled, etc., but for almost audio files downloaded on the Internet that have not been up scaled, if the bit rate is high (~128 kbps or higher), then the sound will be clearer and ""more comfortable"" to hear. If the bit rate is low, you may hear it blurring, noisy and unclear.;
, It is easy to convert a low quality 64 kbps MP3 file into a (so called) high quality 500 kbps M4A file. This action is called ""upscaling"". After upscaling, the audio quality is still not improved and it may be worse.

, The spectrum (or chart) is a graph which shows the frequency (in kHz) and the loudness (in dB). Many free programs such as Spek can help you build the audio chart/spectrum.

, Observe the graph. Notice the cut-offs. The position of cut-offs can tell you the bitrate of the file. Cut-off is the line put at where the graph cannot reach higher. For example, an 128 kbps audio graph will be cut-off at 16 kHz. Note: The red line in the image below is not existed when you use an audio spectrum analyzer.

, Cut-off at 11kHz.
MP3 file, Bitrate 128 kbps. Cut-off at 16 kHz.
MP3 file, Bitrate 192 kbps. Cut-off at 19 kHz.
MP3 file, Bitrate 320 kbps. Cut-off at 20 kHz.
M4A file, Bitrate 500 kbps. Cut-off at 22 kHz.
FLAC file, Lossless quality (Bitrate usually 1000 kbps or higher). Graph's drawn continuously, no cut-off.

, Its bitrate tag reads 320 kbps but the actual quality is 192 kbps.

Press the “Start Burn” button.",How to Burn Music to an Audio CD1," Make sure the drive is either CD-RW or DVD-RW. The ‘W’ stands for writeable, and is necessary to burn information to the disc.


The type of drive is usually printed on the front, but the information can also be found in Control Panel > Device Manager > Disk Drives.;
, This can be accessed from Start > All Apps (All Programs in Windows 7 and earlier) > Windows Media Player. This is the stock media player that is supplied with Windows.

, This opens a panel on the right to create a burn list.

, The files will need to be a filetype supported by WMP (.mp3, .mp4, .wav, .aac, are among the most common). When burned to a CD, the software will transcode the files to a lossless format.


Audio CDs are limited to an 80 minute playtime. This is an industry standard set by manufacturers. This means that the number of songs you can fit onto the CD will vary depending on the length of the track.
CD packaging may also mention a 700MB capacity, but this measurement is used for making data CDs. A data CD works like a storage device and can only be read by computers.

, This opens a menu with different burn options. Select “Audio CD” from the menu.

, The CD burn process will begin. After completion the disc will eject automatically and be ready for playback.


If you cancel the burn process or it fails you will need to use a new CD to try again.

Decide what headphones you want.,
Determine your budget.,
Do your research.,
Make a reservation.,
Go to the store.",How to Buy Headphones," Although most headphones look the same, they're all very much different. Some of them boost a certain part of the music, some of them are designed for comfort and some of them are made to block out all other background noise. Some cheap headphones are lacking in all of these things. There are two ways to decide what headphones you want.


By effect.

Bass booster. Bass booster earphones make your music sound very bassy. Most of the time, they block out all outside noise. Some good bass booster headphones are Beats by Dr Dre but they can be quite expensive. Bass booster headphones are good for dubstep and pop music
Music clarity. Music clarity headphones make your music clearer. If you find that too much bass is ruining your song, music clarity headphones can sort that out. They're mainly used for rock, punk and sometimes folk or classical.


Overhead or in ear

In ear earphones are good for travelling with as they are lightweight and flexible. However, they sometimes lack the bass that you find in overhead headphones. If you are into rock music and don't mind getting some music clarity earphones, in ears are great. You can also use them for sport easier and share them with friends. If you like to listen to music causally, you can put only one earphone in and still have a conversation.
Overhead headphones tend to block out all the sound around you and focus on bass. They can be quite hard to travel with and use during sport as they tend to be big and inflexible. Beats by Dr Dre do fold up, on the other hand. You can't share headphones with someone as you can with earphones. However, they play music much louder and allow you to focus on the song.

;
, If you don't want to spend £300 on big headphones, you don't have to. They will however, have much better sound quality than £1 headphones. The minimum you are willing to spend should be no less than £5. Anything below that will just sound horrible. The more expensive doesn't always mean better though so choose wisely.

, Now that you know your price range and what exactly you're looking for in a pair of headphones, it's time to buy a pair. A good way to do this is to go on the website of a shop that sells headphones and have a look. You may or may not find your perfect pair. If you don't, just look somewhere else. If you do, start reading reviews on that particular model and find somewhere you can test them out. If you can't test them; you'll have to rely on the reviews to make your decision.

, Too many times people have traveled to the store only to find that what they're looking for isn't in stock. To avoid this happening to you, make a reservation beforehand. It's quick, simple and should only require you to enter a few details. Be sure that you've made the reservation at the right shop and be clear when they're holding it until. You don't want to show up a week later to find that they've got rid of them, do you? On the other hand, you don't want to go there right now and find that they haven't come in yet.

, Tell the people in the store that you've made a reservation. They will probably ask you for a reservation number. Give it to them and they'll find what you reserved on their computers. When you get the product, inspect the box to see if it's in good condition and if it looks new. If it doesn't, ask for another one. If you can test it out in the shop then do just that. Taking it home and finding it broken is the worst feeling ever. They should work, however. Once you've paid for the headphones, take them home and enjoy.

, The CD burn process will begin. After completion the disc will eject automatically and be ready for playback.


If you cancel the burn process or it fails you will need to use a new CD to try again.

Pick the right software for you.,
Try a different media player.,
Try a dedicated burning program.",How to Burn Music to an Audio CD3," If you do not want to use iTunes or WMP, there is a plethora of third-party software out there. Perhaps you are dedicated to open-source software or just prefer the feature set of another media player, or maybe you don’t use your computer for music listening and have no need for a media player at all.


When downloading any software, it is always best to get it from the original developer website. This helps to ensure that the installer has not been tampered with or loaded with extra software or malware. If a developer does not host the file for download on their own site, there is usually a list of trusted mirrors to use instead.

, VLC Media Player and Foobar2000 are two free media players that are popular for their speed, customizability, and broad codec (filetype) support. Since these programs are still media players, the process of burning an Audio CD will be very similar to using WMP or iTunes.


Foobar2000 is for windows only.

, InfraRecorder and IMGBurn are two free, no-nonsense burning programs for those who do not need playback support. These programs boast a more comprehensive array of burning options, like mixed mode, which allows user to create hybrid audio/data CDs.


Because these programs support more complex burning features, this options is recommended for more advanced users or those who really don’t want the extra weight of a media player.
Both InfraRecorder and IMGBurn are Windows-only. “Burn” is a strong, simple option for Mac users.

If you choose 64x, you will increasing the speed by sixty-four times the current pace. If you aren't sure which speed to use, consider why you need to speed up the video.Choose the highest values (64x, 32x, 16x) if you are speeding up a video of something incredibly slow: a sunset, or a snowman melting, or a plant growing.
Use 8x or 4x if you want to fit something fairly slow into a much shorter span of video time: a snail crossing a driveway, or a group of people building something.
Speed the video up 2x—double the original speed—if you want to speed along a regular scene without losing clarity, or if you want to minutely adjust a clip of something slow.
If you decide that you want to slow down the video, use a small value: 0.125x, 0.25x, or 0.5x.

, Watch the video through, and make sure that the new, faster speed works with your vision for the project. If not: adjust it. Don't be afraid to split the clip in question into a collection of even-smaller clips, each with its own unique speed. Be aware that when you speed up the video, you shorten its duration – so it will look shorter on the timeline."

Open up Windows Live Movie Maker and import the files from the folder mentioned before.,

Choose a single clip and analyze the clip and answer the questions to yourself: Does it need a computerized transition?,
To control the speed of the clip either visual or auditory you will need to click on the desired clip, (mind that audio and video clips are separate) then proceed to the edit menu and in the sub-options one will find a video speed setting which will be set automatically at (1X).,
Go through each clip, one by one, and decide what effects will be needed and what order to put the film.,
Add transitions between clips.,
When making an amateur film, an intro and credit screen is a good idea.,
Add audio to their film (if desired).,
Be sure to save the project frequently, especially before publishing the film to the computer.",How to Create an Amateur Film Using Windows Live Movie Maker on Windows 7," For example: Documentary, educational, action, comedy, suspense...etc.;
, For example: Do not hold a United Nations conference in your garage, it detracts from the quality and reality of the film.

, If you plan your film well enough, you will not film the clips in successive order, you will film what you need at particular locations. Therefore you may actually film the beginning and end of the movie at one location all at once, to save travel time.

, For HD filming you are looking at around a 100 dollar camera for your cheapest version. Of course you will not be using the Hollywood 5-10 thousand dollar cameras. Another huge part to filming in a professional way, is to use a tripod. The easiest way for someone to tell if this is low quality is if you use only your hand to film. The TRIPOD IS KEY to making a great movie.

, Try different camera angles, take multiple takes of a scene and record absolutely everything you do. Sometimes you do things by accident that are either really amazing or otherwise hilarious. If you only have one camera there is a way to get multiple camera angles of one scene. Simply ask your actors to freeze on the spot and then change the angle, begin recording, and ask them to continue. If edited correctly the time lapse is entirely unnoticeable.


Certain techniques to filming that one may want to take into account are zooming in, moving shots, field vision…etc. The idea is to give the film variety, use the tripod to your advantage to steadily move the camera on the swivel of the tripod. Zooming in is a very difficult art technique to master. Zooming should be done before you begin recording the scene, unless the particular scene situation calls for zooming in or out. Keep in mind that there is no definitive filming protocol; it is all about the art-form and style that can be your own.
One helpful yet optional step is to film only bits at one time, edit it together and continue filming. Filming only parts allows you to see what the final product may look like and then maybe see some changes or improvements that could be made to future footage.

, First create a folder, preferably with the movie title as its label. Then copy (DO NOT CUT) files from the camera memory. Then paste the video files in the folder labeled with the movie title.

, Your files will be automatically placed in the timeline for you in successive order of the file name. Begin watching your film clips and begin cutting out the unneeded portions of the video, (usually at the beginning of the clip and at the end). It is not a good idea to do any serious editing until your film has been cut to a reasonable amount

, You should now put the clips in order on the timeline so that you may begin the intense editing portion of the film.

, Is the clip too loud? (by default, the clip will be played at its loudest volume) Is there any special effects that are needed? For example: does it need music, sound effects, slow or fast motion, flashes of light?


As a practical purpose most sound effects can be generated with sound to a given sequence of events. If your goal is to create visual special effects such as fire, lightning, explosions, floods…etc. The most effective way to do this is to create a microscopic version of your scene that literally can be affected with such effects, and the key is to formulate the two clips together in such a way that the transition is seen as an overwhelming change of effect, as seen from the first person point of view. (This is the most difficult part of filming).

, You may increase or decrease this value to your liking.

, Use the split video tool if you want to cut something away from the video. For precise editing use the two arrows under the preview screen. The arrows are on either side of the play button under the preview screen. These arrows allow you to proceed through the film frame-by-frame. Cutting at exact frames makes the movie flow nicely and professionally.

, As a tip, do these transitions infrequently and generally when you want to reflect a lapse in time. Otherwise simple changes in video are the best way. The Windows live movie maker offers numerous transitional effects, which is why it is important to be mindful of your over/under use of them. The amounts will very based upon the length of the film, as well as the film type. Action films will generally have fewer transitional effects between scenes than would a documentary. To add a transitional effect, the process is quite simple click on the film clip you wish to transition to (not from) then go to the tool bar at the top and click on animations. Immediately you will see transitions that you may select for the clip.


When you click on the transition in the tool bar, the preview screen will show the transition from the previous clip to your selected clip. This makes the process easier and faster to determine which effect to use.

, The intro screen or screens set up the film make it look blockbuster worthy. The intro should consist of the title, maybe a narration in the beginning if you wish, (again all depending on the movie type.) You will get a feel for what is acceptable and what is not as you experiment. To create an intro to the film click on the home tab on the top tool bar. In small print next to the snapshot logo, will be a caption named “title,” go ahead and click on this tool. Now at the top tool bar you will have many options as to that you wish your title to consist of. You may change the wording in the text box, the font, the size, the background color, the outline color, and the effect in which you wish the title clip to present itself. Go ahead and experiment with some versions of a title clip. You may add as many title clips as you deem necessary.


Credits are essentially the exact same process as the title. Go to the home tab on the tool bar, then under the title caption you will see the credits caption. If you click on the credits tab the process and tool bar layout will be the same. Then you may add your credits as you wish.

, What should be done here is to first think about what scenes of the film require music or otherwise sound effects i.e.… Gun shots, explosions…etc. Make sure that the format of the music or audio clip is sustainable in Windows Live Movie Maker. Use either a WAV. Or MP3. File format for your audio. Both are compatible with the movie maker.


Go to the Home tab on the tool bar and click on it. Within the tab is a caption with the logo of an eighth note labeled, “add music.” Click on the add music tab and search your directory for a song or audio clip that you wish to use.
When you finally select your audio clip, the audio will automatically be fitted to the film. You may then drag the audio over to your desired place and have it play during a particular part of the film. As with video clips, you may trim and remove portions of audio clips. Simply click on the audio clip and allow it to play to the point where you wish it to split, and conduct the splitting process the same as you would with a regular film clip.

, To create the final product you will want to save your movie to your computer. To save the movie, go to the home tab and on the very far right side of the tool bar you will see an icon labeled save movie, you will not want to click directly on the icon, but rather on the words listed below which will bring you to a fold down menu that has an option to save the movie to your computer. you will then always have a master copy that you can publish on the Internet or otherwise burn a DVD for. The rendering and publishing process will take a while depending on the length and complexity of the film. More transitions, audio, and credits will take longer for the film to publish.

, The combined file will be in the order that the videos are listed in, starting with the top of the list.

, Click the Scissors button next to the clip you want to edit. A new window will open, allowing you to skip to the exact spot you want. Set a new start point for the clip by clicking the """" button to set an end point.


The new segment will appear beneath the original video file.
Note that Any DVD Converter can run into problems when trying to join trimmed clips. For best results, output the trimmed files first into new video files, and then add the new output to your project.
FLV files can be difficult to trim, as Flash video uses a different frame system. For best results, convert the FLV video to MP4 first and then trim it.

, Once you're satisfied with the order and the length of the clips, select all of the files in the list. You can do this by holding Ctrl/⌘ Cmd and click each one, or you can press Ctrl/⌘ Cmd+A.

, The videos will be merged together, with subsequent videos indented beneath the first clip. Select the first video in the list before proceeding.

, Click the Output Profile drop-down menu at the top of the window. Select the device that you are planning on playing the video on. If you're going to play the video on a computer, or want it to be compatible with the most devices, select ""Customized MP4 Movie (*.mp4)"".

, Click the folder icon in the Output Folder line in the right sidebar. Make sure ""Basic Settings"" is selected to see the Output Folder button. Select a folder that you can easily access and find your merged video file.


Click the ""File Name"" line to set the file name of the merged video clip.

, The wrong settings could lead to a bad file or could cause Any DVD Converter to crash. Adjust your settings before you start the merging process.

Click the Gear button at the top of the window.
Click the ""Video"" tab and uncheck all of the boxes in the ""Video Resize"" section.

, Right-click on the top file in the list and select ""Start Converting"". Any DVD Converter will begin merging the clips into a file in the location and format you specified.Depending on the length and size of the videos, the conversion may take a while to complete.

, Any DVD Converter can get overloaded with too many clips. If you're having problems merging many different clips together, it's recommended that you do them in small batches and then join the batches together.

For example, if you have 15 clips to join, join five clips together at a time. This will leave you with three output videos. You can then load these three output videos into Any DVD Converter and join them as normal.
