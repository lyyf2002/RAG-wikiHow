Export your creation (mastering).,
While optional, it's recommended to go back and ""master"" your track.,
Distribute your remix.",How to Remix," This is where most of the work happens. In your digital audio workstation, also known as DAW, you can import audio tracks which comprise the beats, instrumental tracks, vocals, sound effects, etc. Some software will let you perform complex operations such as matching tempos or pitch correction. Almost all will allow you to slice, transpose, reverse, timestretch within the framework of your editing software.


If you're on a budget, a great application to get started is Audacity. It's free, and it works with all the major operating systems. If you take the time to learn it can perform just as well as most commercial software.
Ableton is a good choice if budget is not an issue.For about $500 more than free, Ableton is geared towards live performance. You can prepare your remixes at home, of course, but you can also perform them in real time.;
, Remixing is a derivative art form; that is, it builds directly on at least one other work of art. Selecting which track you want to remix is an important part of the process. Here are some things to consider:


Choose something with a hook, melody, chorus, or other element that appeals to you. Remixing usually involves repeating part of the song several times in a row, so pick one that doesn't ""get old"" too quickly and holds your interest.
What you usually have to work with is the final mix of the original track, taken directly from the CD. If you can get separate tracks directly from the recording artist, especially for vocals, it will make your remix cleaner and your work easier.
While nothing is as good as having the original, separate tracks, Audacity and Ableton both offer tools that let you remove vocals from a mix (as is done for karaoke), or remove everything but the vocals. This is not easy, and rarely 100% effective, but you can attenuate the backing tracks enough so that in context, the vocals sound like they're isolated. Noise removal plugins are best at this, try to isolate the noise/vocal frequencies from those sweet melodies you want to keep.

, This is where you stamp the track with your contribution. This can range from changing the feel, by adding new rhythm tracks, to total destruction.

, Unauthorized use of an author's tracks can get you in trouble with the law.


Think about what sections you like best—–what would you keep intact, and what will you change? If necessary, listen to the track a few more times to help refine your vision for the final remix.

, To make the remix job easier, you want to isolate not just the melodic elements, but the rhythmic elements as well.


You can do this in an audio editing application like Ableton or Audacity. These apps make it easy to cut loops.
Cutting loops is a fairly simple process. First, listen to your file, and identify the sections you'd like to cut. Then, select the phrase you'd like in your audio editing software, making sure to grab complete measures. A way to test your cut is to loop playback on the selection. If it sounds jumpy at the loop point, you may be selecting too much, or too little.
If your software lets you play your loop and adjust the endpoints at the same time, start playback on the loop, and adjust the beginning first—make sure it's starting exactly where you want it to start. Once that's set, go to the end of the loop, and make small changes in the loop length until the sounds seamless, natural, and most importantly, in-tempo.
Watch out for loops that include reverb tails or cymbal crashes, since these will often extend past the end of a phrase. Conversely, chopping a reverberation like that can be a really interesting effect.
Making sure your loops are cut precisely will make tempo correction within your looping software more accurate. In programs like Sonar and Acid, which use nearly the same correction methods, this is imperative.
Time correction is achieved by either specifying the BPM of the loop (often detected automatically), or by inserting markers in the loop inspection window, to indicate where each beat falls. All of this will accomplish the same result as cutting and looping, while still preserving the original file.
You can also take this time to do some processing on your loops. If you only have the full mixdown, you can bring out vocals or individual instruments somewhat with EQ.
Keep in mind that there is no way to completely isolate a single instrument or voice after a mixdown. For example, you can lighten up the lower register (kick, toms) and bass lines by rolling off the low end. This will keep things from getting muddy, if you use the vocals from that loop over a new bassline, or new drums. For example a boost at 3-5khz will brighten a sound up a lot more whereas increasing a frequency in the low range will bring out more of a muddy, bass mix.

, Try all the available effects in your DAW/audio editing software to see how they will sound on each part. There are plenty of things to choose from, including delay, phaser, chorus, flanger, filters and other EQ, reverb, amplitude modulation, ring modulation, frequency modulation, time stretching, pitch shifting or correction, vocoder and more. Playing around with these styles will help you figure out what you like, as well as training your ear a bit. Always remember that an under produced track is always better than an overproduced one, make it simple but have fun.

, First, set the BPM (tempo—beats per minute) and time signature (usually 4/4 in popular music, but sometimes 3/4) in your looping software. Next, import your loops. Once they are imported and time corrected, you should be able to choose any tempo you like, with very little loss of quality. Now you can start to reconstruct the track.


A safe and easy way would be to follow the form of the original (intro, verse, chorus, verse, bridge, and chorus) but you can also completely change it and make it your own. You can layer the vocals from the verse over a portion of the chorus. You can take a verse as-is, cut individual measure of vocals, and superimpose them reversed. You can reharmonize the vocal or lead lines by introducing completely different elements. Have fun, and experiment!

, When your remix has a start and finish, and you are satisfied with it, you should export. Save all or export to a WAV or AIFF file (don't encode an MP3 just yet). Load this into your audio editing software, and normalize it to 99%. This will ensure that your levels at their highest point reach almost the maximum volume. In addition, you can make your remix seem louder by applying a compressor effect to it before normalizing.

, This means applying effects to bring out certain parts of your mix. If you want a harsher bass overall or brighter highs. A good mastering is the difference between a closet recording and a professional studio.

, Convert the file to MP3, using your favorite MP3 converter.

",How to Change Your Records Into CDs," The standard sound recorder application that comes with most PCs will not enable you to record an LP to your hard drive. There are, however, a variety of programs that record audio, ranging from freeware to very expensive professional editing software. Some of these obviously work better than others, and some have more features, but in general you want a program that writes files directly to the hard drive and that enables you to do some minor editing of the recorded files. For a more thorough discussion of recording and editing software, including reviews, visit the external links listed in the citations, Clive Backham's page in particular.;
, You will need to amplify and equalize the sound from your turntable in order to record it onto your computer. If your turntable has a built-in preamp, you should be able to plug it directly into your computer's sound card. If you don't have a built-in preamp, you can either plug the turntable into a stereo receiver and plug the receiver into your computer sound card, or you can purchase a preamp--you can get these at most computer, audio or electronics stores--and plug your turntable into that. Make sure you buy a preamp with ""RIAA Equalization"" - cheaper ones may not have this, and it is necessary for LPs made after about 1950.

, You may need to purchase cables--standard RCA cables, most likely--to connect all the components. Depending on the type of input and output jacks you have on your sound card, turntable, preamp and receiver, you may also need converters to allow you to connect each component to the next. Cables and converters can be purchased at most electronics or audio stores, and if you don't know what you need simply bring in the equipment you have. In the most common case, being you already have a turntable connected to a stereo system, the only additional cable you should need is an inexpensive 3.5mm Stereo to RCA Cable to connect the receiver to the computer, which can alternately be used to play sound from your computer through your stereo system.

, If you are not using a preamp you'll need to run a cable from the headphone or ""audio out"" jack on the turntable or stereo to the input or ""line in"" jack on your computer's sound card. If you have a preamp, connect the cable from the turntable to the ""line in"" jack on the preamp and then connect another cable from the ""audio out"" jack on the preamp to the ""line in"" jack on the computer sound card.

, Obviously a clean record plays a lot better than a dirty one, and if you're making a recording you want the vinyl to sound its best. Your best bet is to use a professional LP-cleaning machine, but these can be expensive and hard to find (you can get similar results, however, if you have a wet-dry vacuum cleaner and some cleaning solution). You can also wash records in the kitchen sink or use specially-designed brushes to clear surface dust. You want to be very careful cleaning your records, and there are more tips and warnings than can be listed here, so check out the external links for more information.

, You can adjust the input level either on the stereo receiver or in the recording software, however ""line"" outputs on stereos are generally fixed-volume so it's usually best to adjust the recording volume on your computer. You want to make sure that the input is loud enough so that the resulting CD isn't significantly quieter than your other CDs. More importantly, you must ensure that the input volume isn't too loud. If your recording level goes above 0 dB at any point, the sound quality will be distorted, so it's important to stay below this threshold. Try to identify the peak volume (the loudest part) on the LP you wish to record. Some software programs will find the peak for you when you play the record through; otherwise, you'll have to do a little guesswork. To prevent distortion, set the input level (from the LP) peak volume at about -3 dB.

, Make sure your program is running, and your turntable, and receiver or preamp, are on. Start playing the record and press the ""record"" button in your audio software. Record only a small bit of audio to see if everything works, then adjust settings in the program and on the player accordingly. You may also want to play the entire LP to make sure there no skips.

, Press the ""record"" button in your software before starting the LP. Play the album the whole way through as you transfer the music into electronic format, and stop recording only after the LP has finished playing (you can cut out the silence at the beginning and end of the recording later). Your software program may split tracks for you automatically, but if it does not, don't worry about splitting them now.

, If the LP you recorded is in great condition and if your recording equipment is of high quality and is correctly configured, you may not need to do much editing at all. Probably, however, you will at least want to delete any long silences at the beginning and end of the recording, and you should also split the tracks so that you can skip from song to song on your CD. Depending on your editing software, you should also be able to take out or minimize most background noise and imperfections, and normalize the volume. The procedures for such editing vary from program to program, so it's best to consult your software manual or help files.

, Consult your manual or help files.

If for some reason you don’t have QuickTime on your Mac, you can download it from Apple as well.;
, You can find the QuickTime Player in your “Applications” folder on your Mac. On Windows, it will be in your “Programs” folder inside the “QuickTime” folder.


Once you open QuickTime, you may see a start-up window appear. Close this window out.

, There are a few options for starting a new audio recording with QuickTime. Right click on the app icon in the Dock if you are on a Mac. You will see “New Audio Recording” as an option. Click this option to open the audio recording box.
Alternatively, you can go up to “File” > “New Audio Recording”.
On a Windows, Choose “File” > “New Audio Recording”.

, Click the dropdown arrow next to your red record button to pull up more options. The dropdown will show you which microphone you are currently recording with. You can use your internal microphone if your computer has one. Make sure “Built-In Microphone: Internal microphone” is checked.
If you have another microphone plugged into your computer, you can click the other ""Built-In Input"" option to record with your external microphone.

, Whether you’re using your computer’s microphone or an external one, you want to be in a quiet room with little to no external noise.

Go into a quiet room that isn’t too open or large to get a crisper sound when recording.
Large, open rooms can cause an echo which will distort the quality of your sound. Rooms with too much noise can cause ambient noise or feedback to get picked up by your microphone.

, QuickTime will have an option in your dropdown list to adjust the quality level of your recording. You can set your recording to either “Medium” or “High”.


Click the drop arrow next to the recording button to access your quality options. You will find these options below your microphone options.
Choosing a higher quality will give you better sounding audio, but will make your file larger.

, Adjust the slider beneath your recording button to change the recording volume.


The higher you set the recording volume the more noise your microphone will pick up. If you are in a smaller, quiet room, you may only need to drag the slider about halfway up, or a little past.
If you bring the slider too high, the microphone will pick up on quieter noises and can cause distortion feedback or a humming noise. Sometimes you have to bring the slider down to the minimum for the best sound. Do a quick test to make sure the level is good for you before your final recording.

, Once you are ready to record your audio, click on the red dot to begin. QuickTime will start recording. It’s a good idea to give yourself a few seconds before speaking so you have room to trim if you need to.
QuickTime will begin to record and you will see a counter of how long your recording is.
There will also be two bars that flash, depicting your volume levels. You want these input levels to stay around the middle of the bar as much as possible. Too low and the audio won’t get picked up. too high and it might get distorted.
If you find that your input volume is fluctuating too much on either spectrum, adjust your distance to the microphone.

, When you're done recording, click the square gray Stop Button in the center.


Once you click the Stop Button, you will see a Play button as well as both Fast Forward and Rewind buttons.
Above these buttons will be a time tracker and it will show how long your recording is.

, Before saving your recording for export, you can listen to it and make any trims you may need.


Click the Play Button to listen to your recording.
If you are satisfied with the sound, you can also edit your recording to trim out any parts you don’t need. Go to “Edit” > “Trim” to bring up your trimming options. You will now have a yellow bar which you can use to quickly cut any parts at the beginning or end of your recording that you may not need. Or to just take a smaller sample of what you recorded.
Once you’ve made adjustments, click the Trim Button to save your edits.

, After you make your edits, give your recording one more listen to make sure that you’ve kept what you want.


Your recording will now only play the parts you kept inside of the markers on your yellow trim box.

, Go to “File” > “Save” to save your recording.


Here you will be able to give your recording a title and choose which location on your computer to save the file to.

, Once you’ve saved your recording you can also export it.


You can export your audio file to iTunes to have the file saved in your music library for easy access later. This is helpful if you need to listen to it on a mobile device or add it into another software like iMovie.
Listen to it again. After you’ve saved and exported your file. Locate it either in your saved location or through iTunes. Give it one more listen to make sure everything saved correctly.

You can quickly see your version by pressing ⊞ Win+Pause and checking the ""Windows edition"" section of the System window that appears.

, If you are using a version of Windows 7 that supports DVD playback, you should be able to load the DVD in Windows Media Player or Windows Media Center without issue.

, There are a few reasons a DVD may not be playing in Windows 7:If the DVD is from another region, there's a very good chance that it will not play. This is because regions are hard-coded into DVD drives to help fight piracy. To play DVDs from other regions, you'll need to flash your DVD player's firmware, which is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.
If you have another DVD player program installed, it may be messing up Windows Media Player. Either use the other DVD player, or uninstall the program so that Windows Media Player works properly again.
Your drive may be physically failing. If this is the case, you'll need to install a replacement. See How to Install a DVD Drive for details.

, There's a good chance that using a program like VLC or MPC-HC will allow you to play DVDs when Windows Media Player isn't working. You can download VLC for free from videolan.org/vlc and MPC-HC for free from mpc-hc.org. Both are open-source and free of spyware.

Browse for the video you want.",How to Recover Deleted Videos," The Recycle Bin (Trash on Mac OS X) holds files before they are permanently deleted, which allows you to restore in case your change your mind or deleted something by accident. To restore a video from the Recycle Bin, open the Recycle Bin on your desktop, right-click on the video, and select Restore. The video will be returned to its original location.


Large files may bypass the Recycle Bin. If that's the case then you may need recovery software.
If you are using an iPod or iPhone and need to recover a deleted video, see Step 4.;
, If you are using an Apple or Google phone, there is a good chance that your video may be backed up i your personal cloud storage. If you are using a Google device, check your Google+ Videos, as many newer devices will automatically backup videos to your Google+ account. If you are using an iPhone or iPod, check your iTunes Videos library. Your video may synced and available to transfer back to your device.

, If you can't find your videos on your computer, don't save anything new or delete anything else. By not saving anything new, you greatly increase your chances of recovering the video. This is because when a file is deleted from your computer, it is actually set to be overwritten by new data. If no new data is saved, then that data does not get overwritten and it can usually be recovered.

, Make sure that you don't save it to the drive that you need to recover the video from, or you may overwrite the video you need to recover. To be completely safe, download it on a different computer and then put it on a thumb drive. Recovery programs can search hard drives, USB drives, SD cards, and even iPods and other portable media players. Some of the more popular free programs include:


Recuva
FreeUndelete
ADRC Data Recovery
Data Rescue (OS X)
FileSalvage (OS X)
Get the portable version of the recovery program if possible. This will allow you to run the program from a thumb drive without having to install it on the drive that you want to recover the video from.. Not all file recovery programs offer portable versions.If you are attempting to recover a video from a portable device, flash drive, SD card, you don't need to worry about portable versions or not using your computer's drive. Simply download and install the recovery program on your computer.

, If you are trying to recover a video from a camera or iPod, plug it into the computer using a USB cable. You will need to put your iPod into DFU mode in order for the recovery software to access it. SD cards should be inserted into an SD card reader or adapter so that the computer can access it.

, Each program is different, but they all follow the same basic procedure. If you are running a portable version of a recovery program, you will often need to specify where the recovered video should be placed. To maximize recoverability, you should place recovered videos on a separate drive than where they are being recovered from.

, Browse for the disk, drive, or device that the file was deleted from. Most recovery programs will ask what type of file you are searching for, so specify the video format if possible to speed up the search. You can also specify the video name, or get a list of all recoverable files to browse through.Some programs will give you the option to perform a deep scan while looking for files. This will take significantly longer, but may result in more files found.

, Once the scan has returned results, look through the list to see if your video was recovered. Different programs will have different methods for recovery, but in general you just need to select your file and click the Restore button.


Not all videos will be 100% recoverable. This is because files are often stored in multiple parts of your hard drive, and one part of the file may have been overwritten.
Some programs restore the video to its original location, others will restore it to a Recovery folder that you specify.

Be aware that the HR manager will usually be the one checking references.,
Know what references are used for.,
Understand that the hiring managers want personalized references.,
Choose the right people.,
Try to match your references to the job you're applying for.,
Avoid using friends and family members as references.,
Contact the referees you have in mind.,
Remind your referees about who you are.,
Give your referees permission to speak freely about you.,
Acknowledge the importance of your referees.,
Remember to thank your referees.,
Keep your referees involved in the process.,
Stay in touch with your referees over time.",How to Know What to Expect from a Reference Check," Human resource managers (rather than hiring managers) are usually the ones who check references. They usually try to do this as quickly as possible, as they are anxious to get the open position filled quickly.;
, Usually the HR manager will check at least three references per finalized applicant.


These references are not something that guarantees you the job, they are more like a confirmation, an attestation that you are who you portrayed yourself to be in the interview.
For instance, if you project yourself as someone who is punctual and good at his work, the HR manager will want a reference that showcases exactly that - anything different might raise suspicions about you.

, For the hiring managers, generic reference emails or letters are not worth much. They want references that give them specific, personalized answers to the questions they ask.


For example, a reference letter that states that you are good at following orders is not much good to a company who is looking for someone with leadership abilities.

, Your selection has to be impeccable when it comes to the referees you choose; you need to find people whom you have worked with before, who took a liking towards you. Do not choose anyone who was hostile towards you or could be holding anything against you.Usually, the most appropriate references include:


Your last boss, provided you left on cordial terms.
A colleague who was both a friend and someone with whom you had an active working relationship.
A client that you dealt with while in your previous employment, who you left a favorable. impression on.

, The references also have to be in accordance with the job profile you are applying for recently.


For instance, if you are applying for a sales job, you could have one of your previous clients as a reference, as they are someone who can really attest to your sales skills.

, It is better to keep friends and family out of your reference list, unless you have no other option than to include a family member as a previous supervisor.


The problem is that your family members' opinions and appraisals of your work are considered to be biased, and therefore untrustworthy.
If you must include friends, then include the ones with whom you have had an active work relationship.

, Let the person know that you are job hunting and ask them if they would be willing to provide you with a reference.


If they agree, take down their accurate and latest contact details so your prospective employer can reach them easily when need be.
Make sure they are not going to change their cell phone numbers anytime soon. Also, never rely on one reference alone. You should prepare at least four of them, and two of these should ideally be people who supervised you directly.
Remember to tell your referees about when they can expect a call, otherwise they may be caught off guard or unprepared, which isn't good for you.

, The biggest problem that can arise is that the reference does not remember you in enough detail to talk about you, as this will create a bad impression. Therefore meet the person beforehand and help them remember the work you did together or the work you did for them, whichever it is, so that the reference can give a convincing review about you. When you are discussing the work you did together you can focus on a couple of things like:


The work you did on a certain project that turned out well.
Various things that you did that directly or indirectly helped the company’s growth.
Special projects that you undertook alone.
You can also talk about any accolades you received while you were in employment.

, There are a lot of legal bindings on people these days, so your referees may feel unsure about what they can and can't say when they are giving a reference.Therefore, it's important that you have a chat with each of your references beforehand and let them know that they can speak openly about you, without having to wait for prompts from the employer.
You can also coach your referees a little if they are unsure about what to say. If you're applying for a research position, ask them to elaborate a little on the research you did while working for them. Your referees will often appreciate a little guidance in giving you the best reference possible., A reference may not be the entire reason you get a job, but there is no denying the fact that it can be instrumental in raising the odds in your favor. So, once the reference call is complete, what do you do next? Fall out of touch with you reference? No - as a smart job-hunter there are a number of things that you need to do:

, After the reference check has been carried out, the referees may feel that they are part of your job hunt and this increases their interest in your endeavor.


If you do not update them, they may get the notion that you are not serious about the job. This should not be the case, therefore it's important to remember to thank them, regardless of whether they got a call from an employer or not.
Value the time that they were ready to invest for you and show them that you appreciate the gesture.

, After the referee has talked with the employer, be in touch and let them know how the whole thing turned out, whether you got an offer or not.


If you didn't get the job, let them know what you are going to do next. This makes them feel more involved and tilts the situation further in your favor for the future.
Remember that you may need to ask them for another reference down the line.

, Imagine that your referee has undergone a great loss, but you have not been in touch with them. Your potential employer asks you whether they can call the reference at that time, and you say yes.


However, the HR manager finds out that the reference is in no state to talk and that you have been out of touch with a reference for last six months. How do you think that sounds for your reputation in the company’s eyes?
When you are in constant touch with your referees, you know what their situation is at any given time and whether they are willing or able to talk to the employer or not.

Build a website or blog.,
Get a professional promotional video.,
Send your App to app review websites.,
Reach out to the press.,
Reach out to bloggers.,
Podcast.,
Apply for awards.,
Make your app free at launch.,
Get your app social.,
Have App review sites blast your app to their social media followers.,
Optimize your App for the Appstore.",How to Promote Your App," No one should go into the app business without seriously considering the fact that they need to set up an online presence for their apps where they can let their audience know what their app(s) and what it is all about.


With your own webpage you are able to entice or grab your visitors, capture emails of potential customers who may be interested in your new apps when you release them etc. A good tool for this is to use WordPress. WordPress has a lot of tools, plugins and themes that will help you to make that eye-catching site for your apps;
, A video is an effective way of telling a story, of sharing your thoughts, or conveying your message. By making a video, your audience will be enticed to learn more about your app, and eventually be loyal users. Find a site that will allow you to promote your videos. Don’t forget to add your video to YouTube and share it on social media sites.

, App Review sites are great promotional methods for your apps and will no doubt get you a lot of traffic. Once you get a mention from these blogs, it will help generate positive publicity for your app.

, Press release is a great way of getting publicity for your app(s). Check out free press release sites at avangate.com for list of sites you can submit your app to for free

, Find blogs that write about mobile, apps, shopping etc. basically blogs that post that will be able to get your app notice and is somewhat similar to your app. For example if your app is about shopping then find shopping blogs and reach out to the admin of the blog. Bloggers are very influential and most have a large following.

, More and more people are using podcast as they enjoy the benefits that it carries. Therefore a good way to get your app notice is to create a podcast about your app and try to reach out to your market and publish it on iTunes or on your own website.

, Awards will get your app lots of publicity, if you are lucky.

, If you are releasing a paid app, make it free at launch and then try to build some publicity around this. A lot of people will rush to download your app before it becomes paid.

, Millions of people are on social media sites on a daily basis, therefore create a Facebook page about your app or app business and then try to get persons to like your page. It is very important that after you create your page that you post to it regularly. Post things that your reader might be interested in, eg post a review about the new iPhone 6, etc

, Many app review sites offer social media promotion where they will talk about your app on their Facebook and twitter page. This will generate a lot of interest about your app

, This is one proven method that many app developers don’t think about much. AppStore Optimization (ASO) looks at finding the right keywords, app icon and screenshots, amongst other things so that your app will be easy to find on the appstore.

Have a good idea of what your program will do.,
If you already know another programming language just start learning the syntax and looking up equivalents to various commands.,
Learn how to compile and run a basic program, this will be your first program, typically it will just print ""Hello World"" to the screen and exit.,Learn about variable types (INTEGER, REAL, CHARACTER, LOGICAL)

,
Learn about the concept of variables, arrays, functions, and subroutines.,
Learn conditional statements, such as the ""IF"" and ""SELECT CASE"" statements.,
Learn loops and the ""EXIT"" and ""CYCLE"" statements.

,
Learn about SUBROUTINES and FUNCTIONS.

,Learn Recursion (F90 and later) and other advanced topics

,
Read or look up some books on Scientific Programming.,

A simple ""Hello World"" Code:





Note: you have to space each line over 7 spaces
C HELLO.F -- HELLO WORLD PROGRAM
C PUBLIC DOMAIN
PROGRAM HELLO
WRITE(*,*) 'Hello World'
END PROGRAM

Write(*,*) means ""write some unformatted text to standard output""
Why the spaces?,
Remember that Fortran 90 introduced the ""Free Form"" source code, allowing code to be written without the spaces and without the 72 character limit.,
Compile the two fortran files:

.,
Speed up your code by writing efficient code.",How to Program in Fortran," Think about what sort of data is needed as input, how to structure the output, and include some intermediate output so you can monitor the progress of your calculation. This will be very useful if you know your calculation will run for a long time or involves multiple complicated steps.

, Otherwise, you should do this:

, Don't worry about all the minor details of the syntax, just become comfortable with compiling and running.

,, Variables are where information is stored, functions and subroutines are pieces of code that can be executed, and arrays are groups of variables.

, The ""IF"" statement will be one of your most frequently used statements, you can execute code based on whether a condition is true or not (e.g. whether the color the user provided was red).

,,,, For example, the book ""Numerical Recipes in Fortran"" is both a good text on scientific programming algorithms and a good introduction to how to put together codes. More recent editions include chapters on how to program in a mixed-language environment and parallel programming. Another example is ""Modern Fortran in Practice"" written by Arjen Markus. The book gives an insight into how to write Fortran programs in twenty-first-century style in accordance with the latest Fortran standards., This is a relic from the past. In the early days of computer, there were no terminals. You entered data via punch-cards. A ""C"" in the first line on the punch card indicated a comment line. The next 4 spaces were reserved for line numbers and the 6th space indicated that the current line is a continuation of the previous line. This is needed because punch cards were only 80 characters wide. So, any line longer than 72 characters would be chopped off! Because of this legacy, lines of fortran are sometimes called ""Cards""









, For example, ""Hello, World"" could be written as


 ! HELLO.F90 -- HELLO WORLD PROGRAM
 ! PUBLIC DOMAIN
PROGRAM HELLO
WRITE (*, *) 'Hello, World!' ! Display 'Hello, World'
END PROGRAM
Fortran

, Typically, this is done by issuing the commands (the > indicates the command line prompt)

>f77 -c main.f
and
>f77 -c morestuff.f
which generates the files: main.o and morestuff.o
then
f77 -o killerap.x main.o morestuff.o
which links main.o and morestuff.o to make your killerap.x. The -c and -o flags are pretty common...but you should read up on compilation flags for your particular compiler.;
, However, most compilers include optimization algorithms that improve things even more. These are typically turned on by including a -O , -O2, or -O3 flag when compiling (again depending upon your version of fortran).

Generally, the lowest level -O or -O2 level is best. Be aware that using the more aggressive optimization option can introduce errors in complex codes and may even slow things down! TEST YOUR CODE.

Set a Nudge Value.,
Select the region from your audio or MIDI file you want to nudge.,
Nudge the region.",How to Nudge in Pro Tools," Setting up Nudge Values will allow you to determine the value of each nudge increment.


Open the Nudge Value menu. In your Pro Tools session, locate the Nudge Value menu by locating the toolbar on the right side of the Main Counter and below the Grid Value menu. Click on the downward arrow to open the Nudge Value menu.
Designate a Timebase in the bottom portion of the Nudge Value menu. You can choose from Bars and Beats, Minutes and Seconds or from your own sample database. Depending on your selection, the Nudge Values menu will update slightly in the top portion of the Nudge Value menu.
Choose your desired Nudge Value based on the Timebase you designated. If you chose Bars and Beats, you can choose your desired bar, note or tempo, but if you chose Minutes and Seconds, you can choose from milliseconds or seconds.;
, Activate the Selector tool by clicking on the third icon from the left shaded blue, directly above the timeline bar. Once the Selector tool is activated, double-click on the region you want to nudge. You may also use the Grabber tool, which is the fourth icon from the left in the shape of a hand and usually a faster method than the Selector tool option, as you will only have to click once.

, Once you have selected your region, use the plus and minus keys on your keyboard to move or nudge the region forwards or backwards within the timeline into its desired place. The value of the nudge move will reflect the nudge value you had chosen earlier; for example if you chose one-eighth note from the Bars and Beats category and you nudge one move forward, your nudge will move forward by a one-eighth note. If you are using a keyboard without the plus and minus keys, use specific keyboard strokes.


On Windows computers, press the Start and Period buttons simultaneously to nudge the region forward. To nudge your region backward, press the Start and Comma buttons simultaneously.
On Macintosh computers, press the Control and Period buttons simultaneously to nudge the region forward. To nudge your region backward, press the Control and Comma buttons simultaneously.

Be prepared for a two-step process.,
Determine whether your magazine is to be a freely distributed one or one requiring payment.,
While there are several issuers of barcodes in the United States, it is highly recommended that you obtain yours from PIPS, Inc. PIPS, which stands for Product Identification and Processing Systems, is located in New York and is one of the oldest companies in the US specializing in bar coding technology.,
Before PIPS, or any other barcode provider, can issue your barcode, you will need to provide the following information:


Title name
Frequency
Issue
Cover Price

,
Make the relevant payment.",How to Obtain a Magazine Barcode," What most start up magazine publishers fail to realize is that obtaining a barcode is a two part process. First you will need to apply for and obtain a BIPAD number and subsequently a barcode.;
, If you’re a novice to magazine publishing, initially you may be somewhat overwhelmed by the intricacies of launching a new title. Whether or not you want a freely distributed or paid magazine is one aspect of starting a magazine that is pretty easy and straightforward. There are many factors that one should consider before making such a momentous decision, (a subject voluminous enough for an article, if not two, all by itself). Be that as it may, if you’ve decided to have a paid publication (with a cover price) and will utilize the services of a paid distributor, then you have to obtain a BIPAD and a Universal Product Code (UPC) or barcode:


Due to the computerized nature of magazine distribution, retail outlets, supermarket chains and the like, magazine distributors cannot handle magazines that don’t possess UPC technology. The important thing to remember here is that obtaining a UPC, henceforth referred to as a barcode, is in effect a two-part process;
A BIPAD, in a nutshell, is a unique five-digit number that is given to a magazine for the purposes of insertion (encoding) into a barcode. It’s perhaps best to think of a BIPAD as your magazine’s social security number that will be utilized by your distributor and retail outlets that carry your publication for identification, inventory and tracking purposes. Details about BIPAD coding and barcode symbols are noted a little later on.
The BIPAD numbering system is overseen by BIPAD, Inc. with the administrative and issuance duties handled by Harrington Associates located in Norwalk, Connecticut. The minimum processing and administration fee for a BIPAD is $300 dollars. There is a sliding fee scale based upon the number of BIPADs that are required. Since each BIPAD issued is unique to the publication that it’s issued for, as alluded to earlier, it is only necessary to have one BIPAD per publication or individual title that will have separate distribution records maintained by distributors and/or wholesalers. If you plan to launch two or more titles under the same business name and/or corporation, then each title will require its own BIPAD number. Unlike the add on codes, that are encoded into the barcode, BIPAD numbers are never altered and do not have to be obtained for each issue of your publication. The BIPAD application is simple and straightforward and should take only ten minutes or less to fill out. Once completed, the application can be faxed, emailed or mailed to Harrington Associates. If you opt to make your payment by credit card, once Harrington Associates receives your completed application, it is possible to receive your BIPAD number the same day. Bear in mind that, due to the sheer quantity of applications that Harrington Associates receives, a more likely scenario is that it will take two to five business days in order for your application to be processed and it may even take up to a week to receive your final confirmation. Once you receive your BIPAD, you will now be able to apply for a barcode.

, Many of their clients are magazine publishers and as such, PIPS is quite knowledgeable about barcode tolerances and the proper placement of bar codes on magazines. In addition, and probably just as important, they provide prompt and reliable service and can deliver barcodes via email in a matter of hours.

,, Once you provide PIPS with this information, they will then be able to issue your barcode. The cost of a barcode is around $35 dollars, is usually delivered via email in an EPS (Encapsulated Post Script) file and can be applied for and received in the same day. The EPS insures the integrity of the barcode across various platforms, i.e. Mac or PC and is unchangeable once created. Now that you have your BIPAD and barcode, you’re ready to distribute your magazine. Now, wasn’t that easy?

",How to Make a Map Using OpenLayers 3," If you don't already have a webpage you want to insert the map into, you can use the following HTML5 template; save it as ‘map_page.html’ :




<!doctype html>
 
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
  <meta charset=""utf-8"">
  <title>My OpenLayers 3 Map</title>
</head>
 
<body>
  <!-- Content goes here. -->
</body>
</html>


;
, Your webpage will need to include the OpenLayers library JavaScript file. To do this, paste the following line of code into your HTML file, inside the <head></head> area, on a new line below the <title></title>:




<script src=""http://openlayers.org/en/v3.0.0/build/ol.js""
  type=""text/javascript""></script>




, OpenLayers will display the map inside an HTML element, so you need to provide one for it. Paste the following line of markup inside the <body></body>:




<div id=""map"" class=""map""></div>




, You need to set how large the map will be when it is displayed, and you should use CSS to do this. You can add the following to the document <head></head>: 




<style>
  .map {
    height: 500px;
    width: 700px;
  }
</style>




, To start writing the JavaScript code that sets up the map, you'll need to add a <script></script> area to the <body></body> after the map container div. Also inside of this, you can create the map object by calling new ol.Map() like this:




<script type='text/javascript'>
  var map = new ol.Map({ });
</script>




, OpenLayers will render (display) the map inside an HTML element such as a div or a p. The value that you must pass to the setTarget() function is simply id of the element, which we set to 'map':




map.setTarget('map');




, An OpenLayers map's view is what manages what part of of the map you see. Create a new view object that centers on the coordinates (off the coast of central Africa):Note: Unlike the Leaflet mapping library, OpenLayers 3 deals with coordinates in the format .




var view = new ol.View({
  center: ,
  zoom: 1
})
map.setView(view);




, OpenLayers maps have layers which are stacked on top of one another, and are what you actually see in a map. There are three types of layers: Image, Tile and Vector. Tile layers are are the standard 'base' layers, and can come from map providers like Google Maps, MapQuest, or OpenStreetMaps. Each layer has a source, which tells OpenLayers where the layer information is coming from.




var tile_layer = new ol.layer.Tile({
  source: new ol.source.MapQuest({layer: 'osm'})
})
map.addLayer(tile_layer);




, In OpenLayers, maps can be 'zoomed in' to one of several levels, from 0 (the most zoomed-out) to around 20 (the most zoomed in). The zoom level is set on the view object, so we have to get that and set its zoom:




map.getView().setZoom(2);




, Below is what your webpage code should look like:




<!doctype html>
 
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
  <meta charset=""utf-8"">
  <title>My OpenLayers 3 Map</title>
  <script src=""http://openlayers.org/en/v3.0.0/build/ol-debug.js""
    type=""text/javascript""></script>
  <style>
    .map {
      height: 500px;
      width: 700px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
 
<body>
  <div id=""map"" class=""map""></div>
 
  <script type='text/javascript'>
 
    var map = new ol.Map({ });
 
    map.setTarget('map');
 
    var view = new ol.View({
      center: ,
      zoom: 1
    })
    map.setView(view);
 
    var tile_layer = new ol.layer.Tile({
      source: new ol.source.MapQuest({layer: 'osm'})
    })
    map.addLayer(tile_layer);
 
    map.getView().setZoom(2);
 
  </script>

Be safe, not sorry.",How to Make Software Hipaa Compliant," You need to track who accesses a patient’s record. This means that you need to create separate usernames and passwords for each person who has access to patient health information. As part of the audit log, you should track the following:


which record the user accessed
the date it was accessed
whether the user viewed the information, updated it, or deleted it;
, HIPAA also requires that an employee only see the “minimum necessary” information to do their job. For example, a doctor will need to see more health information than a receptionist. Accordingly, you need to create levels of access, in which you provide only as much information as each person needs to do their job.


Some employees might only work with certain patients. In this situation, they should be granted access only to the patient records for the people they work with.
In order to successfully create levels of access, you need to clearly define roles in your organization. This might require that you look at job descriptions and rearrange duties.

, Even if you create levels of access, there may be situations where someone needs to access all information in an emergency. For this reason, you should create an “override” which allows the person to retrieve whatever information is necessary to effectively treat patients.


Nevertheless, you should set up your software so that use of this override function undergoes scrutiny.
For example, you could set up the software so that every time someone uses the override function several other people are automatically emailed simultaneously. The software should also track whatever information this person accesses.
You should also write out a review process for each use of the override function. For example, the person who uses it might have to meet later with a supervisor to justify the use.

, HIPAA requires that you keep your data secure. In practice, this means that you should use passwords and keep the data secured behind a firewall.


You also need to ensure that your emails are secure. In particular, you must use sufficient encryption technology on your emails.
For more information on making sure your email complies with HIPAA, see Make Email HIPAA Compliant.

, You are required to get patients to sign forms authorizing your use of their information for their care. Each form should include a description of what you will use the data for and the date of expiration.


You should track these authorizations, including the date the form was signed and the name of the person signing it.
You should also scan the form and maintain a digital copy.

, HIPAA standardized the transmission of billing information. For this reason, whatever billing system you use must support the HIPAA standards.


At this point in time, virtually every billing system on the market does. Nevertheless, you should confirm with your vendor that it is HIPAA compliant.

, HIPAA also requires that you maintain your data so that a patient can see it whenever he or she requests it. This means that you must maintain backups of all information. If you keep information on paper, then you need copies stored off-site or digital scans created. If you store data electronically, then it must be backed up.


Ask vendors how they back up their systems. Find out how they ensure the continuity of the system in case of an accident.
Should you host the data system on your own servers, then you will need to find out what backup procedures you have in place, as well as your emergency plans.

, Anyone who sees your data must agree to uphold the same policies and procedures as your organization. You should therefore draft a “Business Associate” contract for all vendors to sign.


Health and Human Services has a sample contract available at http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/sample-business-associate-agreement-provisions/index.html. You can modify it to suit your purposes.
There are also sample contracts on the Internet. For example, the UT Health Science Center has a form contract you can use.You should also have your health care attorney look over any contract to make sure that it is sufficient to protect you.

, If you are opening a business, then you will need to purchase software. You also might need to hire someone to host your data on their servers (or to back up your own servers).


Ask other providers what vendors they use. Virtually all healthcare providers are covered by HIPAA, so they should have given considerable thought to whether or not their software is compliant. You should ask for recommendations.

, After getting recommendations for different vendors, you need to compare their prices. You should call them to get a quote. Their phone numbers should be on the Internet.


Prices will depend on the number of people who need to access your system, so make sure you have that number available.If your business is growing, then you should think a couple years ahead. For example, if you have five employees but think you will double in size, then make sure you get a quote for how much it costs to have 10 users. You don’t want to switch software after only a year.

, HIPAA regulations continue to evolve. You should expect the vendor to keep up with changes in the law. When contacting vendors, you should ask the following:


How does the vendor monitor changes in HIPAA regulations? Does it have an action plan for keeping up with changes in the law? Look for concrete examples. Does the company have a lawyer on staff who monitors changes in the law?
What percentage of the vendor’s clients must be HIPAA compliant? If most of the company’s clients must comply with HIPAA, then you can be sure that it will make necessary changes to comply with HIPAA—or else it will go out of business.

, You must comply with HIPAA if your organization transmits any billing information electronically to any health insurance company, including Medicaid and Medicare. The information can include invoices or other information needed to find insurance coverage. Generally, HIPAA regulates providers of the following:


therapy
counseling
medical care
any other service which bills insurance companies

, HIPAA rules are complicated and difficult to understand. In order to make sure that you are in compliance, you should hire a health care attorney for your organization. A health care attorney can help address risk management and regulatory issues.You can keep this person “on retainer,” which means that you pay a fee each month. In exchange, the lawyer is always available to answer your questions.You can get recommendations for a health care lawyer by asking other health care providers who they use. If you don’t get any recommendations, then you can visit your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program. Ask for a referral for a health care attorney.
Be sure to ask the lawyer about his or her experience. You will want someone who has extensive experience in regulatory compliance, not simply in representing businesses in lawsuits.

, Technically, you don’t need to create usernames, levels of access, or even have software in your organization. Instead, HIPAA only requires that you take “reasonable steps” and disclose only the “minimum necessary” information. Nevertheless, as a practical matter, you need to create the procedures for accessing and distributing information described above if you plan to run a modern office using computers and email. These procedures will help protect you from unauthorized disclosures of patient information.


The penalties for violating HIPAA can be severe. You can face up to a $50,000 fine for each violation, up to a maximum of $1.5 million each year. There are also criminal penalties for those who knowingly violate the rules.Accordingly, you are better off following the practices and procedures which are becoming standard in your industry. Experienced health care attorneys and vendors can guide you in the right direction.

Open or create your webpage.,
Include the Leaflet JavaScript and CSS files.,
Add an HTML map container.,
Style the map container.,
Create the map object.,
Set the map's view.,
Add a tile layer.,
Add a marker.,
Add a popup.,
Add a polyline.,
Set the style of a vector layer.,
Add a scale control.,
The finished map.

",How to Make a Map Using Leaflet," If you don't already have a webpage you want to insert the map into, you can use the following HTML5 template; save it as ‘map_page.html’ :




<!doctype html>
 
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
  <meta charset=""utf-8"">
  <title>My Leaflet Map</title>
</head>
 
<body>
  <!-- Content goes here. -->
</body>
</html>


;
, Your webpage will need to include the Leaflet JavaScript file and CSS file. To do this, paste the following line of code into your HTML file, inside the <head></head> area, on a new line below the <title></title>:




<script src=""http:</script>
<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""http:




, Leaflet will display the map inside an HTML element, so you need to provide one for it. Paste the following line of markup inside the <body></body>:




<div id=""map""></div>




, You need to set how large the map will be when it is displayed, and you should use CSS to do this. You can add the following to the document <head></head>:




<style>
  #map {
    height: 500px;
    width: 700px;
  }
</style>




, To start writing the JavaScript code that sets up the map, you'll need to add a <script></script> area to the <body></body> after the map container div. Also inside of this, you can create the map object by calling the map() function of the leaflet object, like this:




<script type='text/javascript'>
  var map = L.map('map');
</script>




, A Leaflet map's view property is what manages what part of of the map you see. Set your map's view to center on the coordinates (off the coast of central Africa):Note: Unlike the OpenLayers mapping library, Leaflet deals with coordinates in the format .




map.setView(, 2);




, Leaflet maps have layers which are stacked on top of one another, and are what you actually see in a map. There are several types of layers: UI (markers and popups), Raster (tile layers), Vector (shapes), and Other. Tile layers are are the standard 'base' layers, and can come from map providers like Google Maps, MapQuest, or OpenStreetMaps. Each layer has a urlTemplate, which tells Leaflet where the layer information is coming from. You should also provide attribution information to tell visitors where the map tiles are from.




var layer = L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
  attribution: '&copy; <a href=""http:OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
});
layer.addTo(map);




, Markers show the location of a point on a map. In Leaflet, markers are a type of ‘UI layer’, so they can be directly added to maps. Simply copy the following line of code into your <script></script> element:.




var marker = L.marker();
marker.addTo(map);




, Popups are used to add contextual information to a marker or other layer.




marker.bindPopup('Chad');
marker.openPopup();




, In Leaflet, a polyline is a line with multiple segments, and is a type of ‘vector layer’.




var polyline = L.polyline([
  , , ])
polyline.addTo(map);




, Styles determine what the vector looks like, and include line colour, line style, fill colour, opacity, and so on. Different style options apply to different types of vectors; for instance, a polyline has no area, so the fill options don't apply.




polyline.setStyle({
  color: 'red'
});




, Controls let you interact with the map in various ways, or show additional information about the map. A scale control displays how large distances are on the map, which changes when the map is zoomed.




var scale = L.control.scale()
scale.addTo(map);

Choose a certificate theme from the Design tab in the PowerPoint Ribbon.,
Determine the purpose and type.,
Insert text boxes for your certificate of appreciation.,
Fill in the text.,
Continue creating text boxes as necessary.,
Edit fonts and font sizes for each text box.,
Add a signature line above the ""Presenter Name and Title"" box in your certificate theme.,
Finish the certificate.",How to Make a Certificate2," Here, you can pick a pre-designed certificate or design your own. You can choose a certificate theme that incorporates the same colors as your company's logo, or choose a different theme and edit the colors to your liking.


Try to choose a theme with few dark or bright colors outside of the text. This will help keep your certificate looking professional.

, Is your certificate for a generic show of appreciation, or will you be mentioning a specific goal the employee achieved or a training course completed? Plan out how much information will be necessary to include on the certificate to make an appropriate number of text boxes.

, To insert text, click the Insert tab, then click the Text Box icon. Click and drag from the first visible vertical gridline to the last visible vertical gridline. Release the mouse button.


If necessary, click the edge of the text box and move it or resize it until it lies just below the first visible horizontal gridline and is the height of half of the grid.

, Right-click on the text box and choose Edit Text from the popup menu. Type your company's name in this box. Center the text within the text box by clicking the appropriate icon in the Paragraph section of the Home tab. Right-click on the text box again and choose Copy from the popup menu.


Right-click on the second visible horizontal gridline from the top of the page and choose Paste. If necessary, you can click and drag the new text box into its proper location. Click inside this box and revise the text to read ""Certificate of Completion,"" ""Certificate of Achievement"" or ""Certificate of Appreciation,"" depending on your purposes with the certificate and the achievement you hope to highlight with the certificate.

, Paste additional text boxes at the 3.75, 4.75, 5, 5.5 and 6.5 horizontal gridlines. Edit the text in each of these to contain ""is hereby granted to,"" ""Employee Name,"" ""for (name of training course, achievement, or outstanding performance),"" ""Project or Team Name,"" ""Awarded: Date"" and ""Presenter Name and Title.""


You can use these generic form descriptions in your text boxes and save this certificate of appreciation as a template to be used in the future.

, Most graphic designers recommend using no more than 3 different fonts for any 1 published document, so it's usually best to go simple and go for the most straightforward choices.


Try the Georgia font, with size 14 applied to the ""Company Name,"" ""is hereby awarded to"" and ""Awarded: Date"" boxes. Use size 32 for the ""Certificate of"" box and size 44 for the ""Employee Name"" box. Size 10 could be applied to the ""for"" description box and size 18 to the ""Project or Team Name"" box.

, Click the Shapes icon on the Insert tab in the Illustrations section and choose the first straight line example. Click and drag to draw a line from the third visible vertical line from the left side of the page to the seventh line. Release the mouse button.


Right-click on the line and choose ""Format Shape"" from the menu. Adjust the width to 1.75 in the Line Style section. Choose a color from the Theme Colors section which is in the Line Color section.

, Decorate your certificate of appreciation with a thick border, adjust font colors and weights or insert your company's logo in one of the corners. Save your certificate and print it on standard paper to review. You might consider showing it to some coworkers or your boss for feedback before finishing them all up and printing them on cardstock.


When you're satisfied with the product, print them on heavy cardstock paper, trim and frame.

Select a certificate template.,
Download the template.,
Customize the template for your purposes.,
Print your certificate.,
Have the certificate signed by the appropriate party.",How to Make a Certificate3," It's a good idea to find a professional certificate template you like and can use quickly and effectively to fill out for whatever event or occasion in which people will be honored with a certificate. Lots of simple and elegant certificate templates can be found here and here.

, Open it in Microsoft Word, preferably the '07 version or later, when you've found one that seems appropriate for your purpose. You'll be able to use the same one for annual awards or other achievements in the future.


Select the template and right-click to open the menu, then select Word to open the document.

, In each section, labeled ""Name"" or ""Date"" you should be able to click in and type the information for the person or persons being recognized. It should be quick and easy.


If lots of people are going to get the same award, you might consider saving a version of the template with some of the information filled out ahead of time to save a little bit of time. Then all you'll need to do is fill in the names.

, After you've got the name and specific information filled out, you should be ready to print them and present them. Use good-quality cardstock as opposed to regular printer paper to give them a more professional finish and quality. You can get this at most any office supply store for a few extra dollars.

, It's usually nice for certificates commemorating specific achievements to be hand-signed by the awarding party. If your boss assigned you to run off some certificates to give out at the office, present them ahead of time to give your supervisor enough time to go through them and sign them personally. It's a good idea that'll only take a few extra minutes and make the certificates mean a lot more.

",How to Make a Map Using Google Maps JS API," If you don't already have a webpage you want to insert the map into, you can use the following HTML5 template; save it as ‘map_page.html’ :




<!doctype html>
 
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
  <meta charset=""utf-8"">
  <title>My Leaflet Map</title>
</head>
 
<body>
  <!-- Content goes here. -->
</body>
</html>


;
, To do this, paste the following line of code into your HTML file, inside the <body></body> area, on a new line, just before the closing </body> tag:




<script async defer
  src=""https:
</script>




, To use Google Maps JS API - just like any other Google API - you'll need an API key, which is like a passcode. You then need to insert your new key into the URL from the step above where it says (remove the square brackets).To get your own key, see Get a Key/Authentication page., Google Maps will display the map inside an HTML element, so you need to provide one for it. Paste the following line of markup inside the <body></body>:




<div id=""map""></div>




, You need to set how large the map will be when it is displayed, and you should use CSS to do this. You can add the following to the document <head></head>:




<style>
  #map {
    height: 500px;
    width: 700px;
  }
</style>




, To start writing the JavaScript code that sets up the map, you'll need to add a <script></script> area to the <body></body> after the map container div. Also inside of this, you can create the map object by calling the Map() function of the google.maps object. You'll also need to pass the function the map container html element, like this:




<script type='text/javascript'>
  var map;
  function initMap() {
    // Create the map object.
    map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'));
  }
</script>




, The map's zoom and center properties determine the area that the map covers by default when the map is loaded. These are just the map's default values; the map's current zoom and center can be changed later if you enable those controls - we'll get to that later.Note: You need to simply copy the following lines of code into your <script></script> element (from the previous step), and make sure it is inside the initMap() function, before the closing ‘}’:




map.setZoom(2);
map.setCenter({lat: 0, lng: 0});




, Markers show the location of a point on a map. In Leaflet, markers are a type of ‘overlay’, so they can be directly added to maps. By default, a marker appears as a red pin, which is a standard image that you can change.




var marker = new google.maps.Marker();
 
var coordinates = {lat: 20, lng: 20};
marker.setPosition(coordinates);
marker.setMap(map);
marker.setTitle('Chad');




, Just like the marker, a polyline is a type of overlay, but it is used for a different purpose. A polyline is simply a line with multiple segments. You define it by providing the coordinates of the points that the line segments will be between. The coordinates needs to be an array of coordinate point objects.
One of the great features of Google Maps’ polylines is that they can be ‘geodesic’, which means they can curve to match the shape of the Earth! You can set that as an option later on.




var coordinates = [
  {lat: 20, lng: 10},
  {lat: 10, lng: 20},
  {lat: 20, lng: 30}
];
var polyline = new google.maps.Polyline();
polyline.setPath(coordinates); // Using the array we defined above
polyline.setMap(map);




, Each overlay in Google Maps has options that you can set, that determine what the overlay looks like. You could set the options of the marker (from the steps above) to make it look unique, but below are options to set for the polyline you just created:




polyline.setOptions({
  strokeColor: '#FF0000', // Bright red
  strokeOpacity: 1.0, // Fully opaque (not translucent)
  strokeWeight: 2 // Thickness of 2 pixels
});

Look for evidence that the GPU is in use.,
Update your GPU drivers.",How to Use BOINC," Visit boinc.berkeley.edu/download.php. Click the Download BOINC button. Once the download is complete, open the folder, then BOINC Installer to begin installation. Click through the Continue and Agree buttons to install BOINC manager.


If you're using an older computer, check the System Requirements link at the bottom of the downloads page and compare them to your own.
On an Android device, download BOINC or HTC Power to Give from the Google Play Store. The mobile interface may not match the instructions below.;
, It should automatically prompt you to add a project, or add an account manager. Here's a little guidance for your first BOINC decision:


Select ""Add project"" and click Next to get started right away. The instructions below assume this is the option you choose.
""Use an account manager"" leads you to sign up with a third-party website. On this site, you can manage your BOINC settings for multiple computers at once.This article does not cover account manager interfaces, but the process should be similar.

, BOINC does take some security precautions, but a malicious project could potentially access your private data or harm your computer. Make sure to find one you trust.Vet the project with the following resources:


Projects listed here are considered trustworthy by BOINC.
Projects listed here have already published scientific papers from BOINC research.
Each entry in your BOINC manager should have a link to a website. Follow this link for a detailed description of the project. Look for a clear description of the project, preferably with the goal of making BOINC-assisted research results freely available., Once you've chosen a project, click Next to see the sign up page. Some projects allow you to create an account with them using BOINC manager. If you see a ""new user"" option, fill out your username and password and click Next to finish your BOINC setup. If you only see a login screen, continue to the next step of these instructions instead.


You may be taken to the project website to finish registration.

, Click Back to return to the list of project. Find the project you want to join, then follow the link in its description. Look for a Join, Sign up, or Create account button on the website. Sign up using a real e-mail and a secure password. Remember your username and password.


If the project asks you to download software, you may skip that step. That's just a project-specific version of the BOINC manager.

, Return to your BOINC manager. Select the project your just signed up for, and click Next. Enter your email address and password, then click Next again. Your computer will now use its spare processing power for the research you selected.


Remain connected to the internet until your computer is done downloading its first task. Once the download is finished, you'll see a progress bar in the BOINC manager.

, In BOINC manager, select Tools in the top menu, then Computing preferences. A menu should pop up allowing you to limit the amount BOINC can use your computer. Here are a few useful options:


If you've noticed your computer becoming hot or running its fan during light use, reduce the ""Use X% of the processor"" setting.
If you're on a laptop, checking ""Do work while on battery?"" will run BOINC when your computer is not plugged in. This will drain the battery more quickly.
If you have a slow internet connection, limit the hours BOINC can go online. Note that your computer must be on and internet-connected during these hours to download the next task.

, The Add Project button is located in your main BOINC manager window. You can use this button to add any number of projects to your BOINC account.


Your computer can only run one simultaneous task per processing unit (e.g. four tasks with a quad-core CPU).BOINC will attempt to give each project roughly equal processing time, but on a given day your computer may only work on one project.

, Select View in the top menu, then Advanced View. This turns BOINC manager into a series of tabs with many additional options and statistics:Use the Projects tab to temporarily suspend a project, remove it permanently, or tell it to stop after this task (""No new tasks""). Click Properties to visit that project's website for additional, project-specific options.
Use the Tasks tab to suspend a task or abort it permanently. Check the time in the Deadline column periodically – if you haven't completed the task by then, another user will start it. You will still get credit after the deadline if you finish the task before the other user.
Use the Statistics and Disk tab for graphical representations of your contributions and the amount of disk space BOINC uses.

, Some projects support additional processing by harnessing your computer's GPU, which can massively increase your contributions to the project.Check your computer's hardware information to find your model.

, Visit this BOINC web page. Scroll down to the specific project requirements. If you see one that mentions your GPU model, you can join that project and potentially increase your BOINC contributions many times over.


Join the project from BOINC manager, using the same process described above.

, Open the Event Log in BOINC Manager, using Ctrl+Shift+E (⌘ Command+Shift+E on a Mac). If you see a reference to ""GPU,"" your mission was successful.


By default, BOINC won't use your GPU while you are using the computer. Leave the event log open for a couple minutes without touching the mouse or keyboard.

, If you see no evidence of GP use, you may need to update your drivers:


Windows users can update using their Device Manager program, or by downloading the update directly from the manufacturer website (such as NVIDIA).
Most Mac users can update using the Software Update program available from the top Apple menu, or directly from the manufacturer website.
Mac users with an NVIDIA GPU should look up their GPU's Compute Capability on this product list. If it is 1.4 or greater, download the CUDA 7 driver. If 1.3 or less, or if the GPU is not on the list, GPU processing will not work with BOINC.

It may be best to get started using the Trello website so that you have access to all of the features and can get used to the interface.;
, This will begin the account creation process.

, You can enter a name, email address, and password to create your account, or you can sign up with your Google account. This will automatically create an account using your Google profile information.

, You'll find this in the upper-right corner.


Boards are the backbone of Trello, and each one serves as the main organizational area for individual projects, events, or collaborations. For example, at home you may have a board for weekly chores, a board for planning an upcoming birthday, and a board for your fitness plan. At work you might have a board for your main project, a board for your calendar, and a board for employee resources.

, The title is how you'll identify the board in your list. Make sure that the name is clear enough for all of the users you may be inviting to join it.

, Your board starts without any lists, so you'll need to create one. Lists are the categories for your board, and entries called ""cards"" will be added and moved between them.


For example, for a to-do list for your home, you could have a ""To-Do"" list for everything that needs to get done soon, an ""In-Progress"" list for tasks you're working on, and a ""Done"" list for tasks that are complete.

, After creating the first list, you'll automatically be able to start creating the second. Continue creating lists until you're satisfied with the structure of your board.

, You can click and drag a list to move it to another position horizontally on the board. Any cards in the list (see below) will be moved with it., It's not possible to completely delete a board in Trello. When you don't want to use a board anymore, you can close it so that it no longer appears:


Delete any cards with sensitive information. While you cannot delete a board, you can delete the cards from it. This is important if you have cards with sensitive information that you want to permanently delete. Open the card you want to delete and then click ""Archive."" Click the ""Delete"" button that appears to permanently delete it.
Open the board menu to close the board. Once you've deleted any sensitive cards, you can safely close your board. You can do this from the board menu.
Click the ""More"" option, and then click ""Close Board."" Click ""Close"" to confirm.

, This will allow you to add a card to the list.


Cards are individual entries that you add to lists. Each card can be a task, idea, recipe, or any other entry that matches your board. You can move cards back and forth between lists as necessary.

, Think of this as the ""Front"" of the card. For example, in your to-do list for home, you may create a card called ""Get lawnmower working.""

, This is one of the main features of Trello. You can think of it like moving cards across a whiteboard. Moving cards between lists is typically used to show progression, such as moving a card from the ""To-Do"" list to the ""Done"" list.

, This is like viewing the ""Back"" of the card. You can add detailed descriptions here, add checklists, attach images, and more.

, You can add more details to the card here, such as detailed instructions, links, phone numbers, or anything else you may need.


When a card has a description, you'll see a small Description icon underneath the card name.

, You'll find this button on the back of the card, in the ""Add"" section. A new menu will appear, allowing you to select from several different colors.


You can simply label with a color, or you can click the pencil button next to a color and give the label a name. This name will appear over the selected color.
Cards can have multiple labels as required.

, This creates a checklist for the card. On the main board, a #/# will appear beneath the card name to indicate how many of the checklist items have been completed.


For example, if your card was to ""Get lawnmower working,"" your checklist may include entries like ""Change the oil,"" ""Replace the cord,"" ""Check the belts,"" etc.

, Clicking the ""Attachment"" button allow you to link files from your various cloud storage services, or upload a file to Trello to link.


If you add an image file as an attachment, it will be added as a ""Card Cover"" and will be visible from the board list.
There is a 10 MB file size limit for files uploaded to Trello, but no limit to the size of files shared from Drive and other cloud storage services.

, You can open this by clicking the ""Show Menu"" link in the upper-right corner.


Trello allows you to invite as many people as you'd like to join your board. You can invite your family members for household boards or your coworkers for your work boards.

, This will allow you to invite other people to view and edit your Trello board. Adding members will only give them access to the current board.

, If the email address is associated with a Trello member, you'll be able to click their Trello name to immediately add them to the board. If the email address is not associated with a Trello member, you can send an invite to join Trello. When the recipient signs up, they'll immediately join the board you sent the invite for.

, You can add members to specific cards, which acts like assigning it to them. When a member is assigned to a card, you'll see their profile picture in the corner of the card on the board list.


Open the back of a card and click the ""Members"" button in the ""Add"" section.
Select the member that you want to assign to the card.
Assigned members are automatically subscribed to card updates.

, The comments section of a card can be used to communicate with other members. Type @name and then select the member you want to mention in the menu that appears. That member will receive a notification that they've been mentioned in the card comments., Teams are groups of users that all have access to a set of boards. Using teams allows you to ensure that everyone can see the boards they're supposed to.Click the ""+"" next to your Trello name and select ""Create Personal Team"" or ""Create Business Team.""
Enter the name of the team and give it a description.
Add members to the team from the Members tab of the Team page.
Create new boards for the team in the Boards tab of the Team page. You can also transfer existing boards to different teams by clicking the current team when viewing a board and selecting ""Change team.""

, There's no limit to the number of boards you can create, so feel free to make as many boards as you need to get everything organized. To get the most benefit, each board should be for a separate task or concept that will benefit from having multiple lists and cards., Trello isn't just for business or to-do lists. You can use it to track ideas and structure your creative work.


For example, you can use Trello to outline a book you want to write, or manage ideas you have for blog articles, or keep a journal.

, Because of its collaborative nature, Trello makes getting an event organized much easier than relying on emails and phone calls. You can create a board for your event and then invite everyone that will be involved in the planning and execution of it.


Different lists can be used for different parts of the event that needs planning (food, entertainment, setup, etc.). You can then add specific tasks to each of those lists (potato salad in the ""Food"" list, put out chairs in the ""Setup"" list, etc.).
Once you have your lists and cards setup, you can assign different people to different cards so that they know exactly what they need to do.
Create a ""Done"" list that your helpers can drag their cards to after they've finished their tasks.

, Power-Ups are application and service integrations that you can add to your Trello account. There are Power-Ups created by Trello, such as the Calendar Power-Up, and there are Power-Ups created by third parties, such as the Publicate Power-Up.


Open your Board Menu and click ""Power-Ups."" If your board is not part of a team, you will be prompted to add it to one.
Click the ""i"" button next to a Power-Up name to see details about what it does and how to use it.
Click the ""Enable"" button to turn the Power-Up on for your board.
Start using the Power-Up. The process for using them will vary depending on the Power-Up. Most Power-Ups are integrated into the backs of cards.

, If you have a list of entries into a spreadsheet and you want to convert each one into an individual card, Trello can handle this automatically:


Highlight all of the entries in your spreadsheet and copy them to your clipboard.
Start a new card in Trello and paste your copied entries into the card's text field.
Select ""Create # Cards,"" which will create individual cards from each of the entries you copied.

, You can make the text on your card bold, italic, or code, and you can create hyperlinks by using special characters:


**bold text** - bold text

*italic text* - italic text

`code text` - code text

(http://www.example.com) - Hyperlink text


, Trello is available for Android and iOS. You can download it for free the app store on your device.

, You'll be asked to log in when you start the app for the first time. Log in with your Trello account, or click ""Log in with Google"" if you created your account by linking your Google account.

, When you log in, you'll see all of your available boards. Tapping on a board will open it so that you can view the lists and cards.

, When holding your phone vertically, each list will take a screen, and swiping will move to the next list. When holding your phone horizontally, swiping left and right will scroll smoothly through your lists.

, When you tap a card, you'll see the details on the back. You can add items like checklists to the back of the card by tapping the ""+"" button.

, You'll be prompted to enter a card name. You can tap the Camera button to take a photo with your phone's camera or attach a different file to the card.

, CMD is run through a command line. You need to enter specific commands to start changing anything. One cool command to start with is the “color” command. The color command has the power to change the way to look at your current CMD display. For instance, if you type “color 0a,” your text will turn green and your background will stay black. If you would like a complete list of colors and how to use the command further, type in “color /?”.

, Inside the CMD window, you should see a blinking underscore. When you start typing, this is where you will be able to see your command being entered. Enter the command you want to use to change the text color. Once you have finished typing the command, go ahead and hit the Enter key, and the command will run.


When you are all done, your settings should be completely saved, so the next time you run CMD you should see the the new colors you set.
Placing the switch “/?” at the end of any command will give you the help file for that command. This should include all switches and the syntax of the command.

, If you’re not satisfied with the color changes you made and would like to return everything to default, simply go into Properties again, and on the “Options” tab, check the box on the bottom next to “Use legacy console,” Then relaunch CMD.

, CMD is run through a command line. You need to enter specific commands to start changing anything. One other cool command to start with is the “title” command. The title command has the power to change the way to look at the CMD title bar. For example, if you type “title Terminal” the title bar would change from “C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe” to “Terminal.” If you would like to see a complete list of switches and syntax for the command simply type “title /?” and hit Enter.

, Inside the CMD window you should see a blinking underscore. When you start typing, this is where you will be able to see your command being entered. Enter the command you want to use to change the title bar. Once you have finished typing the command, go ahead and hit the Enter key, and the command will run.


For some strange reason, this is not a command that the current CMD will remember to keep by default. So the next time you open the CMD window, you will see “C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe” up there again instead of the title you created. This may change in the future, but it may be a while.

PeaZip is a freeware cross-platform archive manager that provides a single GUI for Open Source technologies (7-Zip, FreeArc, PAQ, UPX...) on Windows, Linux, and BSD.,

Archive creation can be started dragging files on the application, or with ""Add"" button in program's tool bar.,

Archive extraction can be started from system context menu, or dragging compressed files on the application, or with ""Extract"" button in program's tool bar.",How to Zip and Unzip Files with Peazip," The file manager allows both to select files and folders to be archived as Zip files (or other formats), and to select archives to be unzipped. Alternatively, file selection can be performed with PeaZip system's context menu entries (not featured in PeaZip Portable version) or simply dragging and dropping files from / to the program.;
, The archive creation interface prompts by default creation of a Zip file, but the file format can be customized, as well as compression ratio (from faster to better) and other miscellaneous options, including encryption. PeaZip relies on optimized Deflate algorithm for compressing in Zip format, that usually compress 5-10% better than standard Deflate but keeping compatibility with other Zip utilities. 7Z format gives better compression ratio, but is slower than Zip. As quite unique feature for archive management software, PeaZip supports two factor authentication (password plus key file), random password generation, and features an integrated encrypted password manager. ""Advanced"" tab features more fine-grained options, ""Console"" tab transform the task in a command line i.e. for use in scripts or for study purpose, ""Schedule"" tab allows to transform the interactive task in a scheduled one, i.e. for setting up a backup.

, It can handle multiple archives even of mixed types at once, or selective extraction of content from a single archive. Over 170 types of archives are supported: classic ZIP files and its variants, new WinZip's ZIPX file format, RAR files, old ACE archives, Microsoft's CAB and WIM files, Apple's DMG packages, ISO and UDF disk images, and many more.

The Session window will display the output of any analysis, and the Worksheet window is where you enter your data. The worksheet window will look very similar to an Excel spreadsheet.;
, The first row of the worksheet is reserved for the C1, C2, C3, etc. labels that Minitab assigns to the columns. The second row is reserved for column labels, which you can enter in manually. Simply click an empty second row cell and type in the label for that column.

, Once you have your column labeled, you can start entering data into the column. Pressing ↵ Enter will take you to the cell below the current one. If you click the little arrow in the upper-left corner of the Worksheet, you can change the direction of data entry so that pressing ↵ Enter will take you to the next column on the same row.


If data is saved in an Excel spreadsheet, copy and paste it to Minitab. Highlight the data set saved in Excel. Right click the mouse and select copy. Go to Minitab and click the first cell below C1. Right click the mouse and select paste cells.Each column should represent one type of data. For example, if you are entering information about baseball teams, one column might be RBI, one might be Errors, and one might be Home Runs.

, Descriptive statistics summarizes a set of data using several important values. Some descriptive statistics include:


Mean - Arithmetic average value of the data in the column
Standard deviation - Measure of dispersion of data
Median - The middle value of a set
Minimum - The smallest number in a set
Maximum - The largest number in a set

, After entering the data set, click the Stat menu at the top of the window. Hover your mouse over Basic Statistics.

, This will open Display Descriptive Statistics window, which shows all of your columns in a list on the left, and a Variables box on the right.

, The variable will appear in the Variables box on the right side of the window.

, Click Statistics... to choose which statistics you want to display. You can check or uncheck any of the boxes. Click OK when you've finished deciding.

, Click OK in the Display Descriptive Statistics window once you are satisfied with the data set and statistics options. The descriptive statistics you chose for the data you selected will appear in your Session window.

, Histograms graph frequencies with respect to categories. It allows you to visually see the frequency for the number of time a variable occurs.Click the Graph menu. After entering the data set, click the Graph menu at the top of the window. Select Histogram...

Select your graph type. You have four options for creating a histogram: ""Simple"", ""With Fit"", ""With Outline and Groups"", and ""With Fit and Groups"". Select ""Simple"".
Choose your data set. You will be shown a list of available data sets. Double-click the one that you want to create the histogram from and click OK. Your histogram will be constructed and displayed in a new window.

, A regression analysis models relations between random variables. There are two types of variables in regression analysis: response and predictor variables. Values of predictor variables are chosen to predict the values of response variables, and the regression analysis will, among other things, determine how accurate this prediction tends to be.


Y usually represents the response variable and X usually represents predictor variable(s)

, Enter response and predictor variables individually in separate columns. Make sure that the columns are properly labeled in the second row.


Response Variable: Measured in an experiment. It is also called dependent variable.
Predictor Variables: The variables whose values determine the change of other variables. They are also called independent variables.

, Click the Stat menu and hover over Regression, and then select Regression...

, Double-click the data set that is your ""Response"", or ""dependent"" variable. This will add it to the ""Response"" field. Then, double-click the data set that is your ""Predictor"", or ""independent"" variable. This will add it to the ""Predictors"" field. You can add multiple variables to the ""Predictors"" field.

, If you want to generate graphs alongside your analysis, click the Graphs... button. You can then choose which graphs of the residuals that you want to create. Click OK after making your selections.

, you can have Minitab store your results, such as your residuals and fits. Click the Storage button to choose what aspects you want stored. These will be added to new columns on your spreadsheet.

, After you are finished configuring your options, click OK in the regression window. Minitab will calculate the regression and display any charts and stored values that you set.Output from the regression analysis appears in the Session window of Minitab.
The regression equation gives an approximation of how X’s predict Y.
P-values determine the significance of the predictor variables.
R-sq describes how well the data fits the model (1 and -1 indicate perfect fit).

When you want to take a screenshot of your game, press the hotkey you set for screen captures.",How to Use Fraps," Based on your needs, you may choose either the free or paid version of Fraps. The free version has several limitations that the paid version does not. The free version of Fraps:


Can only record clips of 30 seconds or shorter (the paid version has no length limit.)
Displays a Fraps watermark at the top of all recorded footage.
Has loop recording disabled.;
, Note that, unlike many programs, Fraps' default installation location is C://Fraps, not C://Program Files/Fraps. If you're unsure how to open the program, look in the C:// directory.


, The hotkey is the keyboard key you will press while in-game to begin recording video. To set a hotkey, click in the box labeled ""Video Capture Hotkey,"" then press a button on your keyboard.


By default, the recording hotkey is F9.
Choose a hotkey that you don't use in the game.

, Fraps works while minimized.

, You should see a numerical value in the corner of your game window. This is the ""frame rate overlay"" - it represents your game's current frame rate.

, The overlay will turn red. This signifies that you're recording a video. To stop recording, press the hotkey again.


Remember that the free version of Fraps only allows recording in 30-second increments.

, Select the ""FPS"" tab at the top of the Fraps window (look for a yellow ""99"".) Here, you will see options for Fraps' benchmarking and frame rate overlay functions.


Frame rate is a measure of how ""fast"" a game is running. Frame rates are usually measured in frames per second (FPS.) Motion in computer games is actually an illusion created by a rapidly changing series of still images called frames. The more images shown per second, the smoother and clearer the motion in the game will appear.
Frame rate overlay is a feature which displays the game's current frame rate in one corner of the screen. Graphically intense portions of the game can result in a low frame rate - the overlay will display this and any other fluctuations in a game's frame rate.
Benchmarking is a process by which a game's average frame rate is calculated for a certain length of time.

, To do this, click in the boxes labeled ""Benchmarking Hotkey"" and ""Overlay Hotkey,"" press a key on the keyboard that you want to use to turn the benchmarking and overlay functions on and off while you are playing the game.


By default, the benchmarking and overlay hotkeys are F11 and F12, respectively.
Choose hotkeys that aren't buttons you use in the game.

, Depending on your preferences, you may choose to enable or disable certain options on this page. You can select the length of time for your benchmarking, select additional metrics for your benchmarking to measure, and select which corner of the screen the overlay will appear in.


For your frame rate overlay, choose a corner of your screen where it won't obscure your vision or hide vital information during gameplay.

, When you would like to create a benchmark or frame rate overlay, press the hotkey you decided on. The benchmark/overlay should appear within the game.

, Select the ""Screenshots"" tab at the top of the window. Here, you will find options for adjusting your screen capture settings.


A screenshot (or screen capture) is a still image of your gameplay.
Free versions of Fraps can only save screenshots as .BMP files. Paid versions can save in the .BMP, .JPG, .PNG, and .TGA formats.

, Click on the box marked ""Screen Capture Hotkey,"" then press a button on your keyboard that you want to use to take screenshots in-game.


By default, the screenshot hotkey is F10.
Don't choose a hotkey that you'll use while playing the game.

, The screenshot tab has several options for customizing Fraps' screenshot feature. You can:


Change your image output format (in the paid version of Fraps.)
Choose whether to include the framerate overlay in screenshots.
Set a repeat timer for taking multiple screenshots.

, Fraps will continue to run in the background.

, The frame rate overlay will turn white for a brief moment (and possibly, lag). This signifies that you have captured an image of your gameplay.

Recall the data later on.",How to Use JSON," JSON is used to store data, similar to XML. It is based on the JavaScript object notation syntax. There are four basic syntax rules for JSON. If you can memorize these rules, then you should be able to write JSON objects from scratch with ease:Data is in name/value pairs
Commas are used to separate data
Objects are contained by curly braces
Arrays are contained by square brackets;
, JSON is based around the pair structure for data. Each entry will need to have a name with a value attached. This value can be a number, a string, a Boolean (true/false), an array, an object, or null. See above for an example of a simple data pair:

, You can combine multiple data pairs into a single object for easy reference later on. Surround the object with curly braces and separate data pairs with a comma. See the example above:

, You can create basic databases by placing multiple objects into one array. This will let you pull up any part of the array later on in the program. See the example above for an object called ""Cities Visited"" containing an array of the cities:

, Once you've created the JSON object, you can use JavaScript to pull that data back and display it. You simply need to call the database and point to which entry in the array you want. See the example above to return the second City from the array above."

The Outline tool set allows you to define the structure that your project will take. This is particularly useful for large or complex projects that contain many parts or topics. The Outline pane uses a tree structure to organise related pages. This first page or node is the Home page. This is the top level page and will always display as your project's home page when published. The iDevice (instructional device) pane is a collection of structural elements that describe learning content. Examples of these include, objectives, pre-knowledge, case studies, free text. Learning content is created by selecting iDevices from the iDevice menu and entering your learning content. ,


Add a heading:you can type the heading or title of your choice.
Add a iDevice type:This is the activity or instruction that has to be followed.
Use the Rich Text Editor toolbar to edit your text; like changing the font,adding videos or adding images. The possibilities are huge.

Blue undo arrow:By clicking on the blue undo arrow, you will undo any changes that might have made to the iDevice since opening it for edit. Please note that some iDevice editing functions (for example, Add or Remove a Question or Option in any of the quizzing iDevices) do not support an undo.
Red X:By clicking on the red X you will delete the iDevice and any content entered.
Up and down arrows:The up and down arrows allow you to change the order of the iDevices displayed on your screen.
Move To menu:You can move iDevices containing content between and within nodes. This is done by opening the drop down menu and selecting the node you wish to move it to.
Edit iDevice:The page and pencil icon that appears in preview mode beneath each iDevice enables you to edit that particular iDevice. This is done by clicking on the icon which opens the iDevice in edit mode., Within this tab you will find three sub-tabs to collect the data.


With the Package tab you can record basic project information like the title from the project, the author and taxonomy.
The Metadata tab allows you to enter details which may prove useful for searching at a later stage. If the metadata entries are not filled in, eXe uses the package title, author, and the description as fallback values. If you don't set the package title either, eXe will default to using the package filename."

, Go to the Download area, and click on the link to download CDisplay. The download will start immediately.


CDisplay is made for Windows only, and the actual setup file is hosted at http://cdisplay.techknight.com/setup.zip.

, Locate the downloaded file on your computer. The filename is setup.zip. It’s pretty generic, so be sure to find and open the correct file. Double-click on the setup file to run the installation.

, Locate the application shortcut from the Start menu once installation is finished, and click on it to launch it.

, The first way to load comic book files into CDisplay is by using the load dialog. Select “File” from the file menu and click on “Load Files.”

You can also right-click anywhere on the application’s user interface and click on “Load Files” from the menu. The keyboard shortcut for this is the “L” key.






The Windows load dialog box will appear. Navigate through your computer to locate the folder or directory where the comic book files you’d like to read are stored. Click on one to load it into CDisplay.







, You can also just drag and drop the comic book file you’d like to read on CDisplay user interface. Look for the file from your computer, click on it, and then drag it to CDisplay. Once you release, the comic book will be loaded into CDisplay.

, You can also load a comic book by double-clicking on it directly, even with CDisplay closed. Look for the file from your computer and double-click on it. CDisplay will be launched with your comic book loaded.

, If you’d like to continue reading where you last left off before closing CDisplay, you can do so since CDisplay remembers the last file and page you were reading. Select “File” from the file menu and click on “Resume Reading.”


You can also right-click anywhere on the application’s user interface and click on “Resume Reading” from the menu. The keyboard shortcut for this is the “R” key. This will automatically load your last comic book on the last page you were reading.
This will only work if CDisplay is still empty, without any file loaded.

, If you’re reading a set or collection of comic books in sequence, you don’t need to stop and look for the next file to load. As long as the comic book files are in sequence and located under the same folder, you can navigate through them without leaving your reading screen.


Select “File” from the file menu and click on “Load Next Files.” You can also right-click anywhere on the application’s user interface and click on “Load Next Files.” This will load the next comic book in sequence from the same folder.

, If you’re reading a set or collection of comic books in sequence, and you’d like to go back to the previous file to review or to recollect what happened, you don’t need to stop and load the previous file.


Select “File” from the file menu and click on “Load Previous Files.” You can also right-click anywhere on the application’s user interface and click on “Load Previous Files.” This will load the previous comic book from the same folder.
Similar to loading Next Files, as long as the comic book files are in sequence and located under the same folder, you can navigate through them without leaving your reading screen.

, The Space key from your keyboard is the primary key used in reading comics in CDisplay. Pressing it on a page will show you the whole image in that page part by part, if the whole page cannot be viewed in one go. Once the whole page is done, pressing the Space key will move to the next page.


You can read through a whole comic book with just pressing the Space key.

, The arrow keys on your keyboard can be used to scroll through an image in any direction. If you don’t like pressing the Space key to automatically show you the whole page in its own sequence, you can navigate it on your own with the arrow keys.


Once done with a page, press the Page Down and Page Up keys to move to the next page and previous page respectively.
The Home and End keys allow you to jump to the first and last pages respectively.

, Your computer mouse can also be used to navigate through the pages and read the comics. A page can be moved with a left-click and drag.


Double-clicking on the righthand side of the screen will move to the next page while doing the same thing on the lefthand side will move to the previous page.
The scroll wheel on the mouse can also be used to scroll through the page, and then to the next pages.

, If you want to go to a specific page, press the “P” key on your keyboard to display thumbnails of all the pages in the comic book. From the thumbnails, you can just click on the one you’d like to go to and the program will bring you to it."

",How to Use a File Compression Program,"



Utility-based compression: This type of file compression is standard with all PCs. The built-in utility program primarily performs what is known as file-to-file compression. It takes a single file—or multiple files—and compacts it into an “archive” file. A decompression program, such as Win Zip, must then be used to unpack the new file. Downloaded software programs and big files are compressed in this manner.

Operating-system compression: Some computer operating systems—mainly those that are incompatible with DOS’s FAT (file evaluation table) file system and most Windows systems—compress individual files within that particular operating system. Windows Vista, for example, will support this file compression system when the operator uses the Vista file system. This utility is favored because it unpacks compressed files automatically as needed while allowing the user to determine what files are “zipped.”

Volume compression system: Newer computer operating systems can compress entire hard drives by using a built-in file compression utility or a third-party product. This type of file compression system enables the user to conserve hard disc space without having to compress files one at a time. Packed files are automatically unpacked whenever a software application attempts to open them.;
, This often depends on your desired compression/extraction format.

, Generally these sites provide information on the software’s:


Ease of use
Features
Compression and extraction formats
Operating system compatibility
Supported file types
Technical support

,, It provides an overview of the software and gives step-by-step instruction in the use of various features.

, You may need to reboot your machine following installation.

, Click on “New” to view the folders on your hard drive. Select a folder to keep your compressed file.

,, Typical choices are normal, fast, superfast, maximum or none.

Have a very thorough knowledge of English and technical writing.,
Read as much technical material as you can in all of your working languages.,
Have excellent resources.,
Have a thorough knowledge about the technical subject.,
Have common sense.,
Practice often.",How to Translate Technical Documents to English," Once you are translating a technical document into English, you must write like a technical writer as though the document-in-translation were written as an original English document. It is very difficult to translate from multiple foreign languages into English without this grasp. Every technical and scientific industry has its own communication standards and audience expectations---learn them!;
, To translate a technical document into English, you have to know how a technical document is constructed in English. To be able to understand your source text, you have read as much as you can in the source language on the subject in question to familiarize yourself with the correct terminology as well as linguistic and cultural nuances.

, For translating technical words from the source language to English, you should have very good dictionaries and reference books on the subject. Build up a good library if you don't already have one. If your source language has limited technical terminology resources, develop your own glossaries.

, One of the most important requirements is an understanding of the technical background of the subject area. Your understanding of the background is a must, before undertaking the translation to a fair degree of perfection. In fact, a perfect combination of all three is required: Command over the source language, English as well as the subject area.


Don't be afraid to ask a Subject Matter Expert (SME). If you don't understand a specific technical concept or are unsure as to how to correctly translate that concept, ask an industry-specific expert if you can, i.e. an engineer, programmer, physicist, archaeologist, etc. Risking mis-translation can be both costly and hazardous.

, There will be instances where it is not possible to exactly translate a technical document from source language to English due to the paucity/ lack of availability of technical words in English or vice versa. In this case, once you have understood the technical matter, you will have to use your common sense while translating. The meaning of the context should not be changed or altered.

, Experience will be gained by practicing constantly. Once experienced; you can undertake these translations with ease.

Carefully consider the various options available.,
Consider the type of rental operation you’ll run.,
Amass your fleet.,
Choose the location of your operation.,
Have Insurance.,
Manage your day-to-day operation.,
Have a website.",How to Start a Vehicle Rental Business," Vehicle rental is a highly competitive industry, but with the right planning and forward-thinking you can greatly minimise your risk. The old mantra “if you fail to prepare, then you prepare to fail” could not be more relevant. It’s incredibly important that you do your research – and so this article is a good starting point! With thorough research, it’s entirely possible to make good money providing a service that will always be in demand!;
, The two main types are contract hire (where customers - typically businesses, lease vehicles for a set time), or daily hire (where customers – typically individuals, hire vehicles for a shorter period of time).

, The important consideration here is whether you will outright purchase your fleet (can be costly) or instead lease the vehicles. Initially your fleet doesn’t need to be large, but bear in mind that the greater your fleet the greater your earnings. As a guide, always put yourself in your customers’ shoes – your fleet must be well maintained and enjoy a high turnover. Employing your own maintenance staff can work out expensive for new start-ups, so it’s worth considering making arrangements with a local repair shop.

, This is a key consideration. Do some research on the type of market in your area and find out as much as you can on your competition. For independent start-ups you will need to develop your USP. National operators like Hertz and Avis can hire vehicles out cheaply, so what can you offer to differentiate yourself and build-up a local customer following? Locations near airports, hotels and train stations are great options. Don’t forget to research your location security – it’s not a bad idea to invest in CCTV cameras and alarm systems.

, Perhaps the most important issue for vehicle rental companies. It goes without saying, but it’s illegal to trade without some form of fleet insurance. It’s worth shopping around to find adequate cover at the best price. Some companies like Tower Gate Insurance offer ‘pay as you go’ insurance solutions that offer all the benefits of an annual policy, with greater flexibility.

, In the past it was common for an entire operation to be run from massive paper diaries and logbooks. This may work in the immediate short term, but the disadvantages of a manual system far outweigh any positives. Manual systems leave you liable for inefficiency, with lost time and often lost paperwork! It can quickly become confusing what vehicles are due out and in, and managing your invoices is often a nightmare. To boost your efficiency and steer clear from these pitfalls, it’s vital that you invest in fleet management software.

, This is an absolute must if you wish to receive a decent flow of business. The Internet has afforded customers with greater flexibility – and most now turn to Google when shopping around for products or services. A website will allow people to do this 24/7, effectively extending your opening hours. The simple fact of the matter, especially for new start-ups wanting to establish themselves, is this: If you don’t have a website, potential customers will go with someone who does. Try to avoid the trap of simply posting your contact details with a few prices and then hope for the best. The 21st century customer is impatient and expects to be able to book and pay online when convenient for them. It’s therefore important that you fully utilise your website (your shop window) to its maximum potential by having a proper online booking engine. It may seem tempting to opt for some bespoke web-developer work, but this can turn-out very expensive. This route allows you to have a complete web booking system on your existing website in under an hour! All you would need to do is insert a code into your website and that’s it! It’s easy to set up tariffs and groups. You can set up availability rules which ensure that you never lose control over your vehicle availability. Your customers also receive automatic booking confirmations and email reminders, saving you the hassle.

Fix any run-time or logic errors.",How to Start and Compile a Short Java Program in Eclipse,"  There are a few different ways of accomplishing this.  You can click the arrow next to the left-most icon on the toolbar and select ""Java Project"" from the drop-down menu.  Alternately, you can start a new Java project by choosing ""File,"" then ""New,"" followed by ""Java Project.""  You can also use the shortcut Alt+Shift+N.;
,  You will see a window titled ""Create a Java Project.""  The buttons ""Next"" and ""Finish"" at the bottom of the window will be greyed out until a project name is entered in the first field.  To proceed, give your project a name and enter it into this field.  For this tutorial, we will use the name ""Project1.""  Enter the name and then click ""Finish.""  Your new project will appear on the left-hand side of the screen under ""Package Explorer"" among existing projects.  Projects are listed in alphabetical order. 

, Before you begin writing code, you will need to create a new Java class. A class is a blueprint for an object. It defines the data stored in the object as well as its actions.  Create a class by clicking the ""New Java Class"" icon, which looks like a green circle with the letter ""C"" in the center of it.

,  You will see a window titled ""Java Class.""  To proceed, enter the name of your class into the field ""Name.""  Since this class will be the main class of the simple project, check the selection box labeled ""public static void main(String[] args)"" to include the method stub.  Afterwards, click ""Finish.""

,  Your new class called Class1.java is created.  It appears with the method stub ""public static void main(String[] args)"" along with some automatically generated comments. A method will contain a sequence of instructions to be executed by the program. A comment is a statement that is ignored by the compiler. Comments are used by programmers to document their code.  Edit this file and insert the code for your Java program.

, Any errors will be underlined in red, and an icon with an ""X"" will show up on the left. Fix your errors.  By mousing over an error icon, you can see a suggestion box that lists the ways you can fix the error.  In this tutorial, we will double-click ""Create local variable answer"" so that the variable is declared first before it is used.

, There are three types of errors you must beware of: syntax errors, run-time errors, and logic errors. The compiler will alert you of the first of these three, the syntax errors. Examples of syntax errors are misspelled variable names or missing semi-colons.  Until you remove all syntax errors from your code, your program will not compile. Unfortunately, the compiler will not catch run-time errors or logic errors. An example of a run-time error is trying to open a file that does not exist. An example of a logic error is opening and using data from the wrong file.

,  Now that your program is free from errors, click the triangular icon to run your program.  Another way to run your program is to select ""Run"" from the main menu and then select ""Run"" again from the drop-down menu.  The shortcut is Ctrl+F11.

,  When your program runs, the output, should there be any, will be displayed on console at the bottom of the screen.  In this tutorial, our Java program added two integers together.  As two plus two equals four, the program is running as intended.

, As stated previously, the compiler will only catch syntax errors. If the output of your program is different from what you've expected, then there might have been an error even though the program compiled. For example, if the output was zero instead of four, then there was a mistake in the program's calculation.

OID = TYPE: VALUE where:


OID – numerical identifier of SNMP objects e.g.",How to Simulate Network Devices Using SNMP Simulator5," “.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.1.0”,

TYPE – type of object defined by SMI (for data types see the table below),

VALUE – value of the object,

MODIFIER – optional modifier of object value.

"
"If more than one device is simulated based on the same SNMP record file, each device will expose the same SNMP object values.,To differentiate object values, separate SNMP record files with different values can be created (which often requires a lot of manual work) or modifiers can be applied.,Using modifiers requires the user to familiarize himself with the modifier syntax, however it speeds up the process of defining simulated devices especially for large networks.,Modifier is an optional element in object definition in SNMP record file that follows object and value and modifies it.,
There are two types of modifiers:


PRE-LOADED-MODIFIER – object value is modified upon simulator start when SNMP record files have been loaded.",How to Simulate Network Devices Using SNMP Simulator6,",,,, This modifier generates constant value of object which will be returned on every object read operation.

POST-LOADED-MODIFIER– object value is modified on every object read operation. The value returned will be different each time it was read. This modifier can be used to simulate performance counters or other objects representing constantly changing metrics.

Download the editing software GIMP.,
Take out a blank piece of printer paper.,
Scan the piece of paper you've used to write all your signatures into your computer.,
Your image will probably be a bitmap file.,
You may have to maximize the GIMP window, so do so if you have to.,
Click and drag your mouse to create a rectangle around your signature.,
This is the fun part!,
Click Save as, and save your new image as something other than the original scanned image.,
Open your cover letter.",How to Sign Electronic Cover Letters," It's free, and found at http://www.gimp.org;
, Write out your signature as many times as you feel like, until you have a signature you like or are comfortable with. Be sure not to write the signatures too close together, as we will need to crop the image later.

, Color, black and white, or greyscale are all acceptable settings. A resolution of 300 or 400 dpi is good. You're going to want to scan to an image.

, At this point you CAN use paint successfully to crop the image, save it, and stick it in your cover letter, and then adjust its size and proportion, etc. I find this to be an unreliable method, depending on what you save the file as, and ""flaws"" in the paper (such as the paper grain). Open your bitmap file with GIMP.

, Find the signature you like among the signatures on your paper, and click the Crop tool on the ""Toolbox"" window. It looks like the end of a X-Acto Knife. Alternatively you can go to Tools -> Transformation Tools -> Crop, or you can also type SHIFT C.

, Make sure to stretch the rectangle only around your signature, excluding marks from other signatures you don't want. Once you've made your rectangle, click again in the middle of the box, and this should execute the crop. You should now only have the one signature you want.

, Click Colors -> Color to Alpha. *NOTE*: If you cannot click Color to Alpha, Click Image -> Mode -> and change it to RGB. What Color to Alpha does is makes the background, which may already be white, into an invisible background. When you put it onto your document then, you are ensuring that the background of the cover letter and the background of your signature image are the same color.

, Click the + to expand the filetypes in the GIMP save window, and select ""PNG Image."" Under no circumstance should you save as a JPEG, as much as we all love the filetype. For one thing, JPEG does not support the alpha we just made, but PNG does. Second, JPEG tends to compress the image and distort your white background into grey sometimes.

, If you're in Microsoft Word 2007 or 2010, Click the Insert tab, click Picture, select your picture. It will be inserted in the document. you can now click and drag it around, and re-size it to your heart's content. If you're on a mac, The insertion area is on the home tab near the far right. It's a button that looks like a painting, or a portrait. Same deal, just find the file, move it around etc. You are done!

Install GPG.,
Install a GUI for GPG.,
An icon for KGPG will be present under Applications → Accessories, to launch KGPG you should click on this icon.

,
Generate a set of keys.,
Decide if your key will expire, and if so, when.,
Select a key size.,
Select an algorithm.,
After filling out the appropriate fields, click the OK button.,
After you enter your passphrase twice, click on the generate button.,
After your key pair has generated, the window will close.

,
Note that now your keyring has one set of keys in it (your private key and your public key).,
Send your public key to others via forums, key servers, e-mails, etc.,
After someone sends you encrypted information, copy the information to your clipboard.,
Upload their key to your keyring.,
Now that you have the public key of the individual you wish to send encrypted information to, go to File → Open editor.,
If you have not set the individual's public key to trusted, you will need to click on the options button and put a check mark next to “Allow encryption with untrusted keys”.,
Sign your encrypted message, so that the individual knows that it is in fact coming from you (or someone who has access to your private key and passphrase...which should be only you).,
If you have someone public key, you can verify signed messages they send to you.",How to Set Up and Use GPG for Ubuntu," To do this, run terminal and type in “sudo apt-get install gnupg” and follow through with any prompting you may get.;
, To install a popular GUI, go to the terminal and type in “sudo apt-get install kgpg”. Follow through with any prompting you may get.

,, To do this, click on the keys tab on the drop down bar, and from the drop down menu select Generate Key Pair. A new interface will pop up. The new interface will ask you for details so that it can generate your key pair. It will ask you for your name and e-mail address, for example.


For name, put your screen name; you can either leave e-mail blank, put your real e-mail address, or use a fake e-mail address. It should be noted that the name and e-mail address you use will be visible to anyone you send your public key to.
It will also ask you for a comment, which you can leave blank if you wish, or you can put a comment in if you have a reason to do so.

, Usually a key does not need an expiration date, although if you feel the need to put one in, you can do so. After an expiration date passes, your key will no longer function, and you will be required to generate a new pair.

, As a rule of thumb, the larger the key size, the more secure messages encrypted with the key are going to be. Select 4096 as your key size.

, The default algorithm, DSA & ElGamal, should be selected.

, You will be taken to a new interface and asked to supply a passphrase. The passphrase should be very long and random, your best bet is to use KeePassX to generate a passphrase.

, A window will pop up explaining that a new key pair is being generated. During the generation of the key pair, you should move your mouse about randomly in order to create a large amount of entropy, thus making your key pair more secure. Continue to move your mouse until the generating key pair window closes.

,, You need to send your public key to all those you wish to communicate with, so that they can encrypt information before sending it to you. To do this, right click on the key pair you just generated, and select export public keys. A new window will pop up asking you where you would like to export the public key to. Select clipboard. Your public key will now be stored on your clipboard (meaning it is what will paste when you go to paste something.)

, simply by pasting the key where you would like it to appear. Now others can use your public key to send encrypted information to you.

, Go to KGPG and select File → Open Editor. A new window will pop up that allows you to input text into it. Paste the encrypted information into this window and select decrypt. You will be prompted for your passphrase. After correctly entering your passphrase, the information will decrypt and you will be able to read it.

, To do this, copy their public key to your clipboard. Now, go to KGPG and go to Keys → Import Keys. A new window will pop up and ask from where you want to import the new key. Select clipboard and then click ok. The persons public key will be added to your keyring.

, A new window will pop up that allows you to input text into it. Type the message you wish to send to the individual in this window, then click on the Encrypt button. A new window will pop up asking which key you want to use to encrypt the information.

, Now simply click on the key of the person the message is intended for, and select ok. Your message is now encrypted.


To send the message to the individual, simply copy and paste the encrypted block of text to your clipboard, and e-mail it to them, or send it to them in a private message, or whatever.

, To sign your encrypted message, click the sign/verify button and select your private key. You will be prompted to enter your passphrase, and after correctly entering your passphrase a signature will be attached to your message.

, To do this:


Simply paste their signed message into the editor, and click on the sign/verify button. A window will pop up telling you if the signature is valid or not.
After you verify the signature, remove the signature from the editor. You will also need to remove one extra “*” at the top and bottom of the message, so that “*****BEGIN PGP MESSAGE*****” is the first line and “*****END PGP MESSAGE*****” is the last line.
After doing this, simply click the decrypt key and enter your passphrase after you are prompted to do so.

Set up a Github Account.,





Install Git Bash.,





Create an SSH Key.,





Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent.,

Add your SSH key to your account.,





Fork a repository.,
Create a local directory.,

Clone the fork.,

Sync your fork with the original.,
Create a user.,
Create a new branch.,





Commit your changes.,





Make a push request.,
Merge with the master branch.,





Always remember to fetch and rebase.",How to Set Up and Use Git," Visit GitHub and create an account. For the purposes of this tutorial a free account will work just fine.
, In order to get started you must first download and install Git Bash for windows. Go ahead and do that now by following this link: Git Bash.

Once it's installed, run Git Bash. You should be looking at a black command prompt screen. Git Bash uses Unix commands to operate so some knowledge of Unix is important to have.

, In order to establish a secure encrypted connection between your GitHub account and Git Bash on your computer, you must generate and link an SSH key. In Git Bash, paste this code but substitute in the email you used with your GitHub account: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C ""your_email@example.com”

You will then be prompted as to where you want to save the key. The default location will suffice so just hit ↵ Enter. Next, Git Bash will ask you to enter and confirm a passphrase. While you don’t have to include one, it’s highly recommended that you do.

, This will authorize your computer to use that SSH key. Enter the following command to start the SSH Agent: eval ""$(ssh-agent -s)"" Then enter in ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa to add your created key.

If your key has a different name besides id_rsa or you saved it in a different location, make sure you use that instead.

, You will now need to configure your account to use your newly created key. Copy the ssh key to your clipboard: clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. Then, in the top right corner of any GitHub page, click on your profile photo, and then click Settings. In the user settings sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys. Then click New SSH Key. Now you can enter in a descriptive name for your key then paste your key into the key field, and press ""Add SSH Key"". Confirm it, and you’re all set!, In order to make changes to a project in GitHub, it must be forked. Go to the repository you want to work on, and fork the repository by pressing fork in the top right part of the page. This will make a copy of that repository on your account., Create a folder somewhere on your computer where you want to house the repository. Then use Git Bash to navigate to that folder. Remember Git Bash accepts UNIX commands, so in order to get into your directory, use the CD command like so: $ cd /path/to/directory
, In GitHub, navigate to your fork and under the repository name, click Clone or download, and copy the link it gives you.

Next, in Git Bash, enter in the following command using your copied URL: $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME. Press ↵ Enter, and your local clone will be created.

, You need to be able to propose changes to the original repository. Navigate to the original repository that you forked in GitHub, then hit Clone or download and copy the URL.

Now navigate into the actual repository folder in GitHub. You’ll know you’re in the right spot when you see a (master) to the right of your command prompt.
Now simply run $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/user/repositoryName using the original URL of the repository.

, Next you should create a user to track who made the changes to the repository. Run the following two commands. $ git config user.email “you@example.com” and $ git config user.name “Your Name”. Make sure the email you use is the same one that's on your git hub account., Next you should create a new branch off of our master branch. As an actual branch of a tree. This branch will hold all of the specific changes you will make. You should create a new branch off of the master every time you work on a new problem. Whether it’s a bug fix or the addition of a new feature, each task must get its own unique branch.

In order to make a branch, simply run: $ git branch feature_x. Replace feature_x with a descriptive name of your feature.
Once you’ve made your branch use $ git checkout feature_x. This will switch you into the feature_x branch. You are now free to make changes to your code.

, Once you’ve finished making changes, or you want to switch branches and work on something else, your changes must be committed. Run $ git commit --all. This is will automatically commit all the changes you’ve made to the repository.

You will get a prompt to enter in a commit message using vim. This message should be short and descriptive. Use the arrow keys to navigate to the top line, and then hit i on your keyboard. You may now type your message. Once it’s typed, hit Esc and then hit the colon key, :. Now type in the letters wq and hit ↵ Enter. This will save your commit message and quit the vim editor.

, Now that your changes have been committed, you should push them! Enter in $ git push origin <branchName>., Go back to GitHub and you should soon see a message pop up with your push. Hit ""Compare & pull request"". On this page you will have the opportunity to review your changes, as well as change your commit message and add comments. Once everything looks in order, and GitHub doesn’t detect any conflicts, go ahead and make the request. And that’s it!

Now it will be up to your other contributors and the owner of the repository to review your change and then merge it with the master repository.

, It's extremely important to always be working on the latest version of a file. Before you make any push requests, or you've just started a new branch or switched to a branch, always run the following command git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/master."

Make sure you have Java installed on your system.,
Make the .jar file executable.,
Run your .jar file.,
Make it so that you can run your .jar file by double-clicking it (optional).,
Open terminal.,
Execute the following command: $>java -jar ,
Open your .jar file by double-clicking (optional).",How to Run a .Jar Java File," Check this by typing java -version into the command terminal. If you don't have the latest version of Java, update it before proceeding.

, A .jar file is made executable by collecting the class files of your Java application; compilers or JVM (Java Virtual Machine) understand these formats. .jar files execute from javaw (Java web start). You need to set application's entry point within jar file. (An entry point is a class containing the main function of your application). You will set the entry point using the Manifest file. Here's how to do it:


The Jar tool automatically sets meta-inf/manifest.mf as path of the .jar file. When you open a default Manifest file, it should read ""Manifest-Version: 1.0, Created-By: 1.6.0 (Sun Microsystems Inc)""
Make a manifest addition .txt file. Enter Main Class: ., with the bracketed portions filled in with your specific information. (This is in the form of an attribute value pair.) Do not forget to add an empty line at the end of the file.
Enter this terminal command to modify the Manifest file to include the application's entry point, changing the bracketed portions to your specific file names: jar cfm Review your Manifest file. After you set the entry point, it should read: ""Manifest-Version: 1.0,Created-By: 1.6.0 (Sun Microsystems Inc), Main Class: .""
Alternatively, you can set the entry point using the .jar tool. This overrides the Main-class attribute in the Manifest's file. Enter the following terminal command: jar cfe , Run the .jar file using the following command (the main method of your java application executes): java -jar , To open the .jar file by double-clicking on it, change the directory to the location of javaw (java web start) executable. Type the following command into terminal: C:\Program Files\Java\j2rex.y.z\bin\javaw.exe"" -jar ""%1"" %*

, With Linux, double-clicking the .jar file opens it in a zip archiver showing the contents of the .jar file. Instead, right-click and select ""Open Terminal."";
,, If you want to run the .jar file by double-clicking, then you might have to try changing the file type association (similar to the instructions for Windows) for your flavour of Linux system.


Make sure the above command works.
Type the following command into terminal: $>/usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.6.0-sun/bin/java -jar %f

Set the path according to where Java is located on your system.

Go back to VMware and install your Windows Longhorn virtual machine as normal.",How to Run a Windows Longhorn Virtual Machine in VMware," Before we can start installing Windows Longhorn, we will need a virtual machine program that can run it. For this, it's best to use VMware Player, as it has the best compatibility for Windows Longhorn. You can use VMware Workstation as well.


To download VMware Player, visit: https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/info/slug/desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_pro/12_0

To download VMware Workstation, visit: https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0
;
, Once installed, run VMware.


These steps focus on VMware Player, so the steps may differ slightly for VMware Workstation.

, You will need an .iso file to install it.

, Select ""Microsoft Windows Vista (""Longhorn"" 6.0.4074.0) (beta) and then download.

,, There is no option for Windows Longhorn because it is not officially supported by VMware.

, It can be called something like Windows Longhorn, or Windows Vista Beta, and so on.

, Something like 30GB or more is good.

, For instance, if you have 8GB of memory, you can give it 4GB. Note that there is no point giving it more than 4GB, because x86 operating systems do not support more than 4GB of RAM.


Do not give all the RAM you have on your computer. This will really slow down your computer, and force it to switch to the page file. Give your VM about half of the memory you have, but no more than 4GB.
Now, before installing, you need to edit the configuration file; otherwise it won't boot.

,,, You will see a whole bunch of files, we are looking for the .vmx file. If you can't see .vmx on the end of any of the files, you will need to do this.


If you are on Windows XP, click Tools (in the folder we are currently in) then Folder Options. Click the View tab, then select the option called, ""Hide extensions for known file types"". Uncheck the box, then click Apply, then OK.
If you're on Windows Vista/7, click Organize, then select Folder and Search Options, and do the same as above.
If you're on Windows 8/8.1/10, click the View tab in the ribbon, then click Options and do the same as in step 4.

,


If you're on Windows XP/Vista/7, select Notepad. Uncheck the box that reads something like Always open this sort of file with this program.
In Windows 8/8.1/10, do the same as above, but click More Options, and then uncheck the box that says, ""Use this application for all .vmx files"" and then choose Notepad. In Windows 10, you'll need to click OK as well.

, Now save and exit.

, Everything should boot up!

Open up VB.Net and you should arrive on the home page.,
Make sure that Console Application is highlighted and then give a name for your project.,
Now that you are in the code, select the line just under Sub Main() and write dim' .,
After the dim write name and As String.,
Now, you are going to write two lines of code.,
The second line of code will say name = console.readline() .,
Then you will put another Console.Writeline but this time you will add Console.Writeline(""Hi {0}"", name).,
Finally, add a console.readkey under the last line of code you entered because this makes the application available to read without immediately exiting.

,
Run the application and then you should be asked for your name and then the application should say hi to you!",How to Say 'Hello' to a Custom Name in a Console Application in VB.Net2," Click on ""New Project"" or if you're homepage is not being displayed for some reason, click on the file tab at the top and then click on New Project.

, The name part is only important in case you want to look for this project again. Then you have something to stand out in the file explorer.

, You are now declaring something and this plays a key role in getting the user's name and using it in a sentence.

, The ""name"" part can be anything you would like but it would just be a bit clearer. However, the ""As String"" part MUST be there as you need to make sure that the computer reads words, not numbers or other things.

, The first one, Console.Writeline(""What is your name?"") asks for your name. The Console part is telling the computer to do something whilst the Writeline is an extension telling it to write something onto the application. The text inside the speech marks inside the brackets is what's going to appear on the screen.

, Again, the console part is telling it's for the computer, the readline tells the computer to store the answer from the first line of text into the name that we declared earlier.

, The {0} represents the first variable being used because in this type of situation, you will ALWAYS start with a 0. The ,name part brings out the custom name that is stored out through the {0} part.

,, If that happens then you have coded the application correctly.

You might have to click an ""I accept"" button before you will be allowed to use the software., Once you have accepted the EULA, backing out and ending it may prove to be difficult. Most people do not think about these things and will simply stop using the software, even though they may still be bound by the EULA terms. One option for ending a software licensing agreement is to return the software to the provider along with a note indicating that you no longer agree to be bound by the EULA.However, once you send the software back to the provider, you will no longer be able to use it.

, Another way to end a software licensing agreement is to never enter into one in the first place. For example, when your screen asks you to ""accept"" the terms of the agreement before using the software, instead of clicking ""accept"", click ""I do not accept."" When you do this, you will not be able to use the software but you will also not enter into the EULA., If the software has been installed on your computer, you have most likely agreed to the terms of a EULA without even recognizing it. If you want to end the agreement, you will usually be able to do so by uninstalling the installed software. As soon as the software is uninstalled, you will no longer be able to use it but you will not be bound by the EULA.

, If you are a company or individual that has entered into an individualized software licensing agreement, you should hire a lawyer before you terminate that agreement. A software licensing agreement is a contract and as such, there are possible negative consequences if you terminate it improperly.To hire a lawyer, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. When you contact the service, you will answer a few general questions about your legal issue and you will then be put in touch with multiple qualified attorneys.


When you are searching, be sure you look for an attorney specializing in contract law and/or intellectual property law.

, To start the termination process, you will first need to understand your software licensing agreement. Within the agreement will be several provisions relating to what you can and cannot do with the licensed software. If any one of these provisions is breached by you or the other party, you may be able to terminate the contract.


For example, if your contract stated that your license fee would be $1,000 per year, but the other party is charging you $2,500 for 2016, you may be able to terminate the contract.

, Almost every individualized software licensing agreement will contain a specific provision dealing with termination. While every agreement is different, you should look for keywords such as ""term"", ""termination"", and ""termination rights."" These words will give you clues about which provision in your contract deals with termination., Once you find the termination clause of your software licensing agreement, you will need to follow it exactly in order to terminate the agreement correctly. Every termination clause is different and most contracts will require you to comply with several provisions if you want to terminate the agreement.


For example, some termination clauses state that the agreement will automatically terminate after a certain period of time. Other termination clauses allow either party to terminate the agreement when the other party defaults on any of the terms or conditions agreed upon in the contract. Some termination clauses even allow either party to terminate the agreement so long as proper notice is given (regardless of whether someone is at fault).
Most termination clauses will include a requirement that, upon termination, you must certify to the other party that you are discontinuing the use of the licensed software. You will usually be required to make this certification soon after you terminate the agreement.Therefore, whenever you choose to end a software licensing agreement, you will no longer be able to use that software.

, Licensing agreements are entered into in order to allow one person (licensee) to use another's software (licensor). In exchange for the ability to use the licensor's software, the licensee will be restricted in how and when it can be used (and will also pay to use the software).It is imperative for software creators to have these agreements in order to protect their intellectual property (i.e., the software code, the images, the purposes of the software, etc.).


In most cases, if you want to use someone's software, you will have to agree to the terms of these agreements. If you do not, the licensor will usually not allow you to use the software.

, Software licensing agreements come in many forms and will differ depending on who you are, who the licensor is, and how you are licensing the software. The most common forms of software licensing agreements are EULAs and individual contracts.


EULAs are seen every day whenever you download and install software onto your computer, television, phone, or tablet. It is a contract between the software application author and you, the end user. When you install software, you will be asked to ""accept"" certain terms before you can use the software. Once you click ""accept"", open the shrink wrap, break the seal, or simply use the software, you are agreeing to abide by the EULA terms and conditions.Individual contracts are generally used when a corporation or some other organization enters into an agreement to license a specific software throughout all of their offices. These agreements are more tailored to the specific needs of the corporation. For example, the corporation might negotiate to be able to make copies of the software (which would usually not be allowed in most EULAs) and the licensor might negotiate to limit the licensee's ability to sublicense or assign the license., Software licensing agreements tend to have a set of common terms you will see over and over. These common terms are the core of these agreements and often limit your uses of the software. Examples of common terms include:""Do not criticize this product publicly."" These terms forbid you from comparing the product with other similar products in what are known as ""benchmark tests."" Benchmark tests are used to measure the performance of software in a controlled environment. EULA terms forbidding these actions might say: ""You may not, without Software Author's prior written approval, disclose to any third party the results of any benchmark test.""
""Using this product means you will be monitored."" These terms often allow software providers to access your computer to automatically make updates. The software provider does this by making your computer contact a third party (i.e., not even the software provider) without ever notifying you. Some licensing agreements will even make subscription renewal automatic. If this is the case, you agree to let the software provider charge your credit card whenever your subscription runs out (at a fee that could change any time).
""Do not reverse-engineer this product."" Most licensing agreements will forbid you from taking a piece of software apart in order to see how it works. A lot of inventors and people who want to customize their user experience will reverse-engineer products in order to make other products better. An example of these terms states: ""You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software.""
""Software providers will not be responsible if their software messes up your computer."" Almost every software licensing agreement includes a disclaimer of liability. When you accept these terms, you are immediately limited in the types of action you can take against faulty software and the companies that create and provide them. An example of such a term states: ""Except for any refund elected by the Software Provider, you are not entitled to any damages, including but not limited to consequential damages, if the Software does not meet the Software Provider's Limited Warranty, and, to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose.""

, A lot of software licensing agreements include terms that are vague, unclear, and even outright illegal. In addition, when you buy a software CD from a store, you are usually agreeing to the software licensing agreement before you ever get a chance to look at it. Other companies bury their licensing agreements and make them so hard to find people like you don't even look for them.


For example, provisions limiting your ability to reverse-engineer software run afoul of the ""fair use"" doctrine in copyright law. Under that law, you are able to reverse-engineer products to create another, non-infringing product.
Another example is provisions that limit your ability to criticize and analyze the producer's software. These terms most likely limit your free speech rights., If you are concerned with the ultimatum that you either agree to licensing agreements in order to use software products or do not use them at all, you can advocate for change. Write your representatives and ask that they introduce federal consumer protection and copyright laws. Ask that these new laws prohibit certain terms from being included in software licensing agreements.Letters to your representatives can be incredibly persuasive. Considering you elect these individuals, if they fail to listen to your concerns, you may not vote for them again and they may not get reelected.

For example, Times New Roman 12 point is comfortable for most people. You can also play around with font sizes throughout the document if you want to emphasize certain language.;
, At the top of the first page, you should center your title between the left- and right-hand margins. You can title the agreement “License Agreement” or “Software License Agreement.”, You might be licensing your software to the mass market. In this situation, it is not practicable to have every purchaser sign a licensing agreement. Instead, the user typically agrees to the terms of the agreement when he or she installs the software. Accordingly, you should include at the very beginning of the licensing agreement a statement that installing the software constitutes agreement with the license’s terms.


For example, you could write: “Carefully read this software license agreement ('Agreement'). By downloading the software and/or clicking the applicable button to complete the installation process, you ('Licensee') agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. If you do not want to become a party to this agreement, do not install or use the software. Instead, return the software within 30 days of receipt. All returns will be subject to the Licensor’s return policy.”You can put this language in all caps so that it stands out.



, If you are not licensing the software to a mass market, then you will create a licensing agreement for two parties: you and the person licensing the software. In the opening paragraph, you want to identify the person licensing the software as the “licensee” and identify yourself as the “licensor.”


Sample language would read: “This Agreement is entered into as of ('Effective Date') by and between , with offices at ('Licensor') and , with offices at ('Licensee')."", Recitals are the “whereas” language in a contract. This language states the motivations of each party for entering the agreement. These recitals are usually fragment sentences.


For example, you could write, “Whereas, Licensee desires to license software for the purpose of and wishes to license this software to Licensee. Now, therefore, the Licensor and Licensee agree as follows.”, The licensee can’t do anything they want with the software. Instead, you tell the licensee in the license agreement what they can do. At a minimum, you should grant the licensee the right to use the software. You might also want to allow the licensee to modify the software so that it can be incorporated into other software. However, you might want to limit the licensee’s ability to sublicense the software to a third party.


Sample language could read: “Licensor grants to Licensee a non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the software identified in Exhibit A (the 'Licensed Programs') for the purpose of . Licensee may use the Licensed Programs for its own use, and may modify or translate the programs or incorporate them into other software. Licensee is prohibited from sublicensing and transferring the Licensed Programs.”, A valid agreement requires that each side give something in exchange for getting something from the other party. You should identify what the licensee is giving you in exchange for the use of your software.


Typically, the licensee pays a fee. You should list the amount. If there is a fee schedule, under which the licensee makes regular payments, then you should attach the schedule. Refer to it by name, such as “Exhibit B contains the fee schedule.”

, The licensee might need to make copies for backup or archival purposes.You should state here the reasons copies can be made, if you want to allow copies to be made at all.


Sample language could read: “Licensee may make copies of the Licensed Programs for archival purposes or for backup, as necessary. Licensee agrees to maintain records of the use of any copy. Licensee further agrees to apply the copyright notice on any copies created under this Agreement.”

, If you allow copies to be made, you should clarify that you remain the owner of the original software and the copies. Remember, a licensee is like a renter of an apartment. The renter doesn’t own the building. Similarly, the licensee doesn’t own the software.


Sample language could read, “The original Licensed Programs and any and all copies made by Licensee remain the property of Licensor.”, You can have a license last for a certain amount of time or indefinitely so long as the person continues to abide by the licensing agreement. For example, you could write:


“The license under this Agreement shall continue until and unless terminated pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and subject to Licensee’s satisfactory fulfillment of its obligations under this Agreement.”, Generally, you state that you can terminate the agreement if the licensee is in default of any terms or condition of the agreement. Also, you typically give the licensee a certain number of days to “cure” (or fix) the default, e.g., 10 days.Also be sure to include a provision stating that the licensee must return or destroy all copies of the software when the license ends., A common warranty is a promise that the software will be in a certain condition. You should decide whether or not you want to include an “as is” provision or a limited warranty.


With an “as is” warranty, you state that you are not warranting that the software is in any condition and that the licensee accepts the software as is.You might also include a limited warranty that the software’s physical medium is “free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.” You also will warrant that the software should perform according to its printed documentation.You can put a time limit on a limited warranty, such as 30 days.Even with an “as is” warranty, it is standard to warrant that your software does not infringe any third party’s copyright or patent. You might include this language: “At its own expense, Licensor will defend Licensee against any legal action based on a claim that the Licensed Programs infringes a United States copyright, patent, or other proprietary right of a third party.”

, You can also agree as to what the licensee’s remedy will be if you breach your limited warranty. Including this provision is helpful because you limit the compensation the licensee can seek. For example, you might restrict the remedy to a refund and replacement of any defective software.


For example, you could write: “In the event Licensor breaches the Limited Warranty, Licensee’s sole remedy is to return all copies of the Licensed Programs to Licensor, at Licensee’s cost, along with proof of purchase. Licensor will then either send a replacement copy of the Licensed Programs to Licensee or issue a full refund, at its own option.”, A third party might sue you and the licensee for damage the licensee caused the third party. For example, the licensee might have relied on your software to process orders for its business. When it fails to properly process orders, a customer might sue the licensee—and sue you, too. With an indemnification clause, the licensee agrees to defend you and pay the costs of any lawsuit.


Sample language could read: “Licensee agrees to indemnify and defend Licensor. Furthermore, Licensee agrees to hold Licensor harmless from all claims, losses, damages, complaints, or expenses connected to or resulting from Licensee’s business operations.”, You should try to include a clause where you limit the ability of the licensee to get money compensation if the licensee sues you. For example, the licensee might claim that your software was defective. It can then sue you for the amount it paid for the license. However, the licensee might also try to get “consequential” damages for lost profits or for the interruption of its business. You can include a provision limiting the licensee’s ability to get these consequential damages.


A sample provision might read: “Licensor’s liability to Licensee under any provision of this Agreement for damages awarded by a court or arbitrator shall be limited to the amounts actually paid under this Agreement by Licensee to Licensor. Licensor shall not be liable for special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including lost profits or interruption of business.”, Sometimes disputes will arise between you and the licensee, and the licensee might sue you in court. Fortunately, you can include a provision in your agreement where both sides agree to first mediate the dispute or to arbitrate the dispute outside of court.


A sample arbitration clause might read: “Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The number of arbitrators shall be three. The place of arbitration shall be Spokane, Washington. Washington law shall apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.”, You should tell the licensee how to contact you. Often, you will need to receive formal notification of any dispute. If the licensee doesn’t send notice in the proper way, then you can claim never to have received notification.


For example, you could write, “Any notice sent connected to this Agreement will be in writing. Notices may be delivered personally or through the mail to the address listed on the first page of this Agreement. A notice is effective upon personal delivery or, if by mail, then five days after a party deposits it in the mail box.”, If there is a legal dispute, you can decide which state’s law will be used to interpret the agreement. Generally, you should pick the state where you are located.


A sample choice of law provision could read: “This Agreement is governed by the laws of .”, Traditionally, if one provision in a contract was invalid, a judge would refuse to enforce any of the other provisions. However, it is now common to include a clause where you state that the remainder of the contract should remain in effect even if one clause is struck by the judge.


A standard severability clause reads: “Should a court of competent jurisdiction find any provision of this Agreement invalid, then the rest of the Agreement shall continue in force.”, You want to make sure that the licensee doesn’t claim that you made oral side agreements. You can prevent this from happening by including a basic merger clause which states that the written agreement contains the entire agreement between both parties.


“This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein. The Agreement merges and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, and discussions, whether express or implied. This Agreement shall take precedence over any additional or conflicting terms contained in Licensee’s purchase order or Licensor’s order acknowledgement forms.”, You should add signature lines if you are not licensing the software to the mass market but instead are licensing the software to an identifiable business or individual.

Burn the ISO to the DVD.",How to Copy DVD Discs onto a PC and Burn a New DVD," You will need software that is capable of copying the exact format of the DVD so that the content can be burned onto another DVD. This software may have come with your computer or can be downloaded for free or purchased from the internet. Copying software will create an image archive of the DVD called an ISO which is a file that contains content sourced from an optical disk that can also be used to replicate the image onto another DVD.


Use caution when looking for software online by searching for review sites and forums when looking for trustworthy software. While the ISO file format is commonly used, some burning software can create an image archive in it's own proprietary format. You will either need conversion software to convert into an ISO file format or set the software to save in ISO format.;
, You will need a DVD drive that is capable of burning DVDs. Make sure the DVD is unprotected otherwise you may not be able to make a copy of the DVD.


If you have a CD burner, it is possible that you will not be able to burn DVDs and will have to connect an external DVD burner drive. Check with your user guide with your computer or DVD drive if you are not sure.
If you run into a situation where the DVD is copy protected or if your burning software provides a warning that copying the DVD may have an abnormality, you can make use of additional programs to break copy protection such as Handbrake or AnyDVD.

, Make sure the program is set to DVD mode and is set to read from the DVD.

, Indicate which DVD drive on your computer you want to read from.

, The program will need to find a place to put the image on your hard drive. Choose a destination such as your desktop to place the file and provide a name for the file to identify it on your PC.

, This will create an image of the DVD that exists on your hard drive. You will receive a notification when the reading process is completed.

, You will need either a DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R or DVD+RW disk to burn the content onto. Check with the user guide of your computer or burner drive to see what your drive is compatible with, though most modern drives will be compatible with all types.


A DVD-R and DVD+R or (Digital Versatile Disk Recordable) can only be burned once. If there are any mistakes you have to use another DVD to burn the content on.
A DVD-RW and DVD+RW or (Digital Versatile Disk Re-Writable) allows you to burn the content on the DVD, erase it, then burn the content onto the DVD again.
The plus (+) and minus (-) indicates different recording formats, but works the same when burning an ISO image on the DVD., If you are running Windows 7 or beyond, you are able to natively burn DVDs from an ISO. If you are running a version of Windows before 7, you can also use ImgBurn, Nero or other burning software to burn an ISO to a DVD.

, Use Windows Explorer to locate the ISO on your computer. Either using the Start Menu then click Computer or click on the folder icon on the taskbar., Right click on the ISO file to bring up a menu, then click on ""Burn disc image."" In the new window, select the drive that contains the blank DVD. Click on ""Burn"" to burn the ISO to the DVD.


If you do not see the option in the menu, right click on the ISO then click on ""Properties"" Change the ""Opens with"" option to Explorer by clicking the ""Change"" button then select Windows Explorer from the list.

Extend your recording.",How to Use Audacity1," In your instrument preferences, set the output destination of your instrument. Set the input of Audacity to match the output from your instrument. In this example, the signal is routed through the Soundflower interface from a software synth‘s output to Audacity’s audio input.


While sound cards and interfaces vary, it’s a good practice to monitor your actual instrument to prevent latency issues. Because latency is always a factor when monitoring the recorded signal, it’s very difficult to find your groove when playing. In Audacity, set your preferences as shown:





;
, Check to make sure your outputs and inputs are properly routed by first selecting Start Monitoring from the popup menu below the input meters (by the microphone icon), then playing your instrument.


The LR input meters should respond.






If the meters are hitting 0dB, use the Input Volume Slider to lower the input level so that the meters only approach 0 during the loudest sections.

, When everything is connected properly, and your levels are set, you’re ready to record. You have two options:

Press Record and start playing. There will generally be some silence at the beginning of your track. This can be trimmed away when you’re done recording.






Alternately, you can enable Sound Activated Recording in your Recording preferences. Check the Sound Activated Recording checkbox, then set the Sound Activation Level (DB)—the lower the number, the quieter the sound that will trigger recording. This is useful if, for example, you are recording in another room and don’t want to have a long silence at the beginning of your track as you walk back and prepare to play.







, Whichever method you choose, it’s now the moment of truth! Press the red Record button (or press “R”, and when you’re ready, start playing. You’ll see the wave forms written to your track as you play.


Note: While this should not generally be the case, if everything is set as described above, if you are flat-lining (i.e., the waveform displays as a straight line) when you record, that means that signal is not getting from your instrument to your track. Confirm your connections and try again.

, When you are finished, press the square yellow Stop button. You should see something similar to the image above.


If you chose Sound Activated recording, Audacity will automatically stop recording when the sound drops below the threshold level.
To add additional tracks while listening to previously recorded tracks, make sure “Overdub: Play other tracks while recording new one” is checked in Preferences: Recording.

, There’s an alternate recording option that most software sound recorders do not have, and that is Timer Record.


From the Transport menu, select Timer Record..., or press Shift-T. In the resulting window, you can set the Start Date and Time, and either the End Date and Time, or the Duration. This lets you set your recorder to turn on when you are not around. Why would you do this? Because you can!







, If you want to add additional material to your existing recording, press Shift-Record, or type Shift-R, and new material will be appended at the end of the existing recording on the current track.

Pressing Shift while you press Play or the Space bar will loop your track until you click the Stop button or press the Space bar again.






To loop a specific section, make sure the Selection Tool is enabled, then click and drag over the section you want to loop. Note: after you make your selection, press “Z” for the software to automatically find the zero crossing point: the point where the start and end waveforms are at 0 amplitude (start and end at at the same sound level). Depending on the nature of the loop and the source material, this will often give you a very clean loop without clicks or pops.







, You can alter the playback speed easily, which can come in handy if you are working out a solo, or trying to learn a difficult piece of music.

Drag the Playback Speed slider to the left to slow the track down, or to the right to speed the track up, then press the green “Playback at Speed” arrow to play your track back at the new speed. To make changes, adjust the speed and click the arrow again.







, The default view is the waveform viewed in linear form. Without going into detail, the linear scale is viewed as a percentage of level between 0—or silence; and 1, or maximum level. You can also view the track in other formats:

Waveform (dB) which shows the waveform in decibel levels. It will generally appear “larger” than the linear view.






Spectrogram, which is a colorful FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) view of the audio.






Pitch, which shows pitches from high at the top of the track, to low pitches at the bottom. It’s very interesting with rich textures, and chords.







, If you have multiple tracks playing, and only want to hear one of them, click on the Solo button in the Track control area to the left of the waveform.


All other tracks except those that are soloed will be silenced. This is very useful if you want to, for example, get a good level between the bass and the drums.

, If you have multiple tracks playing, and want to silence one or more of them, click on the Mute button in the Track control area to the left of the waveform.


All other tracks but the muted track or tracks will still sound. This is very useful if you want to, for example, compare 2 takes, or thin down the mix temporarily.

, The Pan control will place your sound in the stereo field, from left to right, to any point in between. The level control sets the volume for that track.

Trim your track.,
Apply effects.,
Experiment freely.,
Save your finished sound file.",How to Use Audacity3," If you’ve recorded more than you need, to save editing time, trim your track to only what you intend to keep. Start by making a safety backup in case things go awry, and then proceed as follows:


Choose the Selection Tool from the toolbar. Select the audio you want to keep. Choose Loop Playback (Shift-Space), and listen to your edit a few times to make sure it’s good. Adjust as necessary until it sounds right, then from the Edit menu, select Remove Audio, then select Trim, or simply press Command-T (Control-T on a PC). The audio on either side of the selection is removed from the track.






After trimming, move your audio, if necessary, to the correct location by selecting the Time Shift tool, and dragging the sound to the proper location.

, You can apply a variety of effects, from those built into Audacity, to VST effects, and effects native to your OS.


With the selection tool, select all or part of your track.
From the Effect menu, choose your desired effect. For this example, we’ll use Echo, as applied to a simple click track.
Set any parameters called for by the effect, listen to the preview, and when it’s how you like, press OK. The effect will process, and display the result. The example below is the raw click track on top, and the echoed click track on the bottom.
You can process the same track with many effects, though it’s possible to amplify the waveform too much, resulting in ugly digital distortion. If that happens, undo to the last step before distortion kicked in, and instead of applying your next filter, apply an Amplifier effect, set to -3dB. If your next process still results in distortion, undo the distorting effect and the Amplify effect, then redo the Amplify effect at a stronger level. -6dB would be good.
Note: It’s always a good idea to duplicate a track (Command or Control-D) before doing any editing that changes the waveform.

, Try all the filters, and see what they do and how the sound with your source material.

, When you’re done editing, mixing, trimming, and polishing your sound file into a rare gem of musical beauty, you will want to save it for posterity and possible fame and fortune. From the File menu, select Export..., then choose the desired format—from AIFF to WMA and many others in between.

If you haven't yet installed Audacity, you can download it for Mac or PC from the official site: http://www.audacityteam.org/

As of April 2017, Audacity is only partially supported for MacOS Sierra, meaning you may experience bugs while running it on renditions of Sierra.;
, It's in either the top-left corner of the screen (Mac) or the top-left corner of the Audacity window (Windows).

, You'll see this option about halfway down the File drop-down menu.

, It's the top option in the Import pop-out menu. Doing so will invoke a window in which you can select an audio file.

, If your audio file in question isn't readily available on your computer's desktop, you may have to search through the folders listed on the left side of the window here. Once you find the audio file you wish to edit, click it to select it.

, Doing so will open the music file in Audacity.


Depending on the file's size, importing it into Audacity may take a few minutes.

, To do so, click and drag your mouse from one side of the section to the other, then let go of the mouse button. The section in question will have a dark-grey block over it, signifying that it is selected.


To highlight the whole thing, hold down ⌘ Command (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) and press A.
It's best to select the whole audio track to ensure that the sound remains consistent after reducing the background noise.

, It's either in the toolbar at the top of the screen (Mac) or in the toolbar at the top of the Audacity window (Windows).

, You'll find this option a little more than halfway down the Effect drop-down menu.

, It's at the top of the pop-up window. This feature will determine what is noise and what is not, allowing you to filter out background noise while maintaining the integrity of the song or audio itself.


This feature works best if you select more than three seconds of audio.

, You should notice that there are now a couple of new options at the top of the drop-down menu.

, It's near the top of the menu here. Clicking this option will apply Audacity's perceived noise profile to the selected portion of the audio file, thereby removing some (or, in some cases, all) of the background noise.


If this process produces undesirable results, click the Edit tab at the top of the window or screen, then click Undo. After doing so, try highlighting a different section of the audio file.

, To do so, click the File tab, click Export Audio, and click Save. Your audio file should now have significantly less background noise.

, In case you didn't already know, a preamp is a device that you can plug a guitar and/or microphone into. The preamp is then plugged into somewhere where you can record, or the sound is amplified (e.g. a guitar amp and speaker). You'll want to get an adapter with two jacks in it. You should be able to plug a wire like the one in the picture into the adapter. The wire should plug into the line-in port on your computer's sound card. Make sure the buttons that say 80Hz and +48v are on.


Connect all wires.







, In the top-right corner there should be a drop-down menu. Set it from microphone to line in, unless you are using a normal computer microphone. In that case you leave it alone.

, Putting on headphones for recording can help the quality if you know what you sound like while singing. Since the line-in port on the sound card makes the sound go through the speakers in most cases (it's alright if it doesn't, this step is optional) you will be able to hear yourself after plugging in the headphones to the headphone/subwoofer jack on your speaker

",How to Record a Song With Audacity2," You should be using a microphone that will plug into the microphone slot on the preamp. All you have to do is plug in the microphone and get ready to go. If you are not using one of those, plug the microphone into the microphone jack on the sound card.

, Your mouth should be positioned as shown in the picture. If you are using a microphone that you usually see professional music artists using when performing live, or a recording studio mic, keep it in front of your mouth, but keep it still.

, Simply record these with wherever the sound comes out of facing the microphone.

, Unplug the microphone and plug in the guitar, keyboard, bass or other electric instrument. These will go in the instrument slot. Recording an electric instrument without a preamp is tricky. Your best bet is probably to record next to the speaker or add MIDI

, Don't play too loudly. Do nice soft strums, even if it's a heavy metal or punk rock song. You may wish to adjust the drive on your preamp for the guitar track. If you are recording acoustic guitar, you should record it with the microphone close to the sound hole.

You can download it for free on SourceForge. Remember, however, that you will need a Windows computer to use Audacity for auto-tune.


Click the large green button labeled ""Download."" You must wait 5 seconds for the download to begin.
When prompted with the file ""Audacity-win-2.1.0.exe"" click ""Save File."" The number refers to the current version of Audacity, and will change frequently.
Open the "".exe"" file. If you cannot find it, it is likely in your downloads folder.

, This free program will make it easier to add auto-tune features to Audacity, and is provided for free by the Audacity development team.


Click the version labeled ""vst-bridge-1.1.exe.""
Save the file.
Open the "".exe"" file
Follow the on-screen instructions to install the program.
When prompted for the ""Destination Location,"" make sure to select ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Audacity\Plug-ins"" if it is not chosen automatically.

, GSnap is a free effect that you can add to Audacity that gives you control over auto-tune. Like both Audacity and VST, it is available for free on this website. While Mac and Linux computers can use Audacity, they cannot download this plug-in and thus cannot use auto-tune.


Click ""Download GSnap (for 32-bit VST hosts).""
Download the zip file.

, GSnap is not a program -- it is a specific effect that Audacity can use to auto-tune songs. Before you can use it, you need to ""teach"" Audacity how to find your new effect.



Export the GSnap zip by right clicking on the file and choosing ""Export Zip""
Copy the exported zip files, labeled ""GSnap.dll"" and ""GVST License.""
Open up a ""My Computer"" window and navigate to ""Local Disc (C:)""
Paste the two files into the folder ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Audacity\Plug-ins.""

, As Audacity opens, a small window asking you to ""Register Effects"" will appear. There will be two lines, one for VST and one for GSnap, with small check boxes to the left of them, Make sure these boxes are checked and click ""Okay."", You can edit any audio clip you want, but you should start with a simple voice recording to learn how to auto-tune. Either open a file using ""File"" → ""Open"" or record a few seconds of singing with the red, circular ""Record"" button.


Your recording must have pitch! Auto-tune takes your singing and tries to adjust it to a proper melody (like an A scale). If you are recording a flat, normal speaking voice auto-tune will not pick have a melody to try and adjust.
You can only record if your computer has an internal microphone. You can also purchase a USB microphone if you would like higher quality recordings.

, Click and drag over the parts of your recording you want to auto tune. Your selected section will be highlighted in blue.


To click and drag, you need to be using the ""Selection Tool,"" which looks like a large uppercase ""i."" You can choose this tool from the menu at the top of the screen.

, Using the ""Effect"" tab on the top of the screen, navigate down until you see ""GSnap."" This will open up an auto-tune window.

, Auto-tune automatically configures all of the notes so that they fit in a scale, but if you choose the wrong key your vocals will still be out of tune. To find the key of a song, look it up online or find it by ear by searching for the one note you can play throughout the whole song that doesn't sound ""wrong.""


Check the button ""Fill Threshold"" after choosing your key.
You can change keys as often as you want, so feel free to experiment.

, Though you can play with these knobs as much as you want to get a unique sound, change these settings to get the ""classic"" auto tune sound:


Minimum Frequency: 40hz
Maximum Frequency: 2000hz
Gate: -80db
Speed: 1
Threshold: 100 cents
Attack & Release: 1ms

, Make sure that your vocals are still highlighted in blue. If they aren't, you can always click on them again without ruining your settings.

, After hitting apply, you can check how it sounds. If you don't like it, change your settings, hit apply, and try to preview the audio again. Hit ""close"" when you are done.

, Keep playing with the settings to find the sound you want, but keep these tips in your mind while you work:


Larger ""attack"" and ""release"" times make your voice sound more natural.
Adding vibrato can make you sound more natural.
The lower the ""threshold,"" the more robotic you'll sound.
The farther off key you are on the recording, the more ""auto-tuned"" your voice will sound when you're done.

The songs, snippets, and audio tracks you intend to use should be clearly labeled and saved as audio files in a format that Audacity supports, such as .wav files.


Put your samples into folders where you can find them when you want to use them. It may help to label different sets of samples or folders as ""percussion,"" ""guitar,"" ""miscellaneous,"" etc. in order to quickly find and use them.

, This freeware can easily be installed by downloading the executable installation file from http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ or a variety of other locations. If you're unsure of how to download and install Audacity, see the section below for more information.


Use trusted sites to download Audacity. Although this software is free, some disreputable sites may include viruses or other malware along with the download.

, Use the controls in the Audacity program to import a sample. You will see it show up in an initial Audacity track as a collection of moving lines that represent sound fluctuation.

, Audacity uses a visual design to represent the placement of sounds within your audio file. When you see your sample in the track, you can use mouse commands to either move the sample within the track, lengthen or shorten it, or fit it into a specific time window.


Read your Audacity track left to right. The movement of sound is represented on the scrolling track, which scrolls left to right. You will also see time markers on the track that are critical for fitting different samples together rhythmically.

, Begin to layer your song snippets and samples into a rhythmic pattern. Create additional Audacity tracks as you go to hold wide varieties of samples or sounds that will occur simultaneously.


Edit your tracks to make sure your sounds are rhythmically calibrated. For example, if you are using your samples in relation to a constant, rhythmically static backbeat, use the backbeat as the initial track and simply ""sync"" samples by moving them to places in the scrolling tracks where they are in sync.

, When you have added all of the samples that you want, play through and listen for any issues. Be on the listen for misaligned rhythms, dissonance, clipping, and other common audio problems.


Mix your sounds down. You can change volume on specific Audacity tracks to help blend sounds together in a better way.
Address ""muddy"" sound. If you are getting unclear sound, you may be mixing too many samples together. Go through with a critical ear and edit as necessary.

, When you are done, save the entire project into a format that's playable on your computer's sound-playing programs (.wav and ..mp3 work well). Congratulations! You have a finished mashup to call your own.

, Audacity is completely free to download and use - you don't even have to create an account or provide an email address. To get Audacity from its creator's website, visit http://audacity.sourceforge.net/. You should see a large blue ""Download Audacity"" link on the main page..;

Start with high quality recordings.,
Save all recordings to the highest quality possible.,
Update your sound card and drivers.,
Make sure you have sufficiently high quality speakers or headphones.",How to Get Higher Audio Quality when Using Audacity1," The better the recording, the better your final product can be. Some things you can do to improve your recording include:



Choosing appropriate recording devices. Different types of microphones work better for different sounds. Find out what microphone(s) work best for your instrument(s)/environment. Make sure to use high quality cables and connectors.

Recording in a space with good acoustics. Some space shapes and sizes work better for different recordings. You might want to stay away from spaces that echo or are so confined that sound is distorted (then again, that may be the sound you are looking for).

Eliminating as much background noise as possible. Machines creating noise in the background can add a hiss to your recording that may be impossible to get rid of.

Recording multiple takes. It may be a sound decision to record your audio multiple times in order to get the highest quality possible.;
, If you record with another program or device before using Audacity, make sure you export/extract that audio with the highest fidelity possible. Conversion from one format to another can also cause loss in quality.

, If you can afford and have the ability to upgrade your sound card, do so. At the very least, download the latest drivers for your current sound card.

, If your speakers or headphones do not represent your audio with fidelity, they may deceive you. Others may hear flaws easier if they have higher quality speakers or headphones.

Download the latest stable version of Audacity along with the newest beta release.,
Open the Audacity Preferences box.,
Check Audio I/O preferences (Devices in new version).,
Increase Quality settings.,
Customize the Interface settings.",How to Get Higher Audio Quality when Using Audacity2," The newest version may have the ability to work in a higher quality than the latest stable release, but it may also have unforeseen bugs.

, Do so by clicking Edit at the top of the window, or by pressing Ctrl + P. From here, you can make a number of changes that will increase the quality.

, Make sure that Audacity has your correct audio device information, and that Channels: is set to 2 (Stereo), or higher if applicable.

,


Raise the Default Sample Rate: to at least 44100 Hz (CD quality). converting between different sample rates can cause distortion from calculation errors, so keep conversions limited to doubling or halving. use 44100Hz or 88200Hz for general audio, but if the sound intends to be used with video, use 48000Hz or 92000Hz
Set the Default Sample Format: to 32-bit float. This gives you extra 'headroom' for your sounds.
Optionally make both Sample Rate Converter settings High-quality Sync Interpolation.

, Decreasing the Minimum of dB mode display range setting can give you a better idea of the audio you are editing and can help you avoid clipping.

"
"
Watch for clipping.,
Balance bass and treble levels.,
Experiment with different levels of effects.",How to Get Higher Audio Quality when Using Audacity3," If your audio goes outside the decibel range Audacity allows for, then it will clip, resulting in unpleasant quality. Always remember that clipping can happen with your overall audio, not just individual samples.

, If bass sounds are too heavy, they can overpower the rest of the audio or may sound bad on many subwoofers. If treble sounds are too heavy, they can drown out any bass.

, Use the preview function when adding effects to your samples. Different levels of the same effect can be the difference between high quality audio and low quality noise.

"
"
Save.,
Export to the highest quality possible.,
For obsessive quality purists only.",How to Get Higher Audio Quality when Using Audacity4," Make sure to save your project before exporting. You would not want to lose all of your hard work because something happened to your computer.

, Exporting your project as a 32-bit float WAV file will give you a large, high quality file that is likely to play easily in almost any common software media player. You can always use this file to make lower quality mp3s, or any other format. Remember, you may not be able to rely on having the original project file when you need a lower quality file (for example, for publishing online).

, The native file format Audacity uses to record your audio to your hard disk is .AU (Sun/NeXT), it stores your audio in separate approximately 1 Megabyte chunks for less time-consuming partial track editing. However, the .AU format Audacity uses for these 1 Megabyte files appears to be altered in some way as to be only playable by Audacity. If you have not saved a project file, those files still exist on your hard disk, but they are stored in your Audacity temporary files folder. What this may mean for obsessive quality purists is that since the original recording is stored in AU format, the purest, most unaltered way of Exporting your original recording to a single file may be the .AU (Sun/NeXT) format. 32-bit float of course is the highest bit depth available at this time. And just for your information, with a good, well tuned sound system, a very well trained and sensitive ear can easily hear the difference between a complex, low distortion, high quality recording saved in 24 bit and 32 bit float, at 48,000Hz. The disadvantage of using the .AU (Sun/NeXT) format is that if you use Windows, Windows Media Player does not support playback of that format. There are however a number of free media players available which do play the .AU format.

, You will see the track populate with lines that represent sound modulation, directly under the controls.


Use your initial track as a marker for rhythm and timing. Many musicians record an initial track as an ""orienting track,"" where they then align additional tracks with the first one. This track often includes percussion, a static beat or any element that will well represent time for the entire song or project.

, Get these by inputting them directly through microphones, or using prerecorded samples to beef up your final sound composition.

,


Experts recommend using the ""select"" tool available in the tools menu. An alternative method is to simply click on the whole track to select it.

, A variety of commands in Audacity help you to align sound pieces.


Try an ""align with zero"" command. The ""align with zero"" command allows you to align all tracks with the beginning of the overall time for the project.
Use an ""align with cursor"" command. You can effectively move sound portions to where you want them by placing your cursor in the spot where you want the alignment to take place and using an ""align with cursor"" command.
Additional options include using a ""selection start"" or ""selection end"" command for alignment.

, If not, edit them as necessary.

If you want to play the songs on an older device, select ""MP3 Audio"". This will result in slightly lower quality but will compatible with nearly any device.

, By default, the converted files will be placed in the same location as the original files. You can change this by clicking the Gear button in the lower-right corner.


Click the ""Same as Source"" drop-down menu at the top of the Directory section to choose a new location. You can have Adapter automatically import the converted songs into your iTunes library, or you can set a custom location.

Read about both vector graphics and raster graphics.,
Know what a vector is in mathematics.,
Understand that vector images are a collection of individual images and shapes (not just lines).,
Look at an extreme closeup of a vector image versus a raster image, as shown above, and notice this difference.

,
Become familiar with nodes and how they pertain to vector graphics.",How to Understand Vector Graphics,"


Simply put, a raster image is stored in terms of a list of pixels in a grid and what color they are. If a person were to describe a raster image to another person, it would be like handing somebody a piece of grid paper and saying, ""Color the first square white. Now color the second square light blue,"" and so on.
An svg is also an xml file, and it is possible to see the code by opening the image file with a text editor.
For a raster image, making the image bigger just makes those squares bigger. If you zoom in far enough on a raster image (such a bitmap or JPEG), you will see pixels (short for picture elements) the little squares that make up the image. Vector images are infinitely scalable; you can scale a vector file to any size without seeing pixels.;
, A vector is simply a magnitude and a direction. A magnitude can be the length of a line, or it can be something like how fast a thing is going.


If somebody is headed east at four miles per hour, his velocity can be described as a vector.
A line can be described as a vector, too, by stating the angle of that line and its length. It's this kind of idea that makes up vector images.

, They could also be described as consisting of a series of connected lines.


If a person were to describe a vector image to another person, she might say something like, ""Start in the lower left corner of the page and draw a thick, green line. Start it upward at a 72 degree angle, but curve to the right so that it ends at the right side of the image at a 60 degree angle,"" and so on.
Because vector images are defined this way mathematically, a computer can display them at any scale with no loss of definition.

,,


To edit vectors, you need to edit nodes (however your software does it)"

Whatever is inside will be selected. You will see a dashed border with arrows surrounding it. If you click on the arrows, you resize the object. If you click on a selected object the arrows change to allow you to rotate the object."
"
Create the base.,
Use transparent shapes.",How to Vectorize Maps2," To see better, the map has been filled with green. In practice it's better not to fill it, so you can see clearly what you're tracing.]] Draw with the Bezier pen tool (shift+F6). It's more useful than the pencil tool. This tool has two modes – you can go along clicking to make a polygonal line with nodes at the vertices, or you can click and drag to make Bezier curves. If you drag, you will see that a line appears at each node that drives the shape of the curve. It doesn't matter if you don't do it perfectly at first. You can retouch it later. In any case, if you don't like where you put a node, you can eliminate the last node you drew by pressing the delete key.

For making maps, it is often sufficient to make polygonal lines.
It's usually a good idea to zoom in on the area where you're working (magnifying tool).
In the example, polygonal lines have been used to trace the outline of the island of Ireland.

, In the examples shown, the objects are colored to distinguish them, but it is more practical to use transparent objects, so that you can follow what you are tracing on the original map. Everything that has to do with the fill and outline color is in Object->Fill and stroke.

"
"
Divide this base shape into the regions that fit into it.",How to Vectorize Maps3," Use the division tool (Path->Division). This tool divides one shape in two, using another shape. Trace the shape of one of the borders. Then you will have two objects. They will be in order, so that the uppermost shapes cover the lower ones (if they are not transparent). It is important that the object that will divide the island be above the island. To ensure that this is so, use Object->Raise (PgUp). Select both objects. Click on one and then the other while holding down the shift key. Create a division: Path->Division. You should now have two objects.

This is the basic process for dividing maps into regions. Continue with the same process to divide the map as many times as necessary to get a mosaic of regions.
Although it almost always possible to make maps simply by dividing, it wouldn't be a bad idea to take a look at the other other options in the Path menu (union, intersection, divide path, etc.), because they are very useful.

"
"
Color the regions.,
Choose soft colors so that you will be able to have good contrast when writing over them with black letters.,Consult Colorbrewer http://colorbrewer2.org/ to test out various pretested color themes and border combinations.,
Give the border the same properties as the filling and something more.",How to Vectorize Maps4," When you have the map cut into regions, it is time to color it. The color and style of each piece are properties of the objects. To change them, select the object and open the Fill and Stroke dialog (Shift+Ctrl+F). There are various options. The two that are of interest are:

The x indicates no fill (or no border).
The rectangle with flat color is to add flat colors to the image. There are various tabs to adjust the color using the red green and blue values (RGB); the hue, saturation, and value (HSV); the cyan, magenta, yellow and black (CMYK); or the color wheel. There is also a section for opacity, because objects can have a level of opacity or they can be left fully or partially transparent, so that you can see objects below them.
You can also color objects by importing (File->Import) an image with the colors that you want and, selecting an object and using the dropper tool to select colors from the imported image. If you like the colors from the map at: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Mapa_del_Valle_de_Albaida.svg, you can use them in the map you are creating, as done in this example.

Sometimes it is necessary to set off groups of regions, as by using a thicker border.,

Cut the border that delineates Northern Ireland so that it stops at the ocean and doesn't follow the coast of Northern Ireland.",How to Vectorize Maps5," In this case, mark a thick line for the coastline of the island and another to demarcate Northern Ireland.
, The duplication is necessary to keep the original regions separate for one part and unify the other. Once you have this new object, you can remove the fill or give it a very transparent fill and a thicker border.

Look at the image, showing the result of having done this with Northern Ireland and the entire island. Place the object showing the complete island is now in a lower layer (use the ""End"" button on your keyboard), so that the border only shows when it crosses the island.

,, Create a shape that covers the shape of the stroke you wish to eliminate and then use the tool Path->Cut Path. This will divide the border into two pieces so that you can erase (type delete) the border you don't want."

You will be able to adjust settings and even perform edits before saving the new vector image.


One of the most popular sites is VectorMagic, but you only get two free conversions when you create an account. Further conversions will require a subscription.
There are free sites available, but you may not have enough options to create a suitable vector image. If you have a lot of conversions to do, see the next section for instructions on using free open-source software.;
, Vector images work best for simple designs and logos with a few colors. You will not get good results if you try to convert a photograph to a vector image. Sites like VectorMagic support JPG, BMP, PNG, and GIF files.


For the best result, the image should have some blending and anti-aliasing. You'll be able to tell when you zoom into the image, as the edges will have pixels of softer colors to give it a more rounded look. Blended edges help the tracing program get better results. Most digital images will have blending, but you may run into issues when vectorizing pixel art, as this will result in a very jagged final product.

, When you first upload the image to VectorMagic, it will perform an initial trace of the picture. This process may take a few minutes to complete.

, When it's finished, the original image will be displayed on the left, and the vectorized image will be displayed on the right. You can click and hold the ""Bitmap"" button to see the original overlaid the vectored image. If you're lucky, the first pass could come out perfect!

, VectorMagic will automatically identify the type of image and apply what it feels is the best vector tracing process. You can override these settings by clicking the ""Hand-pick settings"" option.


You can select the type of image, which will affect how VectorMagic processes the trace. You'll be asked to select the quality level of the original image, as well as the color range. Select a custom color palette to reduce errors caused by small changes in color of the original image.
When selecting a custom palette, choose as few colors as possible to get the cleanest result.

, If you're using VectorMagic, you can switch to editing mode, which allows you to make manual edits to the segmentation so that the vector comes out clearer. ""Segmentation"" is the process of breaking the image into distinct parts which are then smoothed and turned into vectors. Click the ""Edit Result"" button to open the editor.

, Click the ""Finder"" button to identify areas of the image that the tracer had difficulties with. You can then manually edit these areas so that they processed better during the trace., Look for two different segments of an image that are connected by a pixel. These connections will result in a pinching effect when the bitmap is traced. Use the Pixel tool to erase the connecting pixel.


The Color tool will allow you to select specific colors to use with the Pixel and Fill tools.

, Anti-aliasing is fine in the original bitmap, but it shouldn't be present in the segmentation. The Zap tool will split the aliased part into a separate segment and then merge it with the other segments to create a solid piece.

, Click the ""Next"" button to process your edits. If you are happy with the output, you can click the ""Download Result"" button to download the image as an SVG file. With VectorMagic, you can download your first two images for free when you create an account.

, You can do this by clicking the menu in the upper-right corner and selecting ""Tracing."" You'll see the ""Image Trace"" panel appear.

, You can do this from the File menu or by dragging and dropping the file.

, The tracing options in the Image Trace panel will become active.

, This will allow you to see what the different settings will do before applying them, but it will increase the time between making changes.

, There are five preset buttons along the top of the panel, and more presets available in the drop-down menu. The top row of buttons include the following presets:


Auto Color - Creates a stylized set of colors based on the original colors.
High Color - Attempts to recreate all of the original colors.
Low Color - Creates a simplified version of the original colors.
Grayscale - Replaces colors with shades of gray.
Black and White - Reduces colors to black and white.

, Images converted to vectors don't usually show well with all of their natural colors, so you'll get a better result by reducing the number of colors used. This will lead to a ""flatter"" look for the image.

, This will reveal more detailed controls for the trace.

, Moving the slider to the left makes the paths looser, while sliding it to the right makes the paths tighter. A looser path will lead to smoother edges.

, Moving the slider to the left will make the corners rounder, which will lead to a smoother image.

, The Noise slider determines what groupings of pixels are considered ""noise"" and not included in the trace. This can help straighten lines and smooth out rough spots.

, Illustrator will then perform the tracing action, which may take a few moments to complete.

, This will convert your tracing object into actual vector paths, and will replace your JPG image with the vector.

, Once you're finished with the tracing, you can export the finished image as a vector file.Click the File or Illustrator menu and select ""Save As.""

Inkscape includes a bitmap tracing tool that will attempt to automatically convert your raster image into a vector.

, Click ""File"" → ""Open"" and browse for the bitmap image that you want to convert into a vector. Simple images and logos are best suited for this process. You'll have a difficult time getting adequate results when attempting to auto-trace a photograph.

, After loading the bitmap, you'll need to click it to select it on the canvas.

, Once you have the bitmap selected, you can open the auto-tracing tool. Click ""Path"" → ""Trace Bitmap"", or press ⇧ Shift+Alt+B.

, There are three different modes available for creating a single path. The ""path"" is the line tracing of your image. Selecting each one will update the Live Preview, allowing you to get a feel for what they do.These three options will help you to create a basic outline which you can then manually edit yourself.
Use the ""Threshold"" options to adjust how the scan is processed. For the ""Brightness cutoff"", a threshold of 0.0 will be black, while a threshold of 1.0 will be white. For the ""Edge detection"", the threshold is the same and determines whether the pixel will be counted as part of the border or not.

, Increase the number of scans to increase the number of colors that appear. This can be an inaccurate tool, and may not be able to provide good results for complex images.

, Once you're happy with the results, click OK to apply them to the image. Click ""Path"" → ""Simplify"" or press Ctrl+L to reduce the number of nodes. This will result in a lower-quality image, but the end result will be much easier to edit.

, This is located in the toolbox on the left side of the screen. You can also press F2. This will allow you to select and move nodes to edit the image. For detailed instructions on editing nodes in Inkscape, see this article.

, You can use the tools in the left toolbar to create shapes and lines. Use these to touch-up or replace parts of the trace that didn't turn out right.


Once you've created a shape or line, you can use the nodes to adjust the curve and shape of the object. Click the ""Convert selected object to path"" button (⇧ Shift+Ctrl+C) to edit the nodes shapes that you've created.

, Once you are satisfied with your new vector art, you can save it as a vector image. Click ""File"" → ""Save As"" and choose one of the vector file formats from the drop-down menu. SVG is one of the most common vector formats.

Know that Raster graphics, also known as bitmap graphics, are digital images which can be displayed on a screen.,
Learn that Vector graphics are used to create shapes, lines, polygons, in fact any shape imaginable.",How to Learn the Difference Between a Vector and a Raster Image," They are made from pixels which are points of colour.


Using raster graphics is ideal for drawing a photo image on a screen as each pixel has its own colour value. Raster graphics are resolution dependent – this means it cannot be scaled larger without losing quality. This loss of quality makes images look pixelated (the ragged square-like look you see when a raster image is enlarged too far).
Adobe Photoshop creates and manipulates raster graphics.;
,


The software (Illustrator) thinks of it as a mathematical formula- for example, the user creates a line on a 45º angle from point A to point B for a distance of 50mm and is 2mm wide.
The software draws the line based on this data rather than each pixel. Therefore vector graphics are infinitely scalable – if it’s 50mm in length or 5 meters (16.4 ft) in length the relationship between the points will always be the same.
This is why vector graphics are always used with creating a logo. A designer can create the vector logo and that logo can then be applied to anything from a business card to building signage with no loss of quality. However, vector cannot be used to efficiently draw photo images.

Using the ""pen"" tool, in your program of choice, is useful for creating more complex shapes.,
Make the other side.,
Utilize the 'Circle' or 'Ellipse' tool to add circles for the head and antennae.,
Use a few more overlapping ellipses to easily form the butterfly's body!

,
Connect the antennae to the butterfly's head, using either the 'Line' tool or the 'Pen' tool.,
Review what you have so far.,
Select each of the segments that made up the butterfly and add fills of color.,
Do the wings, too.,
Use gradient, if desired.",How to Create a Butterfly Clipart," Create a 'New Document' with a size of 800 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall.;
, Start by creating one of the butterfly's wings with the pen tool. Set the stroke to ""3 pixels,"" and don't worry about a fill at this point.

, An easy way to create symmetry in an artwork is to copy and paste like shapes. First, select the original butterfly wing, select 'Copy' (generally located in the 'Edit' menu of a program's toolbar), select 'Paste', and then drag my duplicated wing into place. Now you have a set of wings!

, After selecting the tool, simply click anywhere on the artboard, click and drag to your desired size. Copy and pasting can also come in handy here.

,, With 2 clicks of the Pen Tool, you can create one antennae connection. After that, copy and paste to apply the same line to the opposing antennae.

, The graphic looks a but basic and cluttered with all of the overlapping lines, don't you think? That can be fixed by adding 'Fill' colors to the shapes and removing/recoloring the outlines or 'Stroke'.

, You might use brown with a slight red tint, as pictured here (RGB value: #6B4411). You can also change the outline (stroke) color from black to the new brown. In the case of the antennae connections, only the stroke needs to be modified.

, After applying the same treatment to the wings (this time using a dark red color: #B54B1D), you have a fully colorized digital butterfly!

, This more advanced technique can be applied to fills to create a more natural or interesting colorization. For each wing, you can apply a 'Radial Gradient' combining two colors (a yellow: #D3D400 with a red: #B54B1D) to produce a more naturally colored pair of wings. Check out the final product!

Know what masks are.,
You can also use colored images or pictures to create the effect.,
Get your chosen graphic(s).,
Here are the two masks, click on the thumbnails to enlarge the images and copy/paste them to Photobie or save them to your PC.

,
Start a 'new image' in Photobie, set the sizes to 400x400 and the color to white.,
Now we need a second layer with a different color to apply the mask to.

,
Go to the top menu, 'Selection' and click on 'select whole image region'.

,
Set the primary color to the color you would like to use for the second layer.,
Once you have your color chosen, click on the 'fill bucket' tool, this will automatically create a new layer with your color.

,
Open the image that's to be used for the mask or copy this mask/image, click on the layered image we are working on and paste the copied mask over to it.

,
Now with our grayscale image selected put a check mark in the 'mask' box on the layer manager.

,
You should now see the mask effect with parts of the (blue layer) showing through to the background (white in my case).,
Simply do the same as before, 'Selection' - 'select whole image region'.

,
Set the primary color to a new color you would like to use.

,
Click on the 'fill bucket' to make a new colored layer.

,
Now open the second image to be used as a mask.

,
Copy it, click on the image you are creating and paste this new mask layer.

,
Place a check mark in the 'mask' box on the layer manager.",How to Use Masks in Photobie," They are grayscale 'masks' that allow different degrees of color and transparency to pass through one layer to the next.;
, The darker the colors in the mask the more color will go through to the layer under, that which you use the mask on.

, The first one is using grayscale or 'black and white' masks. In this article, *.jpgs are used, but any format that your software can read is fine.

,,


You can set the background color to anything you want really, or even use a picture. Experiment later when you get the idea of how these work.
You can also have the mask or masks open that you want to use, and they should be the same size as your background, in this case 400x400 pixels.

,,, Keep in mind that some of this layer will turn transparent and show through to the background when you apply the mask later.

,,,, You can close the old image you copied for the mask.

,,,,,,


You will notice (if you used the images provided) that the white part of the mask has caused the other colored layer to make its effect in the center of the images. What we want is for this mask to act like a frame. This is easy to correct.

Go to 'Filters', 'embedded filters' and go down to 'negative'. This will switch the black and white colors so that the mask now acts like a frame.

, (You may need to use other selection Mode also to adjust the selected region).

,, Make gamma higher, saturation lower, contrast higher, brightness lower.


In general, the step 4 will give you relative good effect, and all you need to do next is to use the Smudge tool on the left side Paint tool bar to smudge the edges and make the color natural, you will find this smudge tool very useful. In fact, I use it all the time.
However, it is possible the inner white part of the color adjusted layer does looks very good and you may want to use the original color for that inner part. In this case, please follow the step 6, otherwise, jump to step 7.

, Then cut only that region from current new layer through the tool on Layer Manger Tool Bar.

, Be aware that each smudge will create a new layer, if you want undo the last smudge operation, simply delete that new layer (undo button doesn't apply here):

Create a symbol with a number pad.",How to Use a Symbol When You Have a Laptop1," These numbers are often of a different color and are offset from the main symbol on the key. The typical locations for these numbers are on the m, j, k, l, u, i, o, 7, 8, and 9 keys. , Some keyboards without number pads still have number lock keys, which are often labeled “NumLk”. Otherwise, look for a key that matches the color of the hidden key-number, usually labeled “FN” key. Hold FN and press the scroll lock key, or just hold FN, depending on the computer, to enable the number pad function. , You may need to hold both FN and ALT at the same time to enter the code. A full list of codes is at http://fsymbols.com/keyboard/windows/alt-codes/list/. Release the ALT key and the symbol will appear.

, If your keyboard has a number pad on it, this is a much simpler process. Ensure Num Lock is enabled, then just hold alt, enter the code on the number pad, and receive your symbol. This goes for any PC keyboard with a number pad, whether it is a laptop or a desktop.


Examples include general symbols like ALT + 1, ☺, or ALT + 12, ♀. The system can also create accented letters such as ALT + 0193, Á, or general foreign characters, like ALT + 0223, ß. Mathematical symbols, such as ALT + 0177, ±, and a few fractions like ALT + 0190, ¾, are also possible.

As I said above, I am not very happy with the results of the Curve Bend effect in GIMP, so we can use another filter instead, IWarp (Filters > Distorts > IWarp).

If necessary, add an Alpha channel.,
Pick a selection tool.,
Select a portion of your image.,
For total transparency, hit ""Delete"".,
For partial transparency, use one of several options.,
When finished, save or export as a GIF or PNG.",How to Make a Transparent Image Using Gimp," Launch GIMP and bring up your image by selecting File > Open... from the taskbar at the top of the GIMP window, then browsing for your image. When you select your chosen image, it should load into the central editing window, with two smaller windows, the Toolbox window on the left and the Dialogs window on the right, by default. Keep track of these side windows, as they contain the tools we'll use to make our transparent image.;
, In GIMP, ""Channels"" differ from standard ""Layers"" in that they contain all of an image's graphical data for a specific color. In other words, in GIMP, color images have three channels by default: Red, Green, and Blue. Black-and-white images have only one channel: Gray. In addition, some channels have an extra channel called an ""Alpha channel."" This Alpha channel is the channel we'll manipulate to create transparency in our image. See below to determine whether your image has an Alpha channel.


First, select Windows > Dockable Dialogs > Channels from the menu at the top of the central editing window.
You should see a tab labeled with red, green, and blue squares on top of each other appear in the Dialogs window on the right. If not already selected, click this tab.
You should see entries for Red, Green, and Blue channels at the top of this tab (or, if the image is black-and-white, one single Gray channel). Below these, you may or may not see an ""Alpha"" channel. If you do not see one, add one to your image in the next step. If you do see one, skip the next step.

, If your image doesn't already have an Alpha channel, don't worry - adding one is easy. Simply select Layer > Transparency > Add Alpha channel from the menu bar at the top of the central editing window. This creates an Alpha channel, which you'll use to make a transparent image.

, At the very top of your Toolbox window (by default, this is to the left of the editing window) are tools for selecting different parts of your image. In the next step, we'll use one, the Fuzzy Selection tool, to grab part of our image that we'd like to make transparent. However, depending on the situation, another selection tool may be appropriate. The first seven tools at the top of the Toolbox window are all selection tools. In order from the top left, they are:


The Rectangle Select tool. This tool grabs a straight-edged rectangular portion of your image.
The Ellipse Select tool. This tool grabs a circular, oblong, or oval portion of your image.
The Free Select tool. This tool allows you to draw (freehand) around the portion of your image you'd like to select using your mouse - great for small, oddly-shaped bits.
The Fuzzy Select tool. This is the tool we'll use in this guide. This tool intelligently grabs a part of the image that it identifies as an object distinct from the rest. For instance, if one part of your image is a different color than the rest and you click on that part of your image with the Fuzzy Select tool, GIMP will try to grab that specific part of the image and nothing else.
The Select by Color tool. This tool allows you to select all the similarly-colored regions in an image.
The Scissors Select tool. This tool uses GIMP's edge-fitting abilities to intelligently grab shapes.
The Foreground Select tool. This tool attempts to grab objects in your image that GIMP identifies as being in the foreground.

, For this step, we'll assume you're using the Fuzzy Select tool, though any of the above tools are valid. Click on the Fuzzy Select tool's icon in the Toolbox window (it looks like a magic wand), then click the part of your image you'd like to make transparent (for instance, the background). GIMP will attempt to grab this portion of the image - you should see a dotted border around the part of the image you clicked on.


If the dotted border doesn't seem to include the right area, you may need to adjust the tool's sensitivity. After clicking on the Fuzzy Select tool, you should see, among other things, a small meter that reads ""Threshold"" in the lower part of the Toolbox window. By adjusting this meter, you can change how sensitive the Fuzzy Select tool is - in other words, how readily it differentiates between objects in your image.

Generally, for images with a small range of color or black-and-white images, low thresholds are better, while higher thresholds are appropriate for images with a large range of color. Experiment to find the right sensitivity for your needs.



, If you want the part of the image you've selected to be 100% transparent, you should simply delete it. With an Alpha channel present, parts of your image with nothing in them become fully transparent. After deleting part of your image, you should see a checkered background - this signifies transparency.


Be sure to closely examine your image after you've made parts of it transparent, especially if you've used the Fuzzy Selection tool. Small bits of your image may remain, especially near the border between two objects. You may need to zoom in and use the Eraser tool for touch-up work.

, Let's say you don't want the part of your image that you've selected to be 100% transparent. Let's say, for instance, that you only want it 50% transparent. Luckily, GIMP offers a variety of partial transparency options, which range from extremely basic to somewhat complex. Three common options which should cover most situations are listed below - choose the one that's right for you:


Use the eraser tool. Select the eraser tool from the toolbox window. You should see an ""Opacity"" meter appear below. By adjusting the opacity to a level below 100%, you can use the eraser tool to ""paint"" parts of your image with partial transparency.
Make an entire layer partially transparent. Open the Layers tab in your Dialogs window (by default, it is the first tab). At the top, you should see a list of the layers in your image. Select the layer you want, then adjust the opacity meter at the top of the tab until you get the level of transparency you want.
Use a floating selection. Using any of the selection tools listed above, select a portion of your image. Once it's selected, click Select > Float from the menu bar at the top of the editing window. This creates a floating selection - essentially a temporary layer that you can quickly edit. If you're not there already, go to the Layers tab of the Dialogs window - you should see your new temporary layer. Select this layer and adjust its opacity to your liking. When you're satisfied, click anywhere in your image that's outside your selection - your cursor should have an anchor next to it. By clicking, you ""anchor"" the floating selection, applying the changes you made to your image and getting rid of the temporary layer.

If you're having problems, try ensuring the Alpha channel is highlighted in the Channels tab of the Dialogs window before proceeding through the rest of the process.



, Both .GIF and .PNG file types should be transparency-compatible. Save your image in the format that suits your purpose. Usually, .PNG files are better because they support all the features of .GIF files and others, but, for instance, if you're making an animated .GIF, you'll obviously want to save your file in that format. If unsure, try saving in both formats - it won't hurt.


To save your image, select File > Save or File > Save As... from the menu bar at the top of the editing window. To export your image, use File > Export or File > Export As...

Print the cards.",How to Make Business Cards with GIMP," Click the File menu and select ""New"". This will open the ""Create a New image"" window.;
, The standard business card size is 3.5"" wide by 2"" high (90mm x 50mm). If you're going to have the cards professionally printed, include an extra 1/10th inch of space around the card as a ""bleed"" area. Use the drop-down menu next to the ""Image Size"" fields to select the unit of measurement.If you want to make a vertical business card, just flip the dimensions (2"" x 3.5"" or 50mm x 90mm).

, This will allow you to change the pixels per inch for the file. The default is 72, which is far too low for printed materials and will result in a blurry image.

, When you change one to 300, the other should change to 300 automatically. This means that the image has 300 pixels per inch, which will result in a high resolution final product. When you create the canvas with these dimensions, it will seem very large on the screen. This allows you to make detailed edits to the image.


If you want to see what it will look like when printed, click ""View"" and uncheck ""Dot for Dot"". It's recommended that you keep ""Dot for Dot"" enabled when editing., Each element that you add to your business card should be on a separate layer. You're able to edit layers individually, which will make it easier to make changes to specific elements without having to redo the whole thing.


You can create a new layer in GIMP by clicking ""Layer"" → ""New Layer"", or by pressing ⌘ Cmd/Ctrl+⇧ Shift+N.
The default settings will create a new transparent layer the same size as the original image. Your new layer will appear in the Layer window on the right side of the screen.

, If you want to add a background image to your business card, this should be the first layer you add. Click the ""File"" menu and select ""Open as Layers"". This will allow you to select an image file, which will automatically be added as a new layer.


Be careful when using a background, as it can make your text difficult to read.

, This layer will include your name, title, contact information, and anything else you want to include on your card.

, The Text Box tool (""T"" in the toolbox on the left side of the screen) will allow you to create separate boxes with different formatting for each. Click and drag to create separate text boxes for your company name, your name and title, and your contact information


Make sure that your text will be large enough to read. While text may be easy to read when you're zoomed-in on the card, when ""Dot for Dot"" is disabled you may find that it's impossible to see. Switch back and forth between views as you're adding text to see how it will read at its actual size.
Try to keep the same font for most of the text on the card. Changing the font too many times will be jarring for the reader.
Make sure that your name and your company name is prominent and easy to read.
Choose an appropriate font for your business. Lighthearted businesses like party planners can use a more whimsical font, while a more serious business such as accountant should stick to more subdued fonts.

, If you have a logo that you want to use on the card, you'll want to add it to its own layer. This will ensure that it doesn't conflict with any of your text boxes.


Click ""File"" → ""Open as Layers"" and then select your logo file. After loading it, you can resize it by dragging the boxes on the corner of the logo image. You can move the logo around by clicking and dragging the center of the image.
If you don't have a logo, GIMP is the perfect place to create one. See How to Design a Logo for more information on creating the perfect logo.

, Click the ""View"" menu and disable ""Dot for Dot"". This will allow you to see the card at the actual printed size. Use this view to review how the card will look. Make sure that you can read the text, and that the design is not too busy. Check for any typos as well.

, You'll want to save the file as a GIMP project so that you can easily go back and edit the individual layers. When you prepare the file for printing, you'll be ""flattening"" the image so that all of the layers are merged.


Click the ""File"" menu and select ""Save as"". Give the file a name and select where you'd like to save it.

, If you're having your card professionally printed, the printer may prefer specific file formats. Common formats include PDF and PSD (Photoshop). GIMP can export to both of these.

, Once you know the proper format for your file, you can export it in GIMP. Exporting the image will also make the printing process easier for yourself if you're printing at home.


Click the ""File"" menu and select ""Export As"". Choose the format that you want to export as from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the window.
If you're going to be printing the cards at home, select PNG or PDF as the format.

, If you want to print the image yourself, you'll need to set up a new page where you can lay out all of the cards. You can do this in GIMP, or you can use a program like Word or Publisher.

, In GIMP, make sure you create a new canvas that is 8.5"" x 11"" with 300 DPI resolution.

, Browse for the image file that you exported from GIMP. Insert it into the document.

, Select the first file, and then copy and paste it to create another. Repeat this until you've filled up the page.

, Use the rulers along the edge of the document to line up the cards for easy cutting. Make sure that they are aligned both horizontally and vertically.

, Business cards need to be printed on thicker paper than standard printer paper. Find a thick paper that your printer supports, and that won't bleed to much when printed on. Ask the representative at the paper store, or refer to your printer's documentation for tips on finding the right paper.

, Once you have the right paper inserted, you can start printing your cards. Print a single sheet first and inspect it to make sure everything is printing properly. Check that the ink isn't bleeding, and that the text is legible. Try cutting it as well so that you can see if everything is lined up properly.


Once you're certain that the cards look good, you can start mass printing them. Use a precision cutting tool when you're finished to cut the cards out.

Open the photo in The GIMP.
,
Use the Free Select tool (Tools -> Selection tools -> Free select, or hit F) to select the eyes of the subject (or in this example, subjects).,
Feather the selection (Select -> Feather).,
Invert the selection (Select -> Invert).,
Run the diffusion filter (Script-Fu -> Photo -> Diffusion filter; if you don't have this, then you haven't installed the Diffusion Filter script as per the Things You'll Need section).,
Bring up the Layers dialog (Dialogs -> Layers).,
Decompose the image (Filters -> Colors -> Decompose, use the ""RGB"" option).,
On this new image, bring up the Layers dialog.,Merge the layers until you're left with one layer.,Select the entire black and white image and copy it to the clipboard (Ctrl+A then Ctrl+C).,
Go back to the original image window (the one you ran the diffusion filter on earlier).,
Duplicate the BW1 layer (right click, ""Duplicate layer"").,
Save the gradients in the images to the right and open them in the GIMP.,
Select the BW1 layer in the Layers dialog by clicking it.,
On the right hand side, select the BW1Tone.png as your sample.,
Select the BW2 layer, make it visible and turn off the visibility of the other layers (using the ""eye"" icon again).,
Select the BW1 layer again and make it visible.,
Select the bottom layer (which if you have done everything right, should be called ""blur"" if you haven't renamed it).,
Boost the brightness and saturation of the bottom layer by going to Tools -> Color Tools -> Hue/Saturation.,
Make the BW1 layer visible again.,
Select the BW2 layer and make it visible.,Optionally, select the bottom layer and adjust the saturation until it looks right to you.,
Merge down the BW1 layer, then the BW2 layer.,
Roughly select the subject of the photo using the Free Select tool.,
Blur the background by using the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters -> Blur -> Gaussian Blur).,Admire the finished result!",How to Make a Portrait Style Photo in GIMP,", This doesn't have to be exact., Feather by about 5 or 10 pixels, depending on your mood., Now you have everything but the eyes selected., The default settings are usually okay, though it's very easy to overdo ""Radius"" (in this example, we probably did). You will now notice that the photo has been brightened and soft-focused., Merge down the layer called ""Original"" (right click, ""Merge down""), then do the same for the ""intensity"" layer. You will be left with one layer, called ""blur""., You'll have a new window with the photo in black and white., You'll notice that you have three layers: red, green, and blue. Try turning the visibility of certain layers on and off (by clicking the eye icon to the left of it), playing with the ""Opacity"" slider until it looks right to you. In this example, the blue layer was deleted altogether, and the opacity of the green layer was set to 45. Merge the layers until you're left with one layer.
,,, Paste the black and white image into the image, then bring up the Layers dialog again. You'll notice that there is a new layer called ""Floating Selection (Pasted Layer)"". Double click this to give it a new name; BW1 will do for now. Hit enter after typing the new name. The BW1 layer is now a normal layer.
, Give the ""Copy of BW1"" layer a new name, the same way we renamed the pasted layer in the last step. Here it's called BW2. Next, you're going to tone these layers.,


 Save this as BW1Tone.png...




 ...and this as BW2Tone.png. Open them both in the GIMP.

, Turn off the visibility of all the other layers for now, then go back to to the picture's window. Go to Filters -> Colors -> Map -> Sample Colorize., Hit ""Get sample colors"". Play with the levels to see what effect they have. You're aiming to have the dark parts of the black and white photo toned blue. Hit ""Apply"", then ""Close"". You'll now notice that the BW1 layer has now been toned to a subtle blue colour.
, Again, Filters -> Map -> Sample Colorise; this time, use the BW2Tone.png gradient as the sample. Now, the BW2 layer is subtly toned as well., Make the BW2 layer invisible for now. Right click on the layer in the ""Layers"" dialog, select ""Add layer mask"". Select ""Grayscale copy of layer"" and check the ""Invert Mask"" option. Hit ""OK"". You'll notice that only the darker parts of the image are toned blue.
, Make it visible and turn off the visibility of all other layers., The sliders ""Brightness"" and ""Saturation"" should be all the way up. Don't worry if it looks a little strange.
, You'll notice that the image doesn't look quite so strange anymore., Turn down the opacity until it looks right. An opacity of about 40 was right for the example photo.,, You'll be left with one layer. You're almost done; finally, you're going to blur the background layer., Feather the selection (Select -> Feather). 15-20 pixels is often about right. Invert the selection (Select -> Invert)., Use a large radius; about 10-20 pixels depending on the level of detail in the background.,"

Select your item to draw, for example, a mug of coffee.

,
Think of an approximate size you want your object to be.,
Select a technique to use.",How to Draw Something in GIMP1,", There is a world of difference in the technique of drawing something 30x30 pixels and drawing something 400x400.

, If you are drawing something relatively small, you will probably want to ""pixel"". If you are drawing something larger, there are a variety of other techniques you can use. This article will cover two methods. One for drawing smaller objects, one for larger.

"
"
Zoom in.,
Use the pencil tool and draw an outline of the object with which you want to draw.,
Pick three to five different shades of the color that each object is and have these colors handy.

,
Think of the shape of the smaller object.,
Outline the smaller object, and then shade it in using the different shades of color you chose.,
Zoom out, view your work, zoom in, and tweak it.

,
Repeat these steps with all of the smaller objects.

,
Add details to your object.,
Again, zoom out, view, and tweak.,
You should be done!",How to Draw Something in GIMP2," The zoom tool is your friend. Just press ""+"" or click the magnifying glass icon to zoom in and press ""-"" to zoom out.;
, Mentally divide the object into smaller objects. For example, if you were drawing a mug, you would divide it into the opening, the body, and the handle.

,, Getting the exact shape right is the most difficult part of pixeling.

, You many need to use more shades depending on how smooth your object is. You can ""create"" these shades using the smudge tool, if necessary.

,,, If there was a logo on your mug, this would be when to draw it. Do not be afraid that something is too big, this will only confuse you.

, Repeat this step until everything looks perfect.

, Enjoy your small mug.

"
"
As with the smaller objects, you will start by drawing the basic shape of your object.

,
This time, instead of using the pencil tool, you will use the paths tool.,
Click (*do not drag*) to form a series of points that form the basic shape of your object.,
This is when you will decide the scale of things.,Double click the paths toolbox and set the tool mode to ""edit"" (or you can hold CTRL while doing the next step, instead)

,
Form your path into the shape you want your object to be in.,
Tweak it until it is perfect.

,
Then, go to Edit-Stroke Path.,
Now, as in pixeling, divide the object into several smaller objects mentally.,
Now, you must texture the object.,
Oftentimes, you can use gradients to texture the object.,
To make the texture rougher, try filters-distorts-shift, or filters-noise-spread.

,
To make it smoother, try using many gradients set on lower opacities.

,
After you have gotten your texture right, you will need to add some lighting.,
One method it to use the self-explanatory filters-light effects-lighting effect.

,
Another is to use a simple black and white gradient set to 'value' and a lower opacity.

,
Now is the time for you to add all the details you need to for your object.,
Try things until you get something that works for you.

,
Then, just tweak, tweak, tweak and your object will be done!

,
Admire your object, and keep tweaking it.

",How to Draw Something in GIMP3,", The paths tool is your friend. Learn to use it and learn to love it.

, Do not try to make things round, leave them angular for now. Make sure the paths tool mode is set for ""design"".

, Make sure everything is the right size in comparison. If you are drawing a mug, make sure it is of the correct broadness and that the handle is not really big. Tweak things to make them the right size.

,, To do this, click somewhere on your path and drag it. This is where you will round shapes that are supposed to be round. While doing this step it can be useful to zoom in and out.

,, Select ""Stroke Using Tool"" and select pencil. Set the color to black, set the brush to a 1 pixel brush, and stroke it.

, Color each object it's basic color with the fill tool.

, There are many, many different methods for this, and so much depends on what kind of object you are texturing.

, Sometimes you can use the patterns that Gimp provides.

,,, There are a few methods to do this, as well.

,,, For example: a logo, a chip in the mug, the beverage in the mug, etc.

, Eastern emoticons originate from southeast Asia. they are typically written ""front-facing"", as opposed to the horizontal orientation of Western emoticons. Much more emphasis is put on the eyes, which are used to convey the emotion.


Many Eastern emoticons use non-Latin characters. This gives the writer a much larger range of designs that can be created, but some computers may not be able to properly display all of the characters.

, Many Eastern emoticons are surrounded by ( ) to denote the outline of the head or body. It's up to you whether or not you want to include it. Some emoticons work better with or without it.

, Both Windows and OS X have a Character Map (Character Viewer in OS X) that allows you to browse through all of the fonts on your system to find specific characters. Use this to find characters to create your emoticons with, but remember that the other person won't be able to see it unless they have that same font installed.



Windows - Press ⊞ Win+R and type charmap to open the Character Map. Use the menu at the top to switch between your fonts. Search for and download a font called ""Code2000"" for access to nearly any Eastern symbol. Click here for instructions on installing fonts.

Mac - Click the Apple menu and select ""System Preferences"". Click ""Keyboard"", select the ""Keyboard"" tab, and then check the ""Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar"". Click the new icon that appears next to the clock, and select ""Show Character Viewer"". OS X comes with all of the fonts you need to make most Eastern emoticons.Emotion/Object

You're finished!",How to Create Convincing Vintage Black and White Photographs with GIMP," The worst way of doing this is to simply desaturate it (Colours->Desaturate). This uses a perceptual model that does not resemble the colour response of black and white film. Traditional silver-halide black and white films do not behave as the human eye does; they are largely insensitive to red light (which is why it can be developed under a red safelight), and much more sensitive to blue light. Copying this is easy.


Bring up the channel mixer (Colours->Components->Channel Mixer).
Check the ""Monochrome"" checkbox then play with the red, green and blue sliders until it looks right. To copy the colour response of silver halide black and white film, you want to turn down the red channel to zero (or close), turn the blue channel way up, then adjust the green channel and the red channel to taste. For this shot, 0 red, 50 green, and 100 blue worked well. If you have (for example) red writing on a dark subject, or blue writing on a bright one, you may find that a realistic response curve is not desirable; play with the sliders until it looks right to you.





;
, Old lenses, especially ones shot wide-open, will have spherical aberration that leaves subjects sharp but adding a soft, dreamy haze to the photograph. This effect is simple to mimic with GIMP.


In your Layers dialog, duplicate your picture twice.






Blur the top layer by about 1% of the radius of your photograph; our picture was about 2000 pixels wide, so we used 20 pixels.






Set the layer mode of the top layer to ""Soft light"", then merge it down (right click menu, ""Merge down"") to the layer below. Adjust the opacity of the merged layer until it looks subtle; about 35% worked for our photograph. Merge this layer down to the bottom layer when you are done.







, Old lenses always had some amount of distortion. Wide-angle lenses had barrel distortion (whereby the center bulged out) and telephoto lenses had pincushion distortion (whereby the corners were sucked outwards).
The easiest way of doing this is with the lens distortion plugin (Filters->Distorts->Lens Distortion on current versions of GIMP).


The settings you care about are ""Main"" and ""Edge"". Positive values will simulate the distortion typical to wide-angle lenses, and negative ones will simulate that typical of telephoto lenses. In our case, the photo was taken with a moderate telephoto lens (about 100mm equivalent focal length), so we set ""Edge"" to -10.







, Digital cameras have far more shadow detail than any photographic film ever did. To make it look like film, we need to do the same: make dark areas darker, without affecting the brighter parts of the photograph.


Duplicate your bottom layer twice, and set the layer mode of the top layer to ""Soft light"".






Merge the top layer down to the one below, set the layer mode of the merged layer to ""Darken only"", adjust opacity to taste (we left it at 100%), then merge that down to the bottom layer.







, Old lenses, especially when shot wide-open, often had a defect called ""falloff"" wherein the edges of the photograph were slightly darker than the centre. While technically a defect, if it is done subtly it's a great way to bring attention to the centre of the photograph.


Create a new, transparent layer and very loosely paint an area around the edges of the photograph black with your paint tool.






Blur this layer (Filters->Blur->Gaussian Blur)with a radius of about a fifth of of the horizontal resolution of your photograph. 400 or 500 pixels is fine for an 2000-pixel wide image.






Adjust the opacity of your layer until it looks subtle; it should be just enough that you won't notice it's there if you don't know it's there. About 30% is a good bet. Then merge your new layer down.







, Nearly all lenses, even modern ones, will be slightly less sharp in the corners than they in the centre. This is especially so for older lenses, and doubly so for older telephotos and wide-angle lenses. The effect is so subtle that it's barely visible even at big enlargements (and you almost certainly won't see it at the small enlargement used here), but if something's worth doing, it's worth doing right.


Duplicate your main layer, then blur the resulting layer. The best way of doing this is with the focus blur plugin; ""Gaussian Blur"" doesn't quite mimic the defocus effect of a real camera lens. Use a radius of just a few pixels.
Add a layer mask to this layer (right click, ""Add layer mask""). Make sure you initialize it to white (full opacity).






Turn on displaying of the layer mask (right click, ""Show layer mask"") and very loosely paint the edges of the photograph.






Blur the layer mask by about a fifth to a quarter of the horizontal resolution of your photograph.






Turn off display of the layer mask (right click, ""Show layer mask"") then merge it down to your bottom layer.

, This must be the last step, just as the film is the last step in the optical path. This can be defined as small, localised variations of brightness. Modern digital cameras have no visible grain at all in daylight, while every film has visible grain. The easiest way of doing this is with the film grain script. (See How to Install Scripts Into Gimp.)


The film grain script works very well at its defaults; only adjust them if you really know what you are doing.







, We made a couple of tweaks on the final image; a pair of subtle colour tones were added (see How to Retone a Photograph with GIMP) and a final unsharp mask (Filters->Enhance->Unsharp Mask) pass was added to accentuate the fake film grain.

Any actions that you perform from now until you stop the action will be recorded.

, Select your logo. Resize the logo until it is the size you would like. Change the opacity if you would like it to be lighter. Align the logo using the right, left, bottom top or center align buttons on the top tool bar.


Place the logo or text that you have just cut on to your photo in an area that will not obscure the image but will deter people from downloading your picture and using it. Make sure it is not in a place that can be easily cropped off the photo.
Be sure to use the buttons to align your photo because your Photoshop will be able to record those actions easier than those done only using the mouse.

, To do a text watermark in Photoshop, make a text box on top of your photo, color it and change its opacity until it is very light in your photo. Do this after you start recording your action.

, Because you are recording, this will tell Photoshop where to save any future watermarked photos.

, To watermark more than one photo, go to ""File,"" select ""Automate"" and then select ""Batch."" When the window pops up, choose ""Watermark"" as the action in the drop down menu. Choose the folder with the images you want to watermark. You will need to have them in a separate folder for this action. Select the destination for all watermarked photos, using the browsing function prompted by the ""Destination"" button. Check the ""Override box."" Press ""OK"" and your folder of photos will be watermarked and saved in the folder you specified.

Set the opacity.,
Merge the layers.,
Save the file in a non-Photoshop format.",How to Add a Watermark to Photos2," Save it as a separate file that is just for the watermarked image, so that your original is not lost.

, This should contain the logo or image that you want to watermark.

, Copy the image to the file where you want to add the watermark and paste it onto a new layer, above the image.

, On the layer that contains your watermark, turn down the opacity until it is no longer as visible.

, Merge the layer down to join the watermark permanently with image (again, have an unwatermarked version saved somewhere else).

, Save the file as a jpeg or similar file which will not preserve the layers. This will make it harder for others to remove your watermark.

If your computer has an integrated numeric pad, where the numeric keys are built-in to the regular keys as alternate functions, you may need to press the Fn key to activate it. This is most common with smaller laptops and netbooks that don't have room for a regular numeric pad.
Not all laptops have numeric pads, notably the ThinkPad line of laptops. If you don't have a numeric pad, see the Character Map section below.

, This allows you to enter codes with the numeric pad.

, You cannot use the 3 key from the number row at the top of your keyboard, it has the to be the 3 key on the numeric pad on the right side of the keyboard.


If you have an integrated numeric pad, this will be the L key since the right side of the keyboard converts to the numeric pad functions when NumLock is enabled.

, When you release the Alt key, the ♥ symbol will appear. If you are using a program with a font that doesn't support the ♥ symbol, you'll see a ""□"" character instead."

Combine all of the steps to make your whole emoticon.",How to Make Emoticons1," Emoticons work best when they substitute trying to explain an emotion. They are quick, easy ways for other people to see what you are feeling. So before you create your emoticon, you need to know the reason you are creating it.;
, There are two broad types of emoticons: horizontal and vertical. The orientation is typically determined on the style of eyes that you pick. Since the most common emoticon eyes are : any emoticon made with those eyes will be horizontal.

, The eyes are one of the most important parts of the emoticon. They are what tell the reader that they are looking at a face. Eyes can be simple or complex, and many different characters and symbols will work:



: is the most common (regular eyes)

; gives you a wink.

= is the longer ""size"" of :.

^^ is an Anime-style.

@@ denotes bafflement or amazement.

X X shows pain or death

A single X can be used in a horizontal emoticon to show eyes squinting from laughter.



, The nose is one of the least essential parts of the emoticon, but it can add some flavor. The regular - bar makes a simple text nose. A @ sometimes makes a ""piggy"" snout. There are other symbols for noses, depending on how you want it to look like. ""Kawaii"" or anime faces use the underscore, which is _

, The mouth will help convey the emotion that your emoticon represents. This makes the mouth one of the most important parts of the emoticon. Classic mouths include:



) for happy

( for sad

| for unimpressed/skeptical

/ for uneasy

S for sick

P for light-hearted

To choose your colors, left-click on the color you want the outline to be, and right-click on the color you want the fill to be.
Use the Ellipse tool to draw the head. Choose a thin line so that the image doesn’t look to blocky. Hold down the Shift key while dragging the Ellipse tool to create a perfect circle.

Figure out how to make the common keystrokes used to create a cat.,
Use the right font, and try not to use spacing.,
Research ASCII art cat faces online.,
Create a basic cat.,
Add some variations to your cat.,
Attempt other versions of the cat.",How to Make A Cat Using Your Keyboard," There are certain keys you will need to use for different parts of the cat’s body. Some people make more complex cats than others do with their keyboards. But they tend to use the same keys.


Using ^ marks (hold one of the shift keys and press 6 on the numbers above the first row of letters) make good cat ears, and you can use either a w for a cat's mouth, two underscores and a period in between them, or just a period for a nose.
You can use lowercase or uppercase letter o's for eyes; if you want a surprised cat, q's can be 'crying' eyes, or you can use @ signs for dizzy eyes, if you like. Don't hesitate to experiment in a text document.;
, Unless specified, many emoticons don't use spacing between the characters. Add spaces, or use the wrong font, and it might not resemble a cat at all.When using multiple lines of text to create a cat with feet, the figure may not appear correctly when using a font that is not monospaced, meaning a font whose letters do not have a uniform horizontal width.
Examples of common mono-spaced fonts include Courier and American Typewriter. Many common fonts, including Times New Roman and Arial, are not monospaced. These are known as proportional fonts.

, In its most complex forms, such artwork (of cats and other things) has a technical name. It’s called ASCII art. That’s a graphic design technique that creates designs using the 95 printable characters defined by the ASCII standard.


There are lots of different kinds of cats, and the designs get extraordinarily complex. For example, you have the everyday ^^ face, which is made by pressing shift and 6 twice, the =' . '= face, which kind of speaks for itself, and lots of other different faces.
Just play around and use your imagination. ASCII is considered an artform because there is no single way to make a cat or anything on it really. There are many free resources available with pre-made ASCII art online.
Try doing an online search for the image you're trying to make followed by the word ASCII to see what others have already made. If you're interested in making your own ASCII art, try searching for a tutorial on making ASCII art. It's amazing what you can do with your keyboard.You can also enable different languages on your keyboard, so you will be able to use signs from different alphabets, or you can just go online and search ASCII art for examples of cat faces.

, Although there are many different ways to create a cat with your keyboard, the most basic one just requires a few keystrokes.


Create the first whisker: To do this, type an equal sign. Press the = key. After this step, you will have: =
Now, type the first eye: Type a caret (^) by pressing the Shift key, and then tap on the 6 key. After this step, you will have: =^
Create the mouth: Type two periods by pressing the period key twice. Now, you will have: =^..
Create the other eye and whisker: Type a caret and an equal sign. If done correctly, the figure produced should resemble a cat. Now, you will have: =^..^=
An alternative version uses a single period for the nose and other symbols for the ears. >^.^<, You can vary the symbol by replacing the two periods with a hyphen or an underscore: =^-^= or =^_^=. There is room for creativity, so feel free to introduce new variations. You could also type the following: = ' . ' = Note: if you leave out the spaces, you will get this ='.'=.


Adding feet creates a new line; begin creating the cat's feet on the line of text below the one on which the cat face is located by pressing the enter key. Create the first foot: Type an open parenthesis followed by a quotation mark and a closed parenthesis.
After this step, you will have: ("") Create the second foot: Repeat Step 2. After this step, you will have: ("")("") Enjoy your cat face. The cat face and feet together will look like this: =^..^= ("")("")

, You can try other variations of the cat, such as (^ ' w ' ^) (Left parenthesis, caret, space, single quote, space, w, space, single quote, space, caret, right parenthesis).


There are many variations of cat faces, some focusing on the cat eyes.Another version is (^ = ' w ' = ^) (added equal signs for whiskers.) You'll quickly notice that the carets (^) are important parts here because these resembles the cat ears.

Font Size – This will change the size of the font, much like any word processor.
Character Spacing – This is the amount of space between each character in a word. If your words are too squished and hard to read, increase the character spacing.
Word Spacing – This is the amount of space between words. If your sentences seem to be made of one long word, increase the word spacing to add more space between each word.
Horizontal Scaling – To stretch or shrink the selected text horizontally, select a scaling value from the Horizontal Scaling drop-down list.
Fill – To change the font color of the selected text, select a fill color from the Fill drop-down menu.
Stroke – To give the selected text a paintbrush effect, select a stroke color from the Stroke dropdown menu, and select a stroke width from the Stroke Width dropdown list.

If you want to do creative designs you will need to learn some cute accents.,
Find a citation, quote or anything that you want to write down.,
Choose a font.,
Make a sketch with a pencil.,
When your sketch is done, make the same thing with pen.",How to Learn Typography," Before you start practising, you have to know the theory. Anatomy of letter is something you have to know. Also terms such as X-height, baseline and cap height will help you a lot.


Basic concepts are bowl, tail, serifed and unserifed terminal, crossbar.;
, Write any word in different fonts and answer yourself few questions about them.


Does it have a serif? Wedge or rounded?
How the crossbars look and what height are they?
How the tails look?
How the bowls are? Narrow or full?
Is the letter thicker around the curves?

, It's inexpensive hobby, so you won't need tons of supplies but there are few things that you can't start without them.


Firstly you will need some paper to write on. Make sure it's not too thin and not to thick. Artists sketch paper should be perfect!
Second thing you'll need is a pen of course. If you want you can buy an expensive one, but an inexpensive one can be better for your first works because if you will get bored with it you won't be like ""Aawh, I spent so much money on this pen, what I'm supposed to do with it now? "" Also your sketches won't be incredibly pretty at the start so you don't have to waste ink from expensive pen.
If you want to add a little bit of color to your design you can also buy coloring brush pens. And last but not least you will need a ruler and a pencil so make sure you have ones.

, First you have to practise by writing a lot of individual letters in different styles. So grab your pen and some paper (at this point you don't have to use plain one, for practising letters checkered paper will be better) and choose a font that you want to practise this time. You can print whole alphabet if you want, it will help you to accurately map them. Then write every letter a lot of times. Do it every second you have free time. It's really important and don't stop doing it either if you will start to make complicated designs. It will make your technique perfect.

, For example arrows or frames makes your sketches a lot more interesting. Grab some paper and draw every accent that can make your work amazing. Be creative!

, It can be a part of song, poem or just a quote that you like. Also it can be a title of a movie, song or just a name of someone that you like. It should be inspiring and not dumb ( I mean imagine an amazing typography art that says "" I like potatoes"" ... ).

, You can choose only one to the whole design but it will look better if every part or every word will be written with different font. It's your choice, which version will you choose.

, Draw lines (cap height, baseline and X-height) that will help you make your letters same height. Plan where every singe word will be. Will it be straight or cursive ? Thin or thick? Plan all of these.

, Carefully fill every letter with ink. Don't hurry, patience is the key to great design. Then when all of the letters will be filled up, decorate it with some accents. It will make your design more personal and interesting.

When you're done you should have only your hair outlined and encircled by the path tool. As you work with the hair, anything within this path will change color once you start coloring.


For detailed, precise work, zoom in as close as possible to make your path perfect. If you're only doing this as a test or for fun you can be a little looser with the work.Don't worry about an odd strand or small, impossible to trace tufts. You can color those in later, by hand, if you need.

, A path is a versatile, editable line. A selection is the current area of the picture you're working on, meaning that any edits made outside the selection (in this case, your hair), won't show up. To create a selection, click ""Selection"" → ""From Path"" from the top bar.


You can also press Shift and V simultaneously to create a selection from your path.

, Set you foreground color near where you want the picture's final color. In general, the final shot will be a merge between the color you selected and the color of the original hair, but you can adjust the exact color later to get the one you want. For now, choose a common color, like brown, and select it as your foreground color.The color selector is the set of two overlapping squares of color in your Toolkit. To adjust one, double-click the foremost square.
To make crazy, vibrant changes, go to Colors → Hue-Saturation. Adjust the hue to drastically change your hair color into a clown-like shade, no matter how dark it is., Right now, the picture will look like a terrible Photoshop job, with a solid block of color where your hair should be. This will soon be merged into the image below as a realistic hair coloring.


You can also use this mode to see if you've missed anything. If you want, use a paintbrush to coat any missed hairs in your new color.

, Return to the layer's window and make sure your transparency layer is selected. Then click on the drop-down menu for ""Mode"" and select ""Overlay."" This will take the color and imprint it on the image below it, merging the colors while keeping the same shadows and highlights from the original image. You can play with other modes as well, such a Multiply (which leads to a darker hair color, overall) to find one that fits perfectly.


Turn down the layer's opacity to bring the new color closer to the old one. This is a good, quick way to fine-tune your new coloring.
Remember that this is only an overlay. If you deleted the transparency layer at any point you would return to your original image., Once you've made the layer, you can use the bucket to drop in new colors and instantly change your hair color. Play with the opacity and image mode until you get the digital dye-job you were hoping for.Remember to use the Hue and Saturation feature before coloring if you're having trouble with dark hair, or want a more comically bright color like pink or green.

, The biggest issue when changing hair color is the skin underneath. If the hair is thin or splayed out the skin underneath is exposed and accidentally changed colors, leading to unnatural lines and an obvious editing job. Luckily, you can use the eraser to perfect your lines. Simply set the eraser to a gentle dot with faded edges -- a soft brush. Lower the opacity to 20%, then slowly erase away a little bit of your transparent layer where the hair meets your scalp. This removes 20% of the coloring with each pass, allowing you to adjust it slowly so that it looks natural.


You can use a paintbrush, set to the same color as your transparent layer, to do similar detail work. You can zoom in and ""paint"" the hair your new color by hand. You will need to deselect your selection area (Ctrl + K) to paint outside of the outline, however.If you're really talented you can use the brush and eraser to put in highlights, or add new colors to your haircut."

Lighten the original hair for greater control over the final color.,
Put as much light and color into the black hair as possible before moving on to the transparency layers.,
Double up your transparency layer to make your changes more prominent.,
Retain the photo's original lighting when making precise edits.",How to Change Hair Color in GIMP2," Sometimes the image you have doesn't lend itself well to color changes. This commonly occurs with very dark hair, which may be so close to black it is impossible to lighten it or get new colors. A good way to fight this is to use multiple transparency layers, allowing you to get multiple effects on the same head of hair. Create a new transparency layer underneath the first one by right-clicking on the first transparency layer. Then try the following effects before moving on to your standard color-changing layer.


Adjust Hue and Saturation for wild color schemes. Click on Hue and Saturation and adjust the Hue to turn one color into another one, like vibrant red, purple, green, etc. Saturation will adjust how vibrant the color is -- too low and the hair will get gray, two high and it will be nearly-neon. Change the hair to yellow to make it easier to adjust.
Use Brightness and Contrast to lighten dark hair before changing the color. Brightness affects the light, contrast affects the difference between whites and blacks.

, Mix and match the two colors to get good final tones-- a bright, low contrast yellow hue on black hair can be easily transformed into blond hair with the second layer. The more you can lighten the dark hair before moving on, the better.


A yellow hue, combined with raised brightness and contrast, should give you enough room to start messing with the actual color.

, This may be the easiest way to get dark hair lighter. Use the normal techniques to get the hair a little bit darker. Once you're happy with the first layer, simply copy and paste the transparency layer once or twice. If you're using ""Overlay"" mode, the lighter copies will ""stack"" on each other, making the final effect much more pronounced., The benefit of transparency is that it retains the light values of the original photo, making sure the shadows and highlights all stay the same and match the rest of the photos. When making precise edits with the eraser or brush, remember to leave the natural dark and lights spots on the hair identical. Save your tweaks to the strands on the side and the difficult, uneven lines. Don't try and darken up a shiny spot to make the hair look darker or lighten up the shadows to make the photo blonder.


You may be tempted to invert the colors of dark hair blond (making black white and visa versa), but this will completely flip the lighting of the shot and make the hair look unnatural.
Any change you make to the total lightness or darkness of the hair should be done to the whole head, not just certain sections.

The simple lines will provide the clearest shadows and make the image stand out more.To make an entire image pop out, select the whole image to add a drop shadow around the border.
To select text, click the Text layer in your Layers window. Your text should be a large size with a thick font for a well-defined drop shadow effect.
Use the Selection tools to select any shape or section of your image you want to add the drop shadow to.;
, This will open the Drop Shadow tool. Sometimes this window will open behind your other GIMP windows. You'll see several options for adjusting your drop shadow settings.

, The drop shadow tool will automatically offset the shadow by four pixels to the right and below the selected object. These default settings will provide a subtle shadow with the light source appearing to come from the upper-left of the selected object.


Increasing the ""Offset X"" value will move the shadow to the right by the number of pixels entered. Using a negative number will move the shadow to the left instead.
Increasing the ""Offset Y"" value will move the shadow down by the number of pixels entered. Using a negative number will move the shadow up instead.

, The shadow's blur radius will change how large and fuzzy the shadow appears. A large blur radius will extend the shadow but the blur will stretch out with it. The blur radius is measured in pixels.

, You can change the drop shadow color to any color you'd like by clicking the current color. A black drop shadow is the most common and least jarring if you don't want it to stand out.

, The default opacity for the drop shadow is 60%. Increasing this will result in a bolder shadow, while decreasing it will make the shadow fainter.

, This option is most important when you are adding a drop shadow around the border of the entire image. Without this option checked, the drop shadow would appear outside of the bounds of the image canvas. Enabling ""Allow resizing"" will automatically resize the image if the border extends past the boundaries. Any additional extended area will be transparent., Click ""OK"" to apply the drop shadow settings and add the drop shadow to your image. There is no preview button, so you just have to add it to see how it looks.

, If you don't like the way your drop shadow looks, just use the Undo command to get rid of it. It is not possible to edit a drop shadow after adding it, and it will be quicker to just create a new one since your settings were saved.


You can quickly undo your last action by pressing Ctrl/⌘ Cmd+Z. You can also click the Edit menu and select ""Undo"". In the right frame of GIMP, you can open the Undo History tab, which will display all of your recent actions.

, Your object should still be selected. Your previous settings will be saved, so you can make any adjustments to the drop shadow settings before creating a new one. Repeat this process until you've got the perfect shadow.

, The Drop Shadow will be a separate layer on your image. You can use the Move tool to click and drag the drop shadow so that you can move it around the image canvas.

, Drop shadows exist to give the illusion of depth to 2D objects. If the shadow is too pronounced, it will draw attention to itself and shatter the illusion. Shoot for an Opacity setting of 30-40% for a subtle and effective shadow.

, You can apply multiple shadow effects to give your shadows more depth. For example, you might have an object with text underneath it. Adding another faint shadow between the object and the text can help connect them in the viewer's eye. This is especially useful if you have multiple similar elements on the same page, such as buttons with labels underneath each one.

, The default settings for the shadow offset will display the shadow to the bottom-right of the object. A more natural and pleasing look, especially for web design, it to have the ""light source"" directly above the object so that the shadow only appears along the bottom edge. This will give your designs more balance. To do this, set the ""Offset X"" value to ""0"", and use the ""Offset Y"" value to set how deep the shadow is.

, Shadows exist to help the viewer determine depth. If you have multiple objects overlapping, and they all have the same drop shadow settings, your design will be hard to interpret. Overlapping elements should have smaller shadows, so that they don't appear to float high above the object below. Make all of your shadows sizes relative to the total height from the top overlapping object to the base.For example, if the topmost object has a shadow that is 20 px on the base of the image, an object that is tucked underneath it should have a smaller shadow where it intersects the topmost object, maybe 10 px.
Give higher objects a lighter shadow. As you build your drop shadows for multiple objects, your ""higher"" objects should have slightly lighter shadows, while objects that are ""closer"" to the canvas should have darker shadows. This will help differentiate between the different heights. Increase the blur radius for higher objects to make the shadows softer as well.

, There are 2 ways to open this menu. The first is to click on ""Tools"" in the main tool bar, and then select ""Color Tools"" and ""Brightness-Contrast."" The second way is to click on ""Colors"" in the tool bar and then select ""Brightness-Contrast.""

, Use the slider labeled ""Brightness"" to adjust the layer's brightness. Moving the slider to the left makes the layer darker, while moving it to the right makes the layer lighter. Note that this transformation will occur uniformly, which means that it will increase or decrease the brightness of each pixel by the same magnitude.


For example, if you increase the brightness of a layer that is too dark overall, the finished image will likely have a washed-out appearance. This is because the brightness slider turns the layer's darkest tones (like black) into medium tones, and so the overall contrast has been reduced.
To adjust brightness in a non-uniform manner, you should use the ""Curves"" menu instead. This will allow you to adjust brightness while preserving the layer's tonal variety.

, Click ""OK"" to apply the changes you've made. Remember to save the image before closing GIMP.

The horizontal axis represents the current tonal spectrum of your layer, while the vertical axis represents the adjusted tonal spectrum. By clicking and dragging the line to adjust its shape, you are telling GIMP to adjust each tone on the x-axis to its new position on the y-axis.

, To begin editing your graph, you need to add a control point. To do this, click once at any point along the linear graph. You will see a small circular node appear. This is a control point, which you can use to adjust the shape of the graph. Additional control points can be added later to achieve more intricate shapes.

, To make your layer brighter, for instance, click on the control point you created and drag it upwards. This will turn the linear graph into an upward curve. The mid-tones of the image are now brighter, but the darkest and lightest tones has remained unchanged, so the image will not have a washed-out appearance.

, Each anchor is represented as a circle, and two anchors are connected by a straight line. That line is the cutting line, so make sure that it is hovering just off the outline of the object, or touching it. Once you've reached the point where you started, move on to the next step.

, This will connect them properly. If you do not hold down CTRL, then it will move the first anchor instead.





, All that is needed is to click the button labeled ""Create Selection from Path"" under the path tool.





, To do this, right click the active layer, and near the bottom is a button named ""Create Alpha Channel"".





, This can be done by looking under the opacity meter and checking the box next to the checkerboard-like icon.





, It is important to do that in that order. Press CTRL+I to invert and then CTRL+X to cut. Your object should now be on a checkerboard background, indicating that it is transparent.

, Unless the path was 100% perfect, there will be small pieces of background stuck to the outside of the object or small divots where pieces of the object were cut out. While not much can be done to fill in spots that were cut out, the leftover background can be erased. Take a 1 pixel eraser and remove anything leftover.

Shoot at a slow ISO speed, if your camera supports changing this.,
Use a graduated neutral density filter when taking your photos.,
Underexpose if you're not using a neutral density filter.",How to Make Skies Beautiful with GIMP1," For point and shoot cameras, this should always be the slowest speed you have. If you have a digital SLR, this is less important, but you should still err towards using slower speeds. Our example used 100 ISO on an ancient Canon D30; more recent digital SLRs will be fine at much faster speeds. We'll get to the reason for this in a bit.

, Consider getting one if you don't have one. A graduated neutral density filter blocks out light in part of your photo; since skies are typically much brighter than whatever is below them, this allows you to get a more consistent exposure across your photo. But, if you don't have one, or you have no way of fitting filters to your camera or lens, don't worry about it; see the next step., This can be by as much as a stop or two; anything that ensures that your sky does not go pure white (or largely so). The lost detail in dark areas can often be recovered later. Blown highlights (from an overexposed sky) can never be. The opposite is often true of film cameras; even massive overexposure does not result in blown highlights, but shadow detail is often impossible to recover. This is part of the reason you should shoot at a slow ISO; recovering shadow detail brings out noise. Also, the technique used here will bring out any noise that is in the sky, too. If your photo is already noisy (as it will be at faster ISO speeds), then the end result will be ugly."

, Find a series of sprites that will make sense when viewed in sequence(usually a running animation).

, Make the selection only as big as it needs to be. You can change the size of the image later if necessary.

, Then press Ctrl+Shift+V to paste to a new image.

, You want to get rid of that or it'll look silly. First click the background color using the Select By Color tool, then press Delete. You should just have your sprite on a grey checkerboard(representing transparency).

, Copy and make sure that your working image is the one selected before using Paste As New Layer from the Edit menu.

, When you're satisfied with what you have, Pick Export from the File menu and save your animation as a GIF file.

, Then you will see another dialog box with more options. Change the Delay Between Frames option to your liking. A lower option means less delay between the display of each layer. Change the ""Frame Disposal"" option to ""One Frame per Layer (replace)"".

, Right click on the ""Background copy"" layer and go to Add Layer Mask.... Hit ""Add""; none of the settings are relevant to you here., Press L to select the gradient tool, or bring it up from your tool. Go to the main GIMP window and ensure that the foreground colour is set to black, and the background is set to white. Ensure that the gradient is set to black-to-white (one of the ones called FG to BG).




, Hold down your Control key (this ensures a straight line). Click and hold down your left mouse button on (or at some point above) the horizon line and hold down your left mouse button. Drag your mouse pointer to some arbitrary point upwards; you will have to experiment with this to see what works better for your photograph. Release your left mouse button. In the Layers dialog, right click on the ""Background copy"" layer and go to Show Layer Mask to ensure that you've done it right. Do the same again to turn off the display of your layer mask.
, You will notice that the contrast and colour of your sky has improved. This is what you want. We'll call this the ""soft light layer"" from here on.
, Zoom to 100% on your photo (View -> Zoom -> 1:1). Then, in the layers dialog, right click on your soft light layer and go to Duplicate Layer. Do this until either you're either happy with it, or until you start seeing large blocks of colour (when you hit the latter, this is sensor or film noise taking its toll).
, Hit ""OK""; none of the options are relevant here.
, This is optional. Use the freeform select tool (hit F) to loosely select the sky. Go to Select -> Feather, use a Radius of roughly 1%-2% of the height of your photo in pixels. Go to Colors -> Hue/Saturation and slide the Saturation slider over to the right to taste. As earlier, it might be best to zoom to 100% in order to ensure that you're not bringing out too much noise in the process. Hit ""OK"" when you're happy with it.
, You can skip this step if you used a neutral density filter on the sky. Duplicate the bottom layer and add a layer mask, as we did in steps 2-5; except this time you want to do it backwards by drawing the gradient starting at or just above the horizon line, and ending at some point just below the horizon line; the end result is that the ground will be in the white area of the layer mask, and the sky will be in the black area. As before, you'll have to experiment with this. Set the layer mode to Dodge or Screen. Duplicate it to taste, then merge them, as before.
, In our example, the sky was crudely de-noised a little with a selective Gaussian blur (Filters -> Blur -> Selective Gaussian Blur), then the area below the horizon was sharpened (Filters -> Enhance -> Unsharp Mask), and finally a single pass of Harry Phillips' ""tone mapping"" script was applied., Or don't; go away for a few minutes, come back and compare it to your original to see if it really was an improvement. Chances are good that it was; but it doesn't hurt to go back to the start and experiment with different layer masks, and so on.

Download a GIMP brush or brush pack.,
Place the brush in the brush search path.,
Click the “Refresh Brushes” button.",How to Install Gimp Brushes1," There are many that can be found on the Internet. Just do a search for “GIMP Brushes”. Both dedicated sites like GIMPbrush.com and artist sites such as DeviantArt feature GIMP brushes. GIMP brushes end in the extensions “.gbr”, “.gih”, or “.vbr”. Simple brushes for other programs, such as Photoshop, also often work for GIMP by simply changing the file extension to “.gbr”. Note that recent versions of GIMP will actually convert Photoshop brushes automatically. The more complex the brush, the less likely it is to be convertible to GIMP. Procedural brushes, which change shape depending on how they are used, generally can’t be converted.;
, The proper place for this is in your personal “Brushes” folder, generally found at “C:\Documents and Settings\myusername\.gimp-2.6\brushes”. The exact filename will vary according to the version of GIMP you are using. There is a general brushes folder that is not separated by user, but GIMP advises that you do not edit that folder in any way.

, This is a button near the bottom right of the brushes display that shows two arrows, each pointing at the beginning of the other. This should cause GIMP to detect and display your brushes.

Create the image you want as a brush.,
Save your image.,
Click the “Refresh Brushes” button.",How to Install Gimp Brushes2," Use GIMP to draw your brush for you. It can be literally any image, but some work better than others. A brush will basically make a stamp of the image over and over in rapid succession as you move the mouse, so complex can create an undesirable effect where the intended image is obscured. Open the file with appropriate settings for the size and shape of the brush you want. Use black pencil to draw the image, and zoom in to ensure you get a pixel-perfect shape. Note that you can also just copy a selected portion of the image, and GIMP with create a brush from the selected area for the current window. You’ll have to save the selection as a brush for it to remain available, however.
For a simple brush with variable colors, use black for the brush itself, and pure white for any transparent spaces. You can select the color of this type of brush via the normal color selection process, and draw using its shape in any color you please.
For a brush that cycles through shapes or colors, you will need to open a file with transparent fill. Make each different image you want the brush to cycle through on a separate layer. When you draw with it, each time the brush repeats the image it will use only one of the layers, giving you a closely repeated pattern as you draw. The colors of this type of brush are set when it created, so unlike variable-color brushes, you can’t select a different color from the color selector before drawing.

, Use the “.gbr” extension for simple brushes, “.gih” for brushes that cycle through images. Save it to “C:\Documents and Settings\myusername\.gimp-2.6\brushes”, or the analogous folder for your version of GIMP.

Determine whether you really are using too many emoticons.,
Think about why you're using so many emoticons in the first place.,
Replace the emoticons with something else.,
Limit yourself to one emoticon.,
Cut down on using emoticons in forums, blog posts or chatrooms.,
Make sure to include text with any emoticons you use.,
Consider the content that comes before each emoticon.,
Don't be afraid to use the occasional smiley.",How to Use Fewer Emoticons," First you need to find out whether you do actually have a problem. Using some is okay, but you need to know when too much is too much. Do you tend to end all of your sentences with one? Post emoticons in a conversation without any words attached to them? Greet everybody with a smiling face? Think about it. Ask people you often talk to or instant message whether they think it is too much, or whether it annoys them. If you talk a lot in a chatroom, they may have statistics you can look at. Over 50 percent of your lines containing an emoticon is a good benchmark for realising when to start cutting down.;
, Do you really need to convey an emotion with everything you type? Is it just becoming a habit to include them? Try to only use them when you really mean them, and make yourself clearer in the text that you do write.

, Is something confusing you? Use a question mark. Do you find something extremely surprising? Try using an exclamation point. There are a myriad of ways in which you can convey a greater amount of meaning using your keyboard, without having to resort to using an emoticon per sentence.

, Do you really need the whole range? To begin with, try only using one from your vast array, for example, using a :) every now and again when something actually made you smile. This will help you start to cut down on your overuse. It will also help your readers know when you really mean what you're expressing through an emoticon.

, Try to keep them for when you are speaking one-on-one with somebody you know well, as when you post too many in a public place there will probably be some who are okay with it, and some who'd rather you didn't. An emoticon or two is okay, but it can also make it harder to read what you and indeed other people are saying.

, This will automatically cut down on the percentage of what you write that is made up of emoticons and will also help you express yourself better. Contrary to the popular saying that ""a picture is worth a thousand words"", you will actually be more explanatory and expressive by forgoing the :D and opting for ""I had an awesome day, thanks!"" instead. In addition, stating your feelings will make you appear both more mature and verbose., Is using one really appropriate in this instance? If someone tells you some bad news, a few well thought-out words of condolence and support can go a much longer way than a simple :( Likewise, it's probably best to avoid emoticons when delivering bad news yourself, and if you ever say something mean or rude, just because you used a smiley with it does not make it okay., Using a few emoticons is definitely okay in a text, forum or chatroom environment, it's only when you use too many that it becomes a problem. Just keep an eye on how many you are using and make sure that you communicate effectively and can be understood.

Italicize block quotations.,
Italicize the names of named major transportation vehicles.,
Italicize the titles of certain major creative works.,
Italicize a character’s internal dialog.,
Italicize onomatopoeia (word sounds).",How to Italicize," Most software applications let you choose which text you wish to italicize in one of two ways:


Select existing text to be italicized. Place your cursor in front of the first letter in a block of text to be italicized. Hold down your left mouse button and drag your cursor over the block of text to highlight it, then release your mouse button.
Italicize new text. Place your cursor at the location within the body of text where you want to type new, italicized text. In most cases, this will be at the end of the text.;
, Within a software application, you can italicize text using either the software’s graphic user interface or with a keystroke command.


The applications in Microsoft Office and many similar applications feature either a toolbar or ribbon interface that includes a set of text formatting button controls. Among these controls is a button showing a capital “I” slanted to the right. This is the Italics button.
Press the CTRL and I keys on your keyboard at the same time to enable italics in Windows.In MacOS, you can also enable italics by pressing the COMMAND (also called the “Open Apple”) and I keys on your keyboard at the same time., Which way you use the software interface or keystroke commands depends on whether you are italicizing selected text or typing italicized text.


To italicize selected text, either click the Italics button or use the appropriate italics keystroke command. The selected text will be italicized, and the highlighting around the text will disappear.
To italicize as you type, either click the Italics button or use the appropriate italics keystroke command. Begin typing. As you type, your text will be displayed in italics. To turn off italics, click the Italics button or use the appropriate keystroke command again. Your text will no longer appear in italics.

, The italics tag is an upper- or lowercase “I” bracketed by a less than (<) and a greater than (>) sign: <I> or <i>.


You can place the tag in front of text you've already typed or type the tag and then type text you want to italicize.

, The close italics tag looks like the italics tag, except that it has a forward slash between the less than sign and the “I”: </I> or </i>.


If you do not place a close italics tag after the text you wish to italicize, all the text following the italics tag will be italicized.
A number of websites allow you to enable HTML to support bolded, italicized, and underlined text. They may or may not support other HTML features, however., LaTeX (pronounced “LAY-tech” or “LAH-tech”) is a typesetting application that converts text files into formatted documents. To use LaTeX, you must first create a document in a text editor program with instructions telling LaTeX what type of document you have and where the actual document text begins. These instructions are command that begin with the backslash (\) character.


Specify the type of document with the “\documentclass” command, with the type of document specified in braces. For an article, the command would read “\documentclass {article}”. (Do not include the quotation marks; they are used here to set off the example.)
Specify where the text portion begins with the command “\begin {document}”.

, The braces indicate the starting and stopping places for formatting the text as specified by the formatting command.


You can nest several formatting commands, such as having a large block of italicized text with a portion within it in boldface. If you do nest commands, be sure to use as many close braces as you do open braces to ensure that the text is formatted the way you want.

, A sentence with the last word italicized would read as follows: “One of the first TV shows to realistically depict the routine of patrol officers was \textit {Adam-12}.”, Two single quotes (apostrophes), placed in front of and behind the text to be italicized, signal Wikipedia’s text editor that the text between them should be displayed in italics.You may type your text first and go back and place single quotes around the text, or type the first pair of single quotes, your text, and then the second pair of single quotes.


Paired single quotes can be distinguished from double quotes by the greater amount of space between them.
If your text editor has a “smart quotes” feature, you may need to turn it off for Wikipedia’s text editor to recognize the single quotes as formatting signals.
If you have a hyperlink that includes italicized text, the italics flags must be outside the hyperlink bracket indicators if all the hyperlink text is to be italicized. If only part of the hyperlink text is to be italicized, you may place the italics flags around only the text to be italicized., In simplest terms, this means that any word you would underline in a handwritten letter to emphasize, or would say more forcefully than others when speaking, you would italicize in a word processing document or on a website. For example, “I am the only living only child among my first cousins.”

, Foreign words and phrases used in English writing for effect are italicized, such as using the German Turnverein in place of the common American term “athletic club.” Foreign words that have become part of the English language through common usage, such as “kindergarten,” are not italicized.


The Latin words for the genus and species of an organism are also italicized, as in Homo sapiens.

, This is normally done when the terms are first introduced, particularly if they have a meaning different from what the reader is used to.


Physical constants, such as c for the speed of light, and variables in algebra, as in “ n = 2,” are also rendered in italics., A block quotation is a lengthy quotation (typically 100 words or more, or at least 5 to 8 lines of text) set off from the rest of the text and indented. Block quotations are often rendered in italics, or in a different font or point size.When an item in a block quote would be italicized, and the rest of the block quote is already in italics, the item is commonly rendered in normal text to set it off from the block quote.
Large blocks of italicized text can be hard to read on some computer screens. In such cases, you may want to render block quotes in a different font than the surrounding text., While you do not italicize the make, model, or military designation of a vehicle, vessel, or craft, you do italicize the following named vessels:


Trains (The Golden State Limited), but not the names of individual cars.
Ships, either military or passenger vessels (USS Lexington, Queen Elizabeth II).
Aircraft names or nicknames not based on construction or performance characteristics (Memphis Belle or Cutter’s Goose from the TV show Tales of the Gold Monkey, but not the Batplane).
Spacecraft, either real or fictional (the Space Shuttle Challenger, the starship Enterprise, the Millennium Falcon). Space missions, such as Apollo 11, are not italicized.

, The following works have their titles rendered in italics, unless a particular style manual (such as AP or MLA) dictates otherwise:


Books (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone), except for the titles of religious books such as the Bible or the Koran. Titles of chapters, sections, and short stories within anthologies are enclosed in double quotes.
Magazines (Collier’s, Reader’s Digest). Titles of articles (“I Am Joe’s Kidney”) are enclosed in double quotes.
Newspapers (USA Today, The Wall Street Journal).
Plays (Romeo and Juliet, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?).
Court cases (Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka).
Television and radio programs (Star Trek, The Shadow). Titles of episodes (“Amok Time,” “Temple Bells of Neban”) are enclosed in double quotes.
Record albums (Mandatory Fun, Red). Titles of album tracks (“Word Crimes,” “I Knew You Were Trouble”) are enclosed in double quotes.
Artwork (Mona Lisa, The Last Supper).
Punctuation marks that are part of the title are italicized with the rest of the title., In fiction, when a character’s thoughts are put into words for the sake of the reader, they are commonly rendered in italics, as in “Kate regarded her husband with apprehension. That’s funny, Joe never asks for a second cup of my coffee.”

, If you’re attempting to render a sound with a word the way the reader would hear it, italicize the word: “The startled cat gave out an angry Meeeowwwrr!” If you’re using a word to describe a general sound, you don’t italicize it: “The cat meowed.”"

Submit your font sample to other discussion boards or groups.",How to Identify a Font," To help you identify a font, you will need a sample image of the font. If possible, use an image that is clear, has large letters, and is perfectly horizontal. If there is excessive background noise in your image sample, you may want to touch it up in an image editing program. The clearer your font sample, the better luck you will have with many font identifying techniques.;

Since it will be resized to a small size and a drop shadow will be added, small defects will not be noticed. Select the source image based primary on how it reflects your personality or attitude, not necessarily on quality. That being said, if you can find an appropriate high resolution image, it'll make the processing simpler.;
, Cut the head on contour. Different methods are available. Do not forget to add an alpha channel to the layer, because you will want deleted regions to become transparent. You can use a combination of the tools described below:


The Magic Wand - This is most useful when the background contains large areas with uniform colors, highly contrasting with the subject (not the case with the image used in this example). Use ""Select contiguous regions"" and adjust the threshold as needed.
Cut on path - Use ""Select shapes from image"". Work at a high zoom and add short segments. The results are good when the contrast between background and figure is high.
Quick Mask - This is a very powerful tool, it may be a bit overwhelming for a simple hackergotchi.

Toggle Quick Mask, erase the face, toggle Quick Mask off, invert selection and remove it.
Note: The selection is left unfinished on purpose, the scope of this tutorial is to be quick.


Erase - This one is fairly simple to use. Select rectangular regions of the background and delete them.

Then zoom in and use the eraser on the contour.



, After scaling, the images become blurry, so sharpen it.

, Most beginners are tempted to use the default value proposed by GIMP. Do NOT do this, as it is too large for a hackergotchi. Use smaller values. In this case try the X and Y offset of 1 px and a blur radius of 4 px.


An alternative is to use a perspective shadow.

Click the ""New Layer"" button at the bottom left. Enter a name for it (we'll use ""Vignette"" in our example). Set ""Layer Fill Type"" to ""Foreground color"" (this assumes that your foreground colour is set to black, which it usually is). Hit ""OK"".
, In the Layers dialog, click on your ""Vignette"" layer to select it, and select Soft light from the ""Mode"" drop-down box. You will notice your whole image darkening noticeably. This is fine., Right click on your ""Vignette"" layer and go to Add Layer Mask. In the dialog that pops up, you want ""Initialize Layer Mask to"" set to ""White (full opacity)"". Click ""Add"".
, Use the freeform select tool (press F to bring this up) and draw a selection somewhere around the primary point of interest in your photo. This does not need to be exact (and it might even be better if it is not).
, Use your bucket tool (Shift+B) and click within the selection to fill it (this is assuming, again, that you have your foreground colour set to black). You'll notice that the area within the selection has gone back to normal; this is because black areas on the layer mask (which we are editing) make the layer transparent.
,, Go to Filters -> Blur -> Gaussian Blur. In the dialog that comes up, you want ""Radius"" set to a very large amount; a tenth of the longest edge of the photo is not too much. The larger the radius, the more subtle the effect will be. For our small 683x1024 photo, we used a radius of 159 pixels, which may not have been enough. Hit ""OK"". You'll notice that the sharp edges that used to exist at the borders of your selection have gone.
, Click on your ""Vignette"" layer to select it (if it isn't already selected), and then slide the opacity slider towards the right until the effect is subtle enough. Our example used an opacity of about 50%, but what you use is up to your judgment. Too many photographs using a pseudo-vignette effect overdo it hugely. Don't do this!
, You may also want to save one version of it with the extension "".xcf"", which will allow you to later edit your image in GIMP (while retaining layers, layer masks and so forth), in case you notice a problem.

,,,,, Place it to the desired position.

,


You are done when you have reassembled the original photo, this time assembled by layers holding each one piece.
It may not be visible at this point, but the jigsaw puzzle is almost ready. The rest is only polishing.

,


You can do all this select stuff by an alternate route.

Import the SVG shapes as paths,
Transform the path to selection,
Cut and copy in a new layer.

This tutorial used the select by color way as it is easier for beginners.





,


For a fake 3D look a Bump Map filter will be used.
This canvas has been enlarged (Image - Canvas Size) to have enough space for working.

, It will be used as a mask.


One way to make it white was to check ""Keep Transparency"", paint white with the brush tool and uncheck ""Keep Transparency"" when ready.

, Select a radius value as you like. When done you may make this layer invisible, we don't need to see its content.

, Select from the Bump Map drop-down the corresponding blurred white mask and adjust the Depth value, as it will be the one defining the 3D look.

,


In the end you should have a fake 3D look of the table. To make it more realistic I added a background with a wooden texture (optional).

,


All the following steps are optional use only what you want.

, Use whatever angle you like, our intention is to obtain something looking like a mess. After rotating you can also move the piece a bit.

,


Note: You may consider applying bump map after this step of rotating pieces.

, To make a future step (shuffle) easier, 'two layers have been merged.

",How to Trace an Image Using Inkscape1," Click “File” on the menu bar, and then select “Import.”;
, To open Inkscape’s tracing engine, click “Path” on the menu bar, then select “Trace Bitmap.” , Select “single” if you’d like to create a single path from the image, or “multiple” if you’d prefer many overlapping paths. Choosing single scan options:


Brightness cutoff uses the shade of a pixel to decide whether it should become black or white. The higher the threshold setting, the darker the image will become. Edge detection will create a path based on differences in the brightness of pixels. The threshold settings adjust the darkness of the output. > Again, a higher threshold will produce darker output.

Color quantization produces a path based on differences in color. The “number of colors” setting gives you the opportunity to specify how many colors you’d want in your output were it possible to output in color. An algorithm is then used to turn those theoretical colors black or white.


Choosing multiple scan options:


Brightness steps allows you to specify the total number of scans. Colours uses the number in the “Scans” box to determine how many colors to output.

Grays is like colors, but with shades on the grayscale.
Extra options: The ""Smooth"" option will apply a Gaussian blur before tracing, and “Stack scans” gets rid of holes in path coverage. Check “Remove background” to get rid of background, which usually has the lightest color.


More options:

Suppress speckles will eliminate any spots, dust, distortion, and other unwanted bits. Optimize paths merges Bezier curves.



, If your lines appear too thick or not prominent enough, you likely selected a trace mode that’s better suited for a different type of image. Inkscape recommends running the tracer tool three times in order to determine which of the three options best suits your personal needs. , The bitmap image will be preserved in the SVG file.

Import your image.,
Open the Layers dialog.,

Click “Layer” on the menu bar, then select “Layers.” , Click the “+” button to add a new layer. Type a name for the layer (like “tracing layer”) and switch to “Above current” for the position. Click “Add.” , There are different tools available to suit different needs.


Press the F6 key on your keyboard (or click on the pencil icon on the tool menu) to select the pencil/freehand tool. This tool will allow you to freely draw anywhere on your image. If you’re using a drawing tablet, have a steady hand or not much to trace, this tool may suit your needs.
Press Shift+F6 simultaneously (or click on the pen icon on the tool menu) to open the pen/Bezier tool. This tool allows you to click at the ends of lines you want to trace, which will create small, easy-to-manipulate segments. If you have several lines to trace and/or are using a mouse, this tool will give you the most precise results. Double-click at the end of each line to end the path.

, If you’re using the pen tool, try using shorter lines instead of a single continuous line. This will make your trace easier to edit, as you won’t have to start a long line all over again if you make a tiny mistake at the end.


You can switch between your layers in the layer dialog box. Just double click on the layer name you want to work with and you’ll be switched to that view.
It may help to make your bitmap more (or less) opaque as you draw your paths. With the layer selected in the dialog box, move the slider bar beneath “Opacity” to see which settings works best for you.

, On the tool menu, click the second arrow button from the top (the “edit” arrow) to active edit mode. In this mode, you’ll be able to click and drag nodes for fine-tuning.


If you have too many nodes and it’s taking you forever to move them all where they need to be, you can simplify your nodes. This may change the shape of your line just slightly, but it may not be noticeable. Use Ctrl+L (⌘ Cmd+L on a Mac)to reduce the amount of nodes., To make sure you traced every line you want in your vector image, click on the first layer (the raster image) and reduce the opacity until all that’s visible are the lines you drew. If you find you left out a line, return to the layer tool and increase the opacity so the lines you need to trace are visible.

, In the layer tool, click on the first layer (the layer containing the original artwork) and delete it by clicking the subtraction symbol. To save your trace, click File and then Save As.

To open up the Stroke and Fill dialog box, do CTRL + SHIFT F or Object >> Fill and Stroke...



, If there is a color that you like in your resource/concept layer, click on the eyedropper and then click on the color. Otherwise, choose whatever color suits you.

, You can do this by moving your circle over to the resource images. If you can't see it, change the order of your layers by using the arrows.

, This is done a particular way so that you don't resize the stroke. Make it the exact size that you want it.

, You can have whatever you like. You can leave the color the same as the head if you think you will have some midriff showing on his/hers clothes.

, You want it behind your head, so click on Object >> Lower to Bottom (or End). This will move the torso behind the head.

, Don't worry about being exact at this point. Click on the Bezier curve icon and draw it to an appropriate link.


You might want to zoom in to make it easier.

, If you notice that there is color, you don't want it. Go to the Fill and Stroke dialog box and click the X.

, Do it again for the other side or duplicate it, flip it horizontally and move it to the other side.

, Using the bezier tool, create the legs, get them the way you want and then add the feet.

, Adjust the arms accordingly to whatever you are trying to portray.

, The basic stickman is complete, now you will be adding features. Also, keep in mind, you can edit anything that you want to later on, if necessary.

, You will be creating a hand. Using the bezier tool, add a finger on each side of the arm at the very end making a total of three fingers.

, For a pointing hand, you would want one finger pointing and two curled towards your avatar.

, Pick an image from your concept layer and zoom in closely. Using the circle tool, create a set of eyes about the right size.


Note the different sizes of the ovals. This is one aspect that helps you create expression on your stickman.
You don't want the stroke (from Fill and Stroke) present, so be sure the fill is black, right click on the stroke in the bottom status bar and select 'Remove Stroke'.

, Once you have the eyes the correct size, use the selector tool (the arrow) and select them together. Then CTRL G. This will keep them together.

, If not, ungroup them (CTRL SHIFT G) and level them out. Then regroup them.

, Zoom out a little bit and move the eyes around to compare them to the originals.

, Zoom out so that you can see your avatar and move your grouped eyes onto the avatar.

, Use the bezier tool to create a smile for your avatar.

Start up Inkscape.,
Click on the polygon tool with these settings:


Spokes - 5: Number of points for the star
Spoke Ratio - 0.49: How far the sides cut in towards the center
Rounded - 0.18: This gives the star a more rounded and 'chunky' look, as opposed to a sharp pointed star.,
Click in the center of your work space and drag off to the right.,
Move the eye so that it is beside the other eye at the correct angle.

,
Next, you will set the fill and stroke properties.,
Click on the Fill tab, then on the second icon from the left.,
Click on the circle icon and make an oval.,
Go to the Fill and Stroke dialog box and set the stroke for 1.4 black.,

Be sure you have the star selected and not the pentagon shape. Otherwise, it just won't look right.



, This will give you a right leaning star.

,, Click on Object >> Fill and Stroke. This will bring up the dialog box.

, This will bring up several more tabs. Click on the wheel tab from there. You can choose any color that you like and for the stroke; make it 6 pixels.


If you have a certain color that you would like to use, just insert the hex code into the box below the wheel.

Note that the basic star shape is complete. Now, you will be giving your star some character.



, It will have the same coloring as you had before. That's OK, because you will be changing that.

, You will use a gradient fill for the Fill.






Click on the linear gradient fill (third icon from the left) and then click the 'Edit' button.

Inkscape uses 'stops' to allow you to control the gradient. You can add as many as you like and make a more complicated gradient if wished. This will only require the 2 default stops.




Set stop 1 to RGBA fafafaff and stop 2 to RGBA ddddddff. The two colors are pretty close and it may not look like there is a difference until you are finished.
If the dialog box doesn't come up immediately, double click on the eye (the outer perimeter) until it does.

, You will want to make it appear like your star is looking at an angle. Try about 120 degrees. It is easiest to think of it one of these two ways:


About the angle of 4:30 or so or break up a circle into segments.

360 - Circle
180 - Semi-circle
90 - Quarter circle

120 is halfway between the two





, You will want to have it 'looking up' at the same angle as the gradient.

, Give it an angle with the Selector tool. Click on it again to allow you to rotate it.


If you can't seem to get them both selected together, hold down SHIFT while selecting.

, While both are selected, duplicate the eye (unless you have a pirate star!).

If you see rotational arrows, click in the middle of your raster image again. Click on one of the outward-pointing corner arrows and hold CTRL while moving the mouse diagonally to resize your raster image to the size of the vector image. Holding CTRL maintains the aspect ratio of the selected object.

,, Hold down CTRL while moving the scroll wheel on your mouse, or click on the Zoom tool icon:

, The traced paths should be somewhat similar to the shape, but they don't have to be exact. You will make adjustments later.

, You will see many squares. Those are nodes that define the path. You won't need nearly as many as are there, so it's helpful to eliminate some of them. There are two ways to do this:


Select a section to edit and hit CTRL L to Simplify the path. This is an easy way to eliminate excess nodes. Unless you are doing some really fine work, this method should be sufficient enough for you. You can use the Simplify command multiple times on the same selected nodes.
Select a section to edit. Click on nodes (squares), and delete them by hitting the Delete key after each selection.

, As you can see, this one will need some tightening up. It was created using a trackball, so precision work was difficult.

, In this intentionally messed up image, the node is clearly visible. Moving the square will move its location, and moving the two circular extensions off of it will adjust its Bezier curve segments. You will have to experiment and read the Inkscape manual to get the hang of it.


To get the basic shape of your image, move the nodes (squares) to the correct places before doing further adjustments. You will find yourself adjusting the curves, but moving the nodes first makes it easier.
You can click on a segment connecting two nodes and adjust the line.

, Be aware that you can zoom in too close. Some parts of your image may require you to be very close, but others might need your perspective to be a little further out.

Now we will make the gears ""real"", emulating a metallic surface, like gold (or call it bronze, the process is about the same).,
Define the color.,
Then take one wheel and apply the gradient to it.

,
For a 3D look, add a drop shadow (duplicate, make it black, move a few pixels down and right, move it under the wheel, add a bit of blur and maybe decrease the opacity).,
Add some more gears (all your golden gears).",How to Draw Gears in Inkscape2,";
, Metallic is not a color, it is created by light reflection, so this article will use a multi-stop gradient (a gradient with more than two colors).


For gold it should contain a succession of lighter and darker shades of yellow, maybe also a bit of orange.
For bronze, yellow with a shade of green (copper oxidation is green),
For steel it should contains greys.
The chrome is also greys but more reflective (more contrast, from almost black to almost white), silver is less reflective grey and so on.

,,


The gear does not stay on air, so add a background, and use the same golden gradient (if using this example). For the sake of simplicity, you can use a different one, maybe darker.

,


Note the usefulness of the drop shadow, without it it would be hard to set apart the gear from the background, now they are distinct objects.


"
"
To make the image more vivid, try adding some steel gears.

,
Start this by defining the gradient (multi-stop, greys, with a shade of blue).

,
Apply the gradient to some wheels.,
Put the steel gears in the device (just take care to not couple steel gears with gold gears: steel with steel and gold with gold).,
Place the axles in the center of the gears and we are set.

,
Add some screws holding the device.,
Distribute the screws evenly (or randomly if you feel like it) and it's done!
",How to Draw Gears in Inkscape3,",,


Here is one trick to get some of the wheels richer, not that plain and boring: add a groove - two smaller circles, aligned to the center of the gear, filled with the same grey gradient, the larger in an opposite direction, the smaller in the same direction as the rest of the wheel.

,


Now for some axles: small circles, made from gold, steel, ruby or sapphire. Do not forget the drop shadow and consider a white highlight.

,, They are easy to do: create a steel circle, subtract a rectangle to create the groove, add a darker steel rectangle, the bottom of the groove, rotate the screw to a random angle (we don't want all the screws to have parallel grooves, that would be repeating and boring), fix the gradient and add a drop shadow. Maybe a hole: a larger circle colored with the same gradient as the background but with an opposed orientation. (I increased the zoom level in this step for a clearer illustration)

,"
"
Give the gears an aged look.,
Go back to the black and white drawing.

,
'Set the stroke color and unset the fill color.,
So select the gear (gears if we have more) suffering due to this unwanted overlap and convert the stroke to path.

,
Then go to another gear which covers it, duplicate, select the duplicate and the former stroke and do a difference operation.

,
Repeat with all the gears covering it until we get to something like this.

,
Then convert all the remaining strokes to paths.

,
Now make the drawing look rough.,
Repeat for all your gears.

,
Now define a multi-stop gradient for the paper - light brown/yellow for old paper or dark blues if we want to go with a blueprint (I have not decided yet about the way to go).,
Then add some texture to the paper: draw a random blob with the freehand tool, will it in a color similar with the background (but slightly darker or lighter), unset the stroke, simplify if needed and blur a lot:

,
Add some more until you are happy with the texture.

,
Soften the focus.",How to Draw Gears in Inkscape4," Now is the time to try about the completely different approach, making the gears look like old schematics, old writing on old paper, where we will work on the strokes.

,, This will get you something like this, with overlapping contours, we will have to get rid of.

,,,,, But it has a large number of nodes, it will take quite a while to edit them manually for the desired rough look, so, here is an automatic simplify operation (shown at an increased zoom level).

,,


A multi-stop gradient is needed for ink also (not shown), and it has to have fitting colors but good contrast with the paper (like browns for old paper and light blue for blueprints). Apply the gradients.

,,, Select all the gears, duplicate, make the duplicate darker (black), apply some blur and decrease the opacity:

Download Inkscape here, if you haven't already installed it.,
Open Inkscape.,
Select the polygon tool, which is represented as a polygon and star in the toolbar.,
Click and Drag to create your shape/star.,
Take a look at the toolbar again.,
Start the real mandala.,
Try putting in multiple designs.",How to Make a Mandala in Inkscape," Don't worry, this program is completely safe and does not harm your computer in the least.
, It will most probably be in your operating system's program manager (the Applications folder in Mac OS X, the Start Menu in Windows, or the Applications menu in most Unix desktop environments).

,


The following toolbar will be visible at the top:







, The more you drag your mouse outward, the larger the star will be, and the other way around. Don't take too much time perfecting the size, but make sure it is easy to manipulate.


As you form the desired polygon, two small white squares appear on an inner point and an outer point. This is to make the shape of the star.






Pulling the outer square out will result in a thinner, longer pointed star, while pulling inward will make a smaller, stouter star.
Pulling the inner square out will make the star bigger and wider, possibly turning it into a pentagon. Pushing it in will make the star thinner overall, so be careful when using it.

Decide your final shape. Again, as long as the size is easy to use, go with it; you don't need to be exact.







, See all of the type-in boxes? This will adjust the different qualities of the stars. Explanations of the different things in this:


The two shapes






There is a 5 pointed star, and a pentagon. Simply put, the pentagon is for making a polygon, and the star for, well, a star!







Corners







For Polygon:
This is for the amount of points/corners in the shape. You can make a triangle with 3, square with 4, pentagon with 5, etc...







For Star:
This is the amount of extending points in the star. 3 for three pointed, 4 for 4 pointed, 5 for 5 pointed, etc... Also, there is an unlimited amount of corners you can do, though it starts getting too circular as it increases too much.
Note: There is no 2 because it is impossible to make a plane figure with less than 3 sides.

Spoke Ratio






This basically shows how wide/thin the sides and middle will be. the higher the ratio, the wider the star/polygon will be. It gets thinner as it lowers.






The maximum ratio is 1 ( a star turns into a polygon), and the minimum is .010 (Quite thin)

Rounded






This is used to make rounded segments in the star/polygon (or just rounds the point); the larger number, the larger the shape will be, it also goes into negatives, where it goes the opposite direction. This goes into many various forms and changes as the other parts of the shape change(corner, spoke ratio, etc...). This is the most important component in making a mandala.






Note: The more corners you add to the mandala, the more sophisticated everything will look.

Randomized






This makes the shape asymmetrical. It is not recommended you use this part when making a mandala, as it is important to make it as geometrical as possible. You can save the randomization tool for making abstract art.






Experiment with these! Testing out the buttons may not be a good thing to do in this case of picking between a green and a red button, but it is perfect to do it in this case! Once you get the hang of it, manipulating the shape will be much easier.
Try making a file specifically used for making test designs, that way, you can save much more room, and record data for next time if needed.

, After you are done working out what you want to do, make the real shape. Input the information(or just use the arrows!), and start adding some finishing touches. You can add gradients, blurs, swirls, or anything else you may think of!


The following is an example of what you would be doing. Examine how much the shape can change with such simple actions:


, You can try overlapping two, three, four, or even more designs over one. This can make a really wonderful effect (a burst of colors, really), and make it even more attractive. However, make sure you use the opacity properly, some things need to be more bold than others, so you can make other objects more transparent. To do so, select the object by clicking on it once, then click the black paintbrush at the top withing a box. You will come up with another window. There will be two sliding bars. They are labeled the following:


Blur This makes the selected shape lighter and ""fuzzier."" Make sure you don't overuse it, it will only look like a cloud by then. this feature is highly recommended for making backgrounds and the like.

Opacity This makes the shape more transparent or solid, however, if you make it too transparent, you might be unable to see it.

,



Set the canvas size as you desire, 128x128 is a good size, as this is the usual size for thumbnails.

Import your photo inside the document (drag and drop is just fine) and resize it (with Ctrl pressed to preserve the aspect ratio).

By resizing you will lose a lot of small details, but they won't really be needed.



Zoom in. (Alternatively, we can work with the photo at its default size and resize the vector when ready - do whatever works for you).

,



Use the Calligraphic Tool (Ctrl+F6). Set the width and color as you like. The color red has been chosen to help with the how-to.

Start drawing freely along the shapes on your photo. Do not worry about small details at this time.

Zoom. When you want to capture small details and need accuracy, zoom in.

Make any adjustments you like. Enlarging the eyes, for example, can make the subject look cuter.
Here you don't want to draw the neck, but it partially covers the hair, so we have to improvise.



Continue until you have covered all the necessary shapes.

,




Here comes the most repetitive, laborious and probably boring step: the calligraphic tools generated tons of nodes, so we will delete a lot of them to make the shapes simpler and then adjust the shapes.
You can simplify automatically (Ctrl+L) but sometimes the results aren't satisfactory.


So select nodes, delete them and after that, adjust the shape. Depending on what you want to achieve, make it smooth and constant or very rough and irregular.

When one shape is done, proceed to the next.



Take care of the details, do not leave parallel edges: wrinkles are thin at their ends and thick in the middle, hair the same.

Continue until you have simplified and polished all the shapes. It may be a lot of work, but is not high level.

,


As we are almost ready with the drawing part, move the photo away or even delete it (we may use it in the colorization process, but that is optional).

Select all your shapes and do a Union (Ctrl++). You may want to zoom in and simplify more nodes created after union by imperfect positioning, but is not absolutely necessary.
Now you can select the stroke and make it black, as it should be.

,



Use the Bézier Tool (Shift+F6) and draw over. Try starting with an eyebrow.

Unset the stroke and use a fill color as you like (if you kept the reference photo, you can use the color picker to sample from it).

Move this color shape under the outline (Page Down) and adjust the nodes if needed (at a zoomed-in level).

If you feel the need, temporarily use a very contrasting fill color to clearly see the nodes needing editing.
When an element is ready go to the next.



Continue until all areas are colored.

If you like it enough, you may consider it done and stop here or continue by polishing it more (it is still a bit plain, but for small sizes this may be good).



,



Give your image some depth: highlights, shadow, gradients.

If you want and still have it handy, put the photo back on to of your drawing and using Freehand Lines (F6) - or Béziers - mark the highlighted and shadowed areas and make them white and respectively black. Or don't use the photo, just your imagination or aesthetic sense.



Remove the photo and adjust the transparency and blur for those areas, we don't need strong white or strong black.

Take special care of the eyes, they must have a glowing area, otherwise the subject will not look alive.

Add as many highlights and shadows as you like and maybe change the solid colors with slight gradients.
As this graphic is a hackergotchi, be sure to add the 'obligatory' drop shadow.

, More or less depending on what you like. This will round the corners of your shape.

, Move the nodes further apart in the top left hand corner to create a more rounded corner. Keep in mind that you are creating the dino's nose.

, Click on the gradient icon and take it from right to left. You want the front of the nose to be lighter.

, To do this, you need to create five different size circles. Be sure to hold down the CTRL key while creating the circles. This will make sure they are circles, not ellipses.

,, Here is how it should look (more or less) so far.

, Do this by creating a circle, turning it into a path and distort them to have a dull point. Create a main tooth and then duplicate it. To make it look somewhat realistic, vary the size of the teeth. Make 2 or 3 of them.

, Change the color to the color of your dino, move and rotate it so that it will be a spike at the top of his head. Alternatively, you can create the spike without duplicating the tooth.

, Create another rectangle. This will be the eyebrow. For the Rx and Ry, use 20 instead of 50. Turn it into a path.


Lower the top left corner of the rectangle. Once you have it the shape you want it, duplicate it. (CTRL D)
Reduce the size of the new rectangle (it's a highlight) and select a lighter color for it. Push up on the bottom center of it.

The head is now complete.



, Create a circle. Make sure it is the same color as the primary head color. Have it be about half the size of the head. This is a cartoon, after all.

, Then give your dino's body a teardrop(ish) shape. Once you have the shape you want, duplicate it.

, You might want to stretch it out and move it so that it looks right.

,, Shrink them down a bit and add them to the back of the dinosaur.

, Give it the same gradient that the face has. Convert it to a path and shape it the way you want it.

, Pick a color that you like for them. Make them a similar shape to the legs, and add them.

, The arm is the most complicated part of the whole dinosaur. Basically, you need to create it in segments: Shoulder and upper arm, forearm, hand, fingers, fingernails. You do this by creating the circles, converting to paths, and changing the shapes.

Windows 10: Click the start button, then the magnifying glass icon. Type paint, then select “Paint” when it appears in the search results.
Windows 8: Swipe inward from the right side of the screen and select “Search.” Type paint. When “Paint” appears in the search results, click it.
Windows Vista and 7: Click the Start button, then expand the “All Programs” group. Open the “Accessories” menu and select “Paint.”;
, Paint can open up many different image types, including *.bmp, .gif, .jpg/.jpeg, .tif/.tiff, .ico, and .png. To open a file in Paint, click “File,” then “Open.” Navigate to the folder where your image file is stored and click “Open.”

, When Paint launches, you’ll see a white “canvas” appear on the screen. Imagine this canvas as a piece of paper for you to draw or write on. You can adjust the size of the canvas before you start creating your masterpiece.


Windows 7 and later: On the Home tab, click “Resize.” Select “Pixels” and type the desired size in the “horizontal” and “vertical” boxes. Or, if you’d rather adjust the size by percentage, select “Percentage” and enter the percentage by which you’d like to increase or decrease the current canvas size. For example, if you’d like to make your image 50% of the size it is now, type 50 into each box. To double the current size, type 200 into each box.
Vista: Click “Image” and select “Attributes.” Enter your desired canvas size (in pixels) in the Width and Height boxes.

, Click once at the top left corner of the part of the image you want to preserve, then drag the mouse down toward the right until the dotted box encloses just the part of the image you want. Let go of the mouse button, then click “Crop.”

, Click “Image,” then select “Resize/Skew” (if you’re using Windows 7 or later, just click “Resize” on the toolbar). Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+W to bring up the Resize/Skew dialog. Type a new size (in pixels, or by percent, as you did when creating the canvas) to increase or decrease the image size.

, To flip an image upside down (or some other direction), use the Flip and Rotate tools.


Windows 7 and later: On the toolbar, click “Rotate” and choose a direction in the menu.
Vista: In the “Image” menu, click “Flip/Rotate,” and select a direction to flip or rotate your image.
You can also press Ctrl+R to bring up the Rotate tool on any platform.

, Click the magnifying glass icon to enable the Zoom tool. To zoom in, click anywhere on your image with the left mouse button. To zoom out, click with the right mouse button. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+⇞ PgUp to zoom in, and Ctrl+⇟ PgDn to zoom out.

, If you make a mistake using any of these tools, you can “undo” your action by pressing Ctrl+Z.

, You’ll also see the option to choose a file format. This depends based on what you plan to do with your picture. JPG is a good option for photographs or images with lots of colors. If you only use a few colors and not much detail, GIFs are versatile and have small file sizes. If you’re only planning to use this image in Paint, you can save it as a Bitmap (.bmp), which is the default file type.


You can always convert your images to a different file format later. See How to Convert Pictures to JPEG or Other Picture File Extensions.

, The assortment of colored squares at the top of the screen is the color palette. Clicking a color will select that color as the foreground (main) color for any tool you use in Paint. You can also set a background color for when you start working with shapes.


Windows 7 and later: The foreground is called “Color 1,” the background “Color 2.” To choose a foreground color, click “Color 1” and select any color from the palette. For a background color, click “Color 2” and click any color.
Windows Vista or below: Find the two overlapping colored boxes to the left of the palette. The front box is the foreground color, the back box is the background. Set the background color by right-clicking the color of your choice.

,


To draw a straight line, click the Straight Line tool, then choose a color from the palette. Click anywhere in your canvas. While holding down the mouse button, drag the mouse away from that first click in any direction. Release the button when the line is as long as you want it to be.
For a curved line, click the Curve icon (a squiggly line). Draw a line as you would with the straight line tool. When you lift your finger from the mouse button, click somewhere on the line and drag it in any direction. The straight line you drew will curve in that direction.

, The width of the line can be adjusted by clicking the Size menu and selecting a different line width. To draw, simply press the mouse button as you move the mouse on the canvas.

, The Paintbrush is more versatile than the Pencil, as you can choose different brush “tips” for more unique lines.


In Windows 7 and above, click the down-arrow beneath “Brushes” and choose one of the brush tips. You can adjust the size of each brush tip by clicking the “Size” icon.
In Windows Vista and earlier, click the Paintbrush icon, then choose a brush tip shape from the menu that appears just below the toolbar. Select a color from the palette and drag the mouse to draw a design on the canvas.

, This tool works similarly to the Paintbrush tool, but the look is more in line with that of can of spray paint.


Windows 7 and newer: this tool is located in the “Brushes” menu.
Vista and earlier: Click the icon that looks like a can of spray paint. Draw as you would the pencil or brush tools.

, Like other tools, you can adjust the width of the eraser with the Size menu.


Note that the background color (“Color 2” in Windows 7 and later) will appear wherever you use the eraser tool. If you’re erasing a red line on a white background, for example, make sure the background color is set to white.

, Select any shape from the toolbar to draw that shape. Once you’ve chosen a shape, you’ll notice some options for the shape’s appearance.


In Windows 7 or above, click the “Outline” and “Fill” menus to view your (slightly more varied) options. If you’re using Windows Vista or an earlier version, you’ll see an outline of a shape, an outline of a shape around a filled-in color, and a solid-colored shape.
Select your preferred outline and fill options, then click the canvas where you’d like to place your shape. Hold down the mouse button as you drag the cursor to enlarge the shape. Let go of the mouse button when you reach the desired shape size.
If you chose a shape with an outline, the color of the outline will be the current foreground color. If your shape has a solid filling, the fill color will be the background color.

, Also known as the “Paint Bucket,” the Fill tool will paint an entire defined area with a single color.


Click the icon that looks like a spilling paint bucket, then choose a color from the palette. Now, click the canvas to fill it with the color you selected.
The Fill tool will fill the space between all closed lines. Try creating a square or circle with the shape tool in one color, then use the Fill tool to change the color of just that shape.

, There are two different tools you can use to select parts of your image: Freeform Select (a dotted outline of oval-ish shape) and Rectangular Select (a dotted outline of a rectangle). Freeform allows you to draw your own freehand selection line around an image, while the rectangular selection tool lets you draw a rectangle.


In Windows 7 and later, click the arrow beneath “Select” and choose “Rectangular” or “Freeform.” In Windows Vista and earlier, you’ll see both on your toolbar.
To use either tool, start by clicking at the top left corner of your image, then hold the mouse button as you trace your way around. The rectangular selection will be fairly quick, but you’ll need to be more deliberate to trace manually with the freeform tool. Let go of the mouse button when you’re done selecting.

, Copy the selected area by pressing Ctrl+C. Paste it somewhere else (in Paint or in other compatible programs, like Microsoft Word or Power Point) by clicking a new location and pressing Ctrl+V.


If you don’t want the background color to be a part of your selection:

Windows 7 and later: Check “Transparent Selection” in the Select menu.
Windows Vista or earlier: Find the two icons that feature multicolored shapes with a “selection” rectangle on top. Click to highlight bottom (transparent) of the two icons. To disable this later, click back to the top selection icon.



, Select the Text tool, which is signified by the letter “A,” then double-click somewhere on the canvas to start typing.


A dotted text box with square boxes on each corner will appear. Make sure the text in the text box is exactly the way you want it before switching to another tool (you’ll be unable to edit text after closing the text box.
To increase the text box size (which will give you more room to type), hold the mouse over one of the square corners until the cursor turns to an arrow, then drag the box to a larger size.
Choose a font face and size from the top of the screen and begin typing. To change the color, size or face of the text after you type, highlight the text, then choose the new color, size, etc. When you’re typing, click somewhere outside of the text box to leave the tool.

, You can distort an image with the “skew” feature. Click “Image,” then select “Resize/Skew” (if you’re using Windows 7 or later, just click “Resize” on the toolbar). To stretch/distort the image by degree, type a number (in degrees) in the boxes marked “horizontal” and “vertical.

, The small eyedropper icon represents the Color Picker tool. Click this tool, then click somewhere in your drawing. The area you click will now become the foreground color for your next tool of choice.

, You can edit any of the colors by adjusting their hue, brightness and other options in the Paint color mixer. Click “Edit colors” or “Define custom colors” to enter the color mixer. When you’ve decided on a color you like, click “Add to custom colors.”

, Drawing symmetrically isn’t easy when you’re using a mouse, so you may want to give yourself some guidelines. Click the “View” tab, then put a checkmark next to “Ruler” to see horizontal and vertical rulers around your canvas. Put a check next to “Gridlines” to create a grid on your canvas. You can turn either of these items off at any time by removing these checkmarks.

, Here are some of the more common ones:


Rotate: Ctrl+R

New Canvas: Ctrl+N

Cut: Ctrl+X

Paste: Ctrl+V

Copy: Ctrl+C

Save: Ctrl+S

Delete: Del

Print: Ctrl+P
