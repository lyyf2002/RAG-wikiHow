, Paint is a program that can be used to make original drawings on a blank page or on top of other images.Paint can be used to make a GIF, which is short for Graphic Interchange Format—a small 8 bit (or 256-color) image format which is relatively fast to download on the net.

, The toolbar includes a number of basic and familiar tools, such as erase, magnifier, and pencil. It also has select, free-form select, color pick, and color fill. Free-form select designates irregularly-shaped objects in your picture, and pick color helps you set a foreground or background color based on the color you pick., Paint also includes brushes of various styles, lines of various thickness, a large collection of shapes, background transparency options, and a full color palette. You can customize colors or pick a specific color using the color pick tool.

, Size options can be very helpful. In Paint versions after Windows XP, you can resize images after drawing them. To enlarge and image or to view the screen in more detail, you can also use the magnifier or full-screen viewing option., Microsoft Paint is usually found on your Start menu or in the accessories folder.

, Begin creating the image you’d like to make into a GIF, or use the tools to manipulate an image you’re using as the base for your design. Remember the shapes, colors, brushes, lines, and resizing options at your disposal in the toolbar.

, Unlike JPGs, GIFs can make flawless copies even at high compression if the image has large areas of uniform color and no more than 256 colors total., Keep your image simple, as GIF only allows a maximum of 256 colors. This is why it’s not great to save photos in GIF format. Since photos often contain more than 256 colors, saving a photo as a GIF might reduce image color quality. Simpler images, however, are excellent candidates for the GIF file format.Text and fonts. Since text and fonts tend to have a limited color palette—even just black and white—they tend to be particularly good in GIF format.
Logos and icons. Like text, logos and icons tend to have dense, uniform, and limited colors. These qualities make logos and icons similarly strong as GIFs.Line drawings and clip art. These have limited color palettes and are relatively easy to create in Paint., One advantage of GIFs is that, unlike JPG files, they support transparent backgrounds. This means that your GIF can blend with background colors, if necessary.The same GIF then could be set against a white background or a black background, for example.PNG files are best for partial transparency images. Though GIFs can support transparent backgrounds, they cannot themselves be partially transparent.

, Choose“Save As,” and locate the directory where you want to save the image. Type in a file name that you will remember, and save it to a folder that’s relevant to your project.

, Be sure to click on the “GIF” option under the “Save As Type” menu. This will give your filename a .gif extension that designates it as a GIF file.


If you’re not sure whether or not an image is a GIF, you can check. Just right click the image and select properties. The type of file should be the first item listed.

, Remember when you read that GIF images are limited to 256 colors? That’s why you might receive this dialogue box. Choose “Yes” to save if a box appears asking you about the color quality being reduced if you save the picture in this format.

, Ideally, you’d create an immediate backup, either on an external hard drive or through a cloud service. This is good policy in general, but particularly good for important files or files that you’ve spent a lot of time designing.

Try to find at least five pictures that have to do with your topic. Make sure all the pictures really circulate around your point. You don’t want all sparkly, colorful pictures, or all soothing, quiet pictures. You must have an equal variety in order to have a nice balance. Think about what kind of a mood you want to set with this graphic.


If you find one you like, right click on it and press ‘Save as’. If that doesn't work you can take a screenshot of the picture. That will save it onto your computer, and make it available to you in further stages.





;
,

Open up Microsoft Word on your computer and open a fresh document. Click “Insert” at the top and open the “Picture” submenu. Then click on “From File”.






Chose the pictures you want to use from your images, and then, without any resizing, put all of the pictures in rows. See how they can relate to each other in a graphic. Which pictures would look good together? How can you make any pictures stand out? Is there any image you want to trash? Think it over. This is all about observation. On the next page of your document, take some notes on what you want to express in the graphic. Organize your thoughts.







, Save what you wrote on Microsoft Word and keep it open.

, This is where you start building a skeleton of your finished product. Considering and observing your previous notes and the layout of your images, open up all the ones you decided you wanted. This is the point where you decide the size and placement of the graphic. This is the bare bones of your graphic. Do not add any paint or text onto the graphic yet, just organize your pictures.

, Create an account on Lunapic. This is an easy program that doesn’t need special downloading or knowledge to work. Simply sign up, then go to the homepage of the website and upload your recent skeleton. The screen will take you to the editing center, where you can customize and pretty much create your graphic. Look on your sidebar (the little strip with all your tasks on it), and press the picture of the cursive T. Now here are some things to consider for text:


Make sure your text fits your specific theme. For example, if your graphic reads “Save the Earth”, you might want to use a green font. If it says, “Fashion”, you might want to use a sparkly pink font. The website gives many different shapes, colors, and styles that can help portray your message even further. But it’s up to you to pick and chose.






The placing of your text should not be random. The words need to be readable! Try to put them in a blank space, where no colored pictures can get in the way. It’s discouraging for viewers to have to squint to see text.






Size matters as well. Words that are too small make bad impressions- who wants to read with a magnifying glass? In addition, large text can also be distracting and too bold. You need something medium sized (depending on the graphic, somewhere between 30-47 usually works well, but pick and chose yourself).

, This is the time where you jazz up your collection of pictures and text, to a graphic. Using the paint tools on the sidebar are fine for constructing, but you need to be smart about it. The “Paint” and “Pencil” tools tend to look unprofessional, but if you’re going for a more graffiti, carefree style then they are the way to go. Don’t want that? Try creating your own small decorations using the provided basic shapes such as circles, squares, lines, etc. See if you can make a pretty flower border, or maybe a bolt of lighting just using those specific shapes. You have to practice this type of stuff to make your graphic look nice.

, This actually isn’t necessary, but if you feel your graphic needs a little something more- then this is the way to go. To add effects, simply go to the animation menu at the top, and take your pick. Remember: the effect should match your theme, and even up with the pictures. Balance is essential for a great graphic. Test out all effects to make sure that the effect is eye popping enough to be noticed, but not so wild that it draws attention away from the point.

, See if the graphic is really what you wanted it to be. Since this is a Normal Text Graphic, you're not going to have to go through any extra steps. Review it and make sure it’s the correct size and quality.

, Go to the bottom of your screen and press “save”. Then get the code for the graphic and use it! It’s that easy.

Save your color.",How to Make a Blend in Microsoft Paint1," Microsoft Paint comes standard with any edition of Microsoft Windows, but depending on your settings and operating system, it can be located in a variety of different places. The quickest way to open Microsoft Paint is by opening your Start menu, finding the ""search"" function, and typing ""Paint"" into the search bar; this should locate Microsoft Paint for you, allowing you to click on the relevant icon., If you have a post-Windows Vista rendition of Microsoft Paint, your interface will look drastically different than on Vista, XP, or previous versions. Take a minute to browse through the various tabs of your interface with the ""edit colors"" function in mind. If you have Windows 7 or later, this option will be an icon next to your color palette.For example, Windows XP has a row of six tabs in the upper left-hand corner: File, Edit, View, Image, Colors, and Help. The option to ""Edit colors"" should be under the Colors tab; you can also access the ""Edit colors"" menu by double-clicking any color in your default color palette.

, Once you've located the ""Edit colors"" option, access it by either clicking on the pertinent tab or, on earlier operating systems especially, simply double-clicking a color in your palette. This will bring up a color gradient with every feasible color


For example, if you want to create a blend of green and blue, you can position your cursor in between the green section of the gradient and the blue one, then click to anchor your selector. If you decide you want more blue than green or vice versa, you can move the selector in the direction of that color.

, There should be a vertical slider next to your color gradient; this slider will have pure white at the top and pure black at the bottom, with a gradient of your color running the length of the slider. Once you've settled on an approximate color, you can change the light and dark settings thereof by moving the slider's arrow up or down by clicking and dragging your mouse.

, Once you're satisfied with your blend, you can add it to your ""custom colors"" bar by clicking the ""add to custom colors"" button. You can then close out of the gradient window, and your color will be waiting for you in your palette.


Note that, while your custom color will be saved for the duration of your Paint session, you will have to reestablish your custom palette after you close out of Paint.
If you wish to replicate a color at a later date, make note of the numerical values underneath the gradient; if you type these in exactly as they appear during a different session, you'll get the same custom color.

Save your work.",How to Make a Blend in Microsoft Paint2," Microsoft Paint comes standard with any edition of Microsoft Windows, but depending on your settings and operating system, it can be located in a variety of different places. The quickest way to open Microsoft Paint is by opening your Start menu, finding the ""search"" function, and typing ""Paint"" into the search bar; this should locate Microsoft Paint for you, allowing you to click on the relevant icon.

, For your gradient, you'll be blending two colors together, so pick two relatively well-paired colors, like green and blue.

, Under the ""File"" tab, find Properties and click on it. This should bring up the image properties window. From here, you'll be able to resize your canvas.


You can also press Ctrl+E to bring up the image properties menu.

, On the image properties menu, change your canvas' width to 100 and your height to 500. Make sure you have ""Pixels"" checked under the ""Units"" portion, and select ""Color"" under the ""Colors"" portion--otherwise you'll have a black-and-white gradient with skewed proportions!

, Using the straight line tool from the tool bar, draw a line from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, making sure you don't leave any gaps. You'll want to draw using one of the two colors you chose earlier.


Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to zoom out before connecting the corners. The zoom function is in the lower right-hand corner of the screen.
You should use the thinnest line possible from the drop-down menu in the tool bar, since this will allow for the most accurate gradient.

, Select the bucket tool, then your first color. Click on the top slice of the canvas to fill it; for example, if your first color is blue, the upper right-hand corner half of your canvas should now be blue. Repeat this process with your second color and the other section of your canvas., Press Ctrl+W to bring up the ""Resize and Skew"" menu; this menu will allow you to stretch and pull your creation. Go to the resize section, make sure you uncheck ""Maintain aspect ratio"" and change the units from ""Pixels"" to ""Percentage"", and then change the horizontal value to ""1"".


On older operating systems, this menu is called the ""Stretch and Skew"" menu; it can be found under the ""Image"" tab in addition to the same keyboard shortcut.
If you don't uncheck ""Maintain aspect ratio"", both your horizontal and your vertical values will change when you input a number into one of their respective fields.

, Your canvas' vertical value should have remained consistent, while your horizontal value should have shrunk considerably. Re-open the ""Resize and Skew"" menu, uncheck ""Maintain aspect ratio"" again, and change the horizontal value in the ""Resize"" section to 500. Your canvas should expand horizontally, and your gradient should now be visible.


You'll want to repeat this process three times or more, depending on how wide you need your gradient to be.

, Once your gradient is the size you want it to be, save your work under ""File"". Gradients make great backgrounds for Powerpoints, desktops, and website pages, so don't be afraid to create more!

Be aware that the Invert Colors tool has changed.,
Select the image.,
Invert the image.",How to Invert Colours in MS Paint1," Don’t look for the Invert Colors tool on the top toolbar, as you might have in Windows Vista or earlier. Beginning with MS Paint 6.1, you can only invert colors by selecting and right-clicking the image. This means that if you are running Windows 7, 8, or 10, then this new iteration of Paint will be pre-installed.This might be confusing if you've spent years using the top toolbar to tweak your colors – but never fear! The new process is different, but it is still very simple.


The Invert Colors tool is useful if you want to simply swap around the existing colors on a logo or image, rather than replace the entire color.;
, If you want to invert the colors in the entire image, you'll need to select the image as a whole. You can corral the image with the Select tool, or you can choose ""Select all"" from the Select Options.If you only want to invert the colors in part of the image: simply select the piece of the image that you’d like to invert.

, First, right-click on the image with your mouse. Then, scroll down to the “Invert color” option at the bottom of the drop-down menu. Click ""Invert color."" The section of the image you selected should immediately invert.For a quick color inversion, press the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+I.

Look at your uncoloured Pokeball.,
You can start colouring your Pokeball, now!",How to Draw a Pokeball in Microsoft Paint," Windows computers already have them, so you can just go to Start > All Programs > Accessories > Paint, if you own a Windows computer.



 ;
, Some people may personally prefer to make their own grids, but you can paste one from the Internet if you want. To make a grid, draw a horizontal line in grey/dark-grey, and keep drawing them, making sure the space between the lines are exactly the same, to the top of the document. Then do the same vertically.





,, Change the circle-brush to the largest square there is.





, If the squares you drew on the grid were small, one pixel should be a 2x2 square on the grid. If the grid squares are huge, one pixel can just be one square on the grid.





,,, Now click on ""Attributes"" and select ""Black and White"" on the ""Colours"" section. Now invert the colours again. Then change the colours to ""Colors"".





, The squares on the grid look a bit spaced out, don't they? You can join them together to make a complete one or so pixels by selecting the Brush tool and filling in the spaces between the squares.





, Decorate it however you like!

Sketch with the pencil tool.,
Create your main lines.,
Fill in your base colors.,
Make your fill shading lines.,
Add shadows.,
Add highlights.,
Done!",How to Draw and Color with Microsoft Paint1," Using the pencil tool, sketch your drawing. This works best if you use a color other than black.;
, Using the pencil tool, draw in the main lines of your drawing. These can be sketchy or you can work extra hard to get them clean-looking.

, Use the fill tool to fill in your base colors into your entire drawing. You'll want to zoom in in order to catch all of the little gaps that can be created.


The fill tool looks like a paint bucket being poured out.

, Use the pencil tool to draw a line that makes up the edge of your shading area. It's okay if it overlaps your black edges a little bit. This is easy to go over and fix later. The color that you use to draw your line should be the same color that you will use to create the shadows and highlights.

, Use the fill tool to fill in your shading areas, using a deep value color than your base tone.

, Use the fill tool to fill in your highlighted areas, using a lighter value color than your base tone.

, You can create more details and textures by hand but this is the majority of the process. Keep practicing!

Inside Paint: Open MS Paint by clicking the Desktop icon or locating it in Programs. Once Paint is open, click ""File"" and then ""Open."" Find and select the image that you want to invert. Then, press ↵ Enter or click ""Open.""Outside Paint: Find the file that you want to invert. Right-click on the file, and select ""Open with"" MS Paint. The file should open in MS Paint.

, This will immediately invert the colors. The colors in the inverted image are the scientific complements of the colors in the original. A yellow ball will appear blue (not purple, the traditional complement) in the inverted version.For a quick invert, simply press Ctrl+I. Remember: this only applies to Windows Vista and earlier!

Work in a good file size.,
Sketch your picture and upload it to your computer.,
Create your main lines.,
Clean up your line work.,
Fill in your base colors.,
Add highlights, shadows, and midtones.,
Create ""layers"".,
Continue until done.",How to Draw and Color with Microsoft Paint2," Since MS Paint works with very basic pixels, if you want to make your drawing really nice you'll need to increase the canvas size. Do this by clicking the resize button and set the dimensions somewhere above 2000 pixels.

, This process will be much faster if you do a real-life sketch and scan it or photograph it in order to get it on your computer. You can also sketch the picture in MS Paint, but you will need to sketch it in very light gray.


If you do scan your drawing, just open the file in MS Paint in order to start turning it into a beautiful drawing, but be sure you have the original sketch saved separately somewhere else too (in case you make mistakes and need to start over).

, Using the curve tool, create the main lines of your drawing in black. Find a single continuous line (like the upper arch of the eye) and click on the beginning and then then end of the line. Then, use your mouse to grab the straight line that was created and pull it into the curve to match your sketch. Do this until all your drawing is recreated in black.


The black is important. You can always change the color of these outline lines later, but for now do them in black.

, Now it's time to get rid of that sketch! Click select, right-click on the picture, and then invert the colors. Then switch the color to strict black and white by clicking File → Properties. Click OK, let it make the switch, and then switch it back into color the same way. Invert the picture again and you'll have clean art.


Saving a copy of just your plain black lines can be really helpful, especially if you make a mistake and need to restore them.

, Use the fill tool to fill in all of your base colors. Make sure that you get all of the little extra pixels that can get caught between lines that are close together or angles.

, Now for the fun part. Select all and copy your drawing as it is now. Then, choose an area that you want to shade (say, the hair). Select that base color and set it to color 2. Then, make color 1 your shading color. Use any of the tools to do the shading however you like. Don't worry about going over your black lines! Just do one area (with the same base color) at a time.

, Now to get rid of the colors that got outside of your lines! Zoom out so that you can see your whole drawing, click select, right click the picture, and paste in the base you copied earlier. Now for the magic. Go over and click the down arrow under select. Then click transparent selection. Ta-da!

, Keep doing this same process for each area and each shade until you are happy with your drawing!

Work with the limitations of the program.,
Make the changes that you can.,
Experiment with other programs.",How to Draw and Color with Microsoft Paint3," What you have to keep in mind is that MS Paint is not Photoshop. Don't expect to be able to get a Photoshop look with your drawings. You can make nice pictures but they have a very particular look to them. Embrace it. You should also keep in mind that the files save with poorer quality than programs like Photoshop, so don't expect them to print well at high resolutions.

, Know what sort of changes you can make to existing images, like photographs. MS Paint isn't Photoshop, but some basic tweaks can be achieved using the program. You can do things like:


Crop images. Cropping in MS paint can actually be easier than in some other programs, since all you have to do is drag around the corners of the image.
Cover small problems. Copying and pasting small selections that can band-aid small problems with an image is pretty easy with MS Paint, as long as you're patient.
Correct red eye. If you have some dark pixels you can copy and paste or if you feel like you can use the freehand tools, then fixing red eye is very doable in a program like MS Paint.

, If you're using MS Paint because you think you can't get a better program, don't worry. There are other options out there. Be sure to check out these alternatives to help you on your road to digital art mastery:


One program that you might find useful is a free program called Oekaki. This is similar in look to MS Paint but has many more features. You don't even have to download anything. Many websites have Oekaki as an app within a web browser. This program allows some actual layers, much like Photoshop, which means you can make much nicer pictures.
If you want to use a program that is more powerful but you don't want to spend the money on Photoshop, know that there are alternatives. Paint Tool Sai, Manga Studio, and many other programs which are similar to Photoshop can be purchased for $20-50.

Open your paint program.,
Create a new canvas.,
Draw a rough sketch.,
Define the outlines.,
Add more details and color.,
Add shading.,
Save your sprite.,
Look over your finished sprite.",How to Create a Base Sprite," The program can be as simple as Microsoft Paint or a more in-depth program such as Photoshop.



 ;
, There is no size requirement, though the canvas should be large enough to house the sprite you plan on creating. Most paint programs will allow you to change the size of the canvas at any time. While not required, it is recommended to change the background of the canvas to a non-white color that won’t share any colors of your sprite.





, Choose the pencil tool and begin to place pixels - any color should work, though a brighter color is preferred. This does not need to be anything defined - just a rough image of what you want the final product to be. This allows you to get the size of the sprite down, in addition to deciding on a basic pose for your base. It is recommended to choose a more natural or laid back pose as opposed to a more action-oriented one.

, Choose a different color than the one you used for the previous step. Begin to draw over your sketch with more defined details, using the sketch from the previous step as a guide. This can include arms, legs, clothing, and other various points of interest. Continue until you feel you’ve included everything.


If your paint program has the option for multiple layers, it is recommended to do this step on a new layer above the the sketch’s layer.

, Erase the sketch and/or the layer where it resided. Add details to the outline, including color. You can either get colors off of your reference picture, or select your own.

, Shading helps give your sprite depth and allows it to stand out in a 2D space. First, determine where your “light source” is coming from. This will give you an idea of where your darker colors will go to illustrate shading.


Using the colors selected in the previous step, select darker tones of the colors using your paint program’s color selector. Place them based on where your light source is facing; if it is directly in front of the sprite, for example, place them towards the backside of the sprite. Take note of any parts of the sprite that might cast shadow on other parts: these include limbs, branches, and articles of clothing.

, Once you feel you've hit a good point with the sprite, save it. Go to File, and click Save. Save the image where you can access the sprite again. Make sure to save the file as .PNG; anything else can either ruin the image quality or alter the sprite’s colors.

, Make sure everything looks the way you want it to. If you are satisfied with the end result, you have successfully created a base sprite. If you are not satisfied, do not be discouraged. If you continue to practice and improve, your sprite work will improve.

Your cursor should look like the bucket fill symbol once it's selected, move it to anywhere over your white background layer and click your left mouse button.,
Let's name this layer.

,
Expand the layer manager and click in the box beside 'Name' where it says, ""New Layer"", backspace and then type in 'scrapbook' (or what ever you like) and press 'enter' on your keyboard.,
This is a point where your creative mind should take over, you can add whatever you like to make your page look cool.,
Let's go ahead and cut out the areas where you will have your template layers.,
Click on the 'circle selection tool' and with your left mouse button held drag out a good sized circle on your scrapbook layer.,
Be sure to have it where you want it and then on the layer manager click on the 'cut layer's selected region' button.,
Let's do the same but with a square.

,
Click on the 'square selection tool', you will see the circle selection pop up on your scrapbook layer but you can either ignore it and drag out the square shape or go to the top and click 'clear' to get rid of the circle selection and then drag out your square.

,
Again position it to where you want it to be and then click the 'cut layer's selected region' button.,
For these we'll just use the 'fill shape tool' and drag them out with our mouse.

,
Let's change the primary color first to red.,
For the circle first, click on the small arrow beside the 'fill shape tool' and choose the 'circle' option.

,
Now with your mouse, drag out another circle on top of the hole you cut out.,
Click the arrow on the layer manager to, 'move current layer up to back', this will set the new circle you drew in behind your scrapbook layer.

,
Click the Hand 'move resize tool' and move/resize your circle if you have to until it is slightly larger and in the middle of your cut out area.

,
Let's rename this one 'photo1', the same way you did above.

,
Let's go ahead and make this a template layer now.

,
A little farther down in the expanded part of the layer manager you will see 'template layer' and beside it 'False'.,
We do the same now with the square cut out space.,
Now you are all set to add what ever you like to to make your scrapbook page look great.

",How to Create a Template for Photobie Design Studio,";
,


It's these template layers, added later, that you or others will be able to replace easily with images you or they choose.
In this style the images will be set to occupy only one 'cut out' space, so you won't be able to move them. A little planning is advised before you start one of your own one.
Usually if you are going to print your scrapbook page you will want to create it in a large size but for this one we'll just make it a bit small to get the idea of how it works.

,


The 'New Photo Panel' will appear.

,


The default color is set to white and the default 'type' is set to .pob for the Photobie .pob file format.
The resolution of 96 is fine for now too.

,


For the tutorial, we'll just be using a 600x600 white background to start with.
Also, you can lower the thumbnail panel if you wish to view a bit more of your work space.

, This is the layer that will have all your text, embellishments, ...etc...


You have a choice now for this layer, whether you want it to just be another color, a texture or even an image.

,


For this one we'll add just a color for the 'scrapbook' layer.
You could try many things even fill in a gradient for this layer if you choose...it's up to you.
There are two ways to do this color fill, either with the 'bucket fill' tool or you can use 'region' in the top menu and 'select whole image region' to have the whole background area to be filled using one of the fill commands.

,,, You should now have your second 'scrapbook' layer on top of the background one.

,, You will see the name change in the top part of the layer manager where the layers are displayed.

,


You can add bushes, shapes, text, images.........whatever you like.

, This project will have one square and one circle area to have for the pictures. Sometimes it's best to start with these first, then you can build your scrapbook page around them.

,


You will see the selection outline on your scrapbook layer and you will be able to move and resize it with your mouse to the place where you want. Choose an area towards the top left of the scrapbook layer.

,


You should now be able to see through to your white background layer.
( I moved the selection in the screen shot off to the side so you can see both the selection and the cut.)

,,,


You'll now have two areas where we will be able to add photos to.
Now it's time for the template layers where you will be able to add or actually swap out your different photos.

,, This can be any color you wish just to see what you are doing better, you won't see the color at all once you replace it with a photo.

,, Try to make it slightly larger than the circular hole you cut, this just makes things easier when you add your photo.

,,,,,




Click on that area and you will see a small triangle appear,
Click the triangle and choose 'True'.

This layer is now a template layer and you will see the name you gave, 'photo1' change to '@1:photo1'.
You will also notice that there is a new button showing in the layer manager, 'click to replace'.
This is the button you will use to add your photo, replacing the template layer.





,



Click the small triangle beside the 'fill shape tool' and choose 'square.

With your mouse, drag out a square shape over the cut out area.
Use the arrow on the layer manager to move this new square shape behind your 'scrapbook' layer.
Also, use the Hand 'move resize tool' to size and place the new square layer so that it is just larger than your cut out space and roughly centered around it.
Now rename this new square layer, ""photo2"", and press enter.

Do the same as above and change this square into a template layer - Layer manager - Template layer - True.

Start recording.",How to Use Fraps to Take a Screen Capture1," FRAPS only works with games that use DirectX or OpenGL. Because of this, you cannot capture footage of Flash games or games that run with other rendering technologies. This applies to both older and newer games. Most PC games should work with FRAPS.


The free version limits you to 30 seconds of footage at a time, and there will be a FRAPS watermark over the footage.;
, You can download it from fraps.com.

, A small window will appear which will stay on top of any open windows. This window allows you to adjust the FRAPS settings.


Note: FRAPS requires administrator access to run.

, This will allow you to adjust your recording settings.

, By default, the movies will be saved to the same folder that you installed FRAPS in. This generally isn't the easiest folder to get to when you want to view or work with the files. Click the ""Change"" button and set a new folder, such as a ""Games"" folder in your Videos folder.

, By default, F9 is the recording hotkey. You can click the field and press your new key or combination of keys. Just make sure it isn't a key that you use in the game you're recording.

, You can only record as many FPS as your game performs at. The overlay that is enabled by default will help you determine what speed your game runs at. Your FPS is heavily determined by your hardware and graphics settings.


60 FPS will result in the smoothest video, but will also be the largest. YouTube now allows you to upload 60 FPS footage. Recording at 60 FPS will put a big strain on your system.

, You can choose between ""Full-size"" and ""Half-size"". Full-size will record at the game's original resolution, while half-size will record at half the resolution.

, You can enable your microphone so that you can record your voice while playing. You'll be able to set a key so that the microphone only records when you hold it.

, Once you've configured FRAPS, you can start playing the game that you want to record. You can record most games, but if the FPS overlay doesn't appear, then the game may not support FRAPS.

, Press your recording hotkey (F9 by default) to begin recording. The FPS counter in the corner will turn red when FRAPS is recording. You may notice a decrease in performance when you are recording. Press F9 again to end the recording.


FRAPS video files are quite large, and you may fill up your hard drive before you realize it.

Take a screenshot.",How to Use Fraps to Take a Screen Capture3," FRAPS and newer versions of Windows do not get along well. FRAPS technically does not support Windows 8 or newer, and has a few problems with it. The biggest issue is that FRAPS cannot take screenshots of the desktop or desktop programs in Windows 8 or 10. It can only take screenshots of games. If you are running Windows 7 or Vista and are using the Aero theme, you can take screenshots of your desktop with FRAPS.The free version allows you to take screenshots in BMP format, but you can convert them later.

, You can have FRAPS automatically take screenshots after a set interval of time, and continue to do so until you hit the hotkey again. You can set the interval if you decide to enable this feature.

, By default, FRAPS will display the current FPS (frames per second) for the game you are playing in the upper-left corner of the screen. This won't appear in your screenshots, but it can be distracting while you're playing. If you don't care about the FPS counter or don't need it, open the ""FPS"" tab in FRAPS and select ""Hide overlay"".

, Once you've adjusted your FRAPS settings, you can start up your game. The FRAPS window will not appear over your game, unless you are playing the game in Windowed mode.

Enjoy your new no contract, pay-as-you-go phone experience!",How to Eliminate Cell Phone Monthly Charges Even With a Data Plan," Look at your current phone bill and to see how you're using your phone. How many minutes do you use a month? Are you a big texter? Do you need a larger data plan or would you be fine with a smaller plan or even no plan at all.;
, Once you know your usage needs, you're ready to find a plan. There are many different carriers but the key is to find the one with the plan that meets your needs. Popular prepaid service providers include Straight Talk, Cricket Wireless, Tracfone Wireless, and Simple Mobile. Some traditionally with-contract service providers such as AT&T and T-Mobile also have prepaid options.

, Some things to keep in mind when weighing your options:


Does this plan meet my needs, and if so, is it cost effective? You might save more in the long run going with an unlimited prepaid plan. Or if you're a light user, find a plan without bells and whistles so you can stop paying for the features you don't use.
Can you keep your phone? For example, Straight Talk has a ""Bring Your Own Phone"" plan where you can keep your phone (and number). Buying a new phone can be costly. If you're happy with your phone (and it's GSM or otherwise compatible), try to find a plan where you can keep it.
Is there coverage in your area? Do they have voice and data roaming, and if so, what are the associated costs? For example, if you're a big data user it might make a difference for you that T-Mobile does not allow data roaming for pay-as-you-go plans.

, If you were able to find a plan like Straight Talk's ""Bring Your Own Phone"" you can skip this step. Otherwise, you have a number of options but keep in mind that the costs of buying a new, unlocked and out-of contract phone can be high, particularly for smartphones.


Get a phone directly from the carrier. This is probably the easiest and surest way to get a phone because you know the phone will work and be covered with your chosen contract.
Find a phone that is out-of-contract from a friend. When people upgrade their phone, the old one usually becomes an orphan.
Browse eBay. Search for 'cell phones, no or unknown contract' to limit responses to phones that are suitable.
Check out Craig's List. As always, be cautious when making a purchase from an unknown seller.

, If you didn't get your new phone from the carrier or you're bringing your current phone from another plan, you're going to need a SIM card. A phone that is out-of-contract will probably still be locked to a particular carrier. In order to get your phone to work on your new carrier, you must purchase a SIM card specific to that carrier. If the phone is unlocked, then a SIM card for you chosen carrier will work regardless of the ""branding"" may be on the phone. Similar to the purchase of your phone, you can get the SIM card directly from your chosen carrier or from non-brand retailer.

, To activate your SIM card and phone, insert the SIM card into your phone. This is usually done by removing the battery to expose the SIM card slot. The SIM card will only go into the slot in one way -- there is usually a picture of the card being inserted to show which side goes ""up"" and what the orientation is. If you have problems, you can usually find a manual on-line if one did not come with the phone. Another option is to go to a local Radio Shack, AT&T, Walmart or T-Mobile store and ask for help.

, Once the SIM card is in the phone (and it is charged), you can activate the phone online or by calling your carrier. If you want to keep your existing phone number, the process is a bit complicated. Check with you carrier about the specifics but generally it will be as follows:


You first activate your ""new"" phone with the carrier-supplied number.
Then the old number is assigned to your ""new"" phone. (This may require having a PIN number for your old carrier.)

, Congratulate yourself on having saved money with the phone and plan that's right for you.

""Remote Lock"" or ""Lost Mode"" will set a new 4-digit PIN required to access your phone. Remember this PIN so you can access your phone if it is retrieved.
""Send Message"" will display a message on the screen. Typically, this is used as a warning that the phone's location is known, and/or a promise of a reward if the phone is returned anonymously. (You can also ""Play Sound"" to alert the thief that there is a message.)
""Remote Wipe"" is a last resort option that will remove all data from your phone, returning it to default settings and deleting all non-default apps. This should still allow you to track the phone if it is in ""Lost Mode,"" but some users report issues."

Locate the 15-16 digit IMEI number.,
Type the IMEI at http://www.imei.info.,
Click the “Check” button.",How to Tell if a Sony Phone Is Original1," One of the fastest and most reliable ways to find out if your phone is original is to run its IMEI number through an IMEI checker.

On some Sony phones, you can remove the cover from the SIM card slot and then pull the tray outward to see the IMEI. On others, remove the back cover and battery to find the IMEI.
If you haven’t yet purchased the phone, ask the seller to provide the IMEI.;
, Sony customers and support agents who share information on the Sony Mobile forums recommend using this tool to verify the authenticity of Sony phones., Now you’ll see the manufacturer and model of the device. If it doesn’t say “Sony” and the correct model, your phone is not original.

If your phone is navy blue, for example, and Sony didn’t make that model in navy blue, the phone isn’t original., A real Sony phone will say “Sony” on the back. Run your finger across the logo to make sure it feels smooth. The logo shouldn’t be a sticker, and should not flake off.

, While counterfeit phone makers usually do a good job of imitating the original product, you might notice inconsistencies. Find a friend with the same phone or visit a store that carries this model to check your phone against theirs. Here are a few things to check:Are the buttons are in the right place? Do they feel the same on both phones?
Are the phones the same weight?
Does your phone’s screen seem dull compared to the other phone? Colors not as vibrant?
Are the Sony logos exactly the same?

, Most counterfeit phones are made with cheaper parts. If you bought an Xperia for its speed, screen, or camera quality, you’ll notice when those things don’t live up to your expectations.Take multiple photos and check their quality against what you find in online reviews.
Open multiple apps at the same time and see if the phone can perform.

Just click the magnifying glass at the top of the page to launch the search box.


If you’ve found a model that exists but that Sony has not yet released, it’s a fake.

, If the phone you want to buy goes for $799 and you’ve found it for $400, chances are it’s not legitimate. You won’t see drastically different pricing on the same phone model unless one is used, defective, or fake., Buy your Sony phone from Sony, your network provider, or a retailer you trust. If you’re buying a used phone from an individual online, verifying their identity can be tricky. The seller should have many positive reviews, and will be willing to give you the IMEI number for verification.See Sony’s list of authorized dealers at http://www.sony.com/retailers.

Unless you are trained and skilled to do so, never take a phone apart.",How to Save a Wet Cell Phone," Ports for hands free kit, tiny hole for microphone, charging, usb cable connectivity and the plastic covers on cell phones even though tight can freely allow water to enter the phone in a just a few seconds of time. Grab your phone quickly, and turn it off immediately, as leaving it on can cause it to short circuit – if it has been in water, assume it is waterlogged whether it is still working or not.;
, A longer period of immersion, such as being in the washing machine cycle, is more cause for alarm. It is still worth trying the following steps to attempt saving the phone, before giving up.


If the phone is connected to a wall charger and is also submerged in water, do not attempt to remove it from the water. Seek a professional immediately to ask the proper steps to do this safely (as in turning off a main power switch, or similar action). Electricity and water do not mix and can result in electrical shock. However, if your phone was NOT connected to a wall charger but fell into water, remove the phone from the water as quickly as possible, and proceed with the next few steps.
Acting quickly can make all the difference in being able to save your phone from water damage, however don't panic. Maintaining a level head is key to working more efficiently under pressure.

, This is one of the most important steps to saving it. Many circuits inside the phone will survive immersion in water provided they are not attached to a power source (battery) when wet.To find out if the phone is truly water damaged, check the corner near where the battery is – there should be a white square or circle, with or without red lines. If this is pink or red, your phone has water damage.
Quickly read the manual to your phone if you're not sure how to remove the battery.

, Some or all of your valuable contacts (along with other data) could be stored on your SIM. For many people, this could be more valuable and worthy of saving than the phone itself.


SIM cards survive water damage well, but getting it out immediately makes good sense. Pat it dry and set it aside to dry out until you reconnect your phone to your cell network again. (If your phone does not have a SIM card, skip this step).

, Remove all plugs that cover the gaps, slots, and crevices in the phone to expose them to air drying.

, If there is even one drop of water left inside, it can ruin your phone by corroding it and making the circuits corrode or short out. Obviously you need to remove as much of the water as quickly as possible, to prevent it from easing its way into the phone:


Gently wipe off as much water as possible without dropping the phone. Avoid shaking or moving the phone excessively, so as to avoid moving water through it.
Wipe down using a towel or paper towel, trying not to clog the paper in the gaps and grooves of the phone. Keep wiping gently to remove as much of the remaining water as possible.
If you pulled the battery out in time, cleaning the inside of your phone with rubbing alcohol will displace the water which alone could remedy the problem.

, If you want to try to suck the liquid out of the inner parts of the phone, try using a vacuum cleaner if there is one available. Remove all residual moisture by drawing it away with a vacuum cleaner held over the affected areas for up to 20 minutes, in each accessible area (take turns with a friend).


This is the fastest method and can completely dry out your phone and get it working in thirty minutes. However, unless the exposure to water was extremely short, it's not recommended to attempt to turn your phone on this soon.
Be careful not to hold the vacuum too close to the phone, as a vacuum can create static electricity, which is even worse for the phone than water.

, Contrary to common advice, it is not recommended that you use a hair dryer (even on the ""cold"" mode). Using a hair dryer may force moisture further inward toward the crevices, reaching the electrical components deep inside the phone. And if the hair dryer air is too warm, it could further damage the device.


If moisture is driven deeper inside, corrosion and oxidation may result when minerals from liquids are deposited on the circuitry which could eventually cause component failure inside the phone.
While avoiding blowing air into the phone, conversely, using a heater, fan or other air-flow device to blow air ACROSS the phone's openings will aid drying. The Bernoulli principle states that as the warm, dry air moves fast over the phone, the decreased air pressure will gently pull or suck moisture out of the phone. The best part of this option is that you can leave a phone in front of a warm, moving air for hours on end without effort.

, An inexpensive option is to place the phone in a bowl or bag of uncooked rice overnight, Rice Krispie cereal, or just cover the phone in paper towels. The rice might absorb some remaining moisture.If available, it is preferable to use a desiccant instead. Desiccants may absorb moisture better than rice.You can also try slipping the cell phone inside a plastic bag that can be sealed or a plastic container (airtight). Add a desiccant packet, such as silica gel — often found with new shoes, purses, noodle packets, etc — in with the cell phone. The downside of this method is the packets packed with shoes has usually already reached its absorption capacity. Desiccants for flower drying can usually be purchased at most craft stores. Leave the phone with the desiccant or rice as long as possible (at least overnight) to absorb the moisture.
Rotate the phone to a different position every hour until you go to sleep. This will allow any water left inside to run down and hopefully find an opening to escape.

,, After removing the phone from the rice or desiccant (or if you were not able to use either method), place the phone flat on an absorbent material. Remember that the goal is to evacuate all of the moisture and humidity from the device.


Check the absorbent material every hour for 4 to 6 hours. If moisture is evident, repeat the vacuuming step and desiccant steps.

, After you have waited at least 24 hours, or longer if needed, check to see that every area of your cell phone is clean and looks dry. Check all the ports, compartments and in between crevices for any moisture or dirt. Wipe away any dust and dirt from the device and covers and insert the battery into the phone. Attempt to power on the device, listening for odd noises and observing to see if the phone appears to function correctly.

, If this works, you will probably need a new battery.

, Sometimes they can fix it. Don't try to hide the fact that it has been wet - there are internal indicators that prove moisture - and the repair people are more likely to be able to help you if you explain exactly what has happened to the phone.

, Leave that to the professionals, since doing so could potentially cause shock or exposure to harmful chemicals or components.


If your phone is powering up but doesn't operate correctly after you've dried it, then it's likely that you've missed some liquid, or that corrosion has already occurred. Remove all the covers, battery, cards and other extraneous attachments again, and rub it gently with a clean dry paintbrush or toothbrush. Look on YouTube for instructions on how to properly go about this process.

",How to Save Money on Mobile Roaming Charges (for UK Only)," When going abroad, you can buy a pay as you go SIM card for the country you are visiting and get your friends, family and colleagues to call your on your new number. Most SIMs don't charge to receive calls and making calls will be much cheaper than using your UK mobile phone. You can also send cheaper text messages. Some UK web sites offer SIMs for sale, but it is usually cheaper to buy them at your destination. The only drawback of this method is that people calling your UK number will just get your voicemail and will have to re-dial your international number which can be expensive. If your calls are important to you, this is a major shortcoming.

, There are a couple out there. Some work by using a foreign SIM card, such as GO-SIM, OneRoam and SIM4Travel, which allows you to receive calls free in up to 60 countries. Great for backpackers and travelers, but don't forget that people will not be able to call your on your regular mobile number and will have to pay quite a lot to call the Liechtenstein mobile number.,,,,"

Gather your tools.,
Turn the phone off and take out any external components.,
Insert an opening tool between the back cover and the case.,
Work your way around the edge of the back cover.,
Work the tool across the top and down the right side.,
Carefully pull the back cover away from the phone.,
Use the spudger to release the red silicone cover.,
Remove the two terminal screws.,
Remove the battery.,
Replace the battery by working in reverse order.",How to Remove the Battery from Droid Razr," Unlike many other cell phones, the Razr's battery can't be removed with your bare hands. You'll need a few specialized tools before you begin. Luckily, these are available for cheap both online and in in many electronic stores. The tools you will need are:



A plastic opening tool. This is a skinny plastic prybar designed for opening cell phones and tablets.

A spudger. Another plastic tool designed for working with delicate electronic components.Other tools can discharge static electricity and cause short circuits.

A T5 Torx screwdriver. A screwdriver designed to turn the ""Torx"" screws used in the phone, which have a head that looks like a six-pointed star.;
, Powering the phone off completely before you start working reduces the risk of electric shock or damage to your phone. Removing external pieces like SIM cards, carrying cases, charging cables, and so on ensures that they will remain safe during the battery removal process.


Note that most Razrs will have at least one SIM card in them by default. Remove any SIM cards from the small door on the lower left side of the phone., Look at your phone from the side. You should see a small crease running along the edge of the phone. Carefully slip your plastic opening tool into this crease at the lower-left edge of the phone. Gently work the tool to open a gap in the crease.

, The Razr's back cover is held in place with a series of small plastic clips. Gently move the plastic opening tool up the left side of the phone, using gradual pressure to release each set of clips.You should just be working along the edge of the phone now. The center of the cover is held in place with adhesive that can cause it to snap if you try to pry the entire cover up at once.

, The top edge of the back cover is especially thin, so be extra-gentle here. Using too much pressure can cause it to snap.When you're done with the top, release the clips on the right side of the phone just like you did with the left.

, Once you've opened the top, left, and right sides of the back cover, grab the cover on either side about halfway down and start to pull it up. Don't grab the thin upper section of the cover. Use slow, gentle, gradual pressure to separate the cover from the battery. Put it somewhere safe once it is removed.


The battery is attached to the cover with a small amount of adhesive in its center. As you pry the cover up, you can use the opening tool or spudger to help detach it from the adhesive.
Be careful not to lift the battery out with the cover here. This will sever the power lead, breaking the phone., Look in the lower-left corner of the exposed battery. You should see a small pill-shaped piece of red plastic covering the metal terminals. Use the spudger (and only the spudger) to lift this up from the bottom.

, The battery is attached to the terminal by two 3.3 mm T5 Torx screws. Use the T5 Torx screwdriver to unscrew and remove each. To be safe, it is wise to press the screwdriver point against a separate piece of metal first to discharge any static electricity.


Keep the screws somewhere safe after you remove them. One idea is to turn the back case upside down and use it as a ""dish"" for the screws.

, With one hand, grab the blue battery removal film. With the other, hold the phone steady. Slowly pull up on the removal film to remove the battery and lift it out of the phone.


There may be a small amount of adhesive attaching the battery to the motherboard. If there is, you can use the spudger to reach under and detach it as you pull the removal film up.

, When you're ready to put your phone back together, all you need to do is perform the same steps as above backwards. In other words:


Carefully set the new battery in the old one's place, making sure to line up the terminals.
Screw the Torx screws back in place to attach the batter to the terminals.
Replace the plastic terminal cover.
Align the back case with the edges of the phone and press gently to reengage the plastic clips.

Now, you should have the end of the string through and it should be made into a big loop.,
Take the big loop and loop it over you phone charm.,
Pull it through.,

Finished.

",How to Put on a Phone Charm," If it is in a packet and you are using scissors, be careful not to snap charm or the charm string. If your phone has an antenna, just put the plastic circle thing around your antenna and you won't have to follow any more of these steps. If you don't have an antenna but your phone charm has a plastic circle, just chop it off with scissors. You can skip this step if you already have one.;
, You should really use a FLAT surface because if you do it on something bumpy, or worse just hanging up in the air, you might mess up.

, Don't worry, you'll be able to put them back on. It's just that if you keep it on, it makes the next few steps a lot harder.

, This is where you will slide the charm in.

, You slide the end of the string part of your charm through the TOP hole is the upper left or right corner of the phone. I used a pencil to kind of poke mine through but you could use anything. Just be sure to concentrate.

, So now you pull the end of the string so the phone charm is pressed up against the top of the phone and can't go any further.

, This is probably the simplest step.

, Now just pull the phone charm all the way down and you are set to go!

Don't abuse the phone.,
Keep it safe at all times.,
Don’t drop your phone.,
Avoid moisture and heat.,
 Clean it properly.",How to Take Good Care of Your Cell Phone," You’ve invested good money in your phone, so you expect it to last a long time. The thing is, even though your cell phone is of high quality, there is still a chance that it will break apart and stop working, especially if you don’t take good care of it. Because of this, it is imperative that you take the necessary precautions to ensure that your phone is kept in tiptop condition. Here are the things that you need to know about taking care of your cell phone.;
, Like any other electronic device, you need to handle your phone with utmost care. Keep it in a secure place at all times. Do not leave it lying around for kids or pets to toy with. One of the best ways to protect your phone is to store it in a durable cell phone case. Cell phone accessories, like cool cell phone covers, can be purchased for a cheap price in many online stores. But, make sure you go for quality and reasonable price at the same time so that the protective cover is strong enough to do the job of protecting your phone efficiently.

, One of the most common causes of damage of cell phones is dropping it. To prevent this from happening, always hold on to your phone tightly. It would be a good idea to make use of a cell phone lanyard so that you can wear your cell phone around your neck and not worry about dropping it on the ground accidentally. Like other cell phone accessories, cell phone lanyards can also be bought via the online route. 

, Do not subject your phone to extreme temperature changes, and particularly to strong heat. Avoid placing it near heat sources like the stove, furnace, chimney, and under the sun. Don’t leave it out in the cold, either. Avoid getting it near a source of moisture. All forms of liquids should be kept a good distance away from your phone. Do not drink or eat while using your phone to avoid accidental spillage. Don’t put your phone near any body of water, like the sea or swimming pool. Cell phones can be damaged even by slight dampness. If ever your phone becomes wet, save it by turning it off, removing the parts like SIM card and battery, and by drying the mechanisms using a clean absorbent towel. Always have a waterproof bag handy so that you can slip your phone inside it in case it rains.

, Whatever you do, never use a spray bottle to clean your phone. You should,  instead,  use a cotton swab dipped in alcohol and touch it lightly over the keypad. Remember to use this only on the exterior part of the phone and never inside. Protect it from theft


Damage in the cell phone’s mechanism is not the only thing that can take your phone away from you. It’s also possible that someone might steal your phone, so guard it at all times and protect it just like you would with any of your valuables.

You will need to provide your IMEI number in order to have your phone unlocked. If your phone was ever reported as stolen, you will most likely not be able to unlock it.

, When you turn your phone on, you will be presented with the message “Enter SIM network unlock”. Enter the code you received from the unlock service.

, Once you enter the unlock code, wait a few moments for your phone to acquire signal. Check that you are receiving service, and that you are in the service area for the new network.

Don't talk to others and be on the phone at the same it.",How to Use Your Cell Phone in Public," Cell phones are a convenience but they can easily be an annoyance especially to other people. Rule #1 is to know if you are in a place where your phone should be off as in off rather than on mute or buzz. The short list includes: church, a court room, a concert or public performance such as a play, a movie theater, medical facilities. If in doubt ask. And if you think you are too important to ask, turn the phone off.;
, If you are in a public place where you are going to be close to others, turn your ringer to a level where you can hear but which shouldn't disturb others. Use ""vibrate"" as well. In public use an appropriate ""ring tone"" rather than have you phone blasting your favorite pop hit. Nothing makes you look immature as much as having a Lady Gaga tune blasting out of the pocket of your pricey Armani suit.

, When the phone rings, and you are not otherwise engaged, answer the phone quickly. If this is a call that you want or need to take, separate yourself, if possible from other people by turning your back or stepping away from the group. Even when you take these steps, try not to engage in a yelling match or overly demonstrative conversations romantic or otherwise. Remember, the phone has a microphone and your voice will be heard by your caller.

, If the phone rings when you are engaged in conversation with another person, ask to be excused from the conversation you are having before your respond to the phone. And, when you respond to the phone, consider whether you need to answer immediately or let the call go to voice mail.

, Arrange to return the call at a mutually agreeable time. Then end the call quickly.

,, If the call that you answered is a true emergency, let those you are meeting with know that the call is urgent. Then move away from the group or individual and attend to the phone call.

, When you return to the in-person conversation, be honest about the seriousness of the situation and decide with the person or people you are speaking with if your business with them can be postponed.

, If you are starting a cell phone conversation, while in public, try to avoid making any calls that you know will be very emotional or highly charged. Remember to keep your voice at a quiet conversational level, the phone has a microphone. Avoid making discretionary calls if you are sharing a seat or you happen to be a standee on public transportation. If calling from a restaurant, remember not to disturb your near neighbors. Also, don't make a call when you need to be speaking with your waitperson.

, It's also not a good idea to be on the phone when shopping and interacting with a salesperson or clerk.

If you want to call someone's cellular or landline phone, click here.

, The call will be placed immediately, and if the recipient is online. Skype for mobile devices does not support multi-person video chats.


If you're using an Android tablet, you may be prompted to enable video calling before you can place a video call.
If you aren't able to make a video call, it means your device does not meet the minimum requirements for video calling.
The recipient will only see you during a video call if you have a forward-facing camera.

, This requires that your device has two physical cameras.

, While you can call any Skype user in the world for free through Skype, you'll need to pay if you want to use Skype to call a mobile or landline number. The rates vary depending on the location you are calling. You can find the latest rates at skype.com/rates.


Domestic and international calls to mobiles or landlines will both require payment.
Skype charges based on where you are calling to, not where you are calling from.
You can no longer make calls from Skype in India to phones also in India. You can still make Skype-to-Skype calls for free., Skype offers two forms of payment: you can buy a set amount of Skype credit, which your minutes will be subtracted from based on the per-minute rate for the country you're calling, or you can purchase different monthly subscriptions that offer set amounts or unlimited minutes. You can purchase subscriptions and credit through the Skype app or through the Skype website.


There are subscriptions that are country-specific, and there is the Skype Worldwide subscription. The Worldwide subscription offers unlimited minutes to any number in the world for $13.99 USD per month (as of February 2015). Depending on the country you are calling, you may be able to get an unlimited subscription specific to that country for less.

, once you've subscribed or added credit to your account, you can open the dialer by tapping the number pad button in the bottom-left corner of the app. This will open a phone dialer that you can use to key in any number you'd like. You can also tap the ""Address Book"" button in the upper-right corner to search through your contacts.

, As soon as you connect, Skype will begin counting the minutes and deducting them from your credit (unless you have an unlimited subscription). The current rate for the call will be displayed on your screen when the recipient picks up the phone.


The recipient will not be charged unless they are normally charged for receiving calls. The call will be like a local call from their end.

, You can see how much Skype credit you have by tapping your profile picture in the upper-right corner of the main Skype screen. Tapping on your current credit balance will give you the option to purchase more.

, If you haven't set a profile image yet, this will look like a generic silhouette.

, Tap the larger version of your profile image to set a new one. You'll be able to choose from pictures on your device, or you can use your device's camera to take a new one.

, This is the what any other Skype user will be able to see and search for.

, You can change any of the information in the ""Personal info"" section. Remember that anything you put here will be available to see by anyone.

, This is so that your contacts will know how to reach you, and adding a mobile number is required if you want to automatically add people to your contacts list. You can set this information to be private so that only your contacts will have access to it.

, This is located in the bottom-right corner.

, This will load you app and account settings.

,, By default, you'll be able to receive messages and calls from anyone. You can switch this to ""Contacts only"" so that the person will need to be added to your Contacts list before they can get in touch with your.

, This will allow you to set how people can search for you on Skype. Note that people will always be able to search for you based on your Skype username and the email address you used to sign up.

It's useful if you're moving to a dumb phone, but if you're using smartphones your contacts are typically synced with your Google account or Apple ID.;
,,, SIM cards come in three major sizes, and your phones may use different ones. This is especially true if they were made several years apart. Many carriers will provide you with the correct size for free.


You can cut larger SIMs down with a special SIM cutter tool, or ask for a compatible one from your carrier.
Smaller SIMs can fit into larger slots by being placed in an adapter card.

, Whenever you switch carriers, you'll need a new SIM card. You'll get a SIM card when you sign up for a new plan. If you switch carriers and then need a different sized SIM card, you can usually get one for free if you contact customer service.Some carriers operate CDMA networks instead of GSM networks, which don't require SIM cards to operate. Most 4G networks, however, are GSM networks, and will require a SIM card. For example, Verizon Wireless is a CDMA network but their 4G LTE service is a GSM network, so a SIM card is required to access 4G.

, If your phone is in a protective case, you'll need to remove the case in order to get the SIM card out.

, Depending on the type of phone you have, the SIM card will be located in different spots:


Check for a SIM tray. Many modern smartphones have SIM trays along one of the sides. These are opened by inserting a SIM removal tool or a straightened paperclip into the small hole on the side of the tray.
Check behind the battery. If your phone's battery is removable, the SIM is typically inserted behind it.

, Once you've located the SIM card, remove it from your phone.


For SIM trays, pop the tray out with the tool or paperclip and then pull it all the way out of the phone. You can then remove the SIM card from the tray.
If the SIM card is behind your battery, you can either slide it out or press it in a little to pop it out, depending on your phone.

, Reverse the removal process above to put the SIM into the new phone., If you're setting up a new smartphone, you'll be taken through the initial setup process. During this process, your SIM will typically be activated for your new phone automatically.


See Use an Android Phone for instructions on getting started with your Android device.
See Activate an iPhone for instructions on activating your iPhone during the initial setup.

, If your phone was already set up, you'll usually get service a few moments after you insert your SIM card. Just insert the SIM card, power it on if it wasn't on already, then wait to see if you connect. You'll see the signal bars appear in the phone's notification area, and you'll usually see the carrier name next to them.

, If your SIM is still not activating in the new phone, you'll likely need to contact the carrier. Since the phone isn't connected, you'll need to either call from another line or visit a carrier store to have the phone activated.

Go on their website or to their shops and ask for information about their services. Or read reviews and ask others what their experiences are like with their provider.


The amount of people using a certain provider is a good indicator of which carrier is the best in your area.;
, A good company should be able to provide a large range of reliable coverage and reception. This usually means they will own the most number of cellular towers in order to provide network service to more areas. It ensures that your calls won't be dropped while you're moving from place to place and you'll be able to receive service in low populated or underground locations.


Most countries will have a map of all cellular towers that label which towers are used by which provider that you can find by doing a quick internet search. A good provider should have the most towers in your area or areas where you frequent most.
A company might advertise plans with great deals but this doesn't necessarily mean they will have a reliable network. A great plan is only useful if you're able to carry out calls and receive service where ever you are.
If you travel a lot, consider looking for a carrier that provides national or international coverage.

, Like network coverage, data coverage depends on your region and the carrier. Data is useful if you plan to use the Internet on your phone or if you have a smartphone.


Compare data network speeds between carriers. You can usually find this information on their website or from a sales representative. The higher the number of kilobits per second (kbps), the faster you'll be able to use the internet to upload and download data.
Technology is always updating. The latest data ""G"" or generation of mobile technology will be the fastest. However, not all phones can support the latest and fastest data connection., The plan you choose will dictate what kind of phone you can get, what you can do with your phone, how long you have to stay with the carrier, and how much you'll have to pay each month. Choose a plan that is within your budget but still allows you to have the features you want to use on your phone. Some common features include:



Minutes: How many minutes of call time are you offered per month? How much does it cost to go over the maximum? Do these minutes rollover to the next month if left unused? Some providers designate certain times of the day or days of the week where you can use an unlimited amount of minutes to make and receive calls. Some may offer unlimited calling.

Texting: Today, texting is probably the most important must-have feature of cell phones. And most providers will offer unlimited texting or a certain number of free texts. Be careful, some providers may charge you just for opening texts.

Data Usage: Providers will offer varying amounts of data you can use each month to download and upload from the Internet. This can range anywhere from 500 MB to 6 GB to an unlimited amount of data usage.

Voicemail: There is often an additional charge to use this feature. It is very useful when you can't always answer your phone. However, calling your voicemail box may count towards using up call time minutes.

Caller ID: Caller ID is essential in today's world. Most plans will include caller ID now that it is a highly demanded and expected feature.

Contracts: Most plans require you to sign a one to three year contract with the provider. Usually, you'll receive a discounted price for the cost of the physical phone up front or a way to finance your phone throughout your contract. However, you'll still be paying the cost of the phone plan through the span of your contract, along with any fees for additional features and taxes.

Family Plans: If several members of your family use cell phones, then it may be more affordable to go with a family plan. The number of minutes, data, and texts are shared among your family to use each month.

, If you have bad credit, want to save money, or you simply want to try having a cell phone without signing up for a long contract, you may want a prepaid or pay-as-you-go plan. However, some of the cons are:


Phones cost full price and you have to pay for it all at once. Although, some older models of phones are relatively cheap.
Your coverage is not the carrier's top priority. Even though you may opt for a carrier that has the best coverage in your area, contract users will have top priority when it comes to their network.Customer service may be lacking.

, You might only want to call and text your friends and family. They are designed for ease of use and come in a variety of models such as a flip-phone design or slide out keyboard.The cost of a classic cell phone is much lower. Some contracts will offer the phone for $0.
Classic cell phones are quite durable. This is great if your life involves being in conditions where you might drop your phone or need to use it in unstable situations. You won't have to worry about breaking them as easily as a smartphone.
If you're older and want a simple wireless phone, classic cell phones are your best choice. Some phones have enlarged keypads for easy dialing.

, Smartphones are like mini-computers and are the most popular choice of phone for consumers. They have touch-screens, wifi connectivity, HD cameras, and come in different operating systems (OS). The most popular OS systems are:



Apple's iOS: This OS has the largest variety of content and applications, and is known for its ease and polished user interface. It is most popular for mainstream consumers who just want to absorb content (like watch video, play games, or connect with friends) rather than create content for professional uses. For this reason, many work professionals may prefer another OS.

Android: Android offers more flexibility for developers or those who want to customize how their OS looks and works. The OS is highly customizable if you know the basics of tech education and is useful if you'd like to develop applications.

Windows: If you're a business owner, then this OS might be right for you. Windows integrates many traditional Windows applications such as Microsoft Office, Exchange, and its cloud. It offers more power to create and customize advanced documents.

, PDAs are not as popular these days but upgraded models of these phones, such as the Blackberry, work well if your focus is primarily on browsing the Internet without all the extra features that come with smartphones. Tablets have larger screens and have more versatility and power close to a desktop or laptop, but have the convenience of a smartphone.

, For smartphones, there should be an app or icon that has a picture of a phone or says ""Phone"". Tap to view your contacts and/or tap the button to add a contact (this is usually indicated by a ""+"" symbol). Input your contact's information and phone number with the keypad and save. If you're using a classic phone, it's as easy as dialing the number and pressing a button that allows you to create a contact.


Some phones will have different tabs for your favourite numbers, recent calls, contacts, keypad, and voicemail.
Read your phone's manual since each OS can vary slightly the way contacts are made. Android phones will differ from iPhones and Windows phones.

, This button is often indicated by green lettering or symbols. Proceed as with any other phone call.


End the call by pushing ""end"" which is indicated with red lettering or symbols. Calls will usually end automatically after the person you spoke to hangs up, but it's best to get into the habit of hanging up, especially since some calls are billed by the minute.

, Each phone and OS will have a different way to lock your keypad. For example, Apple's iOS 8 and up, and iPhones 5 and greater, offer Touch ID security that reads your fingerprints in order to unlock your phone. While other smartphones will only require you to enter a password or a 4-digit number. Check your settings or user manual to learn how to lock your phone.

You may need to set up an account to download apps. Your phone should prompt you to set up an account which often asks for your personal information and payment options.



iPhones use the App Store app and require users to set up an Apple ID.

Androids use the Google Play app store.

Windows phones install apps from the Windows Store.
Some apps cost money. Make sure you have the correct payment information in your account. Be careful when allowing others to use your phone or your account to download apps. In most cases, a password is required to download any apps that cost money to protect you from unwanted purchases.
Some apps have in-app purchases or options to buy more features to upgrade the app you downloaded.
Classic phones don't usually have apps stores you can download from, but rather already have a set number of applications downloaded. Some later models of classic phones will have games, pictures, or music applications.

, Phones will have a battery life indicator that will tell you the percentage left or the time remaining of your battery life. Most phones will give you a warning or reminder when its battery life is running low.


Invest in different types of chargers such as a car charger, dock chargers for home audio systems, or another extra charger.

In simpler terms, it means that your Android tablet uses a SIM card. Check the user manual or turn the tablet about and look along the sides or at the back of it for any physical slot where a SIM card can be inserted in.;
, Take the SIM card out of your cell phone that has the plan. For some phone units, you can get the SIM card by removing the back cover and then the battery. In other models, you can remove the SIM card out of the phone by flipping it out of one side.


A network plan is SIM-dependent, and its service can be shared among devices just by transferring the SIM card.

, Get your Android tablet, and insert into it the SIM card you took out of your cell phone. How you insert a SIM card also varies depending on the make and model of the Android tablet you have, but it is actually the same with how you insert it into cell phones.


If you’re unsure how to put in a SIM card to your tablet, you may consult its user manual.

, Once you’ve inserted the SIM card into the Android tablet, you can now make calls, send out text messages, or even browse the Internet. Just remember that what you can do is still limited by the services available for your cell phone plan., If the tablet you’re using doesn’t use a SIM card, you can still share your cell phone’s plan with it, but you’ll only be able to share its mobile data connection.

Insert the new SIM card in your phone.,
Enter your unlock code.",How to Unlock Mobile Phones1," If you meet your carrier's requirements, you may be able to unlock your phone for free.
, The requirements for unlocking vary from carrier to carrier, but generally you will need to have been with them for a set amount of time (usually at least 3-6 months), and the phone will need to have been completely paid off.

You may be charged an early termination fee if you haven't paid off the phone's full cost yet.

, You will either be given your unlock code over the phone, or it will be emailed to you., You will need to have the SIM card from your new carrier inserted in order to receive the prompt to enter your code.

The location of the SIM card slot varies, but it is usually behind the battery or in a tray along the side of the phone. You may need a small paperclip to eject the tray.

, When you power your phone on with the new SIM card, you will be prompted for your unlock code. Make sure to enter the code correctly, as entering the incorrect code too many times may lock you out of your phone.

Make sure that you are within the coverage area of your new service when unlocking the device.

Have the proper information on-hand.,
Visit your service provider's store.,
Ask your carrier to install the SIM card you purchased earlier.,
Enter the code your carrier gave to you when prompted.,
Enjoy your carrier-unlocked device.",How to Unlock an Android Phone," While estranging your phone from your contracted service provider (e.g., Sprint) does allow you to switch carriers on the go in theory, keep in mind the following things:As long as you are under contract, be it a two-year or otherwise, your carrier has no obligation to unlock your phone.
Your Android's data type (GSM, CDMA, or LTE) makes a difference in which carriers you can use once your phone is unlocked (though most Android phones support all of the above).
If you've paid off your phone or you bought it outright in the first place, your carrier has to unlock your phone upon request.;
, Most phones from Verizon and Sprint come carrier-unlocked by default. There are also carrier-unlocked variations of Android phones that you can purchase online.


The Nexus, for example, comes equipped with both CDMA and GSM network support. This is also true of ""International"" versions of Android phones that you can buy online.
Although they use CDMA for voice and 3G data, Sprint and Verizon both have unlocked SIM slots for LTE data, which will allow you to use your Android on any supported LTE networks.

, If you didn't purchase your phone for full retail value, you're probably on a two-year contract with your carrier. This presents a couple of problems:


Your carrier technically owns your phone until you finish paying it off, meaning that they aren't obligated to unlock it.
Even if your carrier does agree to unlock your phone, you'll likely need to pay off the rest of your account (e.g., purchase the remaining percentage of the phone that isn't yours) before they'll do so.

, Each of the major four carriers (Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, and T-Mobile) have slightly different criteria for unlocking, but the main theme is that you must own your device. In most cases, the device also must be licensed by the network in question (meaning you can't ask a Sprint representative to unlock your T-Mobile phone for you).



Verizon doesn't place a lock on most of their devices. Even if your Verizon device has a lock on it, you can usually request an unlock as early as six months into the contract.Sprint will unlock your device for you if it a) has been on the Sprint network for at least 50 days and b) has been purchased in full (e.g., you don't have any payments left to make on it).AT&T requires you to submit your device's information for review. If your device is eligible for an unlock, AT&T will let you know within five business days.

T-Mobile unlocks your phone for you if you've paid the phone off and the phone has been on a T-Mobile network for at least 40 days., If you've determined that your phone is eligible for carrier unlocking, it's time to take your Android phone into the closest carrier store to you.

, Based on your contract (or lack thereof), your carrier's policy, and so on, you should have a pretty good idea of whether or not they'll unlock your device for you. Even so, calling ahead to make sure will save you time and frustration.


Remember that your carrier has a legal obligation to unlock your phone for you if you've paid for the phone in its entirety.
Sometimes, small carrier branch stores won't unlock a phone for you. In these cases, you'll need to visit a corporate branch store.

, You can do this online or from the network's carrier store. While optional, having the SIM card on hand will allow you to install it directly after unlocking your phone.


If you aren't planning on switching to a different network (e.g., you're just unlocking the phone for the sake of unlocking it), skip this step.
You'll need to make sure that your selected network is compatible with your phone's data network (CDMA, GSM, or LTE) before purchasing the SIM card. Your carrier can verify this information for you.

, In order to make your carrier's job easier, make sure that you know the following information before going into the store:IMEI number - Your device's ID number. You can find this by dialing *#06#.

Account holder information - This includes the account holder's first and last name and the last four digits of their social security number.

Device phone number - Your phone's official phone number and area code.

, While you can call them and have them walk you through the unlocking process, visiting the store in person will allow you to maintain a physical record of everything that happens. That way, if something goes wrong during the unlocking process, you'll be there to witness it.


This is also a good way to avoid getting the run-around or being put on hold while you're trying to complete the unlocking process.

, If they refuse or you don't want to install your SIM card right now, that's okay--you can install it later by opening the SIM tray with a paperclip, removing the old SIM card (if there was one) and sliding the new one in.


If you're simply unlocking the phone for now, proceed to the next step.

, You'll do this after your device reboots. Your carrier may also just enter this for you if they've agreed to install the SIM.


Keep in mind that asking your carrier to install your SIM and complete the unlock process for you may result in extra fees.

, Now you can use your Android phone with any service provider that uses your phone's radio frequency, including international carriers.

Contact your carrier to unlock your phone.",How to Switch SIM Cards1," An unlocked phone is programmed to operate on more than one cellular network, so a simple way to know if if your phone is unlocked is to put another carrier’s SIM card into it and see if your phone finds a signal. Although not all carriers use a GSM network, phones like recent Apple iPhones will still have a SIM slot, even on Verizon and Sprint, enabling you to use a SIM card if you are in another country. In order to switch SIM cards effectively, your phone must be unlocked. If you are unsure, you can search for your 15 digit IMEI number (a unique identification number for your phone) to check.Your phone’s IMEI number is usually found inside the battery compartment, but can also be found by dialing *#06# or going to your phone’s settings and looking through its device information.;

Your phone is from your carrier.
Your phone hasn’t been reported as lost or stolen.
The account your phone is associated with is in good standing (meaning you don’t have any egregious outstanding payments).
You know the account holder’s name and account number (if it is not you, ensure that you have their information and are authorized to make changes).
The IMEI of your phone.
Your phone number.
The last four digits of the account holder’s social security number or password.
Overseas deployment papers if military obligations are the reason you want to unlock your phone before you are out of contract.
If you are trying to unlock your phone so that you can take it with you to another carrier, ensure that your contract with your current carrier is up.

, Call your carrier and request a SIM unlock. Additionally, T-Mobile and Sprint offer unlocks through live online chat. AT&T device unlocks can be requested through their website.For Verizon, call 1-800-711-8300 to request a SIM unlock.For T-Mobile you can call 1-800-746-0949 as an alternative to the online chat.
If you are a Sprint customer and would like to unlock via phone, call 1-888-211-4727.
It is recommended that you unlock your phone while you are still a customer with your carrier, to ensure you receive service from carrier representatives.
The unlocking process can take some time (up to a week), so plan accordingly.

Alternative unlocking methods exist depending on your device. If you are truly stuck, paid third-party unlocking services are also available. However, you should always be cautious when going to an unofficial third party, and if you do, your phone may be voided of its warranty.

Keep track of the information you collect.,
Know the prices.",How to Purchase Your Own Phone As a Teenager2," Go onto your best local service provider's website and search for a phone. Make sure the phone suits all of your needs, and has any functions that your parents request. Maybe you're busy with an internship and need blue-tooth for hands-free calling, you travel a lot and need GPS, or your parents have requested parental controls - make sure the phone you want has these.


The advanced search option found on most sites can help you find a phone in your price range, and the type you want (flip, slide, touchscreen, etc).

, Find more information about the phone, such as features, versions, model, size, quality, battery replaceable, etc. It can also be of great help to check owner reviews, unboxing videos, hands-on/first impression reviews, and in-depth reviews.


Keep the size of the phone in mind - a man can fit most sizes in his pocket, but a woman who doesn't wear a purse will have to pick a phone that fits in hers.

, Make a checklist of features and functions you want, and make a mark for every one the phone has. This will be great for the presentation of the phone to your parents. At the same time, write down other features and functions that you hadn't thought that would be useful in your phone.


Depending on how tech-savvy you are, the ability to use a phone varies. You might want a simple Nokia phone or an iPhone, depending on how well you think you can adapt to using it.

, Keep in mind 1) the price of the phone and 2) the cost of data. Depending on the phone, a phone can cost anywhere from 20 dollars to 600 dollars, and data can cost a ton! If you use lots of data, you may want a cheaper phone and vice versa. However, remember that not only will you have to pay for the phone, but you might have to pay for the data as well. Find a cost that's right for you.

Don't sneak around your parents' back and buy a phone - there's no way they won't notice!

, Use a program such as PowerPoint to collect your work, information, and research in a nice slideshow. If you can, make graphs, or compare the phone you want to others (more and less popular phones, your parents' phones, etc).

, Collect your parents at a good time for them (not when angry, not right after coming home, etc) and go through the slideshow. Mention why things would be good for you, pros and cons, and so on. Show your savings and present the type of phone and data plan you would like.


If your parents are mad or busy, don't pull them away for the presentation!

The code varies depending on your country and your service provider, and it is not possible to block in all countries. Enter the prefix, followed immediately by the number you are dialing. For example, if you are in the US and want to call (555)123-4567, you would enter *675551234567.

Understand the working principles.,
Know how it works.,
Use an old aluminium box as a frame for the jammer and old UHF connectors from Motorola cell phone as input/output.

,
Attach RF connectors to the circuit.

Use a nine volt battery and voltage regulator to supply all components.,
Screw the input and output antennas (also from old Motorola mobile phone) onto UHF connectors.

,
Your cell phone jammer is ready.",How to Make Your Own Cell Phone Jammer," This cell phone jammer operates at GSM800 frequency since most mobile phones use it to operate. So the selected VCO is a sweeping oscillator, which is very effective but may be hard to construct for the beginners without nice RF-testing equipment.


As a noise source you can use a 45MHz clock oscillator which is driving a Local Oscillator port located on a mini-circuit mixer. There is also an impedance matching network for the Local Oscillator signal to pass through it. It is used to equate impedances of the clock oscillator and the port of the mixer.
RF input (which is this port of the mixer) connects to the first 800MHz cell phone antenna, and the RF output is sent to the mini-circuit amplifier. This amplifier increases the output power for 15-16dbm. The amplified signal is then sent to the second cell phone antenna.;
, All cell phones which use GSM800 have their transmitted and received frequencies always separated by 45MHz. So when the mobile phone tries to call, it is blocked by its own signal returning to it! Isn’t that cool? When the phone blabber annoys you – turn your jammer on and that wrongdoer will hear own voice in his or her cell phone.


Oh, by the way, you can also use this mobile signal jammer to block any cell-based tracking systems which use your GPS to track and record your car’s moves. And it is quite possible to jam IEDs which detonated using cell phones.
The mixer used is designed to work up to 600MHz but in this case it works pretty well.
RF amplifier is doing its job perfectly yet draws additional power.

,,, Place the battery inside and separated by the foamed plastic from the other components.


Place the power on/off switch on the top.

Contact your service provider.,
Request for a transfer of line.,
Wait for your telephone line to be transferred.",How to Keep Your Old Phone Number1," Telephone companies allow transfer of telephone lines from one place to another. What’s going to happen is that they’ll just transfer your existing line to the area where you’re moving to instead of creating a new telephone line. On the other hand, not all landlines can be transferred for these reasons:


The area you want your landline to be transferred is not covered by your telephone company. The telephone company may not have any existing service for the area where you want your phone to be transferred to.
The place you’re moving to is simply far away. Having your service transferred to a different state is just not that ideal.;
, The customer service will inform you if your telephone can be transferred. If it’s possible, you can start to request for a transfer of line. Just state the place where you want to move your existing service to and fill up some documents that may be required by your telephone company.

, This may take a few days or weeks depending where you want your line to be moved to and if there are any available slots in the systems where your service can be squeezed in.


Also, standard fees such as installation and relocation fees may apply depending on your service provider.

Use your new SIM card with the same number.",How to Keep Your Old Phone Number2," Call or drop by to any available service centers of your carrier and ask about their procedures on how you can keep your number. Mobile network carriers each have their own policies on the matter, so make sure to contact your customer’s support.

, Your carrier should be able to give you a new SIM card with your old number. If you’re not going to switch to a different carrier, your airtime balance and other important account details can also be transferred.


Requesting a new SIM card with the same number can either be free or may come with a little fee, depending on the service you’re using.

, Insert the SIM card into your phone and use it like the old one you have. You’ll be able to call and send text messages to people, and they should be able to recognize you—that is, of course, if they saved your mobile number in their contact list.

Contact your carrier’s customer support and ask for your PAC.,
Contact the customer support of the new carrier you want to use.,
Wait for your request to be completed.",How to Keep Your Old Phone Number3," A PAC, or Porting Authorization Code, is a unique alphanumeric code that is used to transfer an existing cellphone number between mobile network carriers. This way, a user can still retain his or her mobile number even after switching to a different service provider.


Different countries have different guidelines regarding the issuing of PAC to subscribers. Basically, all you need to do is to contact your service provider and ask for your Portability Authorization Code. If you meet your respective country’s guidelines on PAC, the service provider should readily issue one for you.
You can get your Porting Authorization Code either for free or with a fee, depending on your network carrier’s policies.

, Call the customer service department of the carrier you want to switch to after you get your PAC. Once you give your new carrier your mobile number and its PAC, they should be able to process your request right away.


Depending on the region, Porting Authorization Codes can only be used after a specific amount of time from the date of issuance (ranging from 2 days up to a maximum of 30 days).

, Your new carrier will issue you a new SIM card that uses your old number from your previous carrier. You should be able to use it normally like you did before, but you’ll now be using the products and services of your new carrier.

Please understand the specific using of steps and methods before using the data cable.,
Pay attention to the stitch correct and correspondence when plug interface.,
Keep the data cable moisture proof and dust proof.,
Try not to let the data cable crimp.",How to Maintain Your Cell Phone Data Cables,"


This is exactly “Know yourself and knows your enemy, you will win every war.” After familiar with the use of the data cable method and steps, we will not damage the data cable because of improper using.;
,


Data cable has two interfaces. One interface is for the connection of computers, and the other interface is for the connection of mobile phone. And their interface stitches are different. And stitch is thin which is easy to break. We must insert the interface carefully; otherwise if the stitch is broken, the data cable is useless.

,


Data ports have small stitches which belong to the metals products and be very vulnerable to get water and dust oxidation. Undeserved maintenance is easy to let the water and dust intrusion into the cable, resulting the data cable cannot work normally, download speed nature also slow.

,


Many users would like to crimp up the data cable for storage after using the data cable. Actually this is wrong. A data cable is made of plastic and aluminum foil shield which can't stand long time volume. Long time volume will cause the damage of the plastic layer or internal aluminum foil shield and reduce the service life of the data cable.

, In this menu, look for the “Screen unlock” section. Touch “Set up screen lock”.

, There will be three different options that you can pick from: Pattern, PIN, or Password.


A Pattern lock requires you to draw a specific pattern on the phone’s screen to unlock it. You will need to repeat the pattern twice before it is accepted.
A PIN lock requires you to enter a 4 digit number to unlock the phone. You will need to enter the PIN twice before it accepted.
A Password lock requires a minimum 4 character password to unlock the phone. You will need to enter the password twice before it is accepted.

, If you want to change your screen lock, navigate to the “Screen unlock” section and tap “Change screen lock”. You will need to input the old lock pattern, PIN, or password before you can enter a new one.

, Press the Power button on your phone while the screen is dark. This will show the Lock screen and the input method for your specific unlock. Enter your pattern, PIN, or password. For Pattern unlocks, the device will unlock once the pattern has been successfully completed. For PIN or password unlocks, press the OK button once you have entered the correct code.


If you enter the wrong pattern or code 5 times in a row, you will be locked out of your phone for 30 seconds before you can try again.

Get and external storage device.For netbooks, an external DVD burner should be a great move, allowing you functionality and data burning capabilities.,
Back up your data regularly.,
Use Folder Lock.,
Use all the security features available on your device.",How to Keep Your Mobile Data Safe and Secure," Another great idea would be a portable hard drive. Depending on the size of your external hard drive, this allows you to copy large amounts of data off your system, but readily available to you if in any situation you may need it. For large quantities of data, an external Blu-ray burner may be the solution.;
, Most people either don’t see the importance of this, or they are just too lazy to do it. Experience around computer systems and devices has shown us, those who back up regularly are the ones who do not end up shouting or screaming when their system crashes. If you are new to this, we suggest that you make a habit out of it.

, The software is especially engineered for the pals who are concerned with data security, yet they find it difficult to secure it. Folder Lock gives you the luxury to secure your data without any complexity and backs it up automatically on the cloud server. Dynamic lockers are one of the perks of using the program. Here is the link through which you can get this amazing software http://www.newsoftwares.net/folderlock/

, Passwords come to mind. Password should be a complex combination of upper and lowercase letters along with numbers and symbols. Alphabets that are located nearby on the keyboard should be avoided in a password. Remember your password and avoid writing in anywhere. Change the password on every 90 days at least.

"
Increase your elevation.,
Try moving outside or to a window.,
Get to an unobstructed location.",How to Improve Cell Phone Reception1," To get more signal, you need to either get higher in elevation so as to be clear of obstructions or move around the obstructions that are present. Some deem this the ""Lion King"" method, where you hold up your phone in midair like Rafiki held up baby Simba. Beyond this, if you're at the bottom of the hill, start climbing. Reception may be better higher up.


Not all phones are made the same. Some are very good at using low phone signals and some are absolutely terrible. Ask other people what works best for your signal supplier.
Know where your local cell phone provider is so you can point your phone nearer to that area and eliminate the possibility of needless obstacles between the signal and your phone.;
, Don't bother trying to make calls from deep inside buildings or underground. Buildings and other large structures are very unfriendly to adequate cell phone signal. If you are having reception problems on the street, try walking to the nearest intersection, as there you may find better coverage.


Cellular band radio waves do not effectively penetrate earth: if you are underground you will likely receive no signal.
In addition, try downloading a signal map tool for your smartphone. These typically work by pointing the user in the direction of their nearest cell tower and can be extremely effective in locating better coverage.

, Today's cell phones are digital and thus more sensitive to a clear signal. Essentially think of the ""best reception"" in your line of sight. Even if you can't literally see the cell tower, what's the clearest path toward an open area?


Also remember that the signal can be reflected, so what reception you do get is not just subject to what is in the way, but also what it is bouncing off of Just because you are in a clear field doesn't mean you will get reception if you are in the shadow of a water tower.
Beyond that remember that not all cell towers serve all cell providers.

"
"
Keep your phone away from other electronic devices that might interfere with your reception.,
Try to keep your battery charged to 2 bars or higher.,
Hold your phone correctly.,
Use Wi-Fi as your cell phone signal.",How to Improve Cell Phone Reception2," These include laptops, iPads, microwaves and other electronics. Turn the WiFi and Bluetooth off, too, and see if that helps devote more of your phone's resources to finding a signal.


Turn off these other devices if possible. If that doesn't work, consider turning your phone off too and turning it back on again shortly thereafter. Sometimes a little reboot solves just about any problem.

, Your cell phone uses a lot more power when connecting a call than when it is on standby. Often, your battery can be strong enough to attempt a call, but not strong enough to find a signal. If you find you are having signal problems, consider your battery and get to charging.

, Mobile phone antennas are designed to project a signal outward, perpendicular to the long axis of the antenna. As such, mobile phones seek signals in a donut-esque shape around the antenna. Normally, when a mobile is held upright, this is not a problem. However, if you are holding your phone in a strange way, such as on its side or upside down, you will hinder the operation of the antenna. Hold your phone upright to guarantee that your phone can ""see"" your carrier signal.


On most newer phones the antenna is located at the bottom of the phone, so if you are experiencing signal problems on a newer phone turning it upside down will boost your signal.
On the older phones, the antenna can usually be located on the rear upper area of the phone (near the camera).

, Make calls and connect to internet from your phone as normally you would. If your mobile phone supports UMA, you can use the wi-fi as your cellphone signal where you don't get GSM signal coverage or areas with poor coverage. There are also some apps that are free to download, such as Viber, which call using Wi-Fi


Not all devices and carriers support UMA calls. Some Blackberry, Androids and a few other phones support UMA, and it is becoming more and more common as technology improves.

Try switching to a 2G network.,
Utilize a Smart Signal Booster.,
Install a cellular repeater.,
Upgrade your antenna.,
Change networks.,
Host a cell site.",How to Improve Cell Phone Reception3," 4G and 3G are designed to deliver high bandwidth to cellphones; however, the distance between the transmission tower and the cellphone must be within a certain range of each other to be effective. The farther away you are away from one, the weaker the signal is going to be. If it is absolutely important for you that you can be reached for calls and texts, consider switching your phone to a 2G network instead. 2G offers a lower bandwidth than their newer counterparts but in turn you will have decent coverage in most places, especially where 3G/4G signals can't penetrate very well.


Imagine in between dense housing or enclosed spaces. Because of the lower data rate, 2G signals are able to get to hard to reach places. The only downside is that your internet connection won't be as fast. At any rate it is perfectly usable for calling and texting.
To top it all off, your battery will not drain as fast since 2G doesn't require that much power. Consult your manuals of your phone on how to enable 2G networks.

, A new category of Smart Signal Booster is emerging. This new category of boosters utilizes super-powerful baseband processors to clean the signal before it is rebroadcast (hence the ""Smart"" in the name Smart Signal Booster). Most of the Smart Signal Boosters have gains of 100db (compared to analog booster's gain of 63 to 70db). That's a 1,000 times to 2,500 times difference.


Some of these new boosters, while more expensive than the traditional analog booster, are completely plug and play: you plug them, and they usually work right away without the need for complex installation of outdoor antennas (usually the donor antenna is inside the booster box). Truly plug and play, they can be used with almost any carrier, require no installation and actually work. Most of the time, Smart Signal Boosters are carrier-specific (i.e. you need to get the one that works for your carrier).

, If you are having cell problems in one location, such as your home or office, then try installing a cellular repeater. Cell phone repeaters pick up low cell signal with an antenna, boost the signal and broadcast it over the coverage area. They typically need at least 2 bars of signal where the antenna is placed (usually outside or on the roof) but can substantially improve cell reception, as well as battery life and data download speeds.


Some repeaters might need technical knowledge such as the frequency of your carrier, and only work for one service provider. For a less technical approach that improves reception on all carriers, use a dual-band cell phone repeater.

, A few cell phone manufacturers make a ""Hi-gain"" antenna for their handsets, which may be changed in-store or by the user at home. Although these won’t improve signal as much (or at all) as a repeater these antennas are relatively inexpensive and you are not confined to one location.

, Most networks operate independently of one another, using their own frequencies and constructing their own cell phone towers. Chances are if the signal is bad with one network you can improve by switching. Most cellular networks these days allow you to transfer your phone number when you change provider.


Some will offer you a great deal if you're a new customer – big companies are running out of newbie customers, so they have to look to customers from their competitors. Search around for who has the best service in your area and who is offering the best deals.

, This may take time, but where cell phone reception is inadequate, property owners can host small cell sites on their properties for major wireless carriers. 3rd parties with Wireless Revenue Programs allow you to register your property to be eligible. Then when there is carrier interest in the area you'll be on the short list of places they choose from and will have optimal coverage.


They may even pay your phone bill. What's not to like?

, If you have a working phone but don't want to use it to activate the SIM card, look up the customer service number of the company listed on the SIM card. Almost all SIM cards have a serial number printed directly on them. Read this number aloud to the person who answers your call, and ask them for the number associated with the card.

Check your bill.",How to Keep a Low Cell Phone Bill," While it's tempting to buy a popular ringtone or a trendy wallpaper, that's just an extra expense that doesn't make your phone work any better. Some phone companies offer ringback tones, as well, which are not necessary components in making your phone work for you. Analyze the age of your phone and determine if insurance is really worth the price. Often, when a phone gets to be several months old, insurance isn't worth the cost. Also consider whether you really need that three-way calling function or GPS service. If you're trying to reduce costs, these are ""extras"" that you can probably do without.;
, If your package has a limited number of minutes, try to keep track of how many minutes you've used so that you do not exceed your plan's allowance. Paying for extra minutes is expensive. To reduce your usage, check your voicemail from a landline, call during off-peak hours and place calls during your nights/weekends hours. If you cannot cut down your minutes on a regular basis, look into changing plans to accommodate your usage.

, Text messaging, picture messaging and playing on the Internet eat up data allowances. By reducing the amount of time you spend on each of these tasks, you are likely to reduce your bill.

, If you add people who are apt to exceed your minute allowance or fail to pay their portions of the bill, you will end up having to pay more for your phone.

, Paying late results in additional late fees.

, Sometimes you will get a discount as a result of your employment. Many government employees or employees of large firms or companies receive small discounts on a monthly basis.

If you do not yet have an urgent need for your cell phone records but feel you may have use of them in the future, store them in a safe and secure place.
The record should include certain basic information, including the date, the time the call was placed, the duration of the call, and (in some cases) any special features that were activated during the call (for example, in-call recording).;
, Most cell phone companies allow you to access the same information online that you would get in along with any physical billing statement, but you must have an online account to see your records.Register for an account on your cell phone provider's website if you have not already done so. You may have to create a unique username (some will allow you to use your telephone number or an email address) and password. The process may go faster if you have your account information at hand.

If such options are not available on the opening screen, you may need to look for headings that include words such as ""Usage."" Understand, however, that certain proxies will only inform you of outgoing calls. If you need a full phone record--including the incoming calls for which many plans no longer charge--then your usage record may not do.

, If you have lost the records sent to you or cannot locate the records online, the best remaining option is to contact your phone provider. They are mandated by law to keep the records, and should be able to provide them to anyone who can prove that they are the main account holder.


Be prepared to provide personal information that will assist the customer service representative in identifying your account, including your account number, cell phone number, current home address, and possibly the last four digits of your social security number.
Because your cell phone provider should have provided this information to you in a monthly statement, they may charge you a fee for providing this information to you again.

How to get a girl's cell?",How to Get Cell Phone Numbers1," The National Cellular Directory is an organization which functions much like a land line phone company, keeping a database of individual cell phone numbers. However, it is an ""opt-in"" service, and to find a person there, that person must have voluntarily registered.;
, People search organizations such as Intellius will quickly find just about anybody. A simple name/address/phone number search can be very inexpensive—in some cases, under a dollar. If you do a lot of searches, though, you would probably want to consider a more robust plan.


Most online searches will ""find"" a person for free. But to get any more information than that will have a significant cost.
These organizations do not always operate with information that is up-to-date. For example, while they may be able to find the cell phone number of a particular person, that cell phone number may have been discontinued several months previously. Use caution when considering these organizations to ensure you are working with a legitimate company. Experience has also shown that those sites have incorrect ages or locations, even going so far as to offer to sell you the phone numbers of people who are long deceased.

, While virtually all the name search sites will charge you to view a phone number, there is a plethora of information out there on all of us, and our phone numbers may be attached to a number of things. School newspapers, social media sites, local organizations we may have joined, etc.

, Many times, people will make their phone numbers available to the general public. If you know the person and are trying to reconnect, friend them on Facebook, or make them a connection on LinkedIn.

, There are numerous ways to get a girl's cell number. I will list a few of them. The first and foremost one is just to walk up to her and ask for it. The second one is to walk up to her and exchange cell numbers. The third way to achieve that is to ask for her mother's cell and call the mom, and ask for her daughter's cell.

Know that you're still using the same technology.,
Flashing your phone to Straight Talk is illegal.",How to Flash a Phone," CDMA stands for Code Division Multiple Access. If you are uncertain whether your phone is CDMA or not, remove the battery and look for a removable subscriber identity module (SIM) card under the battery. If there isn't a SIM card, you indeed have a CDMA phone that can be flashed.


GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) phones can't be flashed (like AT&T and T-Mobile). Metro, Sprint, Cricket, Boost, Verizon and many others are CDMA and thus can be flashed because they're not controlled by the SIM card. (Since Metro has merged with T-Mobile they have introduced phones with SIM cards so flashing may vary from phone to phone.)
Your phone must also have a clean ESN (electronic serial number) -- that is, it must never have been reported lost or stolen.;
, The same one you use to connect to your computer to download music and whatnot will be used with this process.

, There are several easy-to-use flashing programs that make flashing easy, and some are even free to download. Make sure the one you choose will work with your particular phone before attempting to flash.


Examples include Easyflasher.com, CDMA-ware.com, and Your cellular. Search around before you risk damaging your phone with an inadequate or incompatible program.

, You are changing your phone from your current carrier to something else. The only stipulation is that it also must be a CDMA network. Cricket, Page Plus, and Metro PCS are three popular options.


You can check the reception in your area for various carriers at Cellreception.com.Might as well before you make the leap! Certain programs are affiliated with larger networks, like Page Plus is with Verizon.You can get an hour's trial of Page Plus from their website.



, Carefully read the instructions and follow them carefully. After reading the instructions, you will be able to flash your phone within 15 or 20 minutes.


Because each phone's set up is a bit different, it's impossible to outline step-by-step guidelines here. However, there are generally a few things you need to know that we'll try to cover.

, If you're unsure whether your phone is up-to-date or not, it's fairly simple to get the latest online. As long as you know your phone's model number or name, you'll be good to go. If you don't, you can find that online, too.


Make sure you have all the drivers you need before you flash! Otherwise the process may not work. Visit your phone company's website (e.g., Samsung) to do so.

, The software will ask you what your original carrier was, what you're flashing to, and your phone's make and model. It will also prompt you to choose between a ""half flash"" and a ""full flash."" A ""half flash"" is just talk and text, nothing else.

, If you get into the program you're using to flash, you can ""read"" the phone, which will then give you all the information you need to continue with the process. Or you can get into it beforehand. The MEID and ESN can be found underneath your phone's battery.


The MEID will be 18 digits (starting with 2) if it's MEID Dec or 15 numbers and letters if its MEID Hex.
The ESN will be 8 numbers long and possibly labeled PESN., Your software should have an option to detect your phone, allowing it to be read. If you do this, you don't have to worry about determining the COM port yourself -- it should be able to figure that out for you.


If it is asking you your unlock code, for Verizon phones this is always six zeroes. The lesser common, but still possible, options are six ones or six threes.
Certain phones may require you to mess with the PRL. In the US, the code is *228 (for Verizon/MetroPCS/US Cellular) and ##873283# (""update,"" in case you didn't notice) for Sprint. In Canada, it's *22803 for Telus Mobility.
If for some reason the COM Port is giving you guff, you can manually find what port it is in through your Device Manager.

, Most software will have you select ""write"" and then ask you to confirm. Once you select ""yes,"" the phone will proceed to get flashed and automatically reboot when successful. That's it! You're done. Almost too easy, huh?

, This is the term used for a ""sudden death"" of your phone. It becomes virtually useless...unless you want to use it as a brick.


This risk still exists even when done by a professional. The odds are lower than if you ask your geeky roommate to do it, sure, but it's still there.

, However, if you go to a retailer and they do it for you (which is an option), your warranty may stay intact (depending on your circumstances, of course).

, If you're flashing to Boost or Cricket, you shouldn't have a problem. But flashing to a behemoth like Verizon could pose some issues -- they approve of fewer ""at-home"" remedies such as this.

, When you're working with a CDMA phone, whether it's flashed or not, you'll still be relying on CDMA technology. If you live in the US and travel a lot, most phones in other countries are of the GSM variety (i.e., have a sim card). The main benefits of flashing your phone are in saving money and supporting the littler guys.


All carriers within the US with the exception of AT&T and T-Mobile use CDMA technology. Their numbers (ESN) are hard-wired and cannot be changed, unlike their GSM peers., You need to replicate your phone's ESN to do this, thus cloning it. Having two phones with the same number is obviously fishy and is a crime that could lead to some hefty fines or more.If you are contemplating Straight Talk, see their website and talk to a professional beforehand.

Smart phone cell plans usually include data, texting, email and an ability to download apps. It is rare to find a data plan for less than $40 per month. However, some smart phones come free as standard with new contracts.

,


Until a few years ago, it was common for every free cell phone to come with a 2-year contract. AT&T and Verizon are prime examples of companies that usually require these contracts.
No contract plans are available through T-Mobile, Sprint and many of the smaller companies. Make sure you use this term if you do not want a contract.
Wi-Fi plans are those with calling over Wi-Fi. They generally cost less, include less and are unavailable in certain areas.

, You may want to look at other options.


In rural areas, there may only be 1 or 2 major providers, so you may have to choose from fewer options.

, Major and smaller providers provide plans that run for .10 per minute, $2 on days you use the phone and $25 per month for 250 minutes.

, Buy a phone from their limited choices and you can get an unlimited plan for $19 to $29 per month.


Republic Wireless switches to Wi-Fi wherever it is available to save money.

, If this option is available in your area, it may be the least expensive plan on the market.

, You can get unlimited plans between $30 and $50 per month. Some are available without a contract.

Turn off the ringer on your phone when you're in a class, a lecture, a meeting, etc.,
Take your phone with you whenever possible.,
Use theft shutdown software.",How to Take Proper Care of Your New Cell Phone," It's very important to find out which features you really want in a cell phone before you purchase a new one. Make sure it is a brand and model that you're happy with, from its features to the quality of its design. If you purchase a phone you don't like (or get a cheap one included with a contract), you may end up being more ""careless"" with it because you ""care less"" about it, which is really a waste of money and your time.;
, These will take care of your phone by preventing it from being subject to knocks and scratches. This helps to keep the phone's appearance longer and may also protect it from some internal damage should you accidentally knock or drop the phone.

, It should be somewhere that is out of the way and where the phone is not likely to be knocked onto the floor or trodden on. For example, good places include keeping it on a desk, bookshelf, or in a cabinet. It's a good idea to choose one spot where it always goes (near a recharger) so that you can find it with ease, any time.


Do not keep your phone stored in a purse or other closed container for extended periods of time unless it is powered off. Charging a mobile phone in a closed container is a potential fire hazard and may shorten its lifespan. Li-ion batteries (typical for most phones) give off heat when charged and when discharging.
Always use genuine chargers and accessories. Cheaper ones that are not compatible or made for going with your brand of phone can harm the phone or lessen its lifespan.

, Don't talk on your cell phone while it's raining, do not eat or drink near the phone, and avoid carrying it near open water (such as a pond, the beach, or toilets).


If you do get your phone wet, see How to save a wet cell phone.

, Use dry tissue paper or alcohol wipes to clean the phone's exterior surfaces. Do not use water, baby wipes, or other cleaners that may inadvertently add moisture to your phone.

, Some phones will last more than a week or more on a single charge (when not in use), while others may need to be charged every day or every other day. If you spend too much time talking on your phone, you can quickly use up your battery's charge.


Keep your battery percentage between 40%-80% for longer battery life.

, Even in relatively everyday activities such as watching a movie in a movie theater, or attending church, it is polite to keep your ringer on vibrate or turned off. The last thing you want to do is frantically try to turn off your ringer in these scenarios. Doing so risks accidentally dropping or damaging the phone.


Find flight mode on your phone and make use of it when you don't wish to be disturbed.

, Never let your phone leave your sight. Avoid lending your phone to others, even if done under your supervision, as accidents can and will happen once in a while.

, Depending on your phone brand, you can shut down the phone if it is stolen. Activate this in case you lose your phone or it is stolen.

If there’s a full version available in the Play Store, buy and download that one instead.

, Some apps might not have full versions available in the Play Store for you to purchase and download. Instead, they will have a “Remove ads” option inside the app for you to select and buy.


To locate the option, you might either see a “Remove ad” link right on the ad or you can go to the app’s settings menu and find it there. Tapping the option will open the Google Wallet for you to begin processing your purchase. Cost of removing the ads vary from one app to another.
There are some apps that have full versions in the Play Store as well as the “Remove ads” option in the app. If this is the case for your app, it would be best to purchase the full version from the Play Store, so when you change phones, you can still download the same paid app but this time for free (it’s a one-time purchase). If you purchase Remove Ads from inside the app, Play Store may register it as an in-app purchase, and the information might not carry over to a new device; you might end up downloading the free version in the new device, but it will still contain ads despite purchasing the Remove Ads option from the old device.

, In some apps, pop-ups may appear due to improper installation of the app. Try re-installing the app from the Play Store. If the problem persists, it might not be possible to stop pop-ups from it. If the pop-ups really bother you, just uninstall the app or contact the app developer.

Replacement front glass. You can buy one from eBay for a low price.
Flat, thin plastic tools you can use to prop the glass up.
Hair dryer.
Thin gloves, like those made of rubber or leather.
Box cutter.
Painter’s tape.;
, Just press the Power button until the screen turns off., This helps minimize the number of shards left on the touchscreen when removing the glass screen.

If you have a screen protector installed, you do not have to do this step as the protector has enough adhesive material on it to grab the shards.

, Remove also the microSD and SIM card.

Remember to store these items safely so they don’t inadvertently end up in the trash with the discarded tape and glass shards.

, With a hair dryer, constantly heat the bottom panel, where the Home button and capacitive touch buttons are located. While heating, try to pry the corners open with the box cutter. Carefully lift the edges off until all of the front panel is removed.

You will need to heat the sides and top of the front panel as well, as the glue that holds the glass in place is spread on those areas. Heat the surface of the front of the phone to 170–180 °F (82 °C) while making sure to hold the gun three inches away from the phone.
Also, if the glass is shattered, you have to be careful in lifting the large pieces away as it might scratch the AMOLED glass. Lift the pieces slowly and patiently, as rushing might cause damage to the digitizer and touch screen.

Detach the buttons from the front panel by using a little heat, and use a spudger to peel the buttons off of the glass panel.

Start taking the buttons out by beginning with the middle black ribbon in the portion that connects the two buttons. Move sideways to remove each button.

, Once the buttons are unhinged, you can start removing the glass as well as the shards on the screen. If the shattered pieces are very fine, use some sticky tape to gently lift them off of the LCD screen. Do not press hard when doing this, as you can permanently scratch the LCD screen., You will be needing it for the new one., Use some WD40 and microfiber cloth, but do not use WD40 excessively., The double-sided tape should come with the front panel replacement when you purchased it., Make sure it is spotless before applying the new glass., Inspect it in the light for inconsistencies or blemishes that you should wipe off before applying.

Peel off the paper on the strips of sticker tape on the phone, and peel out the protective plastic on the surfaces of the replacement screen.

, Make sure to secure it properly.,, Make sure everything is dust free before doing so. Apply pressure on the edges of the screen to make them adhere securely while lining up the buttons to the appropriate areas while applying the glass.

You can use a small flathead screwdriver to secure the touch buttons (Back and Menu buttons) ribbons to the right position when laying the bottom of the panel down.

To turn off your iPhone 7, press and hold the Lock button on the right side of the phone's casing, then slide the slide to power off switch at the top of the screen right.;
, The Lightning port is at the bottom of the phone. You'll need a 3.4 millimeter Pentalobe P2 screwdriver to remove the two screws here.

, Doing so will loosen the adhesive that holds the screen in place, which will allow you to lift the display up later. Leave the heating pad for five minutes before proceeding.

, Place it at the bottom of the screen, directly above the Home button.

, The screen should only lift a fraction of an inch away from the case. Pulling too hard may rip the display from the case, so be gentle.


Hold the rest of the iPhone down with your other hand while you pull the suction cup.
If the screen won't come up, try heating the bottom of the iPhone for another few minutes.

, There should be a space created by gently pulling up on the suction cup, and your spudger should fit snugly into the gap.


Make sure you're using a plastic spudger and not a metal one, as a metal spudger will damage your phone.

, Twisting the spudger back and forth should gently pry the screen away from the phone's casing. Do not use the spudger near the top of the phone--there are plastic clips that hold the top of the screen in place, and doing so will break them. Instead, only move the spudger about halfway up each side.

, Lifting the screen any higher than this will break the fragile display cables, so err on the side of caution when doing this., Doing so will unstick the last of the adhesive there.

, You should only have to pull it a few millimeters down to clear the plastic clips at the top of the iPhone

, It should fold open like a book, with the interior of the iPhone now exposed and the still-connected display and screen face-down to the right of the case.

, This silver bracket is on the lower-right side of the iPhone's interior; there's a ribbon connecting it to the display part of the phone. You'll find four screws attaching the bracket to the phone, three of which require a 1.2 millimeter screwdriver and one of which needs a 2.6 millimeter screwdriver.

, You'll see two black strips of plastic beneath it: one running parallel to the battery, and one running perpendicular.

, This strip is the battery connector; detaching it will disconnect the display from your iPhone's battery.

, Doing so will detach the ribbon here from the iPhone's interior, thereby disconnecting one of the two display ribbons.

, This silver bracket is at the top-right corner of the phone's interior. You'll find three tri-point screws here: one 1.3 millimeter, and two 1.0 millimeter.

, You should see another black piece of plastic that's perpendicular to the battery; this is the connector for the second display ribbon.

, Doing so will remove the second display ribbon from the iPhone's interior.

, It should be completely removed at this point.

, This black bracket is in the bottom-left corner of the iPhone's case. You'll find a 2.9 millimeter screw and a 2.1 millimeter screw holding it down.

, You should now be looking at the Taptic Engine's connector, which is a black piece of plastic like the rest of the connectors you've unattached so far.

, Doing so will disconnect the Taptic Engine from your iPhone's logic board, which will in turn allow you to remove the Taptic Engine.

, All three of these screws are 1.5 millimeter screws.

, With the Taptic Engine out of the way, you're finally ready to remove the iPhone's battery.

, You'll want to use a pair of needle-nose pliers or tweezers for this step.

, Do this gently, since wrinkling or tearing the adhesive strip will make it extremely difficult to remove your iPhone's battery. After enough pulling, the strip will slide out from under the battery.


If one of the adhesive strips tears and renders the battery impossible to remove: lay the iPhone on a heating pad for a few minutes to loosen the adhesive, then pry out the battery with a thin plastic card inserted on the left side of the battery.

, Make sure you're holding down the battery while pulling out the last one so that the battery doesn't get ejected from the iPhone's interior.

, At this point, you can place a new battery in the iPhone, or let the phone dry as needed if it has suffered water damage.

Small, thin plastic tool for wedging between the glass and the digitizer
Heat gun
Pry tool
Clear tape or packaging tape
Lint-free cloth

, The back of the unit should be facing you.

, Do this by inserting a fingernail on the groove a bit higher than the Power button on the right side of the device, then gently pry off the back cover.

, Secure these in a place where you won’t lose them.

, The heat gun will be used to soften the adhesive holding the glass to the digitizer.


The digitizer is the component that detects the touch input and is attached to the display.

, Heat it for 3–5 minutes while holding it at around 6 inches (15.2 cm) away from the phone.


DO NOT heat the glass for long periods, as it might melt the digitizer, causing discoloration. In the event of this happening, turn off the gun immediately.

, Pry the glass until you have a gap where you can wedge something in.


Do this process slowly as pulling the glass hastily out may shatter it.

, This is so the glass won’t slide back in place.


If the glass is shattered, cover the glass with packaging tape to keep it intact.

, Once the edges are released from the adhesive, the glass will be more easier to remove.

, If you notice the glass becomes difficult to lift out, heat the glass again to prevent the adhesive from cooling.


Be careful when removing the glass around the Home button and the capacitive touch buttons.

, Carefully clear any residue with lint-free cloth and isopropyl alcohol.


Do NOT douse the screen with alcohol.

, Be sure not to touch the underside of the glass, as this contains adhesives and will leave hard-to-remove smudges if you touch it.

, Apply gentle pressure along the sides and on the center.

, This is the charging port at the bottom of the iPhone. You'll need a Pentalobe P2 screwdriver to remove them. The size varies slightly depending on the model:


6 and 6 Plus - 3.6 mm Pentalobe
6S and 6S Plus - 3.4 mm Pentalobe

, You'll want a strong suction cup that can help you separate the display from the case.


For the 6S and 6S Plus, place the suction cup in the lower left corner instead of directly above the Home button.

, You just want to create a very small gap between the display and the rest of the shell. Pulling too hard can damage the display, so pull with a firm, constant force.


Hold the rest of the iPhone down with your other hand while you pull the suction cup.

, A spudger is a tool with a flat end, much like a flathead screwdriver. Insert the spudger into the space created, and then gently work the display apart more.


If you're opening the 6S or 6S Plus, insert the spudger into the notch that appears above the headphone jack.
Twist the spudger to help pry the display up from the case.

, Sliding the spudger up the right and left sides of the case while gently twisting it will help pry up the screen.

, Once you've pried the lower portion of the screen from the case, you can swing it up so that the screen is at a 90° angle from the case. You can prop it up on a book or box to keep it in place.



Do not completely remove the screen, or you will damage the connectors, rendering the iPhone inoperable.

, If you're looking at the battery, the connector will be on the left side, about a third of the way from the bottom. The connector is covered by a rectangular piece of metal with two screws.

, Use a small #000 Phillips screwdriver to remove the two screws holding the bracket into place. You'll be able to lift the bracket out, revealing the connector.

, Use your spudger to pop the end of the connector off of the logic board. Be careful when doing so, as removing the entire socket will break the iPhone.

, This bracket can be found in the upper-right corner of the open iPhone. Take the screws out and remove the bracket. Make sure to pay attention to which screws went in which holes.


The iPhone 6, 6 Plus, and 6S Plus have five screws to remove. The iPhone 6S has four.

, This is the large connector at the bottom of the area you revealed when you removed the bracket, with a cable leading to the display. Use the spudger or your fingernail to gently pry the connector from the socket. Be careful not to remove the socket as well.

, There are three other connectors that need to be removed from the same area. One is directly next to the camera cable, and the other two are revealed when you disconnect the camera cable.

, Once the connectors are all removed, you can separate the screen from the rest of the iPhone.

, These adhesive strips help keep the battery in place. You'll find them along the bottom of the battery.

, The adhesive runs along the other side of the battery. Pull it slowly out until you've completely removed it.


One strip will go up the right side of the battery, and another will go up the left.

, Use a hairdryer and blow on the backing of the iPhone for about a minute. This will weaken the rest of the adhesive that is holding the battery in.


Don't hold the hairdryer directly up against your phone or attempt this step on its hottest setting, as too much heat can cause your phone to sustain more damage.

, After removing the adhesive strips, you'll need to use a firm plastic card to pry the battery off of the remaining adhesive. Stick the card in between the left edge of the battery and the side of the case, then gently pry it out.


Make sure that you don't bend the battery while you're prying it, as this can release hazardous chemicals.

, Once your battery has been removed, you can replace it with a new one and put your iPhone back together. Make sure that all of your connectors are firmly reseated in the correct ports, and that you put the screws back in the same holes that they came out of.Perform a hard reset after reassembling by pressing and holding the Home and Power buttons until the Apple logo appears.
For best battery performance, it's recommended that you drain the battery to below 10%, then charge it to 100%.

, Press the suction cup onto the screen, just a bit above the ""Home"" button. Apply enough pressure to form a tight seal.


A tight seal is necessary to hold this front half up as you try to disconnect it from the bottom.

, Lift the suction cup upward with one hand while pulling down on the rear case with your other hand. Once enough of a gap forms, slide a plastic opening tool in between the two halves and pry the rear case away more firmly.

, If you have a 5s, you'll notice a cable leading from your Home button to the bottom of the iPhone. If you separate the two halves too quickly, you'll break this cable, which will make your Home button useless. You'll need to disconnect this cable before proceeding:

Pop the metal bracket holding the cable to your iPhone off with a spudger.
Pry the cable out of the connector, making sure not to remove the socket as well.

, Use the top as a hinge, and rest the screen against a book or a box at a 90° angle so that you can work on the insides without holding it. Don't let it open further, or you may damage the cables connecting it.

, This bracket can be found about an inch up from the bottom of the phone, directly to the right of the battery. Use your screwdriver to remove the screws surrounding the cable bracket. Then, use your fingers to lift the front panel assembly cable bracket from the logic board inside the rear case.

, Use a spudger or your fingernail to pry the connector out of the socket. This connector was protected by the bracket you just removed. Be careful not to pull the socket out with it.

, To make things easier, you can remove the display so that you don't have to keep it propped up. This can help prevent damage to the cables, but is not strictly required to remove the battery:

Pry up the battery connector.,
Lift the battery out.,
Replace your battery and reassemble the iPhone.",How to Remove the Battery from an iPhone4," You can find them on either side of the charging port. The iPhone 4S uses Pentalobe screws, which require a Pentalobe P2 screwdriver. The iPhone 4 may have Pentalobe screws, or it may have #000 Phillips screws.

, Grasp the iPhone in both hands, placing your thumbs on the back plate and your fingers on the screen. Slide the plate upwards to separate it


You will need to apply a good deal of pressure to slide the case up. To minimize the risk of damaging your screen, apply most of the pressure using your thumbs, and focus the pressure toward the bottom or top of the back plate rather than at the center.
The panel will move up about 2 mm.
Once the case slides up, you can open it to the side and lift it off the front assembly completely. If you cannot lift the case off with your fingers, you can use a small suction cup to lift it off.

, Use a #000 Phillips screwdriver to remove the two screws around the battery bracket. This bracket can be found to the left of the battery, at the bottom. These screws hold the battery connector to the logic board.Note that the top screw is shorter than the bottom.
On some iPhone 4 models, there's only one screw you'll need to remove.

, Slide a plastic opening tool beneath the metal connector next to the battery. Lift it up to release it from the logic board.


You should also consider removing the small grounding clip beneath the battery connector before removing the connector itself. You can do this using the same plastic opening tool. If you do not do this, you risk sending the clip flying as you remove the connector.
Work carefully to avoid prying up the socket by accident. You only want to remove the connector.

, Pull the plastic tab from behind the battery to lift it out. You may need to use a stiff credit card to help pry it from the adhesive.


You will need to work carefully. There is an adhesive holding the battery to the rear case, so you will need to use considerable yet directed force to lift it out.
Avoid moving too close toward the top of the iPhone, since this is where your volume button cables are located.

, You can put your new battery in and then reassemble the iPhone. Make sure that all of the connectors have been reattached, and that the screws have gone back in their original holes.After reassembling, perform a hard reset by pressing and holding the Power and Home buttons until the Apple Logo appears.

The two screws are located on either side of the dock connector.

, Place a sturdy suction cup on the screen, just above the ""Home"" button. Once it has a secure hold, lift it straight up with one hand while holding the bottom of your iPhone with the other. The top panel should come right off.


You will need to use considerable force to lift the front panel off using the suction cup. There is a rubber gasket between the front bezel and back assembly, so the two halves are fit together fairly tight.
Rock the suction cup back and forth as you lift to help loosen it.
If necessary, you can also use a plastic opening tool to pry the bottom away from the top as you lift the top off.
Do not remove the front case completely since it is still connected to the bottom by several cables. Instead, lift it up and rotate it so that it rests at a 45 degree angle from the bottom of the phone.

, While holding the front assembly open with one hand, use your other hand to disconnect the black ribbon cables labeled ""1,"" ""2,"" and ""3"" with a plastic opening tool.


Insert the tool from the left. If you pull it up from the right, you could damage the ribbon connector.
Lift cables 1 and 2 up to remove the connectors. Cable 3 will rotate up about 90 degrees.

, Insert a SIM eject tool into the hole next to the headphone jack in your phone. Press down until the SIM card tray pops out, and continue sliding it out with your fingers to remove it.


If you do not have a SIM eject tool, you could also use a paper clip.
Note that you could also remove this tray at the beginning of the process if you find that to be easier or more comfortable for you.

, Slide your plastic opening tool under each connector to pop them up and open.


If you have an iPhone 3GS, there will also be a ribbon cable labeled ""7"" that you need to disconnect.
Take this time to remove the ""Do not remove"" sticker to reveal one of the screws near the bottom of the case.

, There will be eight screws: five 2.3 mm screws, two 2.3 mm screws, and one 2.9 mm screws.


The first five 2.3 mm screws have partial threads and secure the logic board to the rear case.
The second two 2.3 mm screws have fill threads and secure the logic board to the camera.
The 2.9 mm screw was below the ""Do not remove"" sticker.

, Slide the flat tip of the plastic opening tool beneath the camera. Apply slight yet even pressure to pop it up and out.


Note that you can only partially remove the camera. The bottom will still be connected to the logic board.

, Slid the tip of the plastic opening tool beneath the logic board at the dock connector side. Lift the logic board up carefully and slide it out toward the dock connector end of the phone, removing it completely.


There is a small gold tab on the logic board. It's delicate and can break easily, so you need to be extra careful.

, Slide the plastic opening tool beneath the battery. Lift the battery up to remove it.There is an adhesive that holds the battery to the rear case. As a result, you could end up bending the battery or otherwise damaging it if you attempt to remove it without being careful.
You could use the plastic pull tab to remove the battery, but doing so could increase the risk of bending the battery.
If necessary, try gently heating the back of the case with the lowest setting of a hair dryer. This can weaken the adhesive bond, making it easier to remove the battery.
This step completes the process.

Know how to recognize a cell phone fire.,
Isolate the phone immediately.,
Locate a C02 fire extinguisher.,
Spray the phone until the fire is completely extinguished.",How to Put Out a Cell Phone Fire1," Most cell phone fires are caused by what’s known as “thermal runaway” in the lithium-ion battery cell. When this happens, the first thing you’re likely to notice is dense, black smoke accompanied by a distinct burning odor. The battery itself will then ignite, often emitting small white flames or a faint reddish glow.You may also hear a loud popping or sizzling sound as the chemical-infused metals in the battery continue to burn.When a phone catches fire, it can cause the surrounding materials to bubble, melt or even explode, making it very unsafe to be around.
Don’t hesitate to dial emergency services if you have reason to believe that your phone is an immediate hazard.;
, Keep the burning phone far away from other flammable objects. If possible, take it outside or place it on a non-combustible surface like concrete, stone or metal. This will keep the flames from spreading or damaging materials that are vulnerable to heat.If the phone is in your pocket when you detect smoke or a burning smell, don’t attempt to take it out. Instead, remove your pants and shake it free to keep your clothing from catching fire.Do not attempt to grab a burning phone by hand. You could become seriously injured.

, Pull out the pin at the top of the extinguisher. This will break the safety seal and ready the extinguisher for use. Grip the metal handle in one hand and the end of the nozzle in the other. Point the nozzle at the fire and squeeze the handle to activate the C02.Ideally, you should use a Class D fire extinguisher, which is intended specifically to put out fires caused by reactive flammable metals.Substances like ABC dry chemical, powdered copper and graphite or sand can also be used to stifle metal fires, if you happen to have them on hand., Aim for the base of the flames to smother the fire at its source. Sweep the nozzle back and forth over the flames. Keep spraying until you’re certain that the fire has been put out—lithium ion battery fires have been known to spontaneously reignite, even after they appear to have been stopped.Intense heat can cause adjacent battery cells to catch fire, beginning the burning process all over again."

Prevent the fire from spreading.,
Fill a container with cold water.,
Pour the water over the burning phone.,
Repeat as needed until the fire has been stopped.",How to Put Out a Cell Phone Fire2," If your cell phone catches fire and there’s not a C02 extinguisher around, you’ll need to act fast to contain the flames before they get out of hand. Your initial reaction should be to get the phone away from any nearby flammable materials.Keep a safe distance between yourself and the flames to prevent injury.
Clear the area of items like paper and fabrics that may ignite in the event of an unchecked fire.

, Grab whatever you happen to find around you. Anything will work—a glass, pitcher, bowl, bucket, etc.—as long as it can hold a few ounces of water at a time. It’s crucial that the water be as cold as possible to neutralize the fire quickly and completely.Cold water will lower the temperature of the combustible chemicals in the battery cells, halting thermal runaway.
While lithium does react mildly with water, the cooling effect of the water outweighs the chances of a harmful reaction, making it an effective solution in emergency situations.

, Aim the flow of water directly over the battery. Pour slowly and steadily to maximize the contact time between the water and the phone. If the flames have begun spreading to the surrounding area, be sure to address them as well.Place the phone in a sink and leave the faucet running to expose it to a continuous stream.

, Refill the container with fresh water and continue dousing the phone. Keep in mind that the thermal reaction may restart itself if any other intact battery cell grows hot enough to ignite. Once you’ve successfully dealt with the fire, call the fire department and have them dispose of the phone.To be on the safe side, you should saturate the phone a few more times even after the fire has been suppressed.

"
"
Get the phone to a safe spot.,
Let the fire burn out on its own.,
Make sure the phone doesn’t reignite.",How to Put Out a Cell Phone Fire3," The phone should be resting on a non-flammable surface with nothing around that can catch fire. If you can, carefully transport it outdoors, where you can be sure that no damage will come to your property.Place the phone on a sidewalk or other paved area where the flames won’t spread.
Never discard a burning phone without first quickly evaluating your surroundings.

, In most cases, a cell phone battery fire will die out within a few minutes. During this time, you shouldn’t get too close to the phone. If the pressure inside becomes too great, it could explode, sending fragments of glass and hot plastic flying.Caution other onlookers to stay away for their own safety, as well.
You may be able to use a deep pot or similar container with a lid to control the fire. Creating an oxygen-deprived environment will help snuff out the flames., At the first available opportunity, either blast the phone with a CO2 extinguisher or douse it with cold water. The danger may not be over if other battery cells get hot enough to react. Once you’re sure the device is safe, have the fire department come out to remove the faulty device and inspect the area for structural damage.Always follow up fire-related incidents with a call to your local authorities.

Prevent the screen from turning off.,
Put your phone in a re-sealable plastic bag.,
Wrap it in plastic wrap.,
Buy a reliable case for permanent use.",How to Protect Your Phone While You Cook1," One important step to take before you begin cooking is turning off the auto-lock on your phone. This will prevent you from having to fiddle with your phone every time the screen automatically goes black.The specific steps to take to turn off auto-lock with vary from phone to phone. On most, phones, however, you’ll find the option to turn off auto-lock (or to lock the screen in “on” mode) in the “Settings” application.
On Apple devices that operate with iOS, Open the “Settings” app, look in “General,” and find “Auto-Lock”. Select “Never” to keep the screen from going out while you’re trying.
It’s best to make this step temporary, as leaving your screen on permanently will drain your phone’s battery, and may prevent your phone from requiring a passcode to gain access. As such, return the settings to whatever you prefer once you’re done cooking.;
, Believe it or not, one of the best ways to protect your phone while you cook is by using something that’s likely already in your kitchen. Resealable plastic storage bags, such as Ziploc bags, can protect your phone just as well as some of the waterproof bags that are sold specifically to protect phones. Further, they will still allow you to press your phone’s buttons and use its touchscreen.Keep the bag around when you’re done cooking for use next time. Magnet it to the fridge or put it in a drawer with your cooking utensils.
The waterproof bags you can purchase that designed to protect for use are better for things like running in the rain or going kayaking. This is partly because they float, or have lanyard attachments, which are likely features you don’t need in the kitchen.

, If you don’t have an plastic storage bags, you can use plastic wrap instead. Wrap the phone snugly with a few layers, folding initial layers onto themselves before adding the next. Make sure the final layer is sealed well by rubbing it gently all over.The touchscreen will still work with plastic wrap covering your phone, although you won't have access to the headphone jack or charging port. Audio quality from the phone will also be diminished.

, There are many different reliable cases cases available for most phones. If you like to cook with your phone, consider purchasing a case that is waterproof. Often, these cases are also dust-proof and shockproof, meaning your phone will be protected from ingredients like flour or a an accidental drop as well.


It’s a good idea to put a high quality case on your phone, even if you only cook with it occasionally. You can never predict when you may get caught in the rain!
There are too many to list, and recommended cases vary depend on the type of phone you have. LifeProof and OtterBox, for instance, are extremely popular options.
Note that some cases have built-in, fold-out stands that may be helpful if you like to use your phone while cooking.

Empty and rinse a baby shampoo bottle.,
Cut out the holder.,
Size and cut the fabric.,
Apply the fabric to the bottle or holder.,
Allow the holder to dry completely before use.",How to Make a Cell Phone Charger Holder," Or, you can use nearly any bottle that has a wide body. Clean it out completely and make sure that the bottle is dry before moving to the next step.;
, Make one cut on the front of the bottle, halfway down. Only cut out the front of the bottle so that the back remains intact.


Slice off the top of the bottle and round out the top to create an upside down “U” shape.






Add a hole or opening to the middle of the “U.” The hole will allow you to hang the holder from the adapter, so consider using the adapter's shape to guide you in perfecting the size.







, Measure the bottle to determine how much fabric you will need.


Mark the dimensions on the fabric, then cut out the pattern.

, Wrap the holder with the fabric using hot glue. You may need to trim away fabric pieces as you go but wrap the back first, then bring the fabric around to the front and join it underneath the bottle.


Cut the fabric around the hole or opening and add more hot glue to secure it in place.







, Done!

Fasten a temporary stand.,
Use your cabinets to hold your phone.,
Purchase a stand designed for your phone.,
Build your own permanent holder.",How to Protect Your Phone While You Cook2," There are many ways you can fasten or position something to hold your phone upright to help you use it while cooking. Then, you can prop your phone up where you can easily see it. This will limit the amount you have to touch your phone and reduce the risk of dirtying or damaging it.You can likely use something you already have. For instance, you can quickly and easily fashion a stand out of cardboard, a plastic cup, or even paper clips.
Bending a coat hanger into a stand is another great option, as it can be adjusted to hold your phone in different locations.Even while using something to prop your phone up, be sure to set it out of harm's way.

, Aside from touching your phone with dirty hands, another common risk to your phone in the kitchen is spilling. To reduce the likelihood of spilling on or near your phone, avoid placing it on the same surface you're using to cook. For instance, if you're mixing up some batter on the counter, open the cabinet above and set your phone on one of the shelves.


You can even lean your phone against a stack of plates or whatever else in the cabinet to provide easy viewing. Alternatively, you could also grab a box of cereal from the cupboard and set it wherever you're cooking to hold your phone off of the cooking surface.
If you accidentally spill a liquid ingredient on the counter, it won't submerge or seep onto your phone.

, There are likely stands that are designed specifically to hold your phone. One advantage these have is that they often hold your phone off of the surface on which you rest the stand. As such, not only will you be able to easily read from your phone or otherwise use it, it will also be better protected from spills.


If you want to use your phone for audio while cooking, consider purchasing a speaker dock that you can plug your phone into. Some of these are even damage resistant, though they are likely best positioned in a place where they cannot be spilled upon.

, An especially helpful feature in your kitchen may be a custom built holder for your phone. If you tend to work in the same location, think about whether you could mount a small box or other type of holder where you could easily see it.For instance, mount a small box or tray above your cutting board or prep station.
You can easily screw a small plastic box directly into a wooden cabinet for instance. The degree of craftsmanship - and the location - is entirely up to you.

Charge new batteries.,
Use appropriate chargers.,
Avoid frequently over charging.,
Avoid touching metal contacts.,
Avoid using often in high or low temperature environments.,
Avoid long periods without using or recharging.,
Avoid using lithium ion batteries which are hot after being fully charged.",How to Maintain Lithium Battery," It's not necessary to charge over 12 hours when first used. When a device powered by batteries is purchased, sellers will usually tell us the batteries must first be charged 12 hours before using. Actually, this is unnecessary. Unlike common Ni-CD or Ni-MH batteries, most lithium ion batteries are activated before leaving the factory. Due to their low self-discharge, it’s unnecessary to charge lithium ion batteries for such a long time when new. Lithium ion batteries are ready for use when the charger indicates so, and they will reach their best capacity after 3 or 5 cycles.;
, Many people take great care with their electronic gadgets, but often neglect the consequences of bad chargers on their lithium ion batteries. When choosing a charger, the original charger is the best choice. If that's unavailable, a high quality charger that has an overcharge protection function, or a brand name charger will do. A low quality battery charger can lead to shorter run times, premature battery failure, or even fire or explosion.

, Over charging with a low quality charger may let the battery's interior rise to a high temperature, which is bad for the lithium ion battery and charger. Thus, simply fully charging is good enough - overcharging will make your lithium battery into a little bomb if overcharge protection function is missing.

, All batteries' contacts need to be kept clean for best performance. When carrying batteries around, do not let the contacts touch metal objects such as keys; this could cause a short circuit, damaging the battery or potentially resulting in a fire or an explosion.

, Lithium ion batteries have optimal working and storage temperatures. If they're continually used in extreme temperature environments, this will negatively affect battery use time and useful cycles.

, If batteries will be left unused for 3 months or more, partially recharge them (to around 30-70% of capacity, depending on planned storage time), then store the device to prevent battery damage. You may need to take the device out of storage and charge again after a few months.

, Temperatures can be very high when batteries are freshly recharged. If you use them immediately, the electronic gadget’s internal temperature will rise, which may negatively affect the device's electronic components.

Try a different cable if available.,
Check if the cable seems to be twisted with the plastic coating coming off.,
Check if it is a software crash.,
Fix the Lightning connector.,
Check to make sure charger is working.",How to Know if an iPhone Charging Cord is Broken," There is a slight chance the wall socket might not be working. With the same phone and charger, try taking it somewhere else and plug it into a different power outlet. You might also want to check if there is a power switch to the wall socket you are using - sometimes there are switches to these outlets, and it could be turned off.;
, Keeping the charging cord and wall socket the same, try charging a different device. It is rare, but it be that the problem is with the device being unable to charge.

, If you have a different cable for charging, try that to see if it works while keeping the device and wall outlet the same. Since iPhones can be charged from computers, you could also try plugging the cable directly into your Mac in order to take the adaptor out of the equation. If it starts charging, then the problem is most likely with the power adaptor.

, If this is the case, you might want to straighten it out and reinforce it with electric tape. This method is usually temporary and does not make the cable last much longer, but it does give you some time.

, The iPhone's software recognizes the connection to the power outlet. A simple software crash can cause a screen to go blank, making it seem like the phone is dead. Check this by resetting the phone: press the home and power buttons simultaneously until the phone starts up again.

, If you think the Lightning connecter (which is the portion that goes into the iPhone) is the problem, the only way to fix it is to open it. Grab a cutter and a soldering machine.


Take the part of the cable that goes into the phone and slowly and carefully make a cut horizontally to separate the plastic. This needs to be done to expose the board.
Once a cut has been made around the circumference, separate the two parts of the plastic coating to reveal the board inside and the wires connecting to it.
Separate the two sections of wires. Once the board is exposed, there will be two different sections of wires going into the board. One section should be black and red; this is for the power supply. The other section can be various colors, but is most often green and white. Most likely, one or more of these wires have a loose connection with the board. Carefully separate the two sections of wires and straighten them out to identify their terminals.
Use a soldering machine to reattach all the wires to the board. Once all the terminals are exposed, grab a soldering machine and very carefully, one by one, attach each wire back to the board. This is the hardest but most crucial step. This is a very small piece of board and hence harder to work with. Be careful with the soldering iron, as it can get very hot.
Add glue around the wires to insulate it. You might want to add glow to insulate the wires you just attached so they do not touch with each other.
Reattach the two plastic portions that were cut off. Using glue, reattach as precisely as you can the two portions of the plastic that was cut. It is very important to completely cover and insulate the board. Use more glue if needed to be safe but make sure if it completely attached and covered.

, Most likely, if the problem was with the Lightning connecter, it will be fixed now and it should be able to charge a device.

When purchasing a motherboard, remember to buy the same exact model that’s currently installed on your phone to avoid any compatibility issues.

, Slide it or flip it off your phone’s base casing to reveal its back panel.

, Take a screwdriver and remove all the screws that hold the back panel to the phone body. Depending on the make and model of your phone, you’ll either need a Philips or Torx screwdriver.


After removing the back panel, check if there are any screws holding the motherboard in place and remove it first. Normally, the phone’s motherboard should safely come off too, giving you access to the phone’s screen.

, These two are usually just connected using plugin-type connectors. Gently pull off the connectors to release it from each other.

, If you’ve bought the same exact replacement motherboard for your phone, you should see the same plugin-type connectors on the new motherboard, allowing you to easily join it with the screen.

, Make sure that everything’s firmly in place and that no parts, internal or external, are loosely placed.


Shake the phone a little (not too hard!) and check if you can hear some parts rattling. If you do, check the connections inside again and tighten anything that’s not held in place firmly.

Let the screen dry.",How to Clean Your Phone Screen1," This extra-soft, lint-free cloth cleans glass and plastic without scratching the surface. You can buy one at stores that sell computers, phones, or cameras. If you wear eyeglasses, you might have got a free microfiber cloth when you bought your last pair.


The next best substitute is a soft, 100% cotton cloth or T-shirt. Do not use a screen-printed area, or a cloth that has been washed or dried with fabric softener.Do not use paper towels, tissues, or rough cloths. These can scratch away the oleophobic (greaseproof) coating on your screen, or even scratch the glass itself on some models.;
, This makes it easier to see the grime, although navigating to a bright white page might do a better job in a dimly lit room. If you end up needing to use water, always turn your phone off to reduce the chance of a short circuit.

, Rub the dry microfiber cloth across your screen in one direction. This sweeps dust off your screen instead of grinding it in. Use a light touch, since pressing too hard can damage your screen., If your phone screen is still dirty, dampen one corner of the cloth with a little water. Distilled water is ideal, especially if you clean your screen often. Tap water contains minerals that can leave a white residue on your screen.If you can squeeze water out of the cloth, it's too wet. All you want is a lightly damp corner. Spritzing the cloth with a spray bottle is one way to get there.

, Wipe with the damp corner of cloth in the same way, straight across the screen. If there's a stubborn patch of grime, rub in small circles until it breaks down., Gently wipe the screen with the dry part of the microfiber cloth, but don't try to pick up all the excess water if it means pressing hard. Leave the phone in a room with good air circulation to finish air drying before you turn it on."

These can break during the cleaning process and stick onto the lens., Take the microfiber cloth out of its package. Very gently swab the surface of your iPhone's camera lens. Wipe your lens down as long as necessary to remove unwanted stains and fingerprints., It is not necessary to use cleaning products on your iPhone's screen to remove stains. In fact, cleaning products could potentially damage the iPhone screen. Stick to dry microfiber cloths without added water or products to clean your iPhone."

This will prevent the lens from coming into contact with contaminants from surfaces like counters and tables., When you store your phone in your pocket or bag, make sure you keep it away from hazardous objects. Ideally, your phone should be stored alone in your pocket or in its own compartment in your purse or bag. Keep it away from abrasive items, like keys, that could scratch the camera lens., An iPhone case can help protect both your iPhone's screen and camera lens from damage. The Otterbox is the strongest protective case, but the EyePatch case has a movable cover for the camera lens. If you use your camera frequently, the EyePatch may be worth the investment to protect your lens.The one downside to cases is that they can be a little pricey. You can see if you can find one secondhand on sites like eBay or Craigslist.

, When you set your phone down in your home, keep it in clean areas. Store your phone on clean surfaces to avoid contaminants that could dirty the camera lens. For instance, avoid setting your phone down in the bathroom or on a dirty kitchen counter."

Mix equal parts of 70% isopropyl alcohol and distilled water.,
Turn off your phone and take out the battery.,
Rub the cleaner on with a damp, soft cloth.,
Attach a screen protector.,
Restore a smudged screen with an oleophobic coating kit.,
Look into UV C sanitizers.",How to Clean Your Phone Screen2," Many smartphone manufacturers warn you not to use alcohol, since overuse will eventually wear out the oleophobic coating that protects your screen from fingerprints and scratches.That said, diluted alcohol rarely causes issues if you use it once or twice, and there are no good alternatives for heavy-duty cleaning. Most commercial screen-cleaning products are essentially the same as this homemade mixture.


You can substitute white vinegar for the alcohol (and still dilute it in water), but this can also damage the screen coating., Minimize the chance of damage by leaving your phone powered down until it is completely dry.

, A clean microfiber cloth is ideal, but lint-free, 100% cotton will work as well. Lightly dampen a corner of the cloth, then apply across the screen with gentle wipes in the same direction. If the screen is still dirty, rub the dirty areas in small circles. Do not press down hard on the screen.

, Once your screen is clean, consider attaching a screen protector over your phone. If you can't do this immediately after cleaning, pick up dust from your screen first with a clean sticky note, weak tape, or other mild adhesive.


If you can't use your touchscreen while wearing gloves, some screen protectors will block the touch technology as well. Ask a store employee for a screen protector that works with your model of phone (or with capacitive screens).

, If a small drop of water forms a ball on your screen, the protective coating is still intact. If it smears across your screen, the coating is damaged (or you never had one to begin with). You can buy an oleophobic coating kit to re-apply this coating to your phone screen, following the kit instructions. This won't last as long as the factory-applied version, but one kit might be enough for several applications.Typically, you need to apply this product with a tissue. Spread it across the screen quickly, since it evaporates within a few seconds. Once the whole screen is coated, you may need to let it dry for several hours, then buff out excess streaky material using a microfiber cloth.

, Short for ""Ultraviolet type C,"" these devices kill bacteria on your phone surface by bathing them in ultraviolet light. This will not remove grime from your screen, but it may be the only way to sanitize it without risk of damaging your phone. Sanitizers designed for phones have only reached the market in the past few years, so expect them to get cheaper over time.

Pay attention as to where you place your phone.,
Be careful where you use the phone.,
Stay off the toilet when using your phone.,
Put a durable and non-slip cover over the phone.,
Train yourself to get into the good habit of putting the phone back after each call.,
Recharge the phone in a safe and secure spot.",How to Avoid Dropping Your Phone," Put it down on a solid surface away from edges, away from liquids and foods and away from curious kids and pets. The placement of the phone is one key way to ensure that it won't get knocked onto the floor from a height or end up dropping it into something on the surface that it shouldn't be put in, such as food or drink.;
, If you're distracted and trying to do two things at once, there is a greater chance that you'll drop the phone to keep doing the other task. For example, driving while talking on the phone (illegal in many places) reduces your attention span greatly, and makes it easier for you to drop the phone to hold the steering wheel or pay attention to the road. You might even be unfortunate enough to drop the phone into your cup of coffee...

, Not only is it a sign of disrespect to the caller on the end to be doing your business while talking on the phone but there is an increased risk of dropping the phone into the toilet. Just gross.


Same goes for taking a bath, just don't bathe and phone.

, A non-slip cover helps you to keep good hold of your phone, even during temperature extremes. Moreover, should the phone be dropped accidentally, the cover serves as a form of protection for the phone.

, Whether it goes back into a pocket, a bag or somewhere else, do this without fail each time. Don't hold onto it or put it in a different place than its usual storage spot. In this way, you'll be less likely to drop it and more likely to rely on muscle memory to slip it back into its safe holding place.

, Any person, animal or object that could cause the phone to fall by knocking, swiping, pulling or bumping against must be accounted for when selecting the charging spot at home and in the office. Place the recharging device well away from areas where people walk by, away from piles of paper and away from curious kids and pets. Also be sure to keep the cord tucked away tidily, so that it can't be pulled or tripped over, potentially dragging your phone down.

With a smartphone, avoid using moving or animated pictures or videos for your background.",How to Make Your Cell Phone Battery Last Longer1," Only do this if it's going to be for several hours; turning a phone on/off actually uses a massive amount of power itself. This will probably be the most effective and simple way of conserving your battery’s power. Why? This will help conserve energy and also charge your phone. If you don't plan on answering the phone while you're sleeping or after business hours, just turn it off. Do the same if you are in an area with no reception (such as a subway or remote area, since constantly searching for service depletes the battery fairly quickly).


Some phones have an automatic power save feature, but it takes about 30 minutes with no service to kick in. By then, much battery power has been used. If you are using a smartphone and have no reception, disable the phone functionality (flight/airplane mode).;
, When you are in an area with poor or no signal, your phone will constantly look for a better connection, and will use up all your power doing so. This is easily understood if you have ever forgotten to turn off your phone on a flight. The best way to ensure longer battery life is to make sure you have a great signal where you use your phone. If you don't have a perfect signal, get a cell phone repeater which will amplify the signal to provide near perfect reception anywhere or simply turn on flight (airplane) mode (as said previously).

, Avoid letting your cell phone's battery run all the way down. Unlike nickel-based batteries (such as the NiCd or NiMH rechargeable AA batteries seen in most supermarkets), lithium-based batteries are designed to be charged early and often, and letting them get too low can damage the battery. With lithium-based batteries, doing shallow discharges and frequent charging prolongs battery life.

, Use just the ring tone. The vibrate function uses additional battery power. Keep the ring tone volume as low as possible.

, The back light is what makes the phone easier to read in bright light or outside. However, the light also uses battery power. If you can get by without it, your battery will last longer. If you have to use the back light, many phones will let you set the amount of time to leave the back light on. Shorten that amount of time. Usually, one or two seconds will be sufficient. Some phones have an ambient light sensor, which can turn off the back light in bright conditions and enable it in darker ones.

, If you know it will be a while before your phone’s next charge, don’t use the camera or connect to the Internet. Flash photography can drain your battery especially quickly.

, This is obvious, but how many times have you heard someone on their mobile phone say, ""I think my battery’s dying,"" and then continue their conversation for several minutes? Sometimes, the dying battery is just an excuse to get off the phone (and a good one, at that), but if you really need to conserve the battery, limit your talk time.

, It will drain your battery very quickly. Only turn Bluetooth on when needed.

, Keep them off except when you need them.

,, Use 3G (HSPA, HSPA+, UMTS) or 2G (GSM) rather than 4G (LTE). Using your phone in 4G will drain the battery quicker than if you just use 3G or 2G. Turn 4G (LTE) off when there is weak to no 4G signal in your area. When using 4G, both the 3G and 4G radios are turned on therefore it will use a lot of power. You may also turn off 3G and use 2G if there is weak to no 3G., Animated backgrounds will drain the battery faster.


Use a black background whenever possible. AMOLED screens use a lot less power displaying black instead of white .

Keep it with you all times.",How to Care for Your Mobile Device1," Buying a case is probably one of the first things you can do after purchasing any smartphone. Get a case that suits and feels comfortable in your hand. You are not recommended to buy cases that are bulky. Try to buy a case that is not only stylish but also can provide best protection against any damage.;
, Screen protector is another important thing you can consider for your smart phone. Screen Protectors will protect your phone's screen from being scratched. Sometimes a case already may have a built in screen protector (e.g. OtterBox).

, Accidents may happen anytime. So, don't be surprised if you drop your phone once in a while in your lifetime. As long as you have a case that's durable enough you are at safe side. You should be careful to avoid dropping your device. If your hands are full or you are late to work its best to put your phone in your bag or keep in your pocket.

, Be careful with any accidental drop of water on your phone. Be careful when you take your tea or coffee. If accidentally some water drops on it, quickly remove the battery, clean the water and leave it for an hour to get it dry before you put the battery again.

, Apple recommends that you do a full charge cycle once a month. This means charging it to 100% and then letting it die to 0%. Doing this will make your battery live a durable and healthy life.

,  Keeping your iPhone/Android smartphone screen clean will make your phone look great. Clean your device once in a while with a soft cloth. Don't use tissue paper or anything else but a soft cloth, otherwise there is high risk of scratching specially on screen.

, Keep your phone with you all times. Avoid leaving it in a store as someone may try to steal it and run off with it. Make sure to use FindMyIPhone or any equivalent feature/program if your device is stolen. Android users you can use Lookout to find your stolen/lost android device.

Ignore the phone telling you that the battery is full—this is normal but is not accurate if the battery is not initialized.

, Unlike Ni-Cd batteries, lithium-ion batteries' life is shortened every time you fully discharge them. Instead, charge them when the battery meter shows one bar left. Lithium-ion batteries, like most rechargeable batteries, have a set number of charges in them.

, Put the battery in the fridge. Your battery will last longest if used near room temperature, and nothing wears on a battery like extended exposure to high temperatures. While you can’t control the weather, you can avoid leaving your phone in a hot car or in direct sunlight, and you don’t have to carry your phone in your pocket, where your body heat will raise its temperature. In addition, check the battery while it’s charging. If it seems excessively hot, your charger may be malfunctioning.

, Most newer cell phones have lithium-ion batteries, while older ones generally have nickel-based batteries. Read the label on the back of the battery or in the technical specifications in the manual to determine which yours is.


Nickel-based batteries (either NiCd or NiMH) don't generally suffer from a misunderstood phenomenon known as the ""memory effect."" As described in Wikipedia and many expert sources,the term ""memory effect"" has been widely mythologized to describe any and all deterioration of NiCd (and other battery chemical processes), in many cases misleading consumers into further shortening the lives of the batteries through over-discharging to ""recondition"" them.Lithium ion batteries can be preserved by careful charging and storing them at a partial charge. They do not require ""reconditioning.""
Regardless of the battery type, use only a charger rated for your battery, and discontinue use of a charger that causes the battery to heat up excessively.

, If your battery will be out of use for a while, disconnect it from the phone and store it in a cool and dry but not freezing place (an airtight container in a refrigerator, but not a freezer). Don't keep it with metal objects that might move around and short-circuit the terminals. Lithium ion batteries are not rated to operate at refrigerated temperatures, so let the battery sit outside the refrigerator for at least an hour before using it again. Lithium ion batteries oxidize least when they are stored at 40% charge. Never store a lithium battery at low voltage. Recharge batteries after storage.

, Over time, contacts may accumulate dirt which reduce the efficiency of energy transfer. Clean them with a cotton swab and rubbing or isopropyl alcohol. If the contacts are two different metals, such as gold and tin, accelerated corrosion known as ""galvanic or bi-metallic"" occurs. Cutting the corrosion from the contacts often requires solvents, such as acetone or nail polish remover. Be careful: these solvent dissolve plastic, so use a Q-Tip to avoid damaging the battery housing or the phone.

Know how to avoid battery failure:


The usable time after recharging is shortened.",How to Make Your Cell Phone Battery Last Longer3,"
The battery becomes unusually warm during a recharge cycle.
The battery becomes unusually warm during phone use.
The battery case may become swollen. This is detectable by feeling and viewing the inside/phone-side of the battery case. Also, when the battery is placed inside/phone-side down on a flat, smooth surface, it will rock and will sustain a spin motion. The case of a healthy battery is flat, and the battery will not a spin easily.
The battery develops a hard spot. This is detectable on the inside/phone-side surface of the battery by gently pinching about the surface between one's fingers.

Keep it in your locker at all times if you can.,
Keep it in your pocket or backpack.,
Don't pull it out in class.,
Don't flaunt it.",How to Care for Your Mobile Device2," The locker is probably one of the most safe ways of protecting your smart phone at school (middle schoolers or high schoolers only).

, Another safe way is putting your phone away in your backpack. This is probably the most recommend thing you should do.

, Using it in class just invites confiscation, and if it's confiscated, you can't guarantee that your teacher will treat it with the same care you would.

, The more you show off your new device, the more likely it is that someone will observe it and try to take it. Even if you're not concerned about theft, it's also a good idea to be discrete to avoid an acquaintance grabbing it from you or asking to see it and then dropping it. If you really want to care for your device, keep hold of it yourself, and use it only discretely and in appropriate settings.

, In order to edit it in Audacity, it will need to be in MP3 format. If it is not MP3 format, you can convert it using a variety of free online music converters. Simply upload the file and select MP3 as the output format.

, When the MP3 loads, you will see the waveform graph of the audio. You can press the Play button to listen to the song, and the marker will show where in the song you are.





, Use your mouse to highlight the segment that you want to convert. You can press the Play button to ensure that the start and end sound good and don’t cut off too abruptly.






Keep your segment under 30 seconds, or certain phones may not support it.

, Once you are satisfied with your selection, click File and then click “Export Selection”. Choose MP3 as the format and give the file a name. You will need to load the LAME file that you downloaded earlier.





, For Android, connect the phone to your computer via USB and place the ringtone in the /media/audio/ringtones/ folder. For iPhones, adding the file is a multi-step process:


First, add the clip to your iTunes library. Right-click on it and select “Create AAC version”. This is will create a new file with the M4A extension.
Right-click on the new file and select View in Finder or Show in Windows Explorer. This will open the folder that contains the file. Rename the file so that it has the M4R extension instead of M4A.
Drag the newly-renamed file back into iTunes, this time into your Ringtones library. The file will be added to your iPhone the next time that you sync.

, Ringtones can be a maximum of 30 seconds in length, so choose a part of the song you think would work best as a ringtone in that period of time. You’ll need to write down or remember the starting and stopping time of your new ringtone. To do this:


As your song plays, look at the moving slider at the top right side of the screen. The left side of the moving slider shows how many seconds have elapsed as the song plays. Remember (or write down) the time when your ringtone should start. You can move the slider around with your mouse to test different periods of time within an audio file.
From the starting point, keep listening and write down the time listed when the tone should end. Keep the 30-second maximum ringtone time in mind—if you want the tone to start at 1:30 (1 minute and 30 seconds) into the song, the end time can be no later than 2:00.

, This process is slightly different between Windows and Mac.

Mac: Ctrl + click to access the “Get Info” menu.







, Type the Start and Stop times (in minutes and seconds, like 1:30) in the corresponding blanks, then click “OK.”

Mac: Click once (don’t double-click) on the file and erase the .m4a from the end of its name. Type .m4r at the end and press ↵ Enter to save. On the pop-up confirmation screen, click “Use .m4r” to confirm your change.

, Don’t worry, you still have the copy on the desktop. In iTunes, right-click or Ctrl + click the short song and select “Delete.” Depending on your operating system, iTunes will ask if you’d like to move the file to the Trash or Recycle Bin. Click “Yes.”

, This will add the file back to iTunes, but as a ringtone. Ringtones are stored in the Tones library, which is accessed by clicking the icon with the three dots (…) at the top left corner of iTunes, then selecting “Tones.” Click the music note icon to return to the music library to proceed.

, Click OK to save.

, If you no longer want to see file extensions at the ends of your filenames (for example, you would rather see songname.m4r be just songname, go back to your file extensions settings and remove the settings you changed earlier.

, If your iPhone is configured to sync your library when connected to your computer, wait until that sync is finished before proceeding. If your iPhone was already connected to the computer, that’s okay too.

,, Drag and drop the file right onto the iPhone icon on the left side of the screen. iTunes will sync the ringtone to your phone.

, Tap “Sounds,” then “Ringtone” to see a list of all ringtones on your phone. The newest ringtone will show up at the top of the list. Tap its name to set it as the default ringer.

Install RSD Lite and the drivers, then reboot your computer;
, Android root developer MotoCache1 has released a couple of essential files that you will need to download in order to successfully root. You will need the SPRecovery SBF and the “complete root” update file.


Rename the Complete Root file to “update.zip”. If you don’t see the “.zip” extension in the original file name, then just rename it to “update”.

, Open the Settings menu and select Applications. From the Applications menu, select Development. Check the box next to USB debugging.

, Open the SBF file with a file extractor. Extract all of the files into a new folder that you can easily access.

, Once your phone is connected, power it down completely. Slide the keyboard out and press and hold the Up button on the keyboard (if you are holding your phone vertically, the Up button will be pointing to the right). While holding the Up button, power on the phone.

, Once Framaroot has been installed, click on the icon in your App Drawer to run the program. You will be presented with a drop down menu and a selection of exploits. Most users will want to install Superuser on their rooted phone, so make sure that it is selected in the dropdown menu.

, There will be a couple of exploit choices in Framaroot. Try each one to find one that works. Because systems are patched to fix exploits, what worked before may not work in the near future.


There is no negative effect to trying an exploit that does not work. Try them all until you find one that works. You may have to try the exploit multiple times in order to get it to install.

, The one-click root process can be very quick. Your phone may reboot during the root. Verify that it worked by browsing for the Superuser app.

Understand the process.,
Make the ringtone.,
That's a lot of words, but it's necessary to explain the process to everyone.,
Connect your phone.,
Copy the ringtone to your phone's memory card.,
You've now made a ringtone (or ringtones) and put them on your phone.,
Move the ringtone to the phone.

,
Remember when you plugged your phone in and it said files on the memory card will not be available?,
You now have a ringtone that you have made yourself.,
Optionally, make it a global ringtone.,
Optionally, set it for just one Contact.,
Congratulations, you're off to making your own ringtones for free.

",How to Make Your Own Ringtones for a Motorola Phone," A ringtone is nothing more than a short audio file in .mp3 format. You will hear it when your phone rings; your contact will just hear the usual rings. Once your caller has heard four of these rings, they will disconnect from your phone and connect to your voicemail. Once they have connected to your voicemail, the call is missed and the ringtone stops. Call yourself and time this. Any ringtone longer than that time is too long. It will work but you will not hear anything after that max time.;
,


First, download Audacity. This is a free audio editing program that is quite easy to use. Other programs can do what Audacity will do, but Audacity is free, easy, and it's available on Mac and Linux, so should you choose to leave Windows, this process will still work for you.
Unpack Audacity to a location that is convenient for you. On Windows, C:\Program Files\Audacity is convenient and common. If it helps, then make a shortcut to your desktop (right click audacity.exe and choose ""Send To"">""Desktop (create shortcut)"".
Open Audacity.
Find the .mp3 file for the audio file you want to make into a ringtone. Drop the file on Audacity, anywhere on the window. Wait a few seconds for it to analyze the song.
You are now looking at the waveform for your song. Find the zoom icon (magnifying glass with a plus). Zoom in a couple steps. If you are not familiar with Audacity, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the interface.
Play the song and find the beginning of the part of the song you want. The zoom should let you see at least 45 seconds of the song.
Click before a ""peak"" and hit Play. Is this an acceptable start to your ringtone? If not, hit Stop (important!) and then move the start point by clicking elsewhere (close by). Repeat this until you have found the perfect start. (Later, when showing off your ringtone that YOU made, the start will grab your friends and make you look great.)
Easy way to finish it: Down below you'll see three boxes with hours, minutes, and seconds. In the middle one, put in 30 seconds. Be sure above it, it says Length.
Hard way to finish it: Do the same as above but put in 35 seconds. Now hit play. The 35 seconds will play. Pay VERY special attention to the end. Look for where it should end, any time after 25 seconds in but perhaps closer to 30 seconds depending on your network/provider. A good ending is NOT as important as a good start, but it's OK for showing off or if your mates are watching your phone as you ignore it. Use the mouse buttons to adjust the ending.
Play the segment using the Play button to ensure this is what you want. If not, repeat above steps. If so, read on.
From the File menu choose Export Selection.
You'll be asked to edit the metadata. Artist, album, stuff like that. Ringtones don't need this, so hit Clear, then OK.
Now you're looking at a mostly common Save box. But first click Options in the lower left corner. Set the options as follows: Constant, 96kbps, Stereo.
Find a folder to save to. You should keep your custom ringtones on your PC and then transfer them later. This way you can delete the ringtone to make space, and then get it back later. Hit Save.
If this is your first time saving a .mp3 file, Audacity will politely inform you that it can't find the .mp3 encoder. Don't bother; you probably haven't got it. Just hit Download. This will take you to a web site. Depending on your OS (Windows, if you don't know) follow the given instructions. You'll end up downloading a ~375KB .DLL file to your Audacity directory which will expand its resources to allow it to write to the .mp3 format.
Repeat as necessary for as many ringtones as you would like to make.

, And it's by far the hardest, most technical part.

,


First, go into your phone's menu (usually the center button).
Go to Settings.
Go to Connections.
Go to USB Settings.
Press your Center/Enter button and arrows to change the ""Default"" option to ""USB Drive"". Your phone will now appear to your computer as a removable hard drive with the size of your phone's Micro SD card.
Connect the USB cable to the computer and to the phone. The order does not matter.
If done right (and wait for this), your phone will say ""Connected as USB Drive. Files on Memory Card are not available now.""
If you're using Windows and it's configured correctly, Windows will first ""install"" a ""new (or unknown) USB device"". Once it's done, your phone will be recognized as a removable hard drive, and Windows will ask you what to do with it. Click View Files and Folders.

,


In your phone's root folder, open the Motorola folder.
Open the Shared folder.
Open the Ringtone folder.
Browse to where you saved that ringtone(s) you just made.
Click on the ringtone, or if there is more than one, highlight them.
Use the right button to drag the file(s) to the Ringtone directory. Release it. Choose Copy.

, But you're not quite there yet. The ringtone is only on the memory card, and that's not good enough for a Motorola phone. Motorola requires that the ringtone be stored in its internal memory. Read on...

,, You now need to unplug your phone at either end of the cable. Once the connection is broken, phone and memory card can communicate again. The memory card can only have one master at a time - computer or phone.


Find your ringtone. Hit the Center/Menu button. Go to Media Gallery. Go to Sounds.
Use the arrows to find the file. If you have a lot of files, start typing the name of the file as if you were writing a text message (without dictionary mode). Usually you will only need to type the first letter or two.
Notice the memory card icon to the right of the file. That means it's stored on the memory card.
Click Options, usually Left Shoulder Button.
Go down to Manage; hit Right.
Go down to Move; hit Enter.
Choose where to move the file to. Choose Phone and hit Enter.
Repeat for any ringtones you have made.

, But it's not assigned anywhere.

,


From your home screen, click Center/Menu.
Choose Ring Styles.
Change your ring style to either Loud or Soft.
Choose (Loud Detail or Soft Detail).
Go down to Calls. Hit the Center/Enter button, scroll down, find your new ringtone, and hit Center/Enter.

,


Open the Contacts menu.
Find the contact you want to assign the ringtone to. The ringtone will be applied to all phone numbers associated with that contact (home, cell, work, etc.).
Click Options.

After you have experimented with the new materials and probably set up a few lamps by adding an Emission shader to a mesh (most likely a plain out of the camera-sight) you can tweaking the render-settings:


The only new setting is ether ""Interior"" or ""Sampling"" and ""Light Paths"" depending on the version of Blender you use






""Samples:Render:"" is the number on which the render time depends most.",How to Choose the Right Render and Material Settings in Cycles Render (Blender),",


If this is an old .blend you might already have assigned materials and want to click on ""use nodes"" in the material settings






Otherwise add a new material






Now things are getting a bit confusing because of the number of different combinations. The best way to get used to this system would be to memorize which shade gives which effect and mixing & optimizing them by textures and Mix - nodes (which you should know from the compositor)., On 0 it will render until Esc is pressed






""Bounces min/max"", ""Transparency min/max"", ""Diffuse"", ""Glossy""... are for the tuning  if the result is still very noisy it might have something to do with all the Glossy materials you set up in the scene and might get better if you adjust these values






""Performance/Acceleration structure"" has some settings which are essential for animations like ""cache BVH""

Begin by downloading a free copy of the software.,
Follow the instructions.,
Open the program.,
Get to know a few basics to help you navigate around the program:


The first thing you have to know about SketchUp is that it has 10 simple tools that are all useful for making a model.,
Draw some lines.,
Draw some shapes.,
Move to creating three-dimensional objects.,
Learn to use panning and orbiting.,
Move and rotate objects.,
Colour or paint the object.,
Learn the zooming ability.,
Check out the pre-built models in SketchUp.,
Learn to use construction guides.,
Learn about the more advanced tools on SketchUp once you're comfortable with the standard tools outlined above.,
Try building something in SketchUp.",How to Use SketchUp," Once it has been downloaded, open the .EXE file;
, Depending on your computer type, these instructions for installation may vary so read closely.

, You'll see there is a set of three axes provided immediately, so you get the 3D feel at the outset. Have a look at the tools available. There is a Line tool, a Circle tool and a Polygon tool. Each of these presents you with various possible options to create your desired shapes.

, The first groups of tools are the orbit, pan, and zoom tools. These are used for you to move around and get different views of your subject and are briefly explained in this overview article.
To move the whole viewing screen, push the centre mouse button and hold down the Shift key on your keyboard.
To delete, click the arrow button on the toolbar; when something is selected to delete it will turn blue. Hit the delete key on your keyboard.
To save something, click on ""file"" (in the upper left corner) then click on ""Save As"". Choose where to save the file. Type the name of your file and click on Save. The file will be saved as a .SKP file

, The line tool is selected by default when you first open SketchUp. Obviously, this is for drawing lines. Give it a try to see what you can create and just to get a feel for the lines but be aware they're one-dimensional so you won't be able to snap to axes, etc.


See How to be precise when using SketchUp.

, Beyond lines, you can draw two-dimensional shapes using the tools for shapes. Draw some rectangles, circles and polygons just to try them out. All you need to do is to click on the corresponding tool.


Given that you're working with a 3D program, you'll find the 2D figure is horizontal. In addition, if there is an underlying surface, the 2D shape will be snapped to it.
See How to make a sphere in SketchUp, How to make a half sphere in SketchUp and How to make a cube on SketchUp.

, The way that you do this is by ""pushing"" or ""pulling"" a 2D shape into a 3D shape. Use the Push/Pull tool over the 2D shapes you've created and start seeing what happens.


Select the Push/Pull tool:
Press the mouse button on the shape you want to push or pull into three-dimensional form.
Click then push or pull the shape as desired. Click again.
Enlarge the object as much as wanted. Add more structure.
Play around with adding holes, windows or other elements by cutting out shapes within the 3D shape.

, The need to see the created objects from different perspectives is an important part of any 3D program and SketchUp allows for this. The pan tool lets you move the drawing left or right and up or down. It also allows you to do a combination of these actions. The orbit tool allows you to orbit around the object you've created. This changing perspective can let you see the entire object from any angle.


Use the centre scroll button on your mouse to orbit around your image. You can also orbit by clicking the 'Orbit' button on the top toolbar (it has two red arrows on it).

, This is self-evident but is clearly useful as it lets you change the position of any objects you've created. Have a try using the Move and Rotate tools to see if you can move the objects around to a different position.


see How to use the rotate tool in SketchUp and How to flip an object using SketchUp for more details.

, When a shape has been completed it will turn a different colour, usually a grey-blue. Shapes must be completed to colour them in. Using the Paint tool, the objects can be painted in solid colours or in textures. With the textures, SketchUp will align the textures to the surfaces for you, making it a fun and useful experience.


To add colour, click on the paint bucket. Choose one of the categories such as Ground Cover or Named-Colours. Select a colour/texture and then click the area of the shape that you would like to shade in.
To make windows, go to Translucent.
Use the eraser to take away any unwanted edges.
See How to add custom textures to SketchUp for more details.

, This tool lets you zoom in and out on the shapes you're creating. Use the Zoom tool to show more detail. If you have a mouse wheel, you'll discover that scrolling one way will zoom in and scrolling the other will zoom out.

, There are dozens of these available to you and if there is one to suit your needs, it'll stop you from having to reinvent it. The 3D warehouse offers objects in the areas of architecture, landscape, construction, people, a playground, and transportation. It's a good idea to look through the component library to see if it has objects you'd like to play around with.

, SketchUp enables you to position construction guides anywhere within a drawing. Once there, they can be used to align the object. These are the dotted lines and they make it easier to line up objects.

, The more advanced tools in SketchUp are the resizing tool, the uniform tool, the curve tool, the follow me tool, the text tool, the angle tool, and the measuring tape tool.



The resizing tool: This is used by selecting an object, and dragging the little boxes on the corners and faces to make it any size you want, including wide, tall, short or squat.

The follow-me tool: This allows you to move an object along a specified path, thereby creating a new object. To learn more, see the articles in the Follow-Me tool category.

The uniform tool: If clicked on a face, this will make another face just like the one you click. You can make the face smaller or bigger, depending on how far you drag the cursor.

The curve tool: This is used just like the line tool except if you create a line and drag it to the side, it will create a curved line.

The text tool: This will allow you to add text to your model by putting it on a face.

The angle tool will allow you to rotate an object by clicking on a face and pivoting your cursor.

The measuring tape tool: This can be used to measure an object, and create even sections by typing it in the measurement box on the bottom right side of your screen.

Select the entity, start to move, press CTRL and move a distance away.,
If you want to make a 'field' of your entities, select them and do it again.",How to Copy and Create Arrays in SketchUp2," That is because you will be creating a space for the array to fill.

, Once you have it there, type in the number of total copies you want. In this instance, 4/ to create a total of 5 doghouses.


4/ and then Enter

If it doesn't look right and you haven't done anything else, you can type in another number and it will change.



, In the screenshot at the beginning of the article, 3/ and Enter was pressed to get all of the doghouses.

Decide upon the curved surface that you want to use.,
Create a rectangle directly in front of the curved edge.,
Select the face of the shape you just created and go to File >> Import.,
Map the two leftmost points of the logo to the rectangle that you created before.,
With the logo still selected, right click and select Texture >> Position.

,
Take a look at the result and see where you want it to be and if you can position it correctly.,
Start moving the image around to see if you can get it to look correct.,
Using the four 'pins' that you see, match them to the four corners of the rectangle.,
Look at your image and see how it measures up at this point.

,
Click on the logo, right click, go to Texture >> Projected.

,
Click on the Paint Bucket tool.",How to Map an Image to a Curved Surface in SketchUp," The image here shows a curved design that this article will be using by way of an example.;
, This is achieved by doing the following:    

Use the pencil tool to draw out from the bottom left edge of the original shape.






Using inference, draw the curved edge to exactly match the base rectangle shape that you'll be mapping.







, Find the logo that you want to paste and import it. Be sure to import it as a texture - the texture will be at the tip of your mouse.

, Then it will 'fasten' itself to it.

,, You might be happy with the two logos as shown here or may need to do what you can to change it to what you'd prefer.

, Obviously, in this case, the logo is too small and will tile no matter what you do.

, When done, right click and select 'Done'.

,,,

Click on the eyedropper icon in the tool and then use it to sample your logo. This will make that your active texture.






Using the paint bucket tool, paint the texture onto the curved surface.

The interface will have a set of tools in the top side and the main view in the middle. The main view contains a space with three different axes and a human figure for scale. You can always delete the human figure by selecting it and pressing “Delete.”





;
, The cursor will change into a circular pointer.

, Click the “Camera” menu and select “Standard Views”. Click “Top” to get a two-dimension view of the model from above.

, Do this by right-clicking the mouse and drawing it along the diameter. A good stadium model will be around 20-30m in diameter. Select “Scale” from the toolbar, then grab and drag a point on the circle to distort it into an ellipse.


You can also keep it as a circle to create a circular stadium instead.

, The Offset tool contains two arches and an arrow as an icon.

, Start in the center of the existing circle and create a new circle to define the floor area of the stadium. The distance between the outer and inner circle act as walls.

, After creating the walls, make more circles using the same Offset tool for seating. Each circle will act as a row of seating.

, The button looks like a 3D rectangle with an arrow coming out of the top.

, Click drag the mouse upwards along the blue axis of the gap. This will raise the walls of the stadium.

, Once you’re done with the outer walls, pull the different distances between circles, descending down towards the center. Each row towards the center should be lower than the one behind it.

, Click the “Camera” menu and select “Standard Views”. Select “Front.” to view the front of the model in two dimensions.

, Select “Circle” from the toolbar at the top, and draw a circle right on the façade of the stadium where you want the door.

Color the face more finely.",How to Color Line Art With ArtWeaver," Either do it on the computer or draw it by hand and scan it into your computer.;
,,, Click on Image >> Adjustments >> Threshold. Set the threshold to about 150 or 160. If you scroll up closer, you will see that your image is pixelated.


Look at your image closely and make sure there are no gaps in the lines. Otherwise, your fill will bleed where you don't want it to. MS Paint is a free program that you can use for doing this.

, Then choose either foreground or gradient; whichever suits your purpose.


If you are using the gradient, be sure that it is set for the two point option.

,, Be sure that you have completed all that you want done with one color before you use another one.


Keep MS Paint (or whatever program you used) handy, because it is highly likely you missed some gaps.

, While painting, zoom out to make sure that you have gotten all the parts that you want with any color. You may find it hard to go back to a certain color if you mind you missed a spot.

, To give it a little more realism, you might want to use the gradient option more than the foreground option. Nothing in real life is just one color.


Do not color the lips at this point. They will be covered later.
Be patient, for this is a tedious process. You will be zooming in and out to make sure you haven't missed anything and will probably find that you keep on missing things.

, You will definitely want to use a gradient for the background. You will probably want it to be more obvious than with the rest of the image as well.

, Remember that, usually, women have darker lips than men. Find the appropriate color and fill in the lips.

, Make sure that the Brush is in Covered Edges 15 and that it is a suitable size for the lips. That would be 5-8 depending on your drawing.


The bottom lip should be slightly darker than the top lip.

, That would be adding the eyeshadow and cheek color. A good color for the blush is the same shade as the top lip. The size of the brush should be about 15 - 20.

You may also call 844-665-6327 if you are unable to use your Sprint phone.

, Once you’ve reached the customer service department, tell the representative that you want to disconnect your Sprint phone.


The representative will then assist you with the process, beginning with asking verifying your identity with personal information.

, Terminating the service is free (as long as you’re out of the contract), but you’ll be billed for the remaining airtime used between the last billing date and the date you requested disconnection.


Provide credit card or bank information to pay this balance.
If you have any remaining account deposit, the interest will also be credited to your account.

, Before you can disconnect your service, you need to settle any remaining account balance you have. Pay the balance or penalties using the credit card or bank account you provided in step 5.

, After you request your account to be disconnected, you need to wait for your request to be approved. Your Sprint phone will get disconnected between 24 and 72 hours.


In some cases, a service can be disconnected at the end of the same business day.

Pattern Feature

Activate “Hole.1” and select the “Rectangular Pattern” command in purple.,
Final Product: Test Plate Fixture.",How to Design a Test Fixture Plate Using Catia V5 Software,"

Begin a new part design from the start menu.
Upon selecting this, a 3-D environment will appear. From the tools on the right, select new sketch and apply it to the x-y plane as shown.



 

;
,

Draw a 610 mm x 610 mm square.
Fully constrain the geometry by adding defined dimensions. The sketch will turn green after you fully constrain the sketch. (Don't forget to add vertical and horizontal constraints to your sketch, in order to define the shape!)
Select the “Exit Sketch” icon located at the top of the right tool bar.







,

The Pad feature will allow you to add thickness to your sketch, giving you a 3-D part. When the dialog box appears, input the desired thickness required for your plate, along with the direction in which you would like to expand.







, After selecting the top surface of the plate, you will see another dialog box. (Do not use the pocket command with this application. It will cause trouble with threading.)
Enter the desired diameter and depth of the hole that you would like to form. In this case, select ""Up to Last.""
After defining these parameters, select “Positioning Sketch” in the dialog box. Doing this, your hole will be represented by a white star. Dimension this star as it is the center of your hole.
After you define the position of the hole, select “Exit Workbench.” This will bring back your dialog box.
Because this is a fixture plate, we need these holes to be threaded. Select the tab “Thread Definition” and check the box “Threaded”. This will give you access to different thread types. Select the desired thread which correlates with the drilled hole size that has already been defined. (You can find a reference sheet online that contains different types of threads, dependent on your application.)







, Selecting this command will provide another dialog box with instructions for two directions.
In the first direction tab, indicate the number of holes that you would like to form under “Instances.”
Next you can define the spacing between each hole.
Finally, select the “Reference Element” box, and use an edge of the plate to define a direction for this pattern.
Follow the same steps under the “Second Direction” tab to fill out the rest of the plate. Before selecting “OK”, your rectangular pattern should look like the image shown.







,

This plate has potential to serve many functions. The threaded holes in this plate allow parts to be constrained for testing or operation purposes. Additionally, more fixtures can be attached to the plate to accommodate more complex part design. This plate is very simple, yet useful and can be manipulated easily via the 3-D software.

Don't worry about the pay.",How to Develop Software," There are two basic camps of software development: Applications Development and Systems Development. Applications Development is focused on creating programs that meet the users' needs. These can range from mobile phone apps, to high-production video games, to enterprise-level accounting software. Systems Development is focused on creating and maintaining operating systems using life-cycle development. Systems Development often involves network operability and data security., Anyone can come up with ideas, but a developer will be able to turn those ideas into something tangible. Even if you only want to work on the design aspects of software, you should have some familiarity with coding and be able to create basic prototypes. There are a huge variety of programming languages that you can teach yourself. Some of the more useful and important ones include:



C - C is one of the older languages still in use, and is the basis for most of the other languages on this list. C is used to develop low-level programs, and works very closely with the computer's hardware.

C++ - This is the object-oriented version of C, and is the most popular programming language in the world. Programs such as Chrome, Firefox, Photoshop, and many others are all built with C++. It is also a very popular language for creating video games. C++ developers are almost always in very high demand.

Java - This is an evolution of the C++ language, and is used to due its ease of portability. Almost any system can run a Java Virtual Machine, allowing it to run Java software. It is widely used in video games and business software, and many people recommend it as an essential language.

C# - C# is a Windows-based language that is part of the .NET framework from Microsoft. It is closely related to Java and C++, and if you learn Java you can quickly transition to C#. This language is especially useful for developers working with Windows or Windows Phone software.

Objective-C - This is another cousin of the C language that is specifically designed for Apple systems. It sees immense popularity in iPhone and iPad apps. It is a great language to learn as a freelancer.

Python - This is an incredibly easy language to learn, one of the easiest. Python specializes in web development.

PHP - This isn't exactly software development, but PHP is essential if you are interested in getting into web development. There is always lots of work for PHP developers, though it isn't as lucrative as software development.

, Most bookstores have entire sections dedicated to programming books, and there are tons available on Amazon and other e-tailers. A well-written programming book will likely be the best resource you can have, and will allow you to quickly reference it while working on projects.


Beyond books, the internet is an endless treasure-trove of guides and tutorials. Search for guides on the language of your choice on sites such as CodeAcademy, Code.org, Bento, Udacity, Udemy, Khan Academy, W3Schools, and many more.

, While you don't need a full-on degree in order to get into software development, it can't hurt to take a few classes at your local community college or learning center. This will give you the benefit of one-on-one instruction, and you will be challenged to solve problems that you likely wouldn't if you were learning on your own.


Classes cost money, so make sure that you are signing up for classes that will help you learn what you want to know.
While many developers are able to enter the industry based purely on the merits of their skills, you'll help yourself stand out from the pack if you have a bachelor's degree in computer science from a four-year university. A degree will give you a wider background of knowledge and will give you access to additional helpful classes such as math and logic.

, Before you start trying to apply your new programming skills to real-world jobs, work on some projects for yourself. Challenge yourself to solve problems using your programming language. Not only will this help develop your skills, it will also help build your resume.


For example, instead of using your computer's calendar program to stay organized, try designing your own!
If you're interested in video game development, work on simple games that don't focus on graphics or complex mechanics. Instead, focus on making them fun and unique. A collection of small games that you created yourself will look great in your portfolio.

, The internet is a fantastic way to connect with other developers. If you find yourself stumped on one of your projects, ask for help on sites such as StackOverflow. make sure that you ask in an intelligent manner and can prove that you have already tried several possible solutions.

, Work on your pet projects every day, even if only for an hour. This will help you stay fresh and constantly learn new techniques. Many developers have had success learning a language by ensuring that they are exposed to it on a daily basis.Set a time every day that you can dedicate to coding, or set a deadline that you need to be finished by. Try to work on your projects every day during the week so you can relax on your weekend.

, A good program will perform a task that makes life easier for the user. Look at the software that is currently available for the task you want to perform, and see if there are ways that the process could be easier or smoother. A successful program is one that users will find a lot of utility in.


Examine your daily tasks on your computer. Is there some way that you could automate a portion of those tasks with a program?
Write down every idea. Even if it seems silly or outlandish at the time, it could change into something useful or even brilliant.
Examine other programs. What do they do? How could they do it better? What are they missing? Answering these questions can help you come up with ideas for your own take on it.

, This document will outline the features and what you intend to achieve with the project. Referring to the design document during the development process will help keep your project on track and focused. See this guide for details on writing the document.

, This is a basic program that shows off the functionality that you're aiming to achieve. A prototype is a quick program, and should be iterated on until you find a design that works. For example, if you are creating a calendar program, your prototype would be a basic calendar (with correct dates!) and a way to add events to it.


Your prototype will change often during the development cycle as you come up with new ways to tackle problems or think of an idea later that you want to incorporate.
The prototype doesn't have to be pretty. In fact, art and design should be one of the last things you focus on. Using the calendar example again, your prototype should most likely just be text.

, Bugs are the bane of every developer. Errors in code and unexpected usage can cause all kinds of problems in a finished product. As you continue to work on your project, test it as much as possible. Do everything you can to break it, and then try to keep it from breaking in the future. Have friends and family test your program and report back results. Any way that you can get feedback will help your development process.


Try inputting odd dates if your program deals with dates. Really old dates or far future dates may cause odd reactions with the program.
Input the wrong kind of variables. For example, if you have a form that asks for the user's age, enter in a word instead and see what happens to the program.
If your program has a graphical interface, click on everything. What happens when you go back to a previous screen, or click buttons in the wrong order?

, While it's fine to make a rough project for the prototyping and development phase, if you want others to use it you're going to need to spend some time on polish. This means making sure the menus flow logically, the User Interface (UI) is clean and easy to use, there are no glaring or showstopping bugs, and that it's coated in a nice looking finish.


UI design and functionality can be very difficult and complex. People make whole careers out of designing UIs. Just make sure that your personal project is easy to use and easy on the eyes. A professional UI may not be possible without a budget and a team.
If you have the budget, there are lots of freelance graphics designers who could potentially design a UI on contract for you. If you have a solid project that you're hoping will become the next big thing, find a good UI designer and make them part of your team.

, GitHub is an open-source community that allows you to share your code with others. This will allow you to get insight on your own code as well as benefit others who are looking for solutions that you may have come up with. GitHub is a great learning resource as well as a good way to build your portfolio.

, Once you have a finished product, you can choose whether or not you want to distribute it. There are a variety of ways you can do this these days depending on the type of software you created.


One of the most common ways for small teams or independent developers to distribute their software is through a personal website. Make sure that all of your features are well-documented, and include some screenshots and tutorials. If you are selling your software, make sure you have a good digital payment system and a server to distribute the software from.
If you are developing software for a specific device or operating system, there are multiple digital stores that you may be able to use. For example, if you are making software for Android devices, you can sell your app through the Google Play Store, the Amazon App Store, or your own personal website.

, Although these won't pay as well and are less reliable than full-time employment, you can significantly bulk up your portfolio by taking a series of contract jobs. Check sites like Elance and ODesk (Also known as ""Upwork"" now) to find work. While it can be difficult to get considered for a contract, once you get your first one it gets a lot easier.


Hacker News is a great resource for contract and freelance jobs. Check the ""Ask"" section.
While it can be tempting to bid low to secure a contract job, don't sell your services short. Not only will you end up working more for less than you deserve, you will also anger others in your field, leading to less networking.
Good work on a contract job can sometimes lead to a full-time position. Always put your best foot forward!

, Attend as many conventions and hack-a-thons as you possibly can. Not only will this expose you to more code and problems to solve, it will also help you meet other people in the industry. Despite what you might think about programmers working alone in their basement, the majority of full-time developers are part of a team and networking is just as important as any other field.

, Once you have a few contract jobs under your belt, you can start sending your resume and portfolio out to larger organizations for full-time employment. Besides Monster and Indeed, there are a variety of developer-specific job sites that you should be looking at, including GitHub Jobs, StackOverflow Job Board, AngelList, CrunchBoard, Hirelite, and Hacker News., A good software developer is usually proficient in more than one language. While a lot of what you learn will be on the job, use some of your free time to expand your knowledge and learn the basics of another language or two. This will make transitioning to new projects much easier and will make you a much more desirable job candidate.

, Not every entry-level software development job is going to pay six figures. In fact, none of them will. The good thing about software development, however, is that the job market is incredibly strong. If you feel like you aren't earning enough where you're at, it is relatively easy to move to a new position in a new company (if you have the skills). Treat your first few jobs as necessary experience instead of focusing on your retirement plan.

,, The .25 is for 1440*.25 = 360. 17280/12=1440. So we are taking 1/12th of 1/4 or 1/48th of 17280 = 360, the degrees of the trig function cosine for a circle. PI()/180 converts radians to degrees. (ROW()-6) in row 6 = 0, so we start off taking the cosine of 0, which is 1, and multiplying it by 17. 17 is twice the Stretch factor, and if I recall rightly, is 1/2 the radius of the ring (the Stretch factor operates from each sphere's center). However, Shrinker is also involved, as you'll see later.
Adj Sin: Edit Go To cell range B6:B17285 and enter into B6 w/o quotes the following formula,""=17*SIN((ROW()-6)*0.25/12*PI()/180)+17""and Edit Fill Down, which is different than the above one for cosine by the addition of 17 to it. All in all, that give us 4*8.5, and that is the radius, as I recall.
Indicator: Select cell C6 and enter 1. Edit Go To cell range C7:C17286 and enter w/o quotes the formula, ""=IF((ROW()-7)/MAGIC=INT((ROW()-7)/MAGIC),1,IF((ROW()-7)=0,1,0))"" and Edit Fill Down. This formula says, 'Take a look at the row I'm in, divide it by the number of rows per sphere (MAGIC) and if that number is an integer, return a 1, otherwise if I'm in the next-to-top row also return a 1, otherwise, return a 0.' So now there is an indicator of where 1 sphere ends and the next one begins, no matter how many spheres the user selects to chart.

Remember the magical formula: Icons must be recognizable and beautiful.,
Use symbols and shapes.,
Color it carefully.,
Don't clutter.,
Make sure your icon is related to the product you are selling.,
Consider the iOS.",How to Create Interesting App Icons1," Being beautiful will ensure that the users notice it for the first time. Being recognizable will help you when your user will come back or search for your app. Know that when users see an app icon, they instantly create an opinion about the quality of the app. First impression matters! So make it as powerful and attractive as possible.;
, E.g., blue box with an enclosed 'f'- Facebook, a small flying bird against blue background- twitter, Cursive 'P' against red- Pinterest, and a comical robot - Android. All these icons capitalize on the power of symbol and shapes. These are simple yet beautiful and recognizable. Don't go for complicated designs unless you can pull it off well.

, Colors say a lot about your app in particular and business in general. Use colors carefully. Don't make it clownish. Try not to use more than three colors. Know a little about color psychology. Green is usually associated with nature. Red is romantic, Blue signifies peace and orange oozes energy. Purple is royal. Similarly, know how colors choice is determined by gender, age, and region.

, Remember simplicity is a virtue in visual arts and design.  Don't use long string of texts. Similarly, don't use photos unless you are a rock star or Hollywood celebrity.

, For example, use heart symbol for dating and matchmaking app. Computer or cellphone for cellphones and gadgets. Eateries can have food symbols. Religious symbols are universally recognized, so bank on this phenomenon.

, Google has laid out icons design guideline for developers. This has led to more unified icons. Apple on the other hand already had the ""squircle"" design for their native apps, and has always been very rich aesthetically, which led to synchronized designs by others, too.

"
"
Use grids and basic shapes: The basic shapes and grid let you focus on each element in the consecutive layers e.g., lighting, shading, color, geometry, etc.

,
Light carefully.,
Observe the shadows.,
Color according to their suggestions.,

Have a large version of your app for App Store Display.",How to Create Interesting App Icons3," For example, movie related app can use a clapper board. Instead of using some obscure or less known aspects of movie making e.g., coloring, sound dubbing, etc.

, Photos hardly look good on icons and the whole point of using them is lost when seen at small sizes.

, Transparent icons rarely look good. Most of the time they get merged into bright background.

, iOS users are very sophisticated breed of people. They have been using different iOS applications religiously. Making icons very similar to those of the native iOS apps will drive them away from your app instantly. Moreover, you may end up with copyright issues.

, Users have different devices which will have different rendering. Refer to the Apple Image and Icon size table on Apple's website.

, This can be richer and more detailed, though no visual effects can be applied.


The larger icon should measure 1024 x 1024 pixels. It needs to be named iTunesArtwork@2x. For @1x devices, create app icon using 512 x 512 pixels and named iTunesArtwork.

, You can choose many colours or two colours or even just one. Once you have decided, set your choice(s) out on a flat work surface and put your mobile on the angle you wish in order to work on it.


Note: If it's your first ever time doing this, glitter or see-through nail varnish is recommended. (It still looks great.)

, With a piece of paper, get your starting colour and open it. Don't hit it on the side of the rim, instead quickly make a tiny dot on the paper, then another which is slightly bigger until you get to the biggest size. If you want to paint an area instead of a dot, practice painting lines, curves, and squares on the paper. Keep doing it until you are aware of how much pressure you need to apply to get the size you want.


Note: Only move on to the mobile when you are sure you have the touch and scale perfect. If you are, move on to the next step. You have got it. Well done!

, keypad? or whole thing? It's your choice. Just don't get the nail varnish too near to the buttons.

, Now that you have decided, it's time to finally get on with it. Take your nail varnish and dot little circles in the place you want the décor to be, pulling up as you finish them. Patience and skill is the key.

Determine how you plan to use this phone.,
Determine which carriers will you use.,
Verify if it's a worthy phone.",How to Decide Whether to Buy a Newer or Older iPhone," If you really care about the new features, you might consider a newer model iPhone. If you don't really care about the new features, older models will be right for you at a good price.;
, If you want all the new features offered by the newer models, you have to make sure you can afford it. If you can afford it and want the new features, it will be worth it.


However, if you buy a newer model phone and don't care about the new features, it won't be worth the same amount of money.
If you care about features, again, go with an older model. It'll be worth it way better.

, If you get a newer model iPhone just to text / call, you're not gonna get a phone that's worth the money you paid with a newer phone.


If you just want to do the basic things, like calling, or texting, an older phone is your prime destination. It's more affordable, again, and it will be worth your money for the purposes you use your phone for.

,


If you have to use Sprint, a newer model may come out better, since it's only the iPhone 4S that began the business of Sprint and Apple.
If you use T-Mobile and need an unlocked iPhone, you might as well go with a newer model that supports T-Mobile. AT&T's been in the iPhone world forever, so you probably won't care about carriers for newer and older models.

, Phones can be picky to choose from, so it's important to choose what you need and not what you want. For example, a person who only texts and calls will probably only need a phone that works, so you can get an older model for cheaper and more worth the price.


If you need your phone for intensive gaming, and high performance things, you might consider a newer model with a faster processor

Once you get a sense of how often you're on your phone, you can decide how much you want to cut back. You can monitor your cell phone usage by tracking your time manually in a small notebook. You can also use a phone app to see how often you're on your phone.Apps like QualityTime and Moment can be used to monitor your phone usage. They will tell you how much time you spent using your cell phone on any given day.
Once you get a sense of how much you use your phone, decide how much you want to cut back. For example, say you use your phone for three hours a day and want to cut that in half. You can strive for only 90 minutes of phone usage in the coming days.;
, Many phone apps come with notifications, which can tempt you into getting lost in your phone. For example, you may receive a notification every time someone interacts with you on Facebook or likes one of your Tweets. This will cause you to check these websites, which could result in mindless browsing.Most new apps ask you if you want to allow notifications when you first install them. You should get into the habit of saying ""No.""
On your existing apps, turn off notifications. It will be easier to avoid checking Facebook if you don't get a notification telling you there's a new message in your inbox.

, Many people use their phones as an alarm clock. This can lead you to check your Facebook, email, and other websites first thing in the morning. To lessen this temptation, opt to use an actual alarm clock. This way, your phone will not be the first thing you reach for in the morning.Work on removing your phone from your bedroom altogether. This way, you'll have a phone-free space in your home. This also may help with your sleep, as the light from cell phone screens can interfere with your sleep cycle.

, The fact is, phones are necessary. You cannot stop using a cell phone altogether, especially if you rely on one for your work. Try to schedule time to return things like emails and text messages. This way, you won't be tethered to your cell phone on and off all day and you will also make sure you return messages in a timely fashion.It's important to find a time that works for you. Look at gaps in your schedule where you have free time or down time at work. You can, for example, set aside an hour each morning after breakfast to return messages on your phone.

, It's important to have some time when your phone is off altogether. It can be very tempting to grab your phone and get on Facebook if your phone is right there. Have a set time each day when you power down your phone and disconnect.It can be particularly helpful to do this right before bed. This will help you disengage and unwind for sleep.

, Instead of charging your phone in whatever room you are in, you might try charging it in a room that is not used very often. For example, you could designate your home office as the charging station instead of the kitchen or living room. This will provide some hands off time for you while your phone charges.

, If you worry about being without your phone in case of an emergency, then putting down your phone for even a little while can be distressing. However, having a cell phone on you at all times is not going to make a big difference in an emergency situation. Most people carry cell phones, and even if no one did, then you could go to a nearby business to call for help if there was an emergency.


The next time you try to leave your house without your cell phone, try telling yourself something like, “I can be without my phone for a while and I will be fine. If there is an emergency, then someone will help me.”

, Some people have a hard time putting their phones down because they worry that they will miss out on important news or updates on social media. However, having the news or updates an hour sooner will not make a difference. Try to remind yourself of this if it is preventing you from putting down your phone for a while.


If you are feeling anxious about being without news or updates, try telling yourself, “The news/updates will be there when I pick up my phone again. It won’t make a difference if I find out an hour or two later.”

, If getting “likes” on your posts has become a big part of your sense of happiness and pride, then it may be time to branch out and try to find some alternative ways to feel happy and proud. Some things that might help you to become less dependent on social media include:


Trying a new hobby, such as painting, knitting, or cooking.
Looking for opportunities to shine at school or at work, such as by joining a club or taking on a special project.

Building your confidence.

, If you're worried about your children's internet usage, your cell phone provider may be able to help you set up parental controls. Talk your concerns over with a representative for your cell phone provider and see if there's a service you can pay for to block dangerous websites.Cell phone providers have different services for different fees. AT&T, for example, provides a free app called Data Blocker which allows you to block video and picture messaging on your child's phone. This can help if you're concerned about things like sexting. Other providers have similar services.
Other apps will allow you to filter out inappropriate content. T-Mobile, for example, has an app called Web Guard that blocks all 18 and over content on your children's cell phones.

, If you can't find something that works through your provider, there are many cell phone apps you can purchase. These can allow you to filter content and limit the amount of texts your kids can send.Apps can help filter out inappropriate content, but they can also encourage your child to take a break from the cell phone. Many apps, for example, will send messages encouraging a child to step away from the phone on occasion.

, If you want to make sure a child or teen does not overdo it on their cell phone, make specific rules. Make sure your child knows how often they can use the phone, and when the phone must be turned off.Make a family rule about phone use. For example, you might make it a rule that everyone in the family has to power down their cell phones for the evening at a designated time, such as 7pm. You might even have everyone drop their phones into a basket for the night and then allow them to get them again in the morning.
Some parents find it helpful to write up a contract regarding cell phone usage and have their teen or child sign it. This way, everyone knows what the rules are regarding the phone and there is little room for confusion or misunderstanding.

, If your child or teen brings their phone to school, talk to teachers or principals about the rules in their school. You want to encourage your teen to be respectful regarding their cell phone usage. You want to make sure your teen or child knows cell phones are not always allowed or appropriate, and they should respect rules regarding phones.If your school does not allow cell phones at all, make sure to take your teen or child's phone away before they go to school.

, Children and teens can easily get into trouble online. Have an open dialogue going in your home regarding safe usage of cell phones and other technologies.Talk to your teen about what they post online. Let your teen know nothing they post on the internet is ever 100% private, and that they should not post anything they do not want someone to see in the future.
Let your teen know the dangers or sexting. Talk to your teen about rules regarding sharing lewd content in your state or area.

, Many texting applications, like Apple iMessage, Google Hangouts, and third party apps, may use a lot of data. While they are free to download, you end up burning through a lot of data each month using these apps.Keep in mind, exchanging text messages alone should not eat up too much data. However, sending videos and photos tends to use a lot of data, so cut down on the exchange of media messages.

, Listening to music through apps like Pandora, and watching videos online, eats through data fast. You should refrain from doing so unless you're connected to wi-fi. Otherwise, you will eat up your data quickly.Many people watch movies or listen to music when they work out. See if your gym has free wi-fi to make sure you don't eat up too much data during your regular workout.

, If you have to update apps, always do so when connected to wi-fi. It takes a lot of data to update applications, especially if you're updating several at once. Wait until you're home, or a public place with wi-fi, to update things like Uber., Many apps run in the background, even when you're not using them. This eats up a surprising amount of data. Check the settings in all your apps and see if any are enabled to run when not in use. If they are, turn this feature off to free up data on your phone., Oftentimes, you find yourself wanting to download a podcast, song, or other content during your morning commute or while you're waiting for a bus. Make a habit of downloading this kind of content ahead of time, when you're connected to wi-fi. Downloading any kind of content eats into your data fast."

See how they perform, where they get stuck, are these intuitive, attractive and fun to use? Change your design accordingly.


Similarly, people who are less educated and young users (kids) are a big market sector. The design must be intuitive enough to help them use your app without hassle.;
, Mobile internet market is divided among different operating systems. Consider these differences before designing the app. Use responsive design to ensure that your app appears as intended throughout different platforms and operating systems.

, Use responsive design strategy to create an app that is flexible and customizable for different platforms. Responsive design refers to the idea that app or website changes its layout, fonts, and graphics according to the hosting device. Don't go for the strategy of creating a trimmed down version of your site for cell phones. Instead, first build the site for the small screen and then enlarge it for the bigger screens.

, The grid is an excellent tool to keep your app design consistent and on the track across multiple pages. Consistency in graphics, fonts, and icons create professional look. Not to mention, it reflects your brand image.

, Not all areas have network coverage. Decide on offline usability factor of your app. Make sure that most of the features in your app work during offline sessions. In some parts of the world power outages are a regular feature of daily life, so ideally your app would be usable even if you don't have an internet connection.

, Clearly set your objective about your app objective. E.g., Find petrol stations on highway in a particular state or country.

, Visualize how your app will look on the screen. Draw a rough diagram of screens or skins. What are the functions and everything in between.





, Know if your idea is already used. Find out what users are looking for? How to tap the market financially? Chalk out a marketing plan. Marketing isn't the last step in app making. It should be taken along in every step i.e., pre-production, production, and post production., Storyboarding helps you have a blueprint of app functionality. Similar to storyboarding for movies, the more elaborate storyboard is, the more lucid the process becomes., Prototyping tools let you see and test your app in real time.

They start from free and go to monthly/yearly subscription. Moreover, they don't need you writing code. They offer graphical user interface. You just need to drag, drop, upload photos, check boxes and your app is complete. Bingo!, There are numerous sites offering app building services. Go through some and read content and testimonials. Consider intuitive and easy interface. Some offer free services while others charge fee., Make sure you have read the above section on digging deeper. Do some paperwork and visualization before starting the process. Storyboard how your screens and functions are going to work., Most of the sites are very easy to use. Anyone with some basic knowledge of computers and internet can do it easily., Read the above section titled ""Setting the Benchmark"". Your app should have enough features that work offline.

Look at contract length.,
Compare individual services to bundling.,
Consider time restrictions.,
List your priorities.,
Check with the Better Business Bureau.,
Ask around.,
Skip the incentives.",How to Compare Phone Companies,"


The required length of the contract is an important factor to consider when comparing phone companies. Some companies require that you sign up for a 2- or 3-year term, but only offer incentive rates and pricing for the first 6 months of the contract, which could end up costing you more in the end than signing up with a company that only requires a 1-year service agreement.;
,


Compare phone company contracts by looking at the cost for individual services versus bundling services together. Combining your home phone, cable and Internet services into a bundle package could seem like a deal, but could be more expensive than individual services through separate companies. Compare the overall pricing for each option. There are several web sites that can you help you compare phone, cable and internet services.

,


The time structure of a phone contract is another important factor to consider when comparing phone company prices. Phone companies offer ""anytime"" minutes as well as night and weekend hours that are limited or cost different rates. Consider when you make the most phone calls, as well as how many of them are long distance, and how many minutes you think you need per month and compare companies based on that.

,


Make a list of the essential features your contract has to have, like unlimited long distance, and the features that are desired but not required, like web capabilities. Look at each phone company's offers for your required features, then factor in the bonus features you'd like to have, but can ultimately live without. Having a prioritized list will keep you from being swayed by a phone company's incentive promises.

,


The Better Business Bureau is an organization that aims to protect and inform consumers by providing information about the credentials and customer service ratings of vendors and retailers. Compare the ratings of each phone company you're considering according to the Better Business Bureau's criteria. This rating will give you a good idea of the kind of service you can expect.

,


Ask friends and family members what phone companies they use and how satisfied they are with the overall options, costs and service. People tend to remember good and bad experiences with phone companies, so use the opinions of the people you trust to rate the customer service levels of each phone company.

,


Always look at the basic monthly rate you will be charged after any sign-up discounts or new customer deals have expired. This is the cost you will be dealing with for the length of the contract, so this is where you should start your comparison.

Set Breakpoints: To set a breakpoint, select one line of code first, then move mouse to the left most area of that line(as shown in below picture), either double click or right click then select “Toggle Breakpoint” in the popup list, a small blue ball will appear, that means a breakpoint has been set successfully.,
Start the program in debug mode: We have three ways to do so: 1> Press F11; 2> Click item “Run” in main menu then select “Debug” in the drop list; 3> Click the bug icon on the tools panel(as below picture shows) then select “Debug As Java Application”.

,
Add variables to watch box for examination: We can see the program now is stopping at the line on which we've set a breakpoint.,
Check the variable values in the watch box: Now we can see the value of num1 and num2 are as expected, but sum is still 0.0, because the program hasn't run the code that will update sum’s value.

,
Step Into: Run into the function: Now we'll use function add() to calculate the sum.,
Return from the function: Run the code by pressing F6, or pressing the ""Step Over"" icon in the tools panel, or in main menu, select “Step Over” in the drop-down list of the item “Run”.,
Check the return value from function: Run the program with Step Over, the value of sum will be changed to 9.0.

,

,, Now we'll add the variables into watch box to see if the program will run as we expected. To add a variable into watch box, put the cursor on it, right click, then in the popup list select “Watch”.

,, To see if the function add() will work as we expected, we'll step into it. To do so, just Press F5, or on tools panel, press the ""Step Into"" icon in the tools panel, or in main menu, select “Step Into” in the drop-down list of the item “Run”. The program will run into function add() and stop on the first executable code.

, The program will return from function add() to main() and stop on the same line when it left previously.

,, We must use Step Over instead of Step Into because we don't have the source code of the function println().

, From main menu “Windows”, select “Preference”, then follow the numbers sequentially in below picture:

, That means if it is enabled, every time when a program starts to run, it will stop on the first executable code in main() so that the code can be run manually. To enable “Stop in main”, right click on the project name in project explorer window, select “property” to bring out the “properties for xxx”(xxx is the project name) dialog box, then follow the steps labelled numbers sequentially.

Query your data.",How to Create a SQL Server Database," This software is available for free from Microsoft, and allows you to connect to and manage your SQL server from a graphical interface instead of having to use the command line.


In order to connect to a remote instance of an SQL server, you will need this or similar software.
Mac users can use open-source programs such as DbVisualizer or SQuirreL SQL. The interfaces will be different but the same general principles apply.To learn how to create databases using command line tools, see this guide.;
, When you first start the program, you will be asked what server you would like to connect to. If you already have a server up and running, and have the permissions necessary to connect to it, you can enter in the server address and authentication information. If you want to create a local database, set the Database Name to . and the authentication type to ""Windows Authentication"".


Click Connect to continue.

, After the connection to the server, either local or remote, is made, the Object Explorer window will open on the left side of the screen. At the top of the Object Explorer tree will be the server you are connected to. if it is not expanded, click the ""+"" icon next to it. Located the Databases folder., Right-click on the Databases folder and select ""New Database..."". A window will appear, allowing you to configure the database before creating it. Give the database a name that will help you identify it. Most users can leave the rest of the settings at their default.You will note that as you type the database name, two additional files will be created automatically: the Data and the Log file. The data file houses all of the data in your database, while the log file tracks changes to the database.
Click OK to create the database. You will see your new database appear in the expanded Databases folder. It will have a cylinder icon.

, A database can only store data if you create a structure for that data. A table holds the information that you enter into your database, and you will need to create it before you can proceed. Expand the new database in your Databases folder, and right-click on the Tables folder and select ""New Table..."".


Windows will open on the rest of the screen which will allow you to manipulate your new table.

, It is highly recommended that you create a Primary Key as the first column on your table. This acts as an ID number, or record number, that will allow you to easily recall these entries later. To create this, enter ""ID"" in the Column Name field, type int into the Data Type field, and uncheck the ""Allow Nulls."" Click the Key icon in the toolbar to set this column as the Primary Key.


You don't want to allow null values because you always want the entry to be at least ""1"". If you allow nulls, your first entry will be ""0"".
In the Column Properties window, scroll down until you find the Identity Specification option. Expand it and set ""(ls Identity)"" to ""Yes"". This will automatically increase the value of the ID column for each entry, effectively automatically numbering each new entry.

, Tables are composed of fields, or columns. Each column represents one aspect of a database entry. For example, if you were creating a database of employees, you might have a ""FirstName"" column, a ""LastName"" column, an ""Address"" column, and a ""PhoneNumber"" column.

, When you finish filling out the fields for the Primary Key, you will notice that new fields appear underneath it. These allow you to enter in your next column. Fill out the fields as you see fit, and ensure that you pick the right data type for the information that will be entered in that column:



nchar(#) - This is the data type you should use for text, such as names, addresses, etc. The number in parentheses is the maximum number of characters allowed for this field. Setting a limit ensures that your database size stays manageable. Phone numbers should be stored with this format, as you don't perform mathematical functions on them.

int - This is for whole numbers, and is typically used in the ID field.

decimal(x,y) - This will store numbers in decimal form, and the numbers within the parentheses denote the total number of digits and the number digits following the decimal, respectively. For example decimal(6,2) would store numbers as 0000.00.

, When you are finished creating your columns, you will need to save the table before entering information. Click the Save icon in the toolbar, and then enter in a name for the table. Naming your table in a way that helps you recognize the contents is advisable, especially for larger databases with multiple tables.

, Once you've saved your table, you can begin adding data to it. Expand the Tables folder in the Object Explorer window. If your new table is not listed, right click on the Tables folder and select Refresh. Right-click on the table and select ""Edit Top 200 Rows"".The center window will display fields for you to begin entering data. Your ID field will be filled automatically, so you can ignore it right now. Fill out information for the rest of the fields. When you click on the next row, you will see the ID field in the first row fill automatically.
Continue this process until you've entered all the information you need.

, Click the Execute SQL button on the toolbar when you are finished entering the information to save it to the table. The SQL server will run in the background, parsing all of the data into the columns you created. The button looks like a red exclamation point. You can also press Ctrl+R to execute as well.


If there are any errors, you will be shown which entries are filled out incorrectly before the table can be executed.

, At this point, your database has been created. You can create as many tables as you need within each database (there is a limit, but most users will not need to worry about that unless they are working on enterprise-level databases). You can now query your data for reports or any other administrative purposes. See this guide for detailed information on running queries.

Look at the software that is currently available for the task you want to perform, and see if there are ways that the process could be easier or smoother. A successful program is one that users will find a lot of utility in.


Examine your daily tasks on your computer. Is there some way that you could automate a portion of those tasks with a program?
Write down every idea. Even if it seems silly or outlandish at the time, it could change into something useful or even brilliant.;
, What do they do? How could they do it better? What are they missing? Answering these questions can help you come up with ideas for your own take on it.

, This document will outline the features and what you intend to achieve with the project. Referring to the design document during the development process will help keep your project on track and focused. See this guide for details on writing the document. Writing the design document will also help you decide which programming language will work best for your project.

, When you are just getting started with computer programming, it will behoove you to start small and grow over time. You will learn a lot more if you set tangible goals that you can reach with a basic program. For example,

, Almost all programs are written in text editors and then compiled to run on computers. While you can use programs like Notepad or TextEdit, it is highly recommended that you download a syntax-highlighting editor such as Notepad++ JEdit, or Sublime Text. This will make your code much easier to visually parse.


Some languages such as Visual Basic include an editor and compiler in one package.

, All programs are created through coding. If you want to create your own programs, you will need to be familiar with at least one programming language. The languages you will need to learn will vary depending on the type of program you want to create. Some of the more useful and important ones include:



C - C is a low-level language that interacts very closely with the computer's hardware. It is one of the older programming languages that still sees widespread use.

C++ - The biggest drawback of C is that it is not object-oriented. This is where C++ comes in. C++ is currently the most popular programming language in the world. Programs such as Chrome, Firefox, Photoshop, and many others are all built with C++. It is also a very popular language for creating video games.

Java - Java is an evolution of the C++ language, and is extremely portable. Most computers, regardless of operating system, can run a Java Virtual Machine, allowing the program to be used nearly universally. It is widely used in video games and business software, and is often recommended as an essential language.

C# - C# is a Windows-based language and is one of the main languages used when creating Windows programs. It is closely related to Java and C++, and should be easy to learn if you're already familiar with Java. If you want to make a Windows or Windows Phone program, you'll want to take a look at this language.

Objective-C - This is another cousin of the C language that is specifically designed for Apple systems. If you want to make iPhone or iPad apps, this is the language for you.

, For any high-level language such as C++, Java, and many others, you will need a compiler to convert your code into a format that the computer can use. There are a variety of compilers to choose from depending on the language you are using.Some languages are interpreted languages, which means they don't need a compiler. Instead, they only need the language interpreter installed on the computer, and the programs can run instantly. Some examples of interpreted languages include Perl and Python.

, No matter which language you pick, you'll likely need to understand some basic common concepts. Knowing how to handle the syntax of the language will allow you to create much more powerful programs. Common concepts include:


Declaring variables - Variables are the way your data is temporarily stored in your program. This data can then be stored, modified, manipulated, and called upon later in the program.
Using conditional statements (if, else, when, etc.) - These are one of the basic functions of programs, and dictate how the logic works. Conditional statements revolve around ""true"" and ""false"" statements.
Using loops (for, goto, do, etc.) - Loops allow you to repeat processes over and over until a command is given to stop.
Using escape sequences - These commands perform functions such as create new lines, indents, quotes, and more.
Commenting on code - Comments are essential for remembering what your code does, helping other programmers understand your code, and for temporarily disabling parts of code.
Understand regular expressions.

, There are books for every language and for every level of expertise. You can find programming books at your local bookstore or any online retailer. A book can be an invaluable tool as you can keep it close at hand while you're working.


Beyond books, the internet is an endless treasure-trove of guides and tutorials. Search for guides on the language of your choice on sites such as Codecademy, Code.org, Bento, Udacity, Udemy, Khan Academy, W3Schools, and many more.

, Anyone can teach themselves to make a program if they put their mind to it, but sometimes having a teacher and a classroom environment can be really beneficial. One-on-one time with an expert can greatly decrease the time it takes you to grasp programming fundamentals and concepts. Classes are also a good place to learn advanced math and logic that will be required for more complex programs.


Classes cost money, so make sure that you are signing up for classes that will help you learn what you want to know.

, The internet is a fantastic way to connect with other developers. If you find yourself stumped on one of your projects, ask for help on sites such as StackOverflow. Make sure that you ask in an intelligent manner and can prove that you have already tried several possible solutions.

, This will be the prototype that shows off the functionality that you're aiming to achieve. A prototype is a quick program, and should be iterated on until you find a design that works. For example, if you are creating a calendar program, your prototype would be a basic calendar (with correct dates!) and a way to add events to it.


Your prototype will change often during the development cycle as you come up with new ways to tackle problems or think of an idea later that you want to incorporate.
The prototype doesn't have to be pretty. In fact, art and design should be one of the last things you focus on. Using the calendar example again, your prototype should most likely just be text.
If you're making a game, your prototype should be fun! If the prototype isn't fun, then chances are the full game won't be fun either.
If your desired mechanics just aren't working in the prototype, then it may be time to go back to the drawing board.

, If you are developing your program on your own, you can use a prototype to help build a team. A team will help you track down bugs faster, iterate features, and design the visual aspects of the program.


A team is definitely not necessary for small projects, but will cut down development time significantly.
Running a team is a complex and difficult process, and requires good management skills along with a good structure for the team. See this guide for more details on leading a group.

, Once you're familiar with your language, you may be able to get prototypes up and running in just a few days. Because of their quick nature, don't be afraid to scrap your idea and start over from a different angle if you're not happy with how it's turning out. It's much easier to make major changes at this stage than it is later on when the features start falling into place.

, Use the comment syntax in your programming language to leave notes on all but the most basic lines of code. This will help you remember what you were doing if you have to put the project down for awhile, and will help other developers understand your code. This is especially essential if you are working as part of a programming team.


You can use comments to temporarily disable parts of your code during testing. Simply enclose the code you want to disable in comment syntax and it won't be compiled. You can then delete the comment syntax and the code will be restored.

, In the alpha stage, the testing team can and should be small. A small group will help you get focused feedback and gives you the ability to interface with testers one on one. Every time you make updates to the prototype, new builds are sent out to the alpha testers. The testers then try all of the included features and also try to break the program, documenting their results.


If you are developing a commercial product, you will want to make sure that all of your testers sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). This will prevent them from telling others about your program, and prevent leaks to press and other users.
Take some time to come up with a solid testing plan. Make sure that your testers have a way to easily report bugs in the program, as well as easily access new versions of the alpha. GitHub and other code repositories are a great way to easily manage this aspect.

, Bugs are the bane of every developer. Errors in code and unexpected usage can cause all kinds of problems in a finished product. As you continue to work on your prototype, test it as much as possible. Do everything you can to break it, and then try to keep it from breaking in the future.


Try inputting odd dates if your program deals with dates. Really old dates or far future dates may cause odd reactions with the program.
Input the wrong kind of variables. For example, if you have a form that asks for the user's age, enter in a word instead and see what happens to the program.
If your program has a graphical interface, click on everything. What happens when you go back to a previous screen, or click buttons in the wrong order?

, When revising the program in the alpha, you will be spending a lot of time fixing features that do not work correctly. When organizing your bug reports from your alpha testers, they will need to be sorted based on two metrics: Severity and Priority.


The Severity of a bug is a measure of how much damage the bug causes. Bugs that crash the program, corrupt data, keep the program from running are referred to as Blockers. Features that don't work or return incorrect results are labeled Critical, while difficult to use or bad-looking features are labeled Major. There are also Normal, Minor, and Trivial bugs that affect smaller sections or less-crucial features.
The Priority of a bug determines what order you tackle them when attempting to fix bugs. Fixing bugs in software is a time-consuming process, and takes away from the time you have to add features and polish. As such, you have to take the priority of a bug into account to make sure that you meet deadlines. All Blocker and Critical bugs take the highest priority, sometimes referred to as P1. P2 bugs are usually Major bugs that are scheduled to be fixed, but won't hold a product back from being shipped. P3 and P4 bugs are usually not scheduled fixes, and fall into the ""nice to have"" category.

, During the alpha phase, you will be adding more features to your program to bring it closer to the program outlined in your design document. The alpha stage is where the prototype evolves into the basic for of the full program. By the end of the alpha stage, your program should have all of its features implemented.


Don't stray too far from your original design document. A common problem in software development is ""feature-creep"", where new ideas keep getting added, causing the original focus to be lost and spreading development time between too many different features. You want your program to be the best at what it does, not a jack of all trades., As you add features to your program during the alpha phase, send out the new build to your testers. The regularity of new builds will be entirely dependent on your team's size and how much progress you're making on the features.

, Once you've implemented all of the features and functionality in your program, you can move out of the alpha phase. At this point, no further features should be added, and the included features should essentially work. Now you can move onto wider testing and polish, known as the beta phase.

, In the beta phase, the program is made available to a much larger group of testers. Some developers make the beta phase public, which is referred to as an open beta. This allows anyone to sign up and participate in testing the product.


Depending on the needs of your product, you may or may not want to do an open beta.

, As programs become more and more interconnected, there's a good chance that your program will rely on connections to other products or connections to servers. Beta testing allows you to ensure that these connections work under a larger load, which will ensure that your program is usable by the public when it releases.

, In the beta phase, no more features are being added, so focus can be turned to improving the program's aesthetics and usability. In this phase, UI design becomes a priority, ensuring that the users will have no difficulty navigating the program and taking advantage of the features.


UI design and functionality can be very difficult and complex. People make whole careers out of designing UIs. Just make sure that your personal project is easy to use and easy on the eyes. A professional UI may not be possible without a budget and a team.
If you have the budget, there are lots of freelance graphics designers who could potentially design a UI on contract for you. If you have a solid project that you're hoping will become the next big thing, find a good UI designer and make them part of your team.

, Throughout the beta phase, you should still be cataloging and prioritizing bug reports from your user base. Since more testers will have access to the product, chances are new bugs will be discovered. Eliminate bugs based on their priority, keeping your final deadlines in mind., If you want to get users, you'll want to make sure that they know your program exists. Just like any product, you'll need to do a bit of advertising in order to make people aware. The extent and depth of your marketing campaign will be dictated by your program's function as well as your available budget. Some easy ways to raise awareness of you program include:


Posting about your program on related message boards. Make sure that you follow the posting rules of whichever forum you choose so that your posts don't get marked as spam.
Send out press releases to tech sites. Find some tech blogs and sites that fit your program's genre. Send the editors a press release detailing your program and what it does. Include a few screenshots.
Make some YouTube videos. If your program is designed to complete a specific task, make some YouTube videos showing your program in action. Structure them as ""How-To"" videos.
Create social media pages. You can create free Facebook and Google+ pages for your program, and can use Twitter for both company and program-specific news.

, For small programs, you can most likely host the file on your own website. You may want to include a payment system if you are going to be charging for your software. If your program becomes very popular, you may need to host the file on a server that can handle more downloads.

, Once your program is released in the wild, you will invariably have users with technical problems or who don't understand how the program works. Your website should have thorough documentation available, as well as some sort of support service. This can include a technical support forum, a support email, live help, or any combination of those. What you can provide will be dependent on your available budget.

, Almost all programs these days are patched and updated long after their initial release. These patches may fix critical or non-critical bugs, update security protocols, improve stability, or even add functionality or redo the aesthetics. Keeping your program updated will help keep in competitive.

Separate each two adjacent columns of data from the next two by a bold border right outline. Separate all column Headings into their own bold outline boxes. Select cell range A17285:R17285, copy it and paste it to A17287 as backup formulas. There will be temporary errors -- those are acceptable. They may have to do with column definitions.

, Under Chart Wizard, a new Chart sheet will be created but per the Ribbon, a graph will land atop the data of the Data01 worksheet. Copy (or Cut) this graph and paste it to the top left corner of the Chart worksheet. Hover over the lower right corner until the cursor becomes a double-headed arrow and then select the corner and pull the graph into an approximate square. These steps may take some minutes, depending upon your processor. Wait times of 4 minutes were common for such job as a recalculation of new random arrangement, copy picture, etc. Again, it is much faster to have a mini-chart of columns Q and R with red line, weight 1, on the DATA01 worksheet than to wait the 5 minutes for the actual chart to generate.
Click in the Plot Area to add series 2. Do menu item Chart Add Data and in response to the range query, activate the Data01 worksheet and Edit Go To cell range Q6:R17285, then click OK. This often comes out wrong and has to be corrected in the formula bar. The two series you want are =SERIES(,'DATA 01'!$K$6:$K$17286,'DATA 01'!$L$6:$L$17286,1) and =SERIES(,'DATA 01'!$Q$6:$Q$17286,'DATA 01'!$R$6:$R$17286,2), in that order (per the last number in the last chart parameter of the foregoing chart function statements). The standard preference is for no grid lines or axes or legend, all of which can be set to none via Chart Layout.
Under Chart Layout, per clicking in the Plot Area, one reaches at the far left Current Selection -- Plot Area -- and Format Selection. Under this, the Fill has been set to the Texture Oak, Line has been set to None and no other effects were added.
Next, the Current Selection is set to Series 1, the bowl, and Format Selection shows that Shadow has been set to Outer, 270 degrees, black, size 100%, blur 4 pt, distance 21 pt and transparency 2%. No glow or soft edges were used. Line = 180 pt weight, style solid dashed,  and the gradient picture is presented here (with the final right hand white coming in at 68% and the maroon at 66%):










Next, the Current Selection is set to Series 2, the cherries, and Format Selection shows that Shadow was set but never turned out, even though none of the cherry's colors are transparent, so for whatever reason. Here is the picture of the Line Gradient for the Cherries, plus some of the colors:





Starting at 4% White, we then go to Pink/Fuchsia, and so on:












































 Opening graphic - 15 cherries, paired


Save the Data chit section from A1:R15 as Formulas, then below that as Paste Special Values to the Saves Worksheet, and under these two sets of data, save a copied picture of the chart by using the shift key + copy and the shift key + paste.
Save the workbook.

This workbook builds on the progress achieved in the article Create a Necklace Pattern in Microsoft Excel and it would be helpful to simply copy from that file and modify it.,


Set Preferences.,

Create a copy of the Data worksheet from Create a Necklace Pattern in Microsoft Excel and rename variables AdjX to AdjX1 and AdjY to AdjY1 and Insert Name create for their columns and substitute the new variable names into column E and F formulas (which will also change - see below), and see below for changes to columns G and H, or Create the Defined Variables upper section of the Data worksheet as follows:


Enter AROWS into cell A1 and 1439 into cell A2.,
Create the Column Headings section of the Data worksheet.,
Enter the Column Formulas.,

See the article How to Create a Spirallic Spin Particle Path or Necklace Form or Spherical Border for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation.",How to Create an S Curve Pattern in Microsoft Excel," However, a basic understanding of design principles, such as what happens to a curve when one adds to it versus when one multiplies to it, would be helpful -- so starting fresh might be a good idea too. Here, a basic adjustment is added to the Garthwaite Curve. That adjustment is a little complicated but the user is encouraged to substitute their own values and observe the effects of so doing.;

Make sure your computer meets the system requirements.,
Download the VMware software.,
Install VMware Workstation.,
Open VMware.,
Click File.,
Enter in the details for the operating system.,
Name your virtual machine.,
Set the disk size.,
Customize your virtual machine’s virtual hardware.,
Set the virtual machine to start.,
Wait for your installation to complete.,
Check that VMware Tools is installed.,
Start a virtual machine.,
Stop a virtual machine.,
Move files between the virtual machine and your physical computer.,
Add a printer to your virtual machine.,
Connect a USB drive to the virtual machine.,
Take a snapshot of a virtual machine.,
Become familiar with keyboard shortcuts.",How to Use VMware Workstation," Because you will be running an operating system from within your own operating system, VMware Workstation has fairly high system requirements. If you don’t meet these, you may not be able to run VMware effectively.


You must have a 64-bit processor.
VMware supports Windows and Linux operating systems.
You must have enough memory to run your operating system, the virtual operating system, and any programs inside that operating system. 1 GB is the minimum, but 3 or more is recommended.
You must have a 16-bit or 32-bit display adapter. 3D effects will most likely not work well inside the virtual operating system, so gaming is not always efficient.
You need at least 1.5 GB of free space to install VMware Workstation, along with at least 1 GB per operating system that you install.;
, You can download the VMware installer from the Download Center on the VMware website. Select the newest version and click the link for the installer. You will need to login with your VMware username.


You will be asked to read and review the license agreement before you can download the file.
You can only have one version of VMware Workstation installed at a time.

, Once you have downloaded the file, right-click on the file and select “Run as administrator”.You will be asked to review the license again.
Most users can use the Typical installation option.
At the end of the installation, you will be prompted for your license key.
Once the installation is finished, restart the computer.

, Installing a virtual operating system is much like installing it on a regular PC. You will need to have the installation disc or ISO image as well as any necessary licenses for the operating system that you want to install.


You can install most distributions of Linux as well as any version of Windows.

, Select New Virtual Machine and then choose Typical. VMware will prompt you for the installation media. If it recognizes the operating system, it will enable Easy Installation:


Physical disc – Insert the installation disc for the operating system you want to install and then select the drive in VMware.
ISO image – Browse to the location of the ISO file on your computer.
Install operating system later. This will create a blank virtual disk. You will need to manually install the operating system later.

, For Windows and other licensed operating systems, you will need to enter your product key. You will also need to enter your preferred username and a password if you want one.


If you are not using Easy Install, you will need to browse the list for the operating system you are installing.

, The name will help you identify it on your physical computer. It will also help distinguish between multiple virtual computers running different operating systems.

, You can allocate any amount of free space on your computer to the virtual machine to act as the installed operating system’s hard drive. Make sure to set enough to install any programs that you want to run in the virtual machine.

, You can set the virtual machine to emulate specific hardware by clicking the “Customize Hardware” button. This can be useful if you are trying to run an older program that only supports certain hardware. Setting this is optional.

, Check the box labeled “Power on this virtual machine after creation” if you want the virtual machine to start up as soon as you finish making it. If you don’t check this box, you can select your virtual machine from the list in VMware and click the Power On button.

, Once you’ve powered on the virtual machine for the first time, the operating system will begin to install automatically. If you provided all of the correct information during the setup of the virtual machine, then you should not have to do anything.


If you didn’t enter your product key or create a username during the virtual machine setup, you will most likely be prompted during the installation of the operating system.

, Once the operating system is installed, the program VMware Tools should be automatically installed. Check that it appears on the desktop or in the program files for the newly installed operating system.


VMware tools are configuration options for your virtual machine, and keeps your virtual machine up to date with any software changes.

, To start a virtual machine, click the VM menu and select the virtual machine that you want to turn on. You can choose to start the virtual machine normally, or boot directly to the virtual BIOS.

, To stop a virtual machine, select it and then click the VM menu. Select the Power option.


Power Off – The virtual machine turns off as if the power was cut out.
Shut Down Guest – This sends a shutdown signal to the virtual machine which causes the virtual machine to shut down as if you had selected the shutdown option.
You can also turn off the virtual machine by using the shutdown option in the virtual operating system.

, Moving files between your computer and the virtual machine is as simple as dragging and dropping. Files can be moved in both directions between the computer and the virtual machine, and can also be dragged from one virtual machine to another.


When you drag and drop, the original will stay in the original location and a copy will be created in the new location.
You can also move files by copying and pasting.
Virtual machines can connect to shared folders as well.

, You can add any printer to your virtual machine without having to install any extra drivers, as long as it is already installed on your host computer.


Select the virtual machine that you want to add the printer to.
Click the VM menu and select Settings.
Click the Hardware tab, and then click Add. This will start the Add Hardware wizard.
Select Printer and then click Finish. Your virtual printer will be enabled the next time you turn the virtual machine on.

, Virtual machines can interact with a USB drive the same way that your normal operating system does. The USB drive cannot be accessed on both the host computer and the virtual machine at the same time.


If the virtual machine is the active window, the USB drive will be automatically connected to the virtual machine when it is plugged in.
If the virtual machine is not the active window or is not running, select the virtual machine and click the VM menu. Select Removable Devices and then click Connect. The USB drive will automatically connect to your virtual machine.

, A snapshot is a saved state and will allow you to load the virtual machine to that precise moment as many times as you need.


Select your virtual machine, click the VM menu, hover over Snapshot and select Take Snapshot.
Give your Snapshot a name. You can also give it a description, though this is optional.
Click OK to save the Snapshot.
Load a saved Snapshot by clicking the VM menu and then selecting Snapshot. Choose the Snapshot you wish to load from the list and click Go To., A combination of the ""Ctrl"" and other keys are used to navigate virtual machines. For example, ""Ctrl,"" ""Alt"" and ""Enter"" puts the current virtual machine in full screen mode or moves through multiple machines. ""Ctrl,"" ""Alt"" and ""Tab"" will move between virtual machines when the mouse is being used by 1 machine.

, Then activate the Data sheet and with the Shift Key depressed, do Copy Picture of A1:J8 and activate the Saves worksheet and do shift key + Paste Picture, or just do Copy and paste special formats, then values. The first way is easier a little because of the long note overflowing the column widths. Then activate the Chart worksheet and do shift key + Copy and Paste Picture into the Saves worksheet under the saved data. The reason for pasting the values also is because when formulas get pasted below this picture, they do not have the same references as when pasted at the top, so the results are different than on the the Data worksheet. But formulas still need to be preserved that have been altered, else it would be quite difficult to reconstruct images like this one years later.

Do you like to change the look and feel of your phone every now and then? Do you like to use third party apps if you're not satisfied with the ones that came with your phone? Do you heavily rely on Google's suite of apps(Drive,Gmail, Google Maps)? If so then consider buying an Android phone.
Do you like things the way they came? Do you want a smartphone that feels premium and also does not compromise on functionality? Do you rely on Apple's suite of apps(Apple Maps, iWork, iMessage)? If so, consider purchasing an Apple iPhone.;
, Do you prefer small, medium or big screen sizes? iPhone comes in a few standard sizes , 3.5 (diagonal) such as the iPhone 4S or the 4"" (Diagonal) like the iPhone 5 and the 5S or the new larger iPhone 6 (4.7"" screen) and the iPhone 6+ (5.5"" screen). By contrast, Android devices come in many sizes, ranging from compact, such as the Motorola Moto G and large, such as the Nexus 6.

, Do you like the latest and greatest specs? Do you want blazing fast processing speeds and a camera with loads of megapixels? You may consider buying the top end Android smartphones or the iPhone 6+., It may not have blindingly fast processor speeds or a monstrous RAM, but it performs just as well, with seamless performance. The iPhone's UI is quite easy to use in contrast to Android, which presents a slight learning curve., No smartphone is unquestionably better than the other.

Keyboard. Try to type some words using the iPhone keyboard and some with Android keyboard. Both are virtual keyboard with physical feedback(Only on Android phones) but you may find that one is better suited to your fingers and the way you type than the other.






Media: transferring media files(Music,Movies) to your iPhone is be done via iTunes (software installed on your computer that takes a while to get used to) while Android can accept files by simply connecting a USB cable to your computer. The quality of the audio depends on the specific device.






Camera: similar to Music, Android photos can be transferred from the device to the computer via USB cable while iPhone photos need iTunes or special other software. The quality of the pictures depends on the specific device.






Radio: some Android phones have built-in FM radio ,While the Apple has launched an app to simulate radio functionality.






Simple or advanced: the iPhone interface make use of a single 'Home' button and the app interface usually display a virtual 'Back' button. Android 'Back' button is sometimes physical and it has another very useful 'Details' button that usually displays advanced options. If you never look for any advanced features you will not miss this button but it often(depending on what app you use) comes in handy.







, Android updates take time as they have to be tested and customized to the manufacturer's theme. Except for the Nexus series and a few other phones, android updates take a few months after a new version has been launched.

Call your phone's manufacturer.,
Confirm that your phone has a removable battery.,
Find your cell phone's model number.,
Find your battery's serial number.,
Open a search engine of your choosing.,
Type your search criteria into your search engine.,
Review your search results.,
Purchase directly from the manufacturer.,
Keep a record of your purchase.",How to Choose a Mobile Phone Battery1," If your phone's battery is failing while still under warranty, many pertinent manufacturers will offer to replace it for free; this provides you with a reliable source from which to receive your battery.


Even if your phone isn't under warranty, the manufacturer may be able to point you in the direction of a reputable battery source.
Due to the sheer number of calls your manufacturer's customer service line is likely fielding, this step may take a large chunk of time to complete.;
, If your call to your phone's manufacturer proves unsuccessful, you'll need to replace the battery yourself. Specifically, you should determine whether or not you can quickly and easily remove your phone's battery; most Android phones fit this criterion, whereas iPhone users should skip ahead to the ""Choosing a Charger"" section.


Usually, if your phone has an easily-removable battery, you will be able to access the battery by sliding a panel off of the back of the phone.
If you have an iPhone, you can send it in to an Apple store to have the battery replaced. This process is expensive, but you run the risk of ruining your phone and/or voiding your warranty if you attempt to remove the battery yourself.

, If you still have your user manual, you'll be able to look up your model number there; otherwise, you'll have to find the model number on your phone's casing. Once you find the model number, be sure to write it down--when you search for pertinent battery replacements, the model number will narrow your search considerably.You can usually find a device's user manual online if you can't locate it.

, The serial number's location will vary depending on your phone's model, but you can usually find this information on the back of the battery; keep in mind that you'll have to remove the battery to view the serial number. Write this information down as well, since you'll use it to search for a relevant battery. Other information you should know includes the following:


Battery type (e.g., Lithium Ion vs. NiCAD).
Your phone's manufacturing date.

, To research your replacement battery options, you'll need to enter your phone's information and the battery type into your chosen search engine.


Google and Bing are two common search engine choices.

, You should type your phone's manufacturer name (e.g., ""Samsung""), its name (e.g., ""Galaxy""), the model number (e.g., ""S4""), the phrase ""replacement battery"", and the battery's serial number. Once you've entered the correct search criteria, tap ↵ Enter to search.

, You should see a variety of options at the top of your search engine's page, some of which will have accompanying star ratings. As a matter of principle:


Look for reputable sites such as Amazon, Overstock, or department stores' online branches (e.g., Best Buy or Walmart). You should consider carrier stores (e.g., Verizon or Sprint) reputable sources as well.
Avoid sites without either direct ties to your phone model or probable cause for selling batteries, such as forums, free classifieds sites like eBay and Craigslist, and any other third-party sites.
Try to find batteries with the same serial number as your current battery. Some batteries are manufactured as mass replacements for a group of serial numbers, but if you can find the specific one for your phone, do so.

, Most manufacturers have a profile on Amazon or Overstock; make sure that your chosen battery is officially licensed by a manufacturer before purchasing it., In case your new battery doesn't work, having a record of the sale on hand might get you either a new one for free or (ideally) your money back.

Review affordable plans with larger carriers.,
Opt for a plan with a mobile virtual network operator.,
Opt for a regional carrier.",How to Choose an Affordable Cell Phone Plan2," Signing up for a plan with a large carrier can be tempting since they offer extensive talk and text coverage, access to 4G networks, and reliable internet access.To find an affordable plan with larger companies like AT&T, Vodafone, or Verizon, consider how many phone calls you make and how much data you use each month. You can find an affordable plan for a single line if you opt for lower data usage each month.Browse online or talk to an agent at local cell phone shop to discuss your options.

, Mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs, are carriers that offer low-cost services by leasing wireless capacity from the larger mobile companies. Because they do not pay for the radio frequency emitted from cell towers, MVNOs are able to pass along savings to their customers. You can typically receive a subscription-based or contract-free plan through an MVNO.Boost, TracFone, StraightTalk, Consumer Cellular, and Cricket are some MVNO providers in the U.S.
CoopVoce, Cubic Telecom, and Euro Information Telecom are MVNOs based in Europe. Transatel is a European MVNO that operates in several countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Switzerland.Yuantel is a popular MNVO in China, while Plintron, a MVNO based in India, serves 22 countries., Some carriers in the U.S. cater to particular regions and counties. These carriers offer great customer service and competitive prices. Because of roaming contracts, however, they only offer 3G service. This can be an affordable option if you don't frequently travel outside of the coverage area.Cincinnati Bell, Southern Cellular, and the Union Telephone Company are small carriers that serve local communities and regions in the U.S.See if there are regional carriers in your area.

Opt for a no-contract plan.,
Buy prepaid phone minutes.,
Sign up for a family plan.,
See if there are employer discounts.",How to Choose an Affordable Cell Phone Plan3," A monthly bill with a contract plan can be costly. Your bill may include access fees, activation fees, and monthly rate fees. In addition, you will be paying an expensive termination fee if you wish to terminate your contract. Choosing a cell phone without a contact is a straight-forward, simple way to save money. These plans are easy to cancel and your monthly bill won’t be peppered with additional fees., This option can help you save on your monthly bill if you know how frequently you use your phone each month. When you buy prepaid phone minutes, you are paying for your cellular service before you use it. You won’t be able to go over your allotted data or voice minutes, which means you won’t incur unexpected overage fees. If you do run out of minutes, however, you will have to wait until the next month to reload your minutes or change your plan.Although you can save money each month by purchasing prepaid minutes, you may end up paying more for your phone. These plans require that you pay the full retail price for your phone, which can be costly if you opt for a smartphone., Many carriers offer plans to customers who wish to bundle multiple phone lines. If you and your family use a lot of data each month and send a lot of text messages, a family plan may help reduce your monthly payments or help you avoid overage fees.These plans usually offer free mobile calling between family members, and all of the phone lines are compiled into one easy-to-read bill each month., Check to see if your company has partnered with a cell phone carrier. You may be eligible for discounts through this partnership. Some carriers offer discounts for teachers, military service members, and state and federal government employees. Talk to a human resources representative at your company or talk to a carrier representative to find out you are eligible for employee discounts."

Consider purchasing a new charger.,
Check to see if your charger is up-to-date.,
Verify your phone's make and model.,
Research prospective charger models.,
Check to see if you can buy a charger from a store.,
Keep a receipt from your purchase.",How to Choose a Mobile Phone Battery2," For devices that don't have easily-interchangeable batteries (e.g., iPhones), you may need to purchase a new charger to combat falling battery life.


While you can send an iPhone in for a battery replacement, to do so is often expensive if your battery is no longer under warranty., If you're trying to use a three-year-old charger for a six-month-old Android, for example, you'll notice a decline in battery charge speed.

, While many chargers can be used for several generations of phone, knowing your phone's exact make and model can help you pinpoint a newer charger.


Knowing your device's serial number will also help narrow your search.

, You'll want to find chargers stocked by your manufacturer; any chargers from third-party sources are liable to cause damage or perform inadequately.


Amazon and Overstock are great places to look for chargers.

, While online purchasing is convenient, stores are less likely to accidentally stock inventory from third-party manufacturers than online retailers.


For example, an iPhone user might go to one of Apple's store locations in order to buy a new charger.

, If your charger fails to perform adequately, you'll be able to return it for a replacement or a refund.

Work out how much you plan to use your phone.,
Take a look at each network's offer of prices, some are cheaper for texts and some favour phone calls.,
Once you have decided what network you want, you should begin to compare the various price plans.,
Before you go any further: Do not look at handsets in other networks that aren't available to your network.,
Think of how you will use your phone and the tools you would like on your phone, e.g.,
Look on the network's website, browsing through the phones that you would like and the phones that are available based on the contract or calling plan you want.",How to Choose a Mobile Handset," Will you use it for emergencies only, when out meeting somebody or in place of your landline or a combination?;
, Choose which network looks right for you. It is a good idea to ask the people you will call the most what network they use, calls are often cheaper within the same network than between networks. You should also look at external reviews of the various networks to see what they do well or poorly. You may find that reception is poor for one network where you live or that people are unhappy with the customer service on another one.

, You should have some idea of how much you intend to use your phone. Based on the monthly cost of the contracts or the cost per minute/per text of calls on a Pay As You Go plan you should be able to work out whether it makes better financial sense to have a contract or Pay As You Go. For example, if you expect to spend £5 a month on calls and texts and you can get a phone from between £70 and £100 it will be better value than a contract where you will pay £25 a month and get a free phone. If, however, you will make hundreds of minutes worth of phone calls every month, it will be better value to get a contract that gives you those minutes for free.

, The only way you can use a phone from a different network is to get various codes. And even then you're at the risk of you not being able to use all of the tools on your phone, such as the internet.

, bluetooth, or a camera. Do you need your phone for email and when travelling abroad? Are you going to carry it in your pocket or handbag and if so do you need to worry about size and weight or is functionality and available gadgets more important?

, You can also go into the store, where a 'friendly member of staff will be there to guide you'. You should compare the features of each potential phone in order to help decide which phone best suits you.

Buy a cassette adapter at your local Radio Shack or Best Buy store.,Check the manual first.,
Buy a wireless transmitter- these devices usually attach to your iPod, and require you to tune your radio to a designated FM frequency.,
Also, there is always some interference or static when transmitting and there are times you can't find an open frequency, especially if there's a powerful radio transmitter nearby.,
Try using RCA cables for better sound quality.

,
Remove the stereo from your dash.,
Be sure that your stereo has some type of input in the back.,
Decide where you will be putting your iPod and where you want the wire going.,
Precautions- If its RCA then the RCA to 1/8th inch jack should be fine, get an extension for the 1/8th inch if you need it but don't go splicing wires!,
Check that everything works, which usually requires switching to an ""input"" mode or ""auxiliary"" mode on your stereo.",How to Hook up Your iPod to a Car Stereo," They generally run about $15 dollars, and it's an easy way to listen to your iPod in your car. You simply plug a standard plug into the earphone jack of your iPod, and a cord runs from that to a cassette which you place into the cassette player. Tune your car stereo to cassette, and you're ready to go (any cassette adapter at those stores should work with the iPod, so don't get suckered into buying the most expensive name brand). It is worth noting that the cassette tape is an analog medium, and therefore suffers some loss in audio quality. Sometimes these adapters will not work as the deck will sense that nothing is moving as far as the tape wheels, and will eject the adapter.;
,, While this is certainly the quickest and easiest fix, wireless transmitting has its drawbacks. First, you will notice a slight decrease in your overall battery life. Second, FM radio transmissions do not usually exceed 96 Kbps, which means that any high-quality audio files (128 Kbps MP3 or higher, AAC, FLAC, MP4, etc...) are down-converted before being transmitted to the radio. This loss in quality is irrelevant to the untrained ear, but intermediate and advanced listeners may notice a drastic difference, especially on high-end stereos., Sometimes it's difficult to position the transmitter so that you get a clean signal.

,, If it's a newer vehicle, you may need a special tool which usually just looks like 2 U's. The pointed ends are inserted into small holes on either side if the stereo. Pull the handles away from each other (pull the left one to the left, and the right one to the right). Pull, and the stereo will slide right out. If you have an older car, you will have to find out how to remove the dash and/or stereo. Sometimes it is just a couple of screws, and the rest is held on with clips. On others, you have to figure it out with trial and error (but remember, the more errors you make, the worse your car will probably look in the end). Ask some friends who may have the same car as you, or look it up online so it's done right.

, If your stereo has a CD changer input in the rear with RCA inputs, you aren't out of luck - but you may be out another $50 because you need an adapter that changes the CD changer input into simple left and right RCA inputs. If you already have RCA inputs, there will be 2 of them (left and right audio). Usually, one is red, one is white, and they may or may not be covered by small rubber caps (depending on how old it is). If there are caps, you can remove them.

, Once you've done this, drill your hole. For a way to make sure the wire never falls through the hole (forcing you to take everything apart to get it), go to step 7. Otherwise, skip to step 8.

, Don't drill any holes; instead, find a way to run the cable under the dash.

, If it works, you're all set. Replace your stereo and dash. You're done.

Be careful where you leave your iPod.,
Clean your iPod regularly.,
Be careful with your headphones.,
Know what you put on your iPod.,
Protect your Warranty.,
Don't use the headphones that come with the iPod, it will mark you as a target for thieves even when the iPod itself is in your pocket.

",How to Keep Your iPod Safe," When you buy your iPod or receive one, make sure you buy the protective stickers. These can be easily stuck on and not only protect your iPod from scratches and falls, but they even protect it from water. Leaving an iPod outside in the rain with no protective layer will probably result in it shorting out, whereas an iPod left in the rain with protective stickers has more chance of surviving. There are also slip on covers you can buy, which protect the iPod very well. They come in all sizes and colors, and can be easily changed. Protective stickers and covers are essential. You can also by a small case or iPod sock to put your iPod in.;
, Leaving your iPod outside on the garden table while you put out the washing may seem like a good idea at the time, but when the rain is pounding heavily on your ceiling and you realize you left your iPod outside, it won't. So always keep your iPod close to you, where you can't forget it and where it can't be damaged. Don't leave it outside or near water or near a kitchen appliance.

, Obviously you wouldn't clean it with soap and water, or anything else. There are special cleaning wipes available from shops like Myer and other big department or electronic stores. Lint free cloths will work best. Make sure you use the wipes properly. Clean your iPod about once a month. It might not seem important to do this, but iPods can get clogged up with dirt.

, Yes, it's not the iPod itself, but it's also important to take care of your headphones. Never turn the iPod up on full volume, for it can seriously damage them.

, There are iPod viruses that will crash your iPod and delete boot or root files that your iPod depends on. Also if you have a virus on your computer it can be transferred to the iPod and either go to any other computers you use it with or harm your iPod.

, Don't try to trick your iPod by using emulators. A lot of emulators are viruses that can crash your iPod and void your warranty.

Find out what year your Prius is and what sort of radio you have.,
The first and easiest solution is to fall back on the standard cassette adapter.,
Look into using an FM transmitter.,
Find an auxiliary (AUX) sound input device for a Prius or a compatible Toyota adapter.,
Research two other products: iPod2Car and DICE Electronics.,
A more expensive but slightly more featured option is produced by Vais Technology called the SLI.,
Wait for the Coastal Tech iPod interface; This is a custom designed system specific for the computer that the Toyota Prius uses.",How to Hook up an iPod in a Prius," Then look below at all the options, they will vary in price range and are sorted in order. Ironically, one of the cheapest solutions on here has equal sound quality to the most expensive option.;
, Obviously you need to have a cassette player. Griffin Technology has a $30 cassette adapter, that senses what you are doing with the tape deck and translates that to the iPod (FF, REW, Pause, etc.). Regular (non-automated) adapters can be found on eBay for $1-$10 (including shipping!). Cassettes do not have the best sound and can be finicky, but it gets the job done with no installation. This unit has not been shown to be compatible with the Toyota Prius.

, Monster and other brands make very nice models that include the transmitter and chargers all in one. Audio quality can be poor, especially in cities or areas that have tons of radio stations. At the very best you are only going to achieve FM radio quality which isn't that great. You tune your car stereo to a specific channel to hear your iPod. This is the no frills and no extra installation method. Consider getting an iPod remote if you would like to control your iPod from your wheel without having to look down. While not perfect it allows you to change the tunes without having to take your eyes off the road.

, This connects to the back of the Prius radio using a specific Toyota cable. Multiple companies sell these ""Aux In"" adapters. You can access the data by tuning to Sat1 or Sat2 and receive a pure audio input from your iPod or other device. This lets you have a clean and very good sounding input but no special control of the device. Different versions exist, supporting headphone jack, RCA connectors, etc. Some people also use this with DVD players. Adding a Video Input mod would let you play video on the Prius screen. This is the cheapest solution for the best audio quality. You can also listen to anything compatible with your input cable. Installation is necessary and you will still have to have a separate charger and control the unit by hand or remote. If you are willing to do some installation work but are on a tight budget this is the way to go for excellent sound quality.

, These are interfaces that use the existing car's CD changer interface to control basic iPod functionality. For the Prius that means steering wheel controls, and touch screen. Unfortunately it might mean losing the ability to control your existing CD changer standard in most 2005 models. The device is more or less faking that the iPod is a CD changer. So none of these models will let you see the current song or utilize the Prius touch screen to access specific iPod data. This method is also rather expensive ($200), and you will have to purchase an auxiliary in. As of 11-25-05, the iPod2Car site says it is not compatible with any model of the Prius.

, The SLI, like the options above, allows you to control your iPod with the steering wheel and controller using the same CD exchanger technique. Only this unit will display the song names from your iPod. The SLI does have integrated power and AUX-in built into the unit. The technology allows you to keep all factory installed components (such as 6-disc CD changer, CD/DVD changer). When you connect SLI to the audio system, your car recognizes it as an additional CD or MD changer. The unit costs $299.99! And It is the most feature filled product currently on the market.

, When it's released, it will allow you to fully control your iPod with the touch screen and wheel as well as keeping your existing CD changer functional. Integration into the car will be flawless. It's as if Toyota supported the iPod in the first place. Look at Coastal Tech's website for more info. This is the only interface that will fully display songs, play lists, etc. on the Prius screen. Installation is required but very simple as it's designed for the Prius specifically. NOTE: The Coastal E Tech iPod interface mentioned above is generally considered (at least on Prius-related websites) to be vaporware and will never be released.

The bottom port of the iPod should slide directly into the charging component of the dock stand. If you are using an adapter, you will need to plug the charger end of the cord into the same charging port at the bottom of the device.


Make sure that you have the correct dock or adapter for your device.Both the iPod Universal dock and Apple Universal dock should work with your iPod.
If you use a digital AV adapter, you will need to use Apple's 30-pin digital AV adapter. You will not be able to use the lightening adapter since it is not compatible with the iPod.

, The exact ports you will need to use will vary depending on your choice of adapter or dock. Regardless, you will need to find the right cable and hook it up to both the dock/adapter and TV set.


If you use a dock, use the Apple Universal dock with an Apple Composite AV cable and an iPod Universal dock with an iPod AV cable or an S-Video cable.

When using an Apple Composite AV cable, plug video-in and audio-in components to the TV and the video-out and audio-out components to the dock. The same applies to the iPod AV cable.
When using the S-Video cable, you will need to locate the Line-In and Line-Out ports on your dock and TV. These ports are circular and have rows of pins in them. The S-Video cable should have corresponding components on either end that can fit into these ports on the TV and dock.


For the adapter, you will need to find a plug that can connect the rectangular 30-pin port of the adapter to the corresponding port on your television.
Note that the digital AV adapter and iPod Universal dock with an S-Video cable can both improve the quality of your video, with the former being better than the latter. The other dock connections will only achieve a video resolution of 480i, however.

, The method you use will vary depending on your TV set. Check the instruction manual for further assistance.


You may need to switch to a certain channel to change the input, especially if you have an older TV. Usually, it will be channel 2, 3, or 4.

The iPod Touch (and iPad and iPhone) no longer support this, as they are running iOS. There are a lot of technical reasons as to why this is, but all you need to know is that methods that you used to use with a classic iPod no longer work.


This method also works for classic iPods.;
, In order to get your music tracks off of your iPod Touch, you'll need a transfer program that can access your iPod Touch's file system. Some of the more popular programs include:


Sharepod (Windows) - You can download Sharepod from getsharepod.com

Senuti (OS X) - You can download the free version from wstein.org/senuti/

gtkpod (Linux) - You can download gtkpod from gtkpod.org/wiki/Home


, Don't worry, you won't be using it. Sharepod (and most other iPod management programs for Windows) requires iTunes in order to function so that it can use the connection services that iTunes installs. Once you install iTunes, you never have to open it and can uninstall it as soon as you're finished.



Click here for instructions on installing iTunes.

, Close iTunes if it opens automatically. For most transfer programs, you'll have greater success if you start with the iPod Touch already connected.

, It should detect your iPod Touch automatically and list all of your music tracks in the main window.


If you are using Senuti, you'll be asked to specify a few things before you can access the main interface, such as where you want to store transferred songs.

, Depending on the program you are using, you may be able to check individual songs that you want to transfer or select all of your songs at once.

, Click the ""Copy to computer"" or ""Transfer"" button to begin copying the selected tracks to your computer. If you're using Sharepod, you'll be prompted to select the location that you want the copied tracks to be moved to.


If you're copying a lot of music, the transfer process may take a while.

, Once the transfer process is complete, you'll be able to find the copied music at the location that you specified."

, If your parents see a light in your bra, it's a ticket to getting it taken away. Also, if you're hiding your phone, make sure that it's off or on silent. Imagine driving to school and then hearing your ringtone coming from your breasts. That will definitely raise suspicion.

, Position it where the screen faces your breasts. If someone calls you off-guard, you can see who it is, and turn it off with one click of a ""Lock"" button.

, Before you leave, check if it is bulging out. If it is, make quick touch-ups.

If you use the method outlined in this section, you'll won't be able to determine which tracks are which until you load them into a media player. This is because the iPod Classic renames all of the files when they are added to the iPod.

, This is only possible on iPod Classic models (not iPod Touch), and allows you to access the iPod's files as if it was a USB drive. You can put your iPod Classic into Disk Mode without opening iTunes.


iPod devices with a Click Wheel - Toggle the Hold switch on and then back off. Press and hold the Menu and Select buttons until the Apple logo appears (about six seconds). As soon as the Apple logo appears, release the Menu and Select buttons and immediately hold the Select and Play buttons until the Disk Mode screen appears.
iPod Nano - Press and hold the Sleep and Home buttons (7th gen) or the Sleep and Volume Down buttons (6th gen). Hold the buttons until the Apple logo appears.

, Double-click your iPod in your Computer/My Computer window or on your desktop. This will display the folders contained on your iPod.

, This is the folder that contains all of the music files on your iPod. You'll notice that none of the filenames say what the song is; the iPod renames all the files that are imported using iTunes. Luckily, the files still contain the metadata with all of the song's information, which will be loaded by the media player of your choice.

, Since you won't be able to tell what song is what, unless you go through each song one at a time, your best bet is to just copy everything over to your computer. When you open the songs in a media player, you'll be able to see the information there.


If you're copying a lot of music, the transfer process may take a while.
