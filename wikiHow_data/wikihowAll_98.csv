All versions of the iPod Touch, iPod Shuffle, and iPod Nano use flash memory instead of a traditional hard drive. This means there are no moving parts that can fail or connections that can become severed. There is no practical way to secure or replace an iPod Touch hard drive, as the flash memory unit is built into the circuitry.

, Make sure that the iPod is turned off and locked with the Hold switch toggled on before opening your iPod. This will ensure that you don't accidentally turn it on while working on it.

, It is recommended that you use a specially-designed opening tool to pry the back off, but you can also use a thin flathead screwdriver. If you use a screwdriver, you run the risk of scratching the case.


Some guides recommend a sturdy plastic guitar pick as a good substitute tool.
Insert the tool into the small crack between the metal and plastic parts of the case.
Work the opening tool around the edge, gently prying the back off the iPod.
Press the tabs inside the shell using your tool to help release the casing.
When the case is open, don't force the two halves apart, as there is a small ribbon cable attaching the front to the logic board.

, The large, rectangular metal object in your iPod is the hard drive. Check the cables connecting the hard drive to the rest of the circuitry to make sure that nothing has come loose.


Gently lift the hard drive out of it's housing to reveal the connector cable underneath. It is usually connected to the logic board with black tape. Remove the tape and press the connector firmly into the board. Replace the tape and the gently replace the hard drive. This loose cable is the source of a significant number of hard drive problems., This will create a square that will be thick enough to apply pressure onto the hard drive. If you don't have a business card handy, cutting a square out of a cardboard bar coaster will work as well.

, Center the folded business card on the hard drive, taking care not to disrupt any of the cables.

, With the card in place, push the backing onto the iPod. Push it in with care, and ensure that all of the tabs click back into place.

, After you replace the backing on the iPod, you will likely need to restore it in order to ensure that nothing corrupt remains. See the first section of this article for detailed instructions.

Diagnose the issue.,
Open your iPod.,
Once inside, remove the back plate and place it perpendicular to and raised about 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the center line.,
Remove the troublesome part, retaining as much of the bad part as possible.,
Reset the new part exactly as the old one had been (for ordering, check the link below) Make sure that all wire connections go back exactly as they had been.

,
Once the iPod parts are all together, replace the faceplate on the back plate exactly as it had been and squeeze it back together until it clicks.

",How to Fix iPod Hardware Problems," Take some time and figure out if the problem is the hard drive, LCD screen, logic board, or otherwise. Make sure you get the right part because typically iPod parts, even aftermarket models, are fairly expensive. You can always test to see what hardware is bad by grabbing one of your friends' iPods and playing trial-and-error with parts.;
, This is easily done, thankfully. At least this is the case with video iPods and comparable models(lacquer face and aluminum back plate). Take a small flathead screwdriver(like an eyeglasses style one) and insert it on either the left or right side into the groove where the black/white faceplate meets the aluminum back plate(on other iPod models, where the aluminum meets the plastic). Then push the flathead in and down. This will release the clips(there are 3 on each side) that hold the back plate onto the faceplate.

, This will release tension on the battery and headphone jack cables, which I might add, are extremely delicate.

, Sometimes parts don't come with absolutely everything needed to remount. An example is the headphone jack which also includes the hold switch. That main white mounting unit isn't included with a replacement so you'll need to keep that.

You will need to have a 3rd generation iPod for recording voice and other sounds.,
To use of these devices you simply need to mount them on the top of your iPod.,

Once your iPod has catalogued the recording session, the session will be listed in the voice memos menu.,

Once you have copied your audio files from your iPod to your computer you can delete them from your iPod to free up some space.",How to Do Voice Recording With Your iPod," A 3rd generation iPod will have the dock connector on the bottom. You have three choices when it comes to “input”:



Belkin Voice Recorder: The Belkin voice recorder is quite compact when it isn’t attached to your iPod. This means that being portable, you can pack it up and take it along with you without having to find extra room. The one disadvantage of a Belkin is that it doesn’t have an external headphone jack so when you want to plug in your ear buds you will have to remove the device first. The great thing about the Belkin though, is that it has a small speaker that allows you to see what you have just recorded.

Griffin iTalk: The Griffin iTalk is a little more sophisticated than the Belkin both in the way it functions and the way it looks. The iTalk has a chrome speaker grill as well as an external jack that can be used for both output and input. The iTalk is compact and tiny enough that you can leave it permanently attached to your iPod.

Universal Microphone Adapter: The Universal Microphone Adapter is also made by Belkin and is a great choice if you are looking for an external microphone for your iPod. The Adapter plugs into the top of your iPod but rather than having a built in speaker and microphone it as input and output jacks that are separate and give you three-position settings.;
, Try to position yourself about two to four feet from the source that you are recording. There is no need to hold the recording device up to your mouth and yell as they have been designed to be used from a few feet away from the source.

, Choose the record option. Your iPod will keep track of the length of time for each recording session. When you have finished recording you can either (1) press on the pause button or the stop and save option. You will want to use the pause option if there is more audio that you want to add to that particular session. Use the stop and save option when you want to completely end the recording session and are ready to have your iPod catalog it.

, The session will be referred to by date and time with no title included. You can then listen to the session and then delete it or you can choose the record now option to record another audio track. The controls for recording audio are simple and easy to use. When you want to access your recording sessions you don’t even need to have the microphone attached to your iPod. All you need to do is navigate to the extras menu and choose voice memos.

, Connect your iPod to your computer. If you have the settings set to manually update you will be notified that there is a new voice memo on your iPod and will be asked if you want to add this memo to your iTunes library. You might want to decline this option. This is because your recording sessions are only labelled by time and date and they won’t be of much use when it comes to tracking. Plus, you won’t want to mix your voice recording sessions with your music files.

, You will find the sessions added to the library with titles that look much like “7/3/06 11:41 AM”. This is why you will want to change your preferences to manually manage songs and playlists. This is done by clicking on the iPod icon (found in the lower right corner of iTunes) when your iPod is connected to your computer.

, This will put an iPod icon on your desktop. This icon will give you access to your iPod just the same as you would get with any FireWire hard drive. Click on the iPod icon and search for the recordings folder. You will find your audio sessions in this folder. The file names will be easy to recognize as “20060719 12345a.wav”.

, Because you want your .wav files to open in QuickTime instead of iTunes you want to have control over these files. Click on the file to highlight it and then use the ctrl-click method to display the contextual menu.

, Then click on the change all button so that the mapping is applied to all the .wav files that are on your computer. After this, when you click on a .wav file, it will open in QuickTime at which time you can edit them the way you want. You might also want to change the file name from “20060719 12345a.wav” to something such as “Philosophy Lecture.wav”.

, Create a working method that is right for you. Consider leaving iTunes completely out of the picture and organizing all of your audio files in a music directory specific for your .wav files. This can save you a lot of time when it comes to editing your audio files.

, If you haven't bought an iPod already, consider one that doesn't get scratched as easily such as a Nano or a Shuffle. Even though they lack some features of internet connectivity, touch screen or a screen altogether, they do have their benefits such as they're cheaper, smaller and don't have shiny chrome backing so they don't get scratched as easily.

",How to Live Without an iPod," iPod is one of the more expensive models available; many other brands and models exist for much lower prices, often with comparable and even superior features.;
, These are typically much cheaper than iPods, and they are useful to have even when you have your iPod. However, they are usually bigger and cannot fit in most pocket sizes.

, Try to get a variety, preferably with several artists to a CD. The ""Now That's What I Call Music!"" CDs are recommended for this purpose.

,,, MP3 CD players generally will play CDs like any other CD player, but will also play any music files (as in computer data files) in MP3 format (and sometimes other formats, depending on the player) that are on a CD. MP3 files take up much less memory than standard tracks on a CD, so many more of them can be stored on one CD. Some MP3 CD players will even play CD-RW discs, which, unlike regular CDs, can be erased and rewritten multiple times. It is entirely possible to hold hundreds of songs on one CD and play them with an MP3 CD player, providing hours of music for a fraction of the price of an iPod and with almost no disadvantages (though the physical size disadvantage still remains).

The hold switch is more common on older models of iPod, like the iPod Shuffle and iPod Classic. The hold switch is usually a small metal peg on top of the device. Pushing it to one side exposes a small orange sliver and locks the device. Pushing it back restores normal function.
Newer iPods like the iPod Touch usually use a screen lock feature to keep from activating. This isn't easy to confuse with a frozen device — you'll be able to call up the screen and deactivate your lock as normal.;
, Sure that your iPod is frozen? Use the built-in restart feature, which will turn your iPod off, then back on, regardless of whether or not it's frozen. When it turns back on, it should work normally.


The way to do this varies for the different iPod devices — see the steps below for details., To reset the Original iPod through 3rd generation, press and hold the ""Menu"" and ""Play/pause"" buttons until the Apple logo appears.


Once the logo appears, give the iPod plenty of time to reboot. Don't attempt a second reset until you see the normal menu screen. This advice is true for all other devices in this section as well.


, To reset almost all iPod models with a ""clickwheel"" (4th generation onward; most Nano models), press and hold ""Menu"" and ""Select"" (the button in the center of the wheel) until the Apple logo appears.

, To reset iPod Shuffle models, just use the built-in power switch. Move the power switch into the ""off"" position, hold it for five seconds until the device turns off, then switch it back on.

, To reset iPod Touches, press and hold the ""Sleep/wake"" button (the one on top used to dim the screen) and the ""Home"" button (the one at the bottom of the front of the device.) Hold these together for about ten seconds until the Apple logo appears.

, Newer iPod nano models can vary slightly in their reset methods. To reset the iPod Nano (6th generation), press and hold the ""Sleep/wake"" button and the ""Volume Down"" button for about six seconds until the Apple logo appears., To reset the iPod Nano (7th generation), press and hold the ""Sleep/wake"" button and the ""Home"" button for a few seconds. The screen should go dark — you may not see an Apple logo. Eventually, the normal home screen should return."

Try plugging your iPod into its charger.,
Try letting your iPod run out of battery.,
Try restoring factory settings when all else fails.,
Consult Apple Support for additional help.",How to Unfreeze an iPod2," One simple trick that can sometimes ""unfreeze"" an iPod is to simply plug it in. When the iPod starts receiving power, it will often momentarily interrupt any ongoing processes to acknowledge that is charging in (by displaying a battery icon, lighting up, etc.) This can often ""thaw"" your iPod without any other action needed on your part.


This works whether you plug your iPod into a computer or an outlet — either will do.

, Is your iPod so frozen that you can't even reset it with the steps above? In this case, one thing you may want to try is leaving your iPod in a safe place for a long time so that the battery can completely drain. When this happens, the iPod will be forced to turn off, ending whatever process is keeping it frozen. After this, simply plug it in, let it charge for a few minutes, and try to turn it back on.


Your iPod may take quite some time to run out of battery completely, especially if it didn't freeze in the middle of an energy-consuming task like playing music. If your iPod froze in an ""idle"" state with a full battery, it may take days for it to drain, so be patient.

, If nothing you do seems to get any results, you may want to try the last-resort method of wiping your iPod's memory completely. This will return it to its factory settings, meaning that any music, apps, videos, and personal data on the device will be lost. If possible, you will probably want to back up your files onto one or more computers. To perform a factory reset:Connect your iPod to your computer and start iTunes.
If possible, take the opportunity to sync your iPod with iTunes so that you can easily retrieve your files after the restore.
If you have an iPhone, turn off the ""Find my iPhone"" feature under Settings > iCloud to disable the activation lock.
Select your iPod in iTunes.
On the ""Summary"" tab, click ""Restore""
Confirm your choice in the pop-up window. Wait for the process to complete as iTunes downloads the new OS files and restores your device.
Follow the set-up prompts once your iPod restarts to get it working again.

, Have a problem that's not addressed in this article? Apple's official help resources are a great place to start.

When you use this method, you won't be able to tell what song is what until you add them to a media players library. This is because the song files are renamed when they're added to your iPod's library.


This method is useful for transferring songs that you didn't purchase from iTunes to a new computer or a friend's computer. It is also useful for retrieving your songs when nothing appears on your iPod.
This method is not very useful for people trying to extract a single song or just a few out of hundreds. This is because the songs will not have legible file names, so finding the exact song you want will be difficult, if not impossible.
This will NOT work for iPod Touches, iPhones, or iPads. Use the method above for those devices.

Connect your iPod to your computer via the USB cable by plugging the square end into a USB port on your computer and plugging the other end into the iPod itself while it is on. If you have iTunes installed already, it should open automatically. If this is the very first time using your iPod, iTunes may prompt you for basic setup information.


If you don't have iTunes yet, you'll need to download and install it before you can sync your iPod. Luckily, it's completely free and easy to install.
If you're using Windows, when you plug in the iPod, you may get a pop-up window asking which program to use to open the device. Since we'll be using iTunes, you can select this from the list or just close it and open iTunes manually.;
, To be able to put songs, videos, or other media files on your iPod, you'll need to import your media into iTunes first. You can do this for audio and video files by either dragging a file from where it's located on your computer into the iTunes window, or selecting File>Add File to Library..., then locating the file(s) you wish to import.


To be clear, it's also possible to add files to your iPod with other software, including Windows Media Player and Winamp. However, to use iTunes' syncing feature, the files you want to add need to be imported into your iTunes library.

, Select your iPod from the list of devices — depending on the version of iTunes you have, this will be either in the top corner of the screen or on the side, but it's always prominently featured. You should now see a screen showing your iPod's storage capacity and data settings.

, Look for the ""Music"" tab at the top of the window. Click it to access your iPod's syncing options for music. By default, your iPod will sync with all of the music in your iTunes library — that is, when you sync, everything in your iTunes library will go to your iPod.


The ""Sync only checked songs and videos"" option is a nice feature if you want to sync only some of the files you have in iTunes to your iPod, rather than all of your files. For more information on this, see the section below.

, Change the tab at the top of the windows to ""Movies"". Here, as with your music, you'll see that the default setting is for all of your videos to transfer to your iPod when you sync. Here, you can choose to sync only select movies and playlists if you wish. This is covered in more detail in the section below.


Note that you can also just turn off video syncing entirely by unchecking the ""Sync movies"" box. If you do this, your videos will stay in iTunes — none will transfer to your iPod.

, If you'd like to add any of these other file types to your iPod, navigate to the appropriate menu with the tabs at the top of the window and follow the same basic steps as above. While the individual menus will vary slightly for each file type, the general idea is the same for each — you'll want to use the options on each page to decide whether or not to have the files sync automatically or not, then, if not, specify which files or playlists you want to have sync.


""Photos"" is the exception here because it allows you to sync directly from a file on your computer, rather than through your iTunes library. To sync a photo collection with your iPod, make a folder on your computer with all of the photos you want to sync (you can also use the ""Pictures"" folder that is usually the default save location for image files). Click the ""Sync photos from:"" button on the ""Photos"" menu, then click on the drop down arrow and locate the folder containing the image files you wish to sync.

, Now you're ready to sync. Navigate back over to the ""Summary"" tab of your iPod in the iTunes window. Click the ""Sync"" button (usually at the bottom of the window next to the bar displaying how much of your iPod's storage is in use, but can vary based on the version of iTunes you have). Your iPod's screen should read ""Sync in progress, do not disconnect."" The exact message can differ depending on your iPod model but will always be similar.


Your iTunes window should also show you that it's syncing at the top part of the window where it usually displays what you're listening to.
For some versions of iTunes, the ""Sync"" button may instead be labeled ""Apply"" on the Music, Apps, Movies, etc. screens if you've changed your sync settings., When iTunes reads ""iPod sync is complete, okay to disconnect"" you can disconnect the iPod safely. Your iPod screen should change from displaying a ""do not disconnect"" warning to a battery icon, indicating that the iPod is charging and is no longer syncing.


To be clear, you don't have to disconnect your iPod immediately after syncing. You can also leave it in to charge or change your syncing preferences and sync again.

"
"
Connect your iPod as normal.,
Create a new playlist.,
Add songs to your playlist.,
Set up your iPod to sync only from the playlists you want.,
Sync.",How to Sync an iPod2," Rather than syncing your entire collection of Music, Apps, Movies, and so on, you may want to sync just part of this collection to your iPod. This may be for several reasons: For instance, if you have too many songs for your iPod to hold all at once, you'll be asked to either deal with iTunes syncing random songs from your list each time you sync or to pick which songs to include. To sync select files and playlists, begin as you normally would: by attaching your iPod to your computer with its USB cable.


In this section, we'll make a playlist that includes the songs we want to sync onto our iPod, then sync this playlist (and only this playlist) to our iPod.

, Launch iTunes, then open your music library. To make a playlist, click File>New>New Playlist from the toolbar at the top of the screen. Give your playlist whatever name you want when prompted — an easy-to-remember name like ""iPod Sync"" or something similar always works, but you can use whatever name you wish.

, Next, drag songs you wish to sync to your iPod into the new playlist you just created. To do this, navigate to your main music library and drag the files you wish into your new playlist. For some versions of iTunes, you may need to right click the file want, then select ""Add to Playlist"" from the menu and pick the playlist you just made from the second menu.


You can also select more than one file at a time by selecting a file, then shift clicking another file above or below it to select both files all the files in between. If you don't want to select all of the files in between, use a control (ctrl) click to select the ones you want.

, Open your iPod and navigate to the ""Music"" tab. You should see several options: ""Sync Music"", ""Entire music library"", and ""Selected playlists, artists, albums, and genres."" Make sure ""Sync Music"" is checked, then check ""Selected playlists, artists, albums, and genres."" Now, find the playlist you made in the list below and check its box.


Make sure all of the other playlists in the list are left unchecked, unless, of course, you'd also like these playlists to sync.

, Navigate back to the ""Summary"" tab and click the ""Sync"" button (as noted above, depending on your version of iTunes, this button may instead read ""Apply""). Your iPod should begin to sync as it normally would. When it's done, browse through your iPod's music library — it should only contain songs from the playlist you selected. If you'd like to add more music, add new songs to the playlist you've chosen to sync in iTunes, then sync again (or sync new playlists altogether).


In these instructions, we've synced a music playlist, but the same basic approach applies to playlists of movies and videos as well. To sync playlists of other types of media, make playlists including the files you want, open your iPod, and use the tabs at the top of the screen to navigate to your apps, movies, and so on. For each type of media, be sure to select ""Add only selected playlists..."" or the equivalent option.

To set up Wi-Fi syncing, first connect with a USB cable.,
Enable Wi-Fi syncing on the ""Summary"" menu.,
Restart iTunes, your iPod, and your Wi-Fi router.,
Connect the iPod to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.,
Wait for your iPod to sync automatically.",How to Sync an iPod3," With iTunes version 10.5 and higher, it's possible to sync your device remotely with a Wi-Fi connection.However, to be able to do this, you'll need to connect normally with a USB cable first. Do this as you normally would, then open iTunes to get started.

, Open your iPod in iTunes, then, on the ""Summary"" page, scroll to the bottom and look for the option ""Sync this iPod over Wi-Fi."" Check the box next to this option. After you do this, click the ""Apply"" button at the bottom of the screen (next to the bar showing how much of your iPod's storage you're using) to make your change.

, Next, exit iTunes and reopen it. Then, turn off your iPod and turn it back on. Finally, power your wireless router (or your other Wi-Fi source) off for about 30 seconds and turn it back on. Changes to a device's Wi-Fi settings (including an iPod's) are notoriously tricky to get to take effect, especially while the devices remain on. In practical terms, resetting your devices gives them a chance to ""react"" to your new settings.


The actual explanation for resetting your router and iPod is a little more complicated, mainly because there are multiple reasons why Wi-Fi devices have a hard time registering new connections without resetting., To connect your iPod to your Wi-Fi, open its ""Settings"" menu, then click the ""Wi-Fi"" option. Make sure your iPod's Wi-Fi is set to ""On"" at the top of the menu, then pick your network from the list of options. If necessary, enter your network's security key to gain wireless access. After you connect, test out your connection by trying to open Safari on your iPod and browse the internet.


If you're having problems connecting to your Wi-Fi, there can be a variety of reasons. For instance, devices like microwave ovens, cell phones, and satellite dishes for TV sets can interfere with the Wi-Fi ability of an iPod.In this case, try turning off or removing any sources of interference, then moving your iPod very near to the router and trying again.
Connection problems can also be caused by your router's firewall. In this case, you may need to adjust your firewall settings to allow your iPod to connect. If you're using a Mac, you may want to consult Apple's official support resources for system-specific instructions for connecting your iPod to Wi-Fi., If you've enabled Wi-Fi syncing and your iPod is able to connect to your Wi-Fi network, your computer and iPod should soon recognize each other. Your iPod should begin syncing automatically, displaying its typical ""Sync in progress"" message as it does so. When it's done, your iPod should be updated with the files from your iTunes library that you've designated for syncing (see the sections above for information on choosing which items from your library you want to sync).


Note that if you move away from your Wi-Fi source while syncing is occurring, the process may not complete, potentially leaving you with a partly-synced iPod.

, Your device may have come with a small, soft cloth that is made to be lint-free. This type of cloth won't scratch the surface of the iPhone or iPod touch. Gently wipe the screen from top to bottom with the cloth to remove fingerprints.Use a circular rubbing motion to remove substances that don't wipe away easily.
Don't press down to hard on the screen, or you may remove some of the oleophobic coating.

, If your device's screen has a bit of dried soda or some grime that you couldn't wipe away with the cloth alone, you can wet it a little with clean water. Moisten it with a few drops, squeeze it out, and use the dampened cloth to remove the stuck-on substance.Do not soak the cloth in water. Excess water will harm the screen on your device, so it's important to get it just a little wet before cleaning.
Don't let moisture sit on the screen. Wipe it away immediately with a dry part of the cloth.
Avoid wiping the ports. If moisture gets into these areas it could cause permanent damage to your device.

Be willing to get your device professionally cleaned.",How to Clean Your iPhone or iPod Touch Screen2," All chemicals, including substances like window cleaner or antibacterial cleaner, have the ability to remove the protective coating on the screen, which will inevitably result in a shorter life for your device. Never use a substance other than water to clean the screen.


Don't use cleaners meant for LCD screens, either. Those are meant for a different type of material, and they're harmful to iPhone and iPad Touch screens.
Even natural substances like vinegar and lemon juice are too abrasive for cleaning the screen of an iPhone or iPod screen.

, Water is fine to use in very small amounts, but it should never be directly poured or dripped on the screen. Always use a microfiber cloth to transfer a little moisture to the screen, and make sure to wipe it off right away with a dry cloth.Submerging an iPhone or iPod Touch in water is a sure way to ruin it. Don't try to soak it in an effort to remove a stubborn stain.
If you accidentally get too much water on the screen, examine the user manual that came with your device to determine what steps you can take to fix it.

, If you spill coffee, juice, or another substance on the screen, grab a microfiber cloth and wipe it off right away. This will prevent it from drying on the screen and becoming difficult to remove at a later date.

, Using an abrasive towel, or even a paper towel or napkin, can scratch and damage the screen of an iPhone or iPod Touch. If you lost the cloth that came with your device, you can pick up a new one at a computer store, or use a cloth meant for cleaning the lenses on glasses.

, If your device's screen has been damaged by a stain that won't wipe away, check out the warranty that came with it to determine whether you can take it in to have it cleaned or repaired. Trying to do so yourself may result in further damage.

If your alcohol is in a spray bottle, use about three squirts onto the surface of the cotton ball., Do this after you've disconnected your earbuds. Move in a gentle back-and-forth motion across the surface of the mesh. Pay special attention to the edges between the mesh and the plastic. This is where much of the dirt and earwax build up.

, The options may include inverted, gray-scale, gray-scale inverted, or low light.

, You can use the controller to move the area on which you are zooming in.

If you want to zoom into a third-party app, try taking a screenshot of the page and then zooming in on the screenshot image.

, Place your thumb and pointer finger at opposing points of the screen as if preparing to pinch a cheek., Note that the faster you spread your fingers, the more quickly the screen will zoom.

, Reverse the motion of zooming in. Gently ""pinch"" your fingers towards each other while keeping contact with the screen.

, Though the zoom distance is pre-set, this can often be a handy shortcut for quickly glancing at something in detail, and can sometimes be repeated to zoom deeper into high-detail objects like maps. This technique is a bit more difficult to get used to, but very useful when mastered. The double-tap behaves differently on pictures than on text:


Repeated double-taps on a picture may zoom in until a set point, and then begin to zoom back out. Double-taps may also just zoom in, then stop zooming when a threshold is reached.
A double-tap will fit text to screen, in order to allow an optimal reading comfort.

, The USB end of the charger is a rectangular piece of exposed metal; if you look at its end, you'll see a block of plastic inside. It plugs into the horizontal rectangular slot on the outward-facing side of the power adapter.

The block of plastic inside of the USB end of the charger cable must fit on the opposite side of the block of plastic in the adapter's slot. If you're having trouble fitting the USB end into the adapter, try flipping the USB end over.

, There are two types of charger cables for your iPhone and iPod:


Lightning - iPhone 5 and up; iPod touch 5th Generation and up. This cable's charging end is relatively narrow and flat.

30-pin - iPhone 4S and down; iPod touch 4th Generation and down. This cable's charging end is wide and flat.

, If you're using a Lightning cable, the charger should fit no matter how you insert it into the device's charging port; however, a 30-pin charger must be inserted with the grey rectangle icon on side of the charger facing the same way as the iPhone's screen., A second or so after plugging it in, your device should make a sound (or vibrate), and the screen should briefly display a battery icon.


If your device doesn't begin charging, try using a different electrical outlet.

, USB ports are slim rectangular openings with three-pronged symbols next to them. You'll typically find them on the sides of laptops' casings, though their locations vary for desktop computers.

If you can't find a USB port on your desktop computer, try looking at the sides or back of the keyboard, back of the CPU, or behind the desktop monitor.
Some MacBooks don't have USB ports.

, The USB end of the charger is a rectangular piece of exposed metal; if you look at its end, you'll see a block of plastic inside. When plugging the cable into the USB port, make sure the three-pronged symbol on the USB cable is facing upward.

You may need to disconnect the cable from the power adapter cube first. Do so by gently tugging on the USB end of the cable until it disengages from the power adapter.

Be polite in general.",How to Avoid iPod Oblivion," When multi-tasking by listening to your music or fiddling with your technical gadget, and trying to switch lanes and change gears at the same time, or cross a busy road, your efficiency is reduced considerably and you are, in effect, ""cocooned"" from the rest of the world. Your concentration needs to be focused on the task that matters most – whether it be walking, cycling, jogging, or driving – not on the appreciation of the music at the expense of all else.


Problems that can arise when your attention is diverted by texting, emailing, or listening to music include ""unintentional blindness"" or ""divided attention"".The inattention caused by ""gadget fiddling"" affects cyclists, joggers, ""pedestrians"", and drivers. The error of inattention is compounded when you're listening to the iPod and texting or talking on your phone simultaneously.Avoid switching off your brain when you switch on your gadget.;
, Be a savvy ""pedestrian"" and take great care when walking and listening to your iPod at the same time, especially in busy city areas.


Always turn off the iPod when crossing roads.The music can distract you from hearing cars suddenly turning around the corner into your trajectory. It does happen, more often than pedestrians realize.
It is even better to visibly remove your earphones from your ears before crossing, because if you are hit by a car (and survive to tell the tale), it will likely be argued in a court or insurance case that you were distracted by the iPod. If your earphones have been removed, it's harder to argue this!
Look before crossing the road. Both ways. And again. Don't allow iPod oblivion to give you a sense of invulnerability.
Never assume that a driver has seen you and will stop. Don't walk across the road jiving to your groove with an unrealistic hope that all the cars are going to just stop - be sure that the cars have actually stopped first.
Turn down the iPod when walking past construction sites or roadworks. You need to remain alert for danger around construction sites or roadworks that provide pedestrian walk-around areas. Someone might make a mistake and call out a warning – best if you're able to heed it rather than remaining in oblivion.
While jogging, don't allow the heady mix of fast exercise and fast-paced music dull your traffic senses.

Be courteous to others on the sidewalk. Wearing an iPod is not an excuse for ignoring other people and walking into them. Be conscious of other people around you and avoid walking into them.

, Cycling in the city is dangerous enough without cutting yourself off from the noise that can alert you to the potential of danger.


Turn down the sound level of your iPod so that it is similar to background noise, not like a front row at a concerto. Make sure that you can hear traffic noise.
Avoid using the iPod when you are navigating heavy traffic and dangerous intersections. Flick to ""pause"" when safe to to do so, or even better, think ahead and don't switch it on at all prior to entering such a zone.
Don't use your iPod when cycling in known dangerous areas, such as crossing a bridge, cycling under a tunnel, around blind corners, etc., and anywhere where you share the bike lane with pedestrians but you lack a clear sight of possible pedestrians (who might be suffering from iPod oblivion themselves).

, While you can plug your iPod into the car stereo, your enjoyment of the music could overwhelm your traffic senses.


Don't play the music loudly. Loud music is a driving distraction and can prevent you from hearing sirens from emergency vehicles, or can remove warning sounds from other vehicles performing maneuvers hat might be about to affect or even impact you.
Avoid using an iPod when working with heavy machinery at work. Your mind should be on the job, not the iPod. No doubt your boss agrees!

, While listening to an iPod can while away boring minutes and even hours when using public transportation, there are times when it is important to take care not to fall into iPod oblivion.



Stay alert when traveling late at night. By all means enjoy your music, but be alert for possible dangers at all times. An opportunistic thief or drunk might see your iPod oblivion as a good reason to choose you to harass.
Be sure to keep a good eye on when it's your stop to get off. iPod oblivion shouldn't be the excuse for not arriving at work on time!

, Wearing an iPod at the check-out counter might enable you to blot out the realities of grocery shopping, but it's discourteous to use iPod oblivion as a way to disconnect from the human beings with whom you're interacting. Remove your iPod before purchasing items and connect – talk to the cashier, smile, and make it clear that you're no zombie. While this isn't likely to cause an accident, it is likely to improve your shopping experience and the retail assistant will feel a lot better about serving you as a result.

Click ""Done"".",How to Add Music from iTunes to iPod," To begin the process of adding music to your iPod, open iTunes. If you haven't already connected your iPod, do so as soon as iTunes opens. Within a few moments, iTunes should recognize your device — you should see a small ""iPod"" button with a picture of an iPod appear in the upper right. Click this button.


Note that for iPads, iPod Shuffles, and other iTunes-compatible devices, the process will be nearly the same, though the label on the button that appears will change.;
, After clicking the ""iPod"" button, you'll see a screen displaying an array of information about your iPod, including its name, storage capacity, and several other options. We don't need to deal with any of these — simply click ""Music"" at the top of the window to proceed.

, When it comes to putting music on your iPod, you have two options: iTunes can automatically transfer your entire library to your iPod, or it can allow you to manually choose which songs you want to add. Check the bubble next to ""Entire music library"" if you'd like to add your entire library, or check the bubble next to ""Selected playlists, artists, albums, and genres"" if you'd like to pick your songs manually.


At this point, you may also want to check the boxes for other miscellaneous options below. For instance, if you'd like to add any music videos you have in your library, check ""Include music videos,"" and so on.

, If you chose the manual option for adding songs to your iPod, you'll want to use the menus on the bottom half of the iTunes window to choose which songs you want to add. Scroll through the menus for playlists, artists, genres, and albums, checking the boxes next to the choices you'd like to add to your iPod.


For instance, if you want to add all of your Al Green songs to your iPod, you would scroll through the list of artists until you found Al Green, then check the box next to his name. On the other hand, if you only wanted to add the songs from his greatest hits album, you would scroll through the list of albums until you found Greatest Hits by Al Green, then check the box next to it.
Don't worry if some of your choices overlap — iTunes won't add the same song to your iPod twice.

, Whether you chose the manual or automatic option for adding songs, click the ""Sync"" (short for ""Synchronize"") button on the bottom right of the screen when you're ready to add your songs to your iPod. iTunes should immediately begin to add the songs you selected to your iPod. You can monitor your progress by watching the progress bar that should appear at the top of the iTunes window.


Don't disconnect your iPod during this process. This will disrupt the syncing process, preventing you from getting all of your songs. In addition, this can also cause iTunes to freeze or stop working properly., Congratulations! You've successfully added songs to your iPod. To play your songs, disconnect your iPod, plug in a pair of headphones, select a song from the ""Music"" option at the bottom right of the iPod's main menu, and start listening.


Note that, while this guide describes how to add music to your iPod, the process is nearly identical for other forms of media. For instance, if you want to add movies to your iPod, you would click ""Movies"" at the top of the iTunes window after clicking the ""iPod"" button, then proceed in basically the same fashion.

, To take songs off your iPod, connect it to your computer and proceed as you normally would to the Syncing screen. If it isn't already selected, click the bubble next to the ""Manual"" option for adding songs. Now, scroll through the windows of artists, playlists, etc. and uncheck the boxes next to the selections you'd like to remove from your iPod. When you're done, click ""Sync"" to apply your changes.

, If you don't already have iTunes, you will probably want to download and install it before beginning. Though it's possible to add music to your iPod without iTunes (see above), this is by far the most common way to do so. In addition, iTunes is free, simple to download and install, and offers a variety of helpful features, including in-program access to the iTunes Store and options for automatically syncing your iPod library to the library on your computer.


To download iTunes, simply visit iTunes.com and click the ""Download iTunes"" link in the upper right. Supply your email address and click ""Download Now"" to start the download.

, Your new iPod should be packaged with a white USB cord. This cord allows you to transfer media between your computer and the iPod. Connect the skinny, flat end of the cord to your iPod (there should be a corresponding port on the bottom of the iPod) and the other end to one of your computer's USB ports to begin.


Note that models of iPod other than the standard version (like, for instance, the iPod shuffle) will have cords with differently-shaped plugs.However, all varieties of iPod cord will have one end that plugs into a USB port.

, When you connect your iPod, iTunes should launch automatically. If it doesn't, you may open it manually. Within a few moments, iTunes should recognize the iPod. You will know this is happening if you see the trademark Apple logo appear on your iPod without prompting. You may also notice a progress bar appear at the top of your iTunes window indicating that iTunes is downloading data required to interface with your iPod. Wait for iTunes to complete before proceeding — this may take several minutes.


If iTunes doesn't seem to be recognizing your device automatically, don't despair. iTunes is somewhat notorious for experiencing problems with new devices. Try disconnecting your iPod and reconnecting it, opening and closing iTunes, and restarting your computer before reaching out to iTunes support.
Additionally, if your iPod is low on power, you may need to wait for it to charge off of your computer's power supply for several minutes until iTunes is able to recognize it.

, Eventually, iTunes should automatically launch a large welcome message. Click ""Continue"" to proceed. Next, you'll see a screen that says ""Sync with iTunes"". Click ""Get Started"" on this screen. You will be brought to a screen that presents you with a variety of options, including:


Updating your iPod software to the latest version. If your iPod software isn't current, clicking ""Update"" will download and install the latest version of the software. This keeps your iPod up-to-date with all of the features and security fixes.
Creating a backup of your iPod data. If this is the first time you're using your iPod, you won't have any data to back up, but choosing an automatic backup location (either your computer or the iCloud) ensures you won't have to worry about it in the future.

, To exit the current screen, simply click the blue ""Done"" button in the top right of the iTunes window. When you do this, you'll be brought back to whatever you were looking at in iTunes before you began.

From here, you can add music to your iPod as you normally would (see ""Using iTunes"" section above).

Look for modules compatible with your device.,
Download a module and install it.,
Go to the Modules menu.,
Reboot.,
Tinker and play around.,
Keep your eyes peeled for new or updated modules.",How to Use the Xposed Framework," First you’ve got to get the Framework installer, which you can find in the Xposed Module Repository site.;
, Before you can install the Framework, you have to make sure that “Unknown Sources” is checked in Settings>Security>Device Administration. This enables installing third-party application not found at the Google Play Store, and then you can directly install it if you downloaded it on your device.


If you got it from your PC or Mac, you’ll have to transfer it somewhere on your phone, and then install it. It should look like the typical Android application installation procedure.

, Locate the app icon, and press it. Once it has loaded, go to Framework. Here you can install or update the framework in case yours is somehow outdated. Once that’s done, reboot your device. There is a “Soft Reboot” button below which will reboot the device more quickly.

, You can do so once the Framework is installed.

, This should be the one you installed, and not the .apk. Go to “Download” where you will find a list of all the modules you’ve installed, those you’ve installed and need updating, and those you haven’t installed yet as well as the version of the Framework itself.

, These may not be apparent at first glance, but you’ll get used to them as you sift through the many modules. For modules made specifically for a particular device, the device type will usually be present in the module name so be wary of installing a module not meant for your device.

, When you find a module you want (Gravity Box is a good one which is a pack of universal mods rolled into one module), tap on it, and that will take you to a screen which shows the features, description and comments left by the developer. Read these carefully so you’ll get a better understanding of what the module does and a bit of how it does it as this will help with configuration in the later portion. Tap on the “Download” button, and the installer will start downloading the module. After downloading is finished, install it like a typical application.

, After you’ve sifted through all the modules you can use and have downloaded them, go to the Modules menu and tick off the boxes of the modules you’ve downloaded and installed. (Modules do not appear in your App Drawer without enabling them first in this menu and rebooting).

, Once you’ve ticked off those boxes, reboot your device using the “Soft Reboot” button in the Framework menu. After that, you’re ready to customize your device!

, Once you’ve rebooted, you’ll notice that there are new icons in the App Drawer corresponding to each module you’ve downloaded and enabled. Go to each of these, and play around with the various settings. Most do not require a reboot to become effective, so there are lots of options to play around with.

, There are plenty of useful and awesome modules being added and updated often, so make sure to keep an eye out for installed modules on the Download menu which need updating. Modules like the all-in-one packages (like Gravity Box) are also common, so make sure you do not download too many modules with overlapping features.

,,


Under Windows XP, a 'security alert' may pop up about the Flash player attempting to make its connection. Allow it for this case. The connection between your 'connector' and the debugger is client-server, so this looks to Windows like a server is attempting to provide a service, which some not-so-nice applications also do.
For the 'Web based Flex debugger', make sure .swf files are associated with something (browser or Flash player) to run the debugger when launched from the shell, or from a command prompt or script/batch (start.exe xray.swf).
There should not be a pop-up or other kind of warning visible about 'No SWF to connect to'.
If you have problems, go back to the Extension Manager and make sure the extension is ENABLED (the little check box should be checked).

If your headphones connect via USB, click here.;
, Make sure that the plug is completely inserted, or the sound may not come through both ears.


If your headphones use a 1/4 inch (6.3 mm) plug, typically found on professional and studio headphones, you'll need an adapter, a sound card, or an amplifier in order to use them.

, If you headphones include a microphone, it will usually have a separate prong. If the prong is color-coded, it will be pink. The microphone jack on the computer is typically located near the headphone jack.


Older computer's may not have a microphone jack. If this is the case, you'll need a sound card or other digital processor.

, This is typically caused by the headphone jack not being properly inserted. The jack will need to be inserted all the way in order for the headphones to play from both ears.Examine the cables on the headphones as well. Frayed cables could be causing problems with the headphones. Cables will typically start fraying near the connectors.

, If your headphones aren't picking up any audio, but you know that they work on other devices, something may be wrong with your computer's sound processor.

My headset isn't being recognized when I plug it in.",How to Use Computer Headphones2," Make sure to plug it directly into your computer, and not into a USB hub.

, Usually when you plug your USB headphones into your computer, it will automatically switch so that audio plays through the headphones. This doesn't always happen however, and you may have to manually make the switch. If you have a program currently playing audio, it may continue playing on the speakers after you switch to headphones.

Determine if you need an amplifier.,
Use a portable amplifier for your portable MP3 player.,
Use an amplifier and DAC on your computer for high-quality headphones.",How to Use Computer Headphones3," Amplifiers are designed to provide more power to your headphones. Different situations may require different amplifier setups.Earbuds and small headphones likely will not benefit from an amplifier. Noise-canceling headphones also do not benefit from an amp, as they have built-in to handle the noise-canceling feature.
Professional and studio headphones may require an amp in order to hear at acceptable levels if they are ""high-impedance"" headphones. These headphones require more power in order to output at suitable volumes. Portable users with over-the-ear headphones will benefit from a pocket amp, while desktop users will benefit from an amp with a built-in digital-to-analog converter (DAC).

, If you have a set of good, over-the-ear headphones, you'll get better sound out of your MP3 player if you use a portable headphone amplifier. These are small devices that you charge at home. DACs do not benefit portable players, so don't use an amplifier/DAC combo.


Plug the amplifier into the headphone jack of your portable MP3 player, and then plug the headphones into the amplifier.
Adjust the volume through the amplifier. Raise the volume on your MP3 to a few notches below maximum, and then use the amplifier to adjust the volume to a comfortable level. This will provide the best quality sound.

, An amplifier will provide more power to your headphones, allowing for a better range of volumes. The DAC (digital-to-analog converter) is what translates the digital audio into an analog signal that the headphones can play. All computers have a DAC built-in to the motherboard, and a sound card acts as a DAC as well. These built-in DACs are usually sufficient for most basic uses, but you'll want an external one if you listen to loss-less music or do audio editing on the computer.


If you are using an external DAC, you'll get the best quality by connecting it to your motherboard using an S/PDIF (TOSLINK) cable. If your motherboard doesn't support this, you can connect most DACs using USB.
If you need surround sound processing for video games, you'll be better off with an internal sound card instead of a DAC.
If your amplifier and DAC are separate, connect the DAC to your computer, the amplifier to the DAC, and then your headphones to the amplifier.

, Use the included USB cable to connect the iPod to your computer., If you keep your iTunes up to date, you may have problems getting the jailbreak tool to work. The TaiG utility requires iTunes 12.1.1, which is a slightly older version. In order to downgrade to this version, you'll need to completely uninstall iTunes on your computer first.

Clean your iPod Touch every day.,
Buy a screen protector and a case for your iPod Touch.,
Make sure if you don't have a screen protector or a case, you don't drop it.,
Make sure it does not fall in water or snow, and that you do not freeze it or allow it to over heat (eg.,
Don't carry your iPod around in back pockets/places it can get bumped easily.,
And don't forget your earphones!",How to Extend the Lifetime of Your iPod Touch," This will ensure that it's not smeared with fingerprints, and you'll have better accuracy when using the screen. Some of the older generation iTouches come with a cleaning cloth, but if yours did not, then a glasses cleaning cloth works just as well. To use either, just breathe on the screen, then rub till the fingerprints are gone.;
, There are many different options for both of these items, for example with screen protectors you can get: clear, anti-glare, mirror and a few more. With cases, there are ones that just snap straight onto the back, and ones that you slip the iTouch into. Also, when buying a case, it is important to ensure that all buttons and ports (USB/audio jack) are exposed or at least can be used WITHOUT removing the case.

, Otherwise, the screen will crack and you might get cut. Also, make sure you clean it more regularly, especially the screen, as your fingers are coming in direct contact of the screen.

, If you keep it in your back pocket, there is the possibility of it either getting bent, or you sitting on it. And if it gets bumped, you could break the screen, scuff or even chip it.

, You still need to take care of your earphones, as without these your iTouch is basically useless. Some tips on looking after your earphones are:


Don't wrap them around things tightly. Constant bending of the wire inside the plastic casing can snap it . Plus when you want the earphone's wire extended (eg. if you put the iTouch in your pocket and run the wire up under your shirt to your ears) then it will want to coil up.
Don't leave knots in your earphones wire.
Don't dunk your earphones in water or snow, and don't freeze them or let them over heat. Same as the iTouch, this will kill them.
Don't have the volume up to loud! Not only is it bad for the earphones, it can also affect your hearing.
Clean them. Sometimes your earphones will have earwax and stuff from your ears on them, not only is that gross but it's not good for the earphones. Just wipe it off with a soft cloth (being careful, of course, not to push it into the speakers).

Tap Settings > Wi-Fi and turn off Wi-Fi, then turn it back on.
Verify you are in your Wi-Fi station's signal range.

, You may need a program which is capable of capturing and saving SHSH Blobs and APTickets. These are files which your phone uses to communicate with Apple and allows it to install a firmware lower than the current version. The two best programs for this are iFaith and TinyUmbrella.


There is currently no way to downgrade without having these files.
You can only downgrade to the level that you have these files for. So, capture your version 6 files and you can use them when version 7 comes along, etc. iFaith has an option to use someone else’s files, however, so if you don’t have the files saved you can use that program.
In iFaith, save blobs by clicking ‘Dump SHSH Blobs’ or find someone else’s by clicking ‘Show Available...’. Your phone will need to be plugged in to your computer. The tickets should be saved automatically at the same time for most devices.
The following can be downgraded: an iPhone 2G, iPhone 3G, or iPhone 3GS, or iPhone 4; an iPad 1G; an iPod Touch 1G, iPod Touch 2G, iPod Touch 3G, and the iPod Touch 4G.

, This is the most common program used for downgrading iOS devices.

, There are a number of places to find this online., If using Windows, you will need to run RedSn0w as an administrator (done by right-clicking on the icon).

, Use the included, standard USB cable. Once it is plugged in, put the phone into DFU mode.

,,,, This will allow you to choose the firmware you want to restore.


If you have an unlocked phone, click yes to prevent baseband updates.

, Click OK and Next to allow this.

, RedSn0w should attempt to find them automatically but if they can’t be located, you can bring them up manually on your computer. Just remember where you saved them!

, Once the Blobs are located the program should begin downgrading your device automatically.

, You may want to consider and Untethered Jailbreak, so you don’t need to repeat this process.

Learn the control and object of the game :


Tilt your iPod to control the doodle guy
Jump on enemies or tap to shoot them
Keep jumping higher and higher while earning points.,
Know that some special objects gets you higher.,If you go to the title screen and scroll your finger at the bottom, you can choose different worlds to jump in like Rainforest, Halloween, Christmas, Space, Regular Stage, Soccer etc

,
Try the cheat codes, type these cheat codes as your name to activate the cheats.,
As you go higher, aim lower.,
Plan to lose.,
Study your mistakes.",How to Be Good at Doodle Jump,";
, They include the spring sandals, rockets, propeller caps, super rockets (space theme and under water theme only), and trampolines.

,, To change your name, get to the ""Game Over"" screen. Type names like
""Ooga""(activates cavemen character from pocket god).
""Creeps""(changes the enemies).
""Bunny"" (your doodle guy gains an Easter bunny costume).
""E.B. or HOP"" (your doodle guy changes into E.B. from the movie HOP).
To disable the cheat codes, change your name back to normal.

, As you go higher, the platforms move faster back and forth and you have less time to gauge whether your jump will hit or miss a platform. It's tempting to aim for a higher platform but, by design, many platforms are just barely out of reach. Aiming for a lower platform is worth the extra time considering how long it would take to get back that lofty level.

, You of course want to set a new personal record each game but this amps up the pressure you feel to avoid mistakes and, as a result, prompts mistakes. Tell yourself that this is just a warm-up game (or two or five) and otherwise lower your expectations.

, After you lose, calmly recall exactly what happened before you crashed, died, etc. In retrospect, what could you have done to avoid that end? Started shooting earlier or from a lower platform? Jumping off the screen (left or right) to re-emerge on the opposite side so as to avoid a black hole or monster? It may take several games before you find the same scene but you'll be better prepared for it if you stay calm and try to learn from your mistake instead of going bonkers in frustration.

Look into additional fees.,
Figure out the average contract length.",How to Choose a Cell Phone," Cell phones come in different modes. The type of mode you want depends on how you plan to use your phone.Analog phones transmit signals throughout the air continuously. A wide variety of phones, from handheld phones to larger phones, come in analog mode. If you want to save money by opting for an older cell phone, go for a cell phone that comes in analog mode.
Digital phones provide more security. Eavesdropping and number-stealing is prevented via encryption, so you may want a phone in digital mode if you plan to go online using your phone. Digital phones generally have clearer voice transmission and sound. The battery life is also longer.
Most newer phones are dual mode, meaning they can be switched from analogue mode to digital mode. These can be great if you plan to use your phone in a variety of locations. When the signal is too weak to go digital, dual phones automatically switch to analog mode.;
, There are essentially four different types of cell phone operating systems: android, iOS, blackberry, and Windows. The type of operating system you choose depends on your personal needs regarding the cell phone.Android is one of the most widely used operating systems. It's easy to customize, so if you're tech-savvy you may prefer an Android. The main disadvantage is that the design is updated frequently, which can affect usability.
BlackBerries are great if you prefer a physical keyboard. However, BlackBerries tend to run slower than other operating systems. If you don't plan on using your phone for much beyond the basics, this may not be a problem. If you plan on going online a lot, you may want a different operating system.
Apple iPhones run on an operating system called iOS. If you own other Apple devices, an iOS phone will be most beneficial to you. While iOS phones are less customizable than Androids, they tend to be more user friendly and have the most popular apps.
Windows phones are relatively new, but are somewhat more versatile than regular smart phones. The display involves moving graphics and infographics, which may be helpful if you use your phone professionally a lot.

, You'll be holding your cell phone a lot throughout the day. Therefore, it's a good idea to go for a design that feels comfortable in your hand. Cell phones come in a variety of shapes, from square-like shapes to circular shapes. Pick a shape you feel comfortable holding.To get a feel of different cell phone shapes, make a stop at an electronics store. Experiment with holding a variety of cell phones.
It's easy to forget a cell phone is a physical object. As you'll be using your phone a lot, make sure you find a design you're comfortable holding and handling.

, Cell phones come in three types: smart phones, messaging phones, and basic phones. The type you need depends on how you plan to use your phone.A smart phone is the most advanced form of phone. In addition to calling and texting, you can access the Internet, download apps, take pictures, and upload music. A smart phone is essentially a mini-computer. If you plan on using your phone for a wide variety of activities, the smart phone is the best option for you.
A messaging phone allows you to make calls and send messages. It generally does not have internet access, although some do allow you to send emails. A messaging phone is one step below a smart phone. It's a great in-between if you're looking for a phone that allows for basic communication but does not need the added features of a smart phone.
A basic phone just allows you to make calls. If you don't plan on using your cell phone for anything other than phone calls, you can probably get by with a basic phone. It will be cheaper and less overwhelming to use than a smart phone.

, How long do you plan to use you phone? If you're going to take your phone with you on long work days, you'll likely want a high-powered battery. Look for a phone with a long battery life over one with a short battery life. However, if you don't use your phone much, you can probably get by with a shorter battery lifespan. When exploring phone options, make sure to check to see how long each phone's battery lasts.Battery life gets worse with with time. Keep this in mind. Even if you feel like you can get by with a one to two hour battery, you may want to go for a slightly longer battery life.

, Do you plan on taking a lot of pictures on your phone? If you're an Instagram junkie, you may want to invest in a higher quality camera. If you don't plan on taking too many pictures, the camera quality may not be as big of a concern.For most smart phones, camera quality will be 8 megapixels. More megapixels may produce higher quality photos, but this is not the only factor you should consider when it comes to photo quality. Make sure the camera has a flash. Otherwise, pictures taken inside or at night will come out blurry.
When shopping for cell phones, it's a good idea to take a few photos in the store. This will give you a sense of whether or not the picture quality is high enough for your needs.

, Phones access data in a variety of different ways. How you plan to use your phone can help you determine what kind of data plan you need.If you travel overseas a lot, look into a Moto X Pure edition. It's compatible with data types found in both the United States and parts of Europe.
4G and LTE data tend to provide the speediest data for smart phones. If you're looking for a basic smart phone, all your needs should be met with a 4G or LTE data type. However, bills can get high with these plans. Some phones provide Wi-Fi only data plans, where you can make calls and send messages when connected to Wi-Fi. This can be frustrating if you need to use your phone in an area without Wi-Fi, but it can save you money.

, Do you plan to use our phone to watch a lot of movies or TV shows? If so, you may want a larger screen. Smart phones generally get bigger with each new generation. Getting the most recent type of smart phone will provide you with the biggest screen.If you don't plan to use your phone to watch movies, screen size matters less. Think about saving some money and opting for a smaller screen.

, You should also think about screen resolution if you plan to use your phone to watch TV and movies. A higher resolution will provide better quality pictures and videos. As with size, opt for high resolution if watching movies and videos on your phone is important to you. If this is not important, save your money and opt for a lower resolution., Carriers charge for three basic services: text, talk, and data. When selecting your smart phone, make sure you find reasonable rates for all three types of services.Most modern cell phone users do not talk on their phones as much. Pay for as few minutes as you can when it comes to talk. However, if you do plan to talk on your phone a lot, be open to paying more. You should also watch out for extra charges in regards to night and weekend hours.
You should find a texting plan that charges $10 a month or less for texting. Anything more means you're overpaying. Texting costs cell phone providers nothing, so do not get suckered into paying exorbitant texting fees.

, Roaming fees can send your monthly bill up. When deciding on a provider, look at a map of your coverage. See which areas qualify as ""roaming."" If you frequent these areas a lot, find a different plan., It's a good idea to test out any new plan before committing. If a provider offers a month-long trial, take it. You can try that plan for a month and then see what your bill would look like. If you decide you dislike this plan, you can back out without penalty.Read the fine print on any contract, however. Some free trials will not automatically cancel in a month.

, Fees and surcharges can account for an extra $10 to $20 each month. While this is not a lot of money, it adds up over time. It's worth it to find a plan with limited additional fees. With every plan you look at, check the additional fees section. Look for a plan with less fees., You may want to cancel your contract at some point. You may find you're unhappy with a provider and would like a change. Some providers force you to sign a year to two year contract. This may be too much of a commitment. See if you can find a provider that offers a contract for 6 months or less.You should also look into how to cancel your contract. Some companies may have pricey cancellation fees, or may not let you back out of a contract at all.

What type of coverage will actually be used?,
How many minutes per month will be used?,
What is the monthly budget for the phone?

,
Finally, what kind of features do you plan to use?,
Take the answers from the previous three questions and start looking at plans.",How to Choose a Cell Phone Service," Where is the phone going to be when it is used? People often say “I need my phone to work at the lake.”. Does it? How often are you at the lake? Is it worth paying more money every month so your phone can work at the lake once per year, in the case of an emergency?;
, The simple fact is, you are either paying for coverage or minutes (or your bill is a ton money). Which one is more important, coverage or minutes?

,, If you plan to use extras like internet or texting, be sure to purchase a plan to save money, as these can be costly a la carte.

, You’ll quickly see that having a lot of minutes and great coverage is really expensive.

Frame your video so it doesn't need cropping; in other words, your finished video won't have a border around its edges.

, Take care not to put your finger in front of the lens.

Even if your recording isn't perfect, remember that the recording is for use as a study tool and is not a technical work of art.

, So that you will be able to read the important details of the video later, hold the Nano close to the monitor; manually ""zoom"" it in. This is the advantage of making a hand-held recording.

Alternate between holding the Nano close and far.

, Divide your recording into at least five or six chapters., Key in the chapter labels., On your computer, each chapter will be displayed as a large icon with the opening scene. Use your DVD player controls, like stop, pause, fast forward, and rewind, to get to the scene that gives you the best visual clue as to the contents of the chapter."

, Once you have verified that your phone works on your new service plan, you can cancel your old contract. Be firm while cancelling, and argue any fees that weren’t explained or written out when you signed the contract. If you are cancelling early, you will most likely be obligated to pay the early termination fee.

Review and test the customer database before release.",How to Create a Customer Database," Choose a product that is compatible with the word processing and other software tools used in the business. This will make it easier to import or export data from other sources, making it possible to avoid entering a large amount of data into the newly created database.;
, Most designs will include information such as company name, mailing address, physical address, contact name, telephone and fax numbers, and email addresses. Additional data such as information on contract terms, pricing, and notes on pending tasks associated with each client are often included in the data captured and maintained in this type of electronic resource.

, Along with providing a centralized resource to retrieve important data, think in terms of what types of reports could be created using the data, or if the database is intended for use as a resource in generating mailing labels, email lists, or even lists to use in fax broadcasting. Keeping this in mind will help in determining how to name each of the fields that will house data, and ease the process of creating report formats that pull from those fields.

, Create a simple template that follows a logical sequence when it comes to entering names, addresses, and other contact information. Doing so makes it easier to move from 1 field to the next with a minimum of interruption and complete the entry of a new customer record within a reasonable period of time.

, This includes identifying which fields will be included on report formats as well as which can serve as the basis for sorting or searching the database entries. Assigning the right authorizations to each field will expedite retrieval of the right data when and as it is needed.

, A few basic formats that can be used frequently will often be sufficient, although key users can be granted the ability to create customized reports that include fields relevant to the user's job position and level of access to customer data.

, A workable customer database includes the ability to create login credentials that allow only authorized employees to access the information. Going further, assigning different levels of rights makes sure that each user is able to view, change and enter data relevant to his or her job responsibilities, but is not able to view other information that is of use to other personnel.

Learn Assembly programming.,
Gather your tools.,
Start the program you want to crack with W32DASM.,
Find the counter function.,
Set a break-point on the counter.,
Change the counter code.",How to Crack Software by Modifying DLL Files," In order to crack most software, you will need to have a good grasp on assembly, which is a low-level programming language. Assembly is derived from machine language, and each assembly language is specific to the type of computer you are using. Most assembly language is expressed through binary and hexadecimal.;
, In order to examine and modify DLLs, you will need several different tools. W32DASM is a software disassembler that allows you to pick apart programs. SoftIce is a Windows debugging tool. You'll also want a good coding text editor, such as UltraEdit or Notepad++.

, This will show you what DLL files are being loaded by the program. Use W32DASM to examine which functions are being called from the DLL.

, Many programs use a timer for copy protection, and when the timer runs out, the user is no longer able to access the program. The goal is to find this counter code, and then bypass it.


If the program you are cracking uses a different form of protection, you will need to look for that instead.

, Once you've isolated the counter function, set SoftIce to break when it is encountered. This will allow you to look at the exact code that is occurring when the counter function is called.

, Now that you've found the code for the counter function, you can change the code so that the counter never reaches the point where it shuts you out of the program. For example, you could make it so that the counter cannot count up to the break limit or you can bypass the counter by jumping over it.

Determine how much of what you send to the Copyright Office will be code and how much will be screenshots.,
Consider pre-registering your software.,
File your registration with the Copyright Office.,
Deposit a copy of your work with the Copyright Office.",How to Copyright Software," As part of the processing for copyrighting software, you will have to send a hard copy deposit of your software to the Copyright Office. The Copyright Office regards your source or object code and screen displays to be part of the same computer program and thus requires only a single registration to copyright all components of the same software application. However, the Copyright Office presently has no designation for ""computer software"" as a type of work to be registered on its forms. You have to decide how you plan to register the work under the categories it does have.


If your software is predominantly text-based, register it as a ""literary work.""
If your software uses a lot of pictures or graphics in its display, register it as a ""visual arts work.""
If your software uses a lot audio-visual components, such as .avi files, animated graphics or streaming video, register it as a ""motion picture/audiovisual work."" (Most video games will fall into this category.);
, Preregistration is designed to protect a work still in development from infringement. It does not replace registration, but it allows the developer to sue someone else for infringement that occurs before the final version is released or published. Along with computer software, preregistration is available for motion pictures, compositions of music, sound recordings, photos used in advertising or marketing and literary works to be published in a book.


Preregistration is available only online. You submit a description of up to 2,000 characters (330 words) of the software, along with a filing fee, payable by credit card, through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network or from an account previously established with the Copyright Office. (You do not include an actual copy of the code or program screens.) For more information about the process, see http://www.copyright.gov/prereg/help.html#how_to.

Once the Copyright Office processes your preregistration, they'll send you a notification by e-mail with the information you sent, a preregistration number and the date your preregistration was processed and became effective. You can obtain a certified copy of the notification from the Copyright Office's Certifications and Documents section.
Once you pre-register your work, you must register it within 3 months after you publish or produce it or within a month after you become aware someone has infringed your copyright. If you don't register within this time, any court must dismiss a suit brought prior to or within the first 2 months after publication.

, The Copyright Office now permits you to file your registration in 1 of 3 ways: online through its electronic Copyright Office (eCO), completing fill-in Form CO on your personal computer, or obtaining a paper form from the Copyright Office. All 3 methods require you to include payment with your application and permit you to register a single work, multiple published works by the same author or multiple published works collected together for the first time in the same publication on the same date owned by the same person filing the registration.


To access the electronic filing option, go to the Copyright Office website at http://www.copyright.gov/ and select ""electronic Copyright Office."" You'll be asked whether you intend to submit an electronic or a hard copy of your work. (You may submit either an electronic or hard copy of any unpublished work with this option.) Using this option lets you file for less money than the other 2 options and also provides you with faster processing, the ability to pay electronically, e-mail acknowledgment of your submission and online tracking of the status of your application.
Fill-in Form CO can be obtained by selecting ""Forms"" on the Copyright Office website at http://www.copyright.gov/. This form includes a barcode that permits the Copyright Office to process the form with its scanners; because each barcode is unique to the registration application, you can only use Form CO to register the work for which you requested it. After completing the form on your computer, you then print it out.
Requests for paper forms must be addressed to the Library of Congress, U.S. Copyright Office-TX, 101 Independence Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20559-6222. Use the same address to submit a copyright registration and your payment by mail; a completed Fill-in Form CO is sent to the same address. (You may also print out your electronic registration form and send it by mail if you wish, but you then pay the higher fee for non-electronic processing.)
For whichever method you use, fill in the ""Year of Completion"" with the year you completed work on the computer program and the exact date the version you're seeking to register was first published. Fill in the ""Author Created"" space with the elements of the software package you're seeking to register, such as just the program itself or the program and its accompanying documentation. Fill in the ""Limitation of Claim"" if you created the program using a lot of previously published code and subroutines or an authoring tool; use the ""Material excluded"" section to list those subroutines (or simply state ""Previous version"") and the ""New material included"" section to list the parts you're actually claiming copyright for, such as new code or editing of existing code.

, If your software is unpublished, you may submit the copy either electronically in PDF format or as a printed copy, depending on whether you're submitting the accompanying application electronically or by hard copy. If you're submitting a published copy of your software, you must submit a hard copy regardless of which filing method you use.


If your program does not contain any trade secrets, you need to submit a paper or microform hard copy of the first and last 25 pages of source code, or the entire source code if it runs less than 50 pages. (If the program is written in a scripted language such as HyperCard, the script is treated as source code.) You may substitute object code for the source code, providing you accompany it with a written statement that the object code contains copyrightable authorship.
If your program does contain trade secrets, you may submit the first and last 25 pages of source code or all the source code if it runs less than 50 pages, with the source code containing your trade secrets blocked out. You can also send just the first and last 10 pages of source code, if none of those pages contain trade secrets, or any 10 consecutive pages of source code without trade secrets and the first and last 25 pages of object code. This must be accompanied by a letter stating that the code contains trade secrets.
If the program is structured in such a way that there's no definable beginning or end to the source code, you can decide which sections of the code represent the first and last pages.
If the source code has revisions, and the revisions are not included in any of the portions of code described above, you need to include 20 consecutive pages of code with the revisions and no trade secrets or any 50 pages of code that include the revisions and have any trade secrets blocked out.
You have the option as to whether or not to include screenshots as part of your deposit if you filled in the ""Author Created"" section of your copyright registration form as ""Author Created."" If, instead, you filled it in as ""Computer program, including text and screen displays"" or similar, then you must include screenshots for all the screens you wish to register. (If the screens are displayed in a user manual, sending the manual is an acceptable way to send in the screenshots.) If you're registering audiovisual displays, you can do so on 1/2-inch VHS tape, CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, or upload the file if it is small enough.
If your software has been published on CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, you must include a copy of the disc, with any accompanying operating software and user manual. (If the manual is in printed form, you must include a hard copy of the manual; a PDF copy is not acceptable as a substitute.)

Download Sendmail.,
Build and install Sendmail for your machine.",How to Configure Sendmail1," You may be automatically offered a short initial message which will indicate the current release. These instructions below assume version 8.10.0 or later.
, In most cases, this consists of unpacking the distribution, reading the README and sendmail/README files, and typing Build in the Sendmail directory. See the INSTALL file in the distribution's top-level directory for details."
"Understand that Sendmail uses information from the Domain Name System (DNS) to figure out which IP addresses go with which mailboxes.,
Choose an available domain name.,
Configure your DNS on the server.,
Configure MX records for your domain (Note: CNAME records can not be used; see § 5.2.2 of RFC 1123 for details.),
Determine your connection method:

If the mail server which will serve your new domain has a full-time connection to the Internet, it should be the primary MX host for your domain.,
Now the name servers are setup, register your domain using one of the registries.",How to Configure Sendmail2,", In our example, we will use yourdomain.com., Establish two machines as primary and secondary name servers for your domain. Knowledge of how to do this is assumed; otherwise, read the O'Reilly book ""DNS and BIND"", 4th Edition is highly recommended. Familiarize yourself with BIND before continuing., MX records are explained in the O'Reilly Sendmail book; the 2nd edition gives an overview in § 15.3 and describes how to configure them in § 21.3, whereas the third edition explains everything about them in § 9.3. You have two options for MX records:, In this configuration, your MX records would look like this:

yourdomain.com. IN MX 10 yourmailserver.yourdomain.com.


Otherwise, you will need to find another machine to queue mail for your domain when you are not connected. Be sure to get the machine owners' approval first. That machine must be configured to allow relaying to your domain. If it is running Sendmail, this can be as simple as adding your domain to the relay-domains file on that machine. You would then point your MX records at that machine. For example:
yourdomain.com. IN MX 10 yourmailserver.yourdomain.com.
yourdomain.com. IN MX 20 othermailserver.otherdomain.com.


, As you register, inform the registry of the two name servers, and then the domain will point to your server."
"
Read the cf/README file thoroughly.,
A typical cf/domain/yourdomain.com.m4 file that looks something like:

divert(-1)dnl
#
# This file contains the global definitions for yourdomain.com
#
divert(0)dnl
VERSIONID(`@(#)yourdomain.com.m4 1.0 (yourdomain.com) 5/1/97')
FEATURE(`use_cw_file')dnl

,
It may have some other feature()'s and define()'s as well.,
Generate your /etc/mail/sendmail.cf file from your mailserver.mc file, so type:

cd sendmail-VERSION/cf/cf
/Build mailserver.cf
cp mailserver.cf /etc/mail/sendmail.cf

,
Create the virtual user table.,
If you have a local user, say sam, and there is no key for sam@yourdomain.com and no catch-all key for @yourdomain.com, then Sendmail will fall back to the local user sam when resolving sam@yourdomain.com.,
If you want a virtual address to resolve to more than one real address, you need to do it indirectly.,
The %3 is the preservation of the optional +detail part of the original address.,
For people administering multiple domains, it may be easier to keep each domain's list in a separate file, then write a short script to concatenate all such files together into a master virtual user table.",How to Configure Sendmail3," It will give you instructions on creating a .mc file in the cf/cf directory. Your mailserver.mc file will typically look something like:

divert(-1)dnl
#
# This file contains the global definitions for yourdomain.com
#
divert(0)dnl
VERSIONID(`@(#)mailserver.mc 1.0 (yourdomain.com) 5/1/97')
OSTYPE(solaris2)dnl
DOMAIN(yourdomain.com)dnl
FEATURE(`virtusertable', `dbm /etc/mail/virtusertable')dnl
MAILER(local)dnl
MAILER(smtp)dnl

Your actual OS will be substituted for solaris2.

,, The virtual user table is the key to all of this.,, This is explained in detail in the Sendmail book: § 19.6.28 of the 2nd edition, or § 4.8.51 of the 3rd edition; an overview is given here. The table is a database that maps virtual addresses into real addresses. You create a text file where each line has a key/value pair, separated by a TAB. For example:

Example 1:

joe@yourdomain.com jschmoe
jane@yourdomain.com jdoe@othercompany.com
@yourdomain.com jschmoe

In this first example, the address joe@yourdomain.com will be mapped to the local user jschmoe; jane@yourdomain.com will be mapped to the remote user jdoe@othercompany.com, and anything else coming in to yourdomain.com will also go to jschmoe.





Example 2:

joe@yourdomain.com    jschmoe%3
bogus@yourdomain.com &npsp;  error:nouser No such user here
list@yourdomain.com    yourdomain-list
@yourdomain.com    %1@othercompany.com

In this second example, the address joe@yourdomain.com will be mapped to the local user jschmoe%3 (see note 3 below for an explanation of what the %3 means), the address bogus@yourdomain.com will return the indicated error, the address list@yourdomain.com will be mapped to the local user yourdomain-list (which you would use the aliases file to ultimately resolve) and every other user at yourdomain.com will be mapped to a remote user of the same name at othercompany.com.





, To prevent this, you must use either a catch-all key or an explicit key for sam@yourdomain.com; the error:nouser example above may be useful in this instance., Have the virtual address resolve to a local alias, then have the local alias resolve to the desired set of addresses. For example, in the virtual user table:

joe@yourdomain.com localjoe
then in the aliases file:


localjoe: joe@othercompany.com, jane@othercompany.com
In the above example:

joe@yourdomain.com jschmoe%3




, In general, +detail means that when Sendmail gets an address like user+detail@domain, then if domain is in class w (see step 7 below), sendmail checks to see if user+detail can be resolved, then falls back to just plain user if not. Thus all of:

joe@yourdomain.com
joe+foo@yourdomain.com
joe+reallylongextrapart@yourdomain.com


would all match the above entry, with %3 preserving the +detail part of nothing, +foo and +reallylongextrapart respectively.




Multiple domains are allowed, and virtual addresses in each domain are independent. So for example, you could have:

joe@yourdomain1.com localjoe
joe@yourdomain2.com joe@othercompany.com
joe@yourdomain3.com localjoe
joe@yourdomain4.com error:nouser No such user here



, But we're getting ahead of ourselves; that's the next step..."
"
Build the virtual user table.",How to Configure Sendmail4," If the above virtual user table text file is located at sourcefile, and you are using the DBM database type, then use the command:

makemap dbm /etc/mail/virtusertable < sourcefile
Note: if you built Sendmail with NEWDB instead of NDBM, then use hash instead of dbm in the above line.
This creates one or more non-text files (typically /etc/mail/virtusertable.dir and /etc/mail/virtusertable.pag, or /etc/mail/virtusertable.db), but does not actually change /etc/mail/virtusertable itself, so this is the recommended location for sourcefile.
If you would like to reverse-map local users for out-bound mail, you will need to add support for the generics table to your .mc file:

FEATURE(`genericstable', `dbm /etc/mail/genericstable')dnl
GENERICS_DOMAIN_FILE(`/etc/mail/generics-domains')dnl


And you will need to create /etc/mail/genericstable which is like /etc/mail/virtusertable above except the columns are reversed:

jschmoe joe@yourdomain.com



"
"
Add each new domain name to sendmail's class w. This is typically done by adding a line to /etc/mail/local-host-names (known as /etc/sendmail.cw prior to version 8.10) with the value of each domain name.,Restart or SIGHUP sendmail.,
You do not need to restart sendmail when changing the virtual user or generics tables, only when changing /etc/mail/sendmail.cf or class files such as /etc/mail/local-host-names.",How to Configure Sendmail5," Likewise, if you are using the genericstable, you should add any domains you wish to reverse-map to /etc/mail/generics-domains.,,

An extra step is required for hosts not connected full-time. As noted in the MX configuration section, if you use another host to queue your mail until you connect, you will have to force delivery of mail queued on the secondary mail server. To accomplish this, when your primary server connects, you should run the script etrn.pl which comes in the contrib directory of the sendmail distribution:

etrn.pl secondary-mx-host yourdomain.com
It may be advisable to put this at the end of the Sendmail start-up script on any primary MX. It would be especially useful as a follow-up to whatever script initiates the connection on primary MXs without full-time connections.
At this point, you should be set, and people should be able to send e-mail to addresses @yourdomain.com.



"
"
Test your configuration and make sure everything works as expected before announcing the new domain name and mail addresses for that domain.",How to Configure Sendmail6," If things don't work as expected, you can test with Sendmail's test mode:

sendmail -bt
Here are some examples of things to try in test mode (make sure the domain is in class w:):

$=w
# is the map working?
/map virtuser joe@yourdomain.com
/map virtuser jane@yourdomain.com
/map virtuser @yourdomain.com

You will want to work with the 'lowest common denominator' of your intended viewers. This means that you want to think about what your viewers may have to view your images. If they aren't computer savvy or techies, there is a chance that they won't have flash. If you want to make sure that there is nothing to keep someone from viewing your album, use HTML. If you want a few more bells and whistles, use Flash.

, Experiment with the various options to see what works best for you and your photos.


Remember that what works best for one set of images might not necessarily apply for another set.

, You can preview it and/or you can edit it; depending on your needs and abilities.

, You will be able to choose a name for your album and also add comments and a footer. If you know HTML, it has the ability to add links to your album.

In General, set R1C1 to Off and select Show the 10 Most Recent Documents .
In Edit, set all the first options to checked except Automatically Convert Date System. Set Display number of decimal places to blank(as integers are preferred). Preserve the display of dates and set 30 for 21st century cutoff.

, Place the cursor between the A of column A and the 1 of Row 1 in the top left corner and select the entire worksheet; Format Cells Number Number Decimal Places 4, Font Size 9 or 10., 210=109+38+63. 109=round(1954/9/2,0) which is birthday #1, yyyy/m/dd. 38=round(1958/4/13,0) which was birthday #2, being April 13, 1958 described as a double quotient, and 63 is the Lucky Number. It just kept coming up during good events and meaningful moments. Later, substitute your own birth dates of you and your soul mate, or perhaps your parents, or friends, or whomever, and your own Lucky Number or a trial number that makes the design ""come out well."" In a later step, a constant of .5 is entered and 210/.5 = 420, over 360 rows varying 210 to -210 = exactly 7/6 (420/360 that is). π/6 is 30 degrees since p=180 degrees so 7/6 π = 210 degrees, and 210 is the overall variable number being decremented by 360 degrees versus a cosine and sine function. This sort of even relationship to π between your value in A1 and the constant is wanted in order to get good smooth spherical curves.
In cell B1. input the number 360 and Insert Name Define Name it as variable AdjRows. There will actually be 361 rows of calculation, but the formulation depends upon there being 360, as in degrees of a circle. AdjRows is short for Adjusted Rows, the number of rows of input to the final graph form, adjusted by 1 closure row.
In cell C1, input the formula (without the quote marks) ""=1+((1-SQRT(5))/2-1)"", which will result in the value of .618033988749895 being displayed when the cell number is formatted for 14 decimal places. This is the Golden Mean (or Golden Ratio or Proportion) Long Leg, the GMLL. 1 minus the long leg equals the Short Leg and both have been known since Euclid's day. Insert Name Define Name this cell C1 as GMLL. See the Tips section for more information.
In cells C7 and D7, type Fact2 and Fact3 respectively. Select area C7:D8 and Insert Name Create Names to create the two variable names Fact2 AND Fact3. and their variables in top row for underneath cells C8 and D8. These variables may also be changed later to arrive at new designs.
Input the formula ""=Round(1958/4/13,0)"" into cell C8, or Fact2, and input ""=Fact2"" into cell D8 or Fact3. Fact is short for factor. These two variables are factors in the main trigonometric formulas to come. Here, they are both set to the later of the two birth dates.

,, This will decrement 210 to -210, a total change of 420 over 360 cells, or 7/6 ""time period units"" compared to a sphere, in lengths, but also in terms of a particle's distance to travel over time, given the volume is known. See the Tips section for more information.
Input .5 into cell B10. Edit Go To cells B11:B370 and enter ""=B10"" into cell B11 and Edit Fill Down. This will put the constant value of .5 in the column. Set the format of the color of cell B10 to canary yellow so it's recognizable as a variable constant one can change later.
Input ""=((Sin((A10)/(B10*2)*Fact2*GMLL)*Cos(A10)*Fact2*GMLL)*(Cos((A10)/(B10))*Fact2*GMLL))+Sin(ROW()-10)"" into cell C10, select C10:C370 and Edit Fill Down. These are the x values of the graph. They are based upon the formula for a spherical helix in 3D per ""CRC Standard Curves"" by David von Seggern, modified so that dimension z was modified into dimensions x and y, and the whole was spun about a larger circle. See the Tips Section on Other Websites for more info.
Input ""=((Sin((A10)/(B10*2)*Fact3*GMLL)*Sin(A10)*Fact3*GMLL)*(Cos((A10)/(B10))*Fact3*GMLL))+Cos(ROW()-10)"" into cell D10, select cells D10:D370 and Edit Fill Down. These are the y values for the chart and likewise contain the z values of a 3-dimensional chart.

,
Command c copy the chart and use the plus symbol at bottom of workbook to create a new worksheet. Command v paste it into the new worksheet and drag it 1"" down and to right on worksheet. Then select lower right corner and expand the chart a fair amount until the line detail shows clearly.
Select Chart Layout Axis. Set Horizontal and Vertical Axes to No Axis.
Grab lower right corner of chart and re-size it until it is an approximate square.
Double-click on the white plot area and select Gradient, Style Radial, Direction Centered, click on left color tab and select color canary yellow, then right tab and select color fire engine red; tap OK. Adjust until you have bright yellow small center and bright red corners.
Double click on the chart's line plot series and set line weight to 1 point. Set color to canary yellow.

, It helps to save your work. On the Data sheet, select cell range A1:D16 and copy it and activate the worksheet Saves and paste the selected range to the left, then again, a few rows below its bottom, and atop that, do Paste Special Values. You now have saved both the formulas and values that created that particular chart. Activate the Chart and, holding down the Shift key, do Copy Picture. Release the shift key. Activate the Saves worksheet, hold down the shift key again and do Paste Picture. Now you have fulfilled a scientific obligation to keep track of your work. Do this to track changes you make and wish to save.,

In cell C2, input .125 or ""=1/8"" (w/o quotes).,
Create some more Named Variables.,
Put the entire sheet in font Lucida Fax size 9 by selecting the very top left cell between A and 1 for column and row and thus select the entire worksheet.,
Create the Column Headings.,
Input the t and c_ Formulas.,
(Adjusted) Cosine and Sine formulas.,
Input the Main X and Main Y Formulas.,
Do Edit Go To cell range F6:F2886 and input the formula ""=((sin(A6/(B6*2))*GM*sin(A6)*GM*(cos(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+D6)/ShrinkExpand"".,
While the sheet will now produce the chart wanted, for small numbers of spheroids like 1 or 2 or 3, they cannot appear in a ring properly.,
It is also a good idea to do Insert Comment a copy of all the formulas so far into the cells so there are always the original formulas should they ever be overwritten.,
Have a blank worksheet ready to copy a new chart into and expand and format at will.,
Above is the chart for 32 spheroids.

",How to Create a Spirallic Spin Particle Path or Necklace Form or Spherical Border," Have ready 2 newly named worksheets in the workbook, one for the DATA, the other for the CHART. Title them so please -- it makes formulas easier to understand later.

Under View, set show row and column headings to On or checked and show gridlines. Show scroll bars and sheet tabs and outline symbols and zero values. Show formula bar by default and show status bar. It is very important to show the formula bar.







,

Into cell A1, type AjRows.
Into cell B1, type GM (for Golden Mean).
Into cell C1, type Factor1.
Into D1, type KEY.
Into cell E1, type Number. 

, Into cell A2, input 2880 (as the number of adjusted rows in the data-set). In cell B2, input the formula ""=(sqrt(5)-1)/2"" (without quote marks). This is the Golden Mean or Ratio or Proportion, known since Euclid's time, such that a:b as b:(a+b), and is quadratic and has many special properties, such as phyllotaxis in Nature -- it's used because it maintains in proportion the square of a number to the number such that for the Pythagorean Theorem, a given Pythagorean triplet will grow in constant proportion to itself, and since the sine and cosine functions are Pythagorean functions, it applies to them as well., Into cell D2, input ""=36"" (w/o quotes). Input 1 into cell E1.,

Into cell A3, type Tip.
Into cell B3, type Base.
Into cell C3, type Spheroids.
Into cell D3, type ShrinkExpand.
Into cell E3, type PiDivisor.
Into cell G3, type Lucky.
Select cells A3:G4 and Insert Name Create in Top Row.
Into cell A4, input ""=B4*12*PI()"" -- the empty parentheses for pi are correct. Do Insert Name Define name as Tip for cell A4.
Into B4, input 1712, which is 2^4 * 107 (where 2^4 means 2 raised to the power of 4).
Into cell C4, type 32 for now -- the lookup table that is going to be prepared is set to take any number of spheroids up to 64. (Actually 100 but the detail gets hard to see.)
Into cell D4, type 1 for now. Setting up another plot column set of data with ShrinkExpand set to a different value will insert or surround one circle of spheroids with another one.
Into cell E4, input 180. Differentiating this variable creates special effects.
Into cell G4, input the Lucky number 63.
Select cells A2:G2 and Format Cells Border  thick line Top Bottom Sides Center and format number with 4 decimal places. Do the same for cell range A4:G4.

, Generally, viewing 4 decimal places will inform one of the differences in the sine and cosine function results.,

Into cell A5, type Base t.
Into cell B5, type c_.
Into cell C5, type Cos (for cosine).
Into cell D5, type Sin (for sine).
Into cell E5, type Main X.
Into cell F5, type Main Y.
Base t is the number of turns and also the total distance in terms of points a particle would travel past. As you will soon see, the total variation in the column values is from +64,540.8795 to -64,540.8795, or +129,081.7590 absolutely. This is over 2881 rows. +129,081.7590/2881= 44.8045 valuation units per chart point. Each decrement is about -44.8201 and 1/44.8201 = .0223 … so the points are very very close together and the accuracy of the graph is very good. Charting 32 spheres over about 2880 rows, there are 2880/32 = 90 points per sphere or spheroid. They are termed spheroids because they are not perfect spheres. But they are pretty close -- how exactly square your chart area is matters quite a bit as well and that can be difficult to get right, as Excel has not provided a parameter for setting it precisely. The c_ in cell B5 stands for constant; you will see that the formulation varies the value of the constant with the number of spheroids the user inputs.

,

Into cell B6, input the formula, ""=Base"". Do Edit Go To cell range B6:B2886 and do Edit Fill Down.
Into cell A6, input ""=If(odd(Spheroids)=Spheroids,0,Tip)"". This formula states that if the number of spheroids input is odd, result=0, else result=Tip (where Tip was defined above as 12*PI()*B4 or 1712). In the case of the result becoming 0, the column will decrement to twice Tip, negatively from 0. The number of spheroids charted will be odd, eg. 31.
Do Edit Go To cell range A7:A2886 and input ""=((A6+(-Tip*2)/(AjRows)))"" into cell A7, then do Edit Fill Down. The value in cell A2886 should be decremented to -64,540.8795 if spheroids is even (eg. at 32), else it will equal 2*-64,540.8795. Please see Note 6 in the Tips section regarding differentiating cells A7 and A6 because their formulas are different

,

Do Edit Go To cell range C6:C2886 and input into cell C6 the formula, ""=Spheroids/KEY*(cos((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))"" (without the quotation marks, as always). Do Edit Fill Down.
The KEY number is an other means of warping the output; currently, it's set to 1, non-warping. All it is really doing is applying a fraction to the main cosine function. By taking the cosine of the cell 6 rows up from cell C6, we are taking the cosine of 0 to begin with, then in subsequent rows, take the cosine up to 360 and in cycles then to 2880+6. 2880/360=8. So there are 8 cycles. Number is a variable for getting partial circle effects like animation motion likenesses when a fraction because the next piece, *PI()/PiDivisor. converts from pi radians to degrees and vice versa. Recall that PiDivisor is set to 180 degrees. Multiplying by Factor1=.125 is taking back the 8 by 1/8th.
Do Edit Go To cell range D6:D2886 and input into cell D6 the following formula: ""=Spheroids/KEY*(sin((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))"".
Do Edit Fill Down. This is the sine or y function in place of the x cosine function just done.

, Do Edit Go To cell range E6:E2886 and input into cell E6 the following formula: ""=((sin(A6/(B6*2))*GM*cos(A6)*GM*(cos(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+C6)/ShrinkExpand"". This is the heart of the Spherical Helix formula and is sin * cos * cos. Do Edit Fill Down., This is sin * sin * cos. Be very careful to match your parentheses exactly as given.

If you are getting an error, it's probably because of a missing parenthesis, so count that the lefts = the rights and look to see that you have them placed exactly as given. If you are getting an undefined name error, it means that ""GM"" is not properly associated with cell B2 -- go back and Define Name that variable again, without quotation marks. Otherwise, it's ShrinkExpand for cell D4. If either of those cells or any previous cell contains an error value, go back and fix it according to the above instructions.

, A solution for that contingency has been worked out.

Do Edit Go To cell range I6:I69 and input 1 into cell I6 and then do Edit Fill Series Columns Linear, Day, no trend, Step Value 1 and blank stop value; press OK. That should input the series from 1 to 64 in that cell range.
Do Edit Go To cell range J6:J69 and input into cell J6 .125 and then do Edit Fill Down. That will input the constant value of .125 in that cell range.
Do Edit Go To cell range K6:K69 and input ""=I6*$K$35/$I$35"" and do Edit Fill Down and then input the value .125 in cell K35. Do Edit Go To cell range I6:K69 and Insert Name Define Name Looker.
Go to Factor1 cell C2. Input the formula, ""=Vlookup(Abs(Spheroids),Looker,2)"". If that last number is changed from 3 to 2 in the VLookup Formula just given, it will always return .125, otherwise it will adjust for the number of spheroids input the value of Factor1 (so that will no longer be an available variable). Change the font of cell C2 to dark blue italic or something red or something that helps one remember not to change it. If your chart does not look right, try changing this formula to ""=Vlookup(Abs(Spheroids),Looker,3)"".

, Do that now for cell C2 until you see the red corner flag and remember to do it for all the other formulas later please. The Abs() Absolute function allows one to input a negative number of spheroids; the effect will be to flip the graph 180 degrees horizontally (from left to right or right to left), as one can tell with an odd number of spheroids.,

Do Edit Go To cell range E6:F2886. Press the Charts button on the Ribbon, All, or Chart Wizard or Insert Chart. Select chart type Scatter Smoothed Line Scatter. Command c copy it and access the new worksheet and command v paste it into the new worksheet. Your chart should look like the example above except for the bronze tinge would be white and the default line might be black and too thick or thin. Adjust the chart size by dragging the bottom right corner until you get a square plot area and a circular ring. Get rid of the Vertical and Horizontal Axes and gridlines via the Chart Layout tab. Clicking on the plot area will give access to the gradient style, etc. Double-clicking on the chart plot line itself will give access to changing that. A value of line thickness = 1 is recommended. Mission accomplished!! Shrink the chart on the original Data worksheet and put it at the bottom of the data. Split the window so that you can see the small chart and the last rows of data.
Optional: Create a Double ""Rainbow"" or a ring within a ring, like benzene rings and tightly packed animal cells such as a hornet's stinger. Select D3:D4 and do Edit Copy to H3:H4. Edit ShrinkExpand by adding a 2 to it to become ShrinkExpand2. Insert Name Create Top Row while cell range H3:H4 is still selected. Select cell E6. Select over the formula in the formula bar and command c copy it (do not copy the cell -- copy exactly only the formula itself in the formula bar). Do Edit Go To G6:G2886. Mouse-select in the formula bar and paste the formula just copied. Edit the last ShrinkExpand to make it ShrinkExpand2. Do Edit Fill Down. Select cell F6. Select over the formula in the formula bar and command c Copy it. Do not copy the cell and paste it into the new cell -- that won't work out right. Do Edit Go To cell range H6:H2886. Edit in the formula bar the last ShrinkExpand to become ShrinkExpand2. Press Enter or Return. Do Edit Fill Down. There should be all zeroes because the value in ShrinkExpand2 = 0.
Select cell G5 and type Second X and in cell H5 type Second Y. Now go to cell H4 and type in 1.5 and go to the original ShrinkExpand in cell D4 and input 2. On the Chart worksheet, select menuitem Chart Add Data and then select back on the Data sheet cells G6:H2886 and hit OK. Somehow it comes out wrong sometimes and one must click on the new chart series in the Chart worksheet and type in G's for E's in the plot series in the formula bar -- then it's OK.
There should now be two series: 1) =SERIES(,Data!$E$6:$E$2886,Data!$F$6:$F$2886,1) and 2) =SERIES(,Data!$G$6:$G$2886,Data!$H$6:$H$2886,2). They should be just touching with the first series inside the second series. Select a good color for the second series and line thickness should probably be set to 1 for each.
Well done!! Whether one also adds the 2nd series to their Data worksheet bottom chart is a matter of preference -- generally, it's cleaner to see effects take place on one series at a time quickly in miniature.

So now there is an indicator of where 1 sphere ends and the next one begins, no matter how many spheres the user selects to chart. Format Number Number Custom 0.00000;; to stop the zeros from appearing.
Modified: Randy: Edit Go To cell range F6:F17285 and Insert Name Define Name Randy to cell range $F$6:$F$17285. Edit Go To cell range F6:F17286 and enter into F6 w/o quotes the following formula,""=RANDBETWEEN(0,10)/100""and Edit Fill Down. Warning: Make calculation Manual before adding this variable or column into your formulas, especially as a factor, as it can take 20 minutes to calculate and draw the new chart. It is not currently employed, but a copy of its formula has been saved at the bottom of the x and y formulas.
Modified: t: 0 to nπ: Select cell G6 and enter 0. Select cell G7:G17285 and enter to G7 the formula ""=IF(E7=1,2*PI(),2*PI()/(MAGIC*1)+G6)"" and Edit Fill Down.

Modified: Adj_x1: Edit Go To cell range I6:I17285 and enter w/o quotes into I6 the formula ""=IF(E6=1,A6,I5)"" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range I6:I17285 and Insert Name Define Name Adj_x1 to cell range $I$6:$I$17285. This makes a constant adjustment as if one were referencing a new center every new sphere from Spiral Cos, else it takes the value just above itself.
Modified: Adj_y1: Edit Go To cell range J6:J17285 and enter w/o quotes into J6 the formula ""=IF(E6=1,B6,J5)"" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range J6:J17285 and Insert Name Define Name Adj_y1 to cell range $J$6:$J$17285. This makes a constant adjustment as if one were referencing a new center every new sphere from Spiral Sin, else it takes the value just above itself.
Modified: x: No z: Edit Go To cell range K6:K17285 and enter w/o quotes into K6 the formula ""=(Stretch_x1*(((BEE^2-CEE^2*COS(AYE*G6)*COS(AYE*G6))^0.5 *COS(G6)))+Adj_x1)*SPIRALLIC"" and Edit Fill Down. This is the x part of the heart of the sinewave sphere formula from the text, without the z dimension added or multiplied in, which is why it took me so long to discover how to make it work.
Modified: y: With z: Edit Go To cell range L6:L17285 and enter w/o quotes into L6 the formula ""=(Stretch_y1*(((BEE^2-CEE^2*COS(AYE*G6)*COS(AYE*G6))^0.5 *SIN(G6))+z1_)+Adj_y1)*SPIRALLIC"" and Edit Fill Down. This is the y part of the heart of the sinewave sphere formula from the text, with the z dimension added in, which is why it took me so long to discover how to make it work. In the spirallic spheroids Garthwaite Curve, the z-dimension is multiplied into both x and y parts. Furthermore, I have made no adjustment for the Golden Mean Long Leg, which I expected to all along, until it worked without it. The other curve doesn't.
Modified: Select cell K17286 and enter the formula w/o quotes ""=K6"" and select cell L17286 and enter the formula w/o quotes ""=L6"". This makes the top connecting line from the last sphere to the first.

Modified: Planned Error Value -- Select cell L17287 and enter ""=SHRINKER^2*(Stretch_y1*(((BEE^2-CEE^2*COS(AYE*G17287)*COS(AYE*G17287))^0.5 *SIN(G17287))+z1_)+Adj_y1)*Randy"" or +Randy, etc. Warning: this can really take a lot of processing time -- set calculation to Manual first.
Modified: Edit Go To cell range K6:L17288 and do Format Fill sky blue.
Modified: Select cell F5 and Format Fill light sea green, font red, Border navy blue outline bold. Copy this cell to J17287. Then do Edit Paste Special Format of this cell to cell E6, E7, G6, K17286 and L17286 to make distinct the format of those cell's formulas/values.



,

Modified: Edit Go To cell range - a short range -- and from the Ribbon or Chart Wizard select Charts All/Other Scatter Smoothed Line Scatter and Copy or Cut the chart that is atop the data worksheet and paste it to the top left of the Chart worksheet. Hover over the lower right corner until the cursor becomes a double-headed arrow and pull it open to become a large wide rectangle.
Click in the Plot Area and select Chart Layout from the ribbon and at far left under Current Selection select Series 1, then under that, Format Selection. Set Line to Red, Smoothed line, Weight = 1 pt. and Dashed = Solid. Set Shadow to checked Outer 45 degrees, magenta pink, Size 100%, Blur 0 pt, Distance 30 pt, Transparency 80%. Set Glow to magenta pink Size = 2 pt. 2% transparency, Soft Edges 0 pt. OK.
Do Current Selection under Chart Layout as Plot Area, Format Selection. No Line, No Glow and No Shadow. Set Fill to Gradient Radial Lower Left Corner, Full Left 0% Orange and Full Right 100% White. No Glow, 3-D is all zeros. OK.
Do Current Selection under Chart Layout as Chart Area, Format Selection. Fill Gradient color Prussian Blue I think they call it on left 0% to Navy Blue on right 100% Path 0 degrees, Upper Left Corner, Transparency 0%. Line = Auto. Shadow is Unchecked/ No Glow or Soft Edges. 3-D Format is not set. OK.
The chart handles 360 spheres only at this point.
The chart's horizontal axis is set to -8 min, +4 Max, and the vertical is set to +/- 4.5.

Here are the settings for the Spiral Chart, in picture form. Spiral_Last_Value has been changed to ""=PI()"" from ""=2*PI()"" and Stretch_X1 has been changed to ""=(8.5*(SHRINKER*10))*0.8"" from ""=(8.5*(SHRINKER*10))*2"".
All the Chart formatting settings are the same but the cell range being charted is different -- it's =SERIES(,'DATA 01'!$K$8:$K$17285,'DATA 01'!$L$8:$L$17285,1) with the horizontal and vertical scales set to auto-checked.

, A1: AdjRows; B1: GMLL (for 'Golden Mean Long Leg'); C1: Factor; D1: N_; E1: MULTER1; F1: MULTER2 G1: p; H1: NUM. Edit Go To cell range A1: H2 and Insert Create Names in Top Row. Then go back and change N to N = Exponent and NUM to NUM=. Click between the A and the 1 in the top left corner of the worksheet to select the entire worksheet and Format Cells Number Number Decimal Places 4, and Alignment Center.

, A2: 1439; B2: =0.618033988749895; C2: -.25; D2: 1; E2: 1; F2: 1, G2: 1; H2 1. Into I2 type the following left-aligned note, w/o quotes: ""0,P:P,P then P,P to P,0 then P,0 to 0,0 then 0,0 to 0,P.""

, The A3 and B3 values are memos of values that work for A and B. Select cell E3 and type Charting, and do the same for F3.

, A4: Base t; B4: c; C4: Cos; D4 Sin; E4: x; F4: y; G4: Sides x; H4 Sides y. So when p=1, the I2 note forms a square of 4 sides of {x,y} pairs in columns G and H as follows: {0,1}:{1,1}, {1,1}:{1,0}, {1,0}:{0,0} and {0,0}:{0,1}. That's Top, Right, Bottom and Left Side.

Enter into B5 the formula, w/o quotes, ""=25680/2/3/2/2/3/2"" (the result should be 178.3333). Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =25680/2/3/2/2/3/2 = 178.3333"". Format cell Fill Light Blue, as its formula is distinct from the others in that column. Edit Go To cell range B6:B1445 and with B6 the active high-lighted cell, enter the formula, ""=B5"" and Edit Fill Down.
Enter into A5 the formula, w/o quotes, ""=B5*12*PI()"" and Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =B5*12*PI()"". Format cell Fill Light Blue, as its formula is distinct from the others in that column. Insert Name Define Name top to cell $A$5. That's ""top"" is what is correct, w/o quotes.
Edit Go To cell range A6:A1445 and with A6 the active high-lighted cell, enter the formula, w/o quotes, ""=(A5+(-top*2)/(AdjRows))"" and Edit Fill Down. Do Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =(A5+(-top*2)/(AdjRows))"". Done correctly, cell A1444 will be -6,723.0083, just the opposite of cell A5.
Edit Go To cell range C5:C1445 and with C5 the active high-lighted cell enter the formula w/o quotes, ""=COS((ROW()-5)*PI()/180*Factor)"". Now there are 1440 rows and 1440/360 = 4, so the Factor at -.25 is correct. Edit Fill Down and Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =COS((ROW()-5)*PI()/180*Factor) and 1440/360 = 4 so Factor = .25 is correct"". Changing Factor to +.25 had no effect on the Chart. Cos(.25) = Cos(-.25) is why.
Edit Go To cell range D5:D1445 and with D5 the active high-lighted cell enter the formula w/o quotes, ""=SIN((ROW()-5)*PI()/180*Factor)"". Now there are 1440 rows and 1440/360 = 4, so the Factor at -.25 is correct. Edit Fill Down and Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =SIN((ROW()-5)*PI()/180*Factor) and 1440/360 = 4 so Factor = .25 is correct"".
Edit Go To cell range E5:E1445 and with E5 the active high-lighted cell, enter the formula w/o quotes, ""=((SIN(A5/(B5*2))*GMLL*COS(A5)*GMLL*(COS(A5/(B5*2)))*GMLL)+G5)^(N_-0)"". Edit Fill Down and Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =((SIN(A5/(B5*2))*GMLL*COS(A5)*GMLL*(COS(A5/(B5*2)))*GMLL)+G5)^(N_-0)t"". That is a zero, not an Oh, at the tail end -- it's for adjusting the exponent as between the Cosine and Sine. The addition of G5 instead of C5 will become apparent in a minute -- C5 makes a circle and G5 makes a square, Combinations are possible, so C5 was left in.
Edit Go To cell range F5:F1445 and with F5 the active high-lighted cell enter the formula w/o quotes, ""=((SIN(A5/(B5*2))*GMLL*SIN(A5)*GMLL*(COS(A5/(B5*2)))*GMLL)+H5)^(N_-0)"". Edit Fill Down and Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =((SIN(A5/(B5*2))*GMLL*SIN(A5)*GMLL*(COS(A5/(B5*2)))*GMLL)+H5)^(N_-0)"". That is a zero, not an Oh, at the tail end -- it's for adjusting the exponent as between the Cosine and Sine. The addition of H5 instead of D5 will become apparent in a minute -- D5 makes a circle and H5 makes a square, Combinations are possible, so D5 was left in.

, One side at a time will be done.


Side 1, the Top, from {0,1}:{1,1}. Edit Go To cell range H5:H365 and enter ""=p"" into cell H5 and Edit Fill Down. Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =p"" w/o quotes. Select cell G5 and input 0 into it. Edit Go To the cell range G6:G365 and enter the formula w/o quotes, ""=p/360+G5"". Edit Fill Down. If Excel creates problems about p being a disallowed variable name, Insert Name Define Name p_ for cell G2, and substitute p_ for p wherever is mentioned p -- p works fine in the example sheet however, but it is a column name, so strictly speaking, it's probably disallowed now. I changed N to N_ for the same reason. Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =p/360+G5"" (or p_/360+G5 -- whichever pertains). Edit Go To cell range G5:H365 and Format Cells Fill some nice color to differentiate it from the other sides.
Side 2, the Right, from {1,1}:{1,0}. Edit Go To cell range G366:G725 and enter ""=p"" into cell G366 and Edit Fill Down. Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =p"" w/o quotes. Edit Go To cell range H366:H725 and input w/o quotes the formula ""=-p/360+H365"" into it. Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =-p/360+H365"" (or -p_/360+H365 -- whichever pertains). Edit Go To cell range G366:H725 and Format Cells Fill some nice new color to differentiate it from the other sides.
Side 3, the Bottom, from {1,0}:{0,0}. Edit Go To cell range G726:G1085 and enter ""=-p/360+G725"" into cell G726 and Edit Fill Down. Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =-p/360+G725"" w/o quotes. Edit Go To cell range H726:H1085 and input w/o quotes the formula ""=0"" into it. Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =0"". Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range G366:H725 and Format Cells Fill an entirely bright new color to differentiate the bottom from the other sides.
Side 4, the Left Side, from {0,0}:{0,1}. Edit Go To cell range G1086:G1445 and enter ""=0"" into cell G1086 and Edit Fill Down. Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =0"" w/o quotes. Select cell H1086 and input w/o quotes the formula ""=E5"" and Insert Comment and edit in ""Original Formula =E5"". Edit Go To cell range H1087:H1445 and input w/o quotes the formula ""=p/360+H1086"" (or =p_/360+H1086) into it. Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =p/360+H1086"". Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range G1087:H1445 and Format Cells Fill a final differentiated color to make the final left side different from the other sides.

Edit Go To cell range E5:F1445 and use Chart Wizard to get a new Chart or use the Ribbon to select Chart, All. scroll down to Scatter, Smoothed Line Scatter and copy or cut and paste to the CHART worksheet the new chart. Double click in the chart and hover over the lower right corner until the double-headed arrow appears and pull it open in an expansion until a square is formed. This resizing business may require adjustment again -- leave it to the end of the chart formatting. .
Double-click on the vertical axis and set Scale as follows: Minimum: -.2, Maximum: 1.2; Major Unit 1.2; Minor Unit .2; Horizontal Axis is the only one checked and it crosses at 0.0. The chart is in Base 10. OK. Double-click on the horizontal axis and set Scale as follows: Minimum: -.2, Maximum: 1.2; Major Unit 1.2; Minor Unit .2; Vertical Axis is the only one checked and it crosses at 0.0. The chart is in Base 10. OK. With the Shift Key depressed, Copy Picture after clicking on the chart area, and activate the SAVES worksheet and Shift Key Paste Picture. One may wish to make some notes about the scale settings. Here is a picture of the chart w/o any axis or legend or grid lines or background, as one may wish to copy and stretch it immediately for some message or something -- those deletions are performed in Chart Layout and one can add a bottom reflection, or a shadow, or glow, etc. and put it in a frame or on a graphics work board, etc. -- many nice effects are possible:

Enter 63 to cell AD1 and Format Cell Number Number Custom ""Degrees ""0.00 and Insert Name Define name Degrees to cell $AD$1. 90 degrees is a problem, as is 0 and 180 and 360, but otherwise, it works well..
Enter Slope into cell AE1 and into cell AE2 Insert Name Define Name Slope to cell $AE$2 and enter the formula w/o quotes ""=TAN(Degrees*PI()/180)""
Enter Factor_Up into cell AF1 and enter w/o spaces 2.102 594 6851 1947 into cell AF2 and enter =2.43189347013788*S_COUNT/24 into cell AF3.
Enter b_ into cell AG1 and enter w/o spaces -0.939 692 620 785 908 into cell AG2. Enter b_YN into cell AG3 and N into cell AG4 and Insert Name Define b_YM to cell $AG$4 and b_ to cell $AG$2. Enter 0 into cell AG2.
Enter New x  into cell AE6 and New y into cell AF6.
Enter 0 into cell AE7 and Format Fill yellow and do Font red bold and centered horizontal. Enter ""=1+COS(Degrees*PI()/180)"" into cell AE1447 and Format Fill yellow and do Font red bold and centered horizontal.Edit Go To cell range AE8:AE1446 and with AE8 active enter the formula w/o quotes ""=($AE$1447-$AE$7)/1439+AE7"" and Edit Fill Down.
Edit Go To cell range AF7:AF1447 and enter w/o quotes with AF7 active the formula ""=Factor_Up*(Slope*AE7)+IF(b_YN=""N"",0,b_)"". Factor_Up will stretch or shrink the line in theory for its y values. The b-intercept may be set to 0 in b_ or negated via N in b_YN while retaining a previous value in b_, or both.
Select AG1448 and enter Min, AG1449 and enter Max, AG1450 and enter Goal, AG1451 and enter Bu changing Factor_Up, and select AG1452 and enter Goal by changing b_.
Select AE1448 and enter ""=MIN(AE7:AE1447)"" and select AE1449 and enter ""=MAX(AE7:AE1447)"". Copy AE1448:AE1449 and Paste to AF1448. Select AF1450 and enter 6, then enter into cell AF1451 ""=AF1450-AF1447"" which is the set to zero cell, when we want to change AF7 (it has to be a value first) to equal 0 by changing Factor_Up.
Select cell AE1452 and enter ""=1-AE7"" which is what we want to equal zero when we want cell AE7 to equal 1 (therefore the line would start at {1,0} instead of at {0,0}) -- it's there for user discretion and is utilized by changing AE7 simply to 1 now -- it used to also depend on Factor_Up or b_. Select cell AF1452 and enter ""=0-AF7"" which is the Goal when we want to change AF7 to 0 by changing b_.
Select cell AD1454 and enter Chart has, then select cell AE1454 and input 1440, then select AF1454 and enter rows. Select AD1455 and enter Divided by, and select AE1455 and enter 24 and select AF1455 and enter Spheroids. Enter Equals into cell AD1456 and ""=AE1454/AE1455"" into cell AE1456, with the answer being 60.
Enter 3 in cell AE1457 and into cell AD1457 enter Number of Spheroids to Chart and Format Cells Font bold size 14 and alignment right. Aligned left, select cell AB1458 and enter the formula with quotes =""So if ""&AE1457&"" Spheroids are wanted, then adjust the series in the chart formula bar to the first ""&AE1456*AE1457&"" rows.""
 and Format cells Font bold size 12. By calculation, the user may select which three spheroids to chart, adjusting for the fact that the series starts in row 7. So, if for example, the last 3 spheroids were wanted, the user would subtract 180 from 1447 and chart only that row (1267) up to row 1447. The user would then adjust the axes according to the demands of the rest of their graphic layout. Changing the number of spheroids in S_Count works, but only over a limited range of values -- this solution always works.

,


Edit Go To cell range F7:G1447 and, using either the Chart Wizard or the Ribbon, select Charts, All/Other, Scatter-Smoothed Line Scatter. A chart will appear atop the data unless using Chart Wizard, in which case a new Chart sheet will appear.
Assuming the former case, Copy or Cut the chart from atop the data and paste it to the Chart worksheet, then expand it by hovering over the lower right corner until the cursor becomes a double-headed arrow and clicking to drag the Chart Area until about a 6"" wide by 4"" tall rectangle is formed.
Using Chart Layout, select the Horizontal Axis and set Minimum to -1.5  Maximum to 3.0, Major unit to 1.5. Minor unit to .3 and Vertical Axis crosses at 0.0, in Base 10, OK.
Using Chart Layout, select the Vertical Axis and set Minimum to -1, Maximum to 7, Major unit to 1.0. Minor unit to .3 and Vertical Axis crosses at 0.0, in Base 10, OK. It's done according to Min Max row formulas at the bottom of columns F and G or AE and AF kept there for just such an occasion.
The axes may now be safely eliminated as well as any grid lines and legend.

, Your chart should resemble the one above.

Make use of helper articles when proceeding through this tutorial:

See the article How to Create a Spirallic Spin Particle Path or Necklace Form or Spherical Border for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation.",How to Create a Skewed Spheroids Pattern in Microsoft Excel,";
, At first, it was thought one might save a lot of time if one had read this article - ""Create a Pink Love Note of Spheres in Form of a Heart"", because there is a section that was introduced with that article that gets used again here. But, as it turns out, there have been changes in the interim.

, The formulas for A1 and A2 are the same. Adjuster = 1.
Enter -61 for TURNS into cell B2.
The result in cell B5 now shows -81,152 and the formula is ""=IF(TURNS>0,VLOOKUP(TURNS,TURNS_LOOKUP,2),VLOOKUP(TURNS, TURNS_LOOKUP_NEG,2))"" which is the same I believe.
Enter 26 for S's Count into cell C1. (although 28 will appear.)
The result in cell C2 = 2230 for Designer and the formula has not changed from ""=VLOOKUP(S_COUNT,SPHEROIDS_COUNT_LOOKER,2)""
The formula for Var, cell C3, has been overwritten with the value 25.
The formula for Cc is unchanged and the result is -.03141593
db is unchanged at 4.5
GMSL and GMLL are unchanged.
The formula for top is unchanged at ""=ROUND((-B4*PI())+(Adj),0)"" and the result is 886771.
AAA is unchanged at 1.00244189810508
Enter 27.5 for Divisor into cell E3.
Enter Y into YN in cell E4.
The formula for Factor is unchanged at ""=IF(E4=""Y"",IF(ODD(S_COUNT)=S_COUNT,-S_COUNT*0.01,S_COUNT*0.01),-0.25)"" and the result  is +.26
Enter 0 for Power into cell F2.
Cells H1 and J1 are unchanged at .92 and .96 respectively and the formulas for Sync1 and Sync2 are the same.

,
B7'S formula has not changed from ""=IF(EVEN(S_COUNT)=S_COUNT,ROUND((-B4*PI())+(Adj),0),TOP)""
B8:B1447's formulas have not changed from ""=((B7+(-TOP*2)/(AdjRows)))*$B$1""
C7's formula has not changed from ""=ROUND(-EXP((PI()^2)+(Cc*-(db))),0)+Designer""
Edit Go To cell range D7:D1447 and with D7 active, enter the formula w/o quotes, ""=X7/Divisor+COS((ROW()-7)*PI()/180*Factor)"" and Edit Fill Down.
Edit Go To cell range E7:E1447 and with E7 active, enter the formula w/o quotes, ""=Y7/Divisor+SIN((ROW()-7)*PI()/180*Factor)"" and Edit Fill Down.
Cell range F7:F1447's formulae remain the same as ""=IF(A7=0,F6,((PI())*((SIN(B7/(C7*2))*GMLL*COS(B7)*GMLL*(COS(B7/(C7*2)))*GMLL)+D7)))""
Cell range G7:G1447's formulae remain the same as ""=IF(A7=0,G6,((PI())*((SIN(B7/(C7*2))*GMLL*SIN(B7)*GMLL*(COS(B7/(C7*2)))*GMLL)+E7)))""
Cell range H7:H1447's formulae remain the same as ""=F7*GMLL*Sync1""
Cell range I7:I1447's formulae remain the same as ""=G7*GMLL*Sync1""
Cell range J7:J1447's formulae remain the same as ""=F7*GMSL*Sync2""
Cell range K7:K1447's formulae remain the same as ""=G7*GMSL*Sync2""

, The worksheet does not contain a Defined Variable Name of TT either. No need for you to enter it. Probably part of some approach to a problem that was solved in another way., TURNS_LOOKUP is now in cells $M$2:$N$1441. TURNS_LOOKUP_NEG is in cells $O$2:$P$1442 and runs in column O from -1440 to 0 and in column P from -104192 to 412 (an increment of 72). SPHEROIDS_COUNT_LOOKER is in cells $R$2:$S$1441 and increments by 251175.5 from a base value of -6,363,636 in column S, and from 0 to 1 in cells R2:R25 and then increments by 1 to  a value of 1416 in cell R1446 and then 10,000 in cell R1447., Select cell AA7 and input the value 28.6470945405378.

Know what kind of mp3 player you have.",How to Upload Music from an Mp3 Player to Windows Media Player1," First and foremost, not all mp3 players are created equal. There are popular ones, like the iPod (in all its incarnations) and, more recently, the Zune, and there is a much more diverse category of mp3 players and portable audio devices made by other manufacturers besides Apple and Microsoft. Creative, RCA, Philips, Sony, and iRiver, just to name a few, produce some fairly good quality mp3 players and portable media devices.


These different brands and the fact that they're not all the same are mentioned because in essence, before determining how to get the files onto, and similarly, off of the player, you should know what kind of player you have, and a few things about it. Does it have internal memory? Is it a hard-drive based player? Is there software packaged with the device? You should find answers to all of these questions before proceeding.

Work with iTunes.",How to Upload Music from an Mp3 Player to Windows Media Player2," If you have an iPod, you will probably already have iTunes installed on your computer, to work with the files on your iPod. Unfortunately, iTunes limits you severely on how you're able to work with getting the music onto and off of your iPod.


With iTunes 7, you're able to back up your entire library to a CD or DVD. Use this CD or DVD to recopy the music back onto your hard drive and import it into Windows Media Player's library.
An easier method might be to get Windows Media Player to recognize your iPod directly. However, this sort of compatibility is directly contradictory to the Apple and Microsoft's respective software designs. The iPod by design requires you to use iTunes and not Windows Media Player. Windows Media Player will probably never support the iPod.;
"
"
Know if your mp3 player has a flash memory card.",How to Upload Music from an Mp3 Player to Windows Media Player3," If you have another brand of mp3 player, it's important to know whether or not it has internal flash memory, has a flash memory card in it, or is a hard-drive based player like the iPod. Many Creative mp3 players look, feel, and function like USB flash drives. You can plug them directly into a free USB port on your PC, wait for Windows to recognize the disk, and you should be able to find your music on your player through Windows Explorer.


Copy it and import it into Windows Media Player. Some require a connection cable, usually from a mini-USB plug to the standard size. If you do not have this, it is most likely required in order to transfer music between the computer and the mp3 player.
Hard-drive based mp3 players require special drivers that must be installed so that Windows knows how to work with them. Generally these are bundled with the player itself, and can be installed easily from, for example, a CD. If you have since lost or damaged the original driver disc, you may be able to get the installation program necessary to install the drivers from the manufacturer's website.The details of which vary per manufacturer.
After installing the drivers, connect the mp3 player to your computer with the appropriate cable (it's almost always best to use the cable that came with the player, if one didn't come with it, use any brand you trust) and Windows should recognize the player and set it up for use. More often than not, Windows will recognize mp3 players as either removable disks, or possibly portable media devices. Windows will usually also bring up a menu of tasks when you connect your player, which list things such as ""Synchronize with Windows Media Player"" and ""Take No Action"". Cancel or close such a window if it appears.
If your mp3 player appears as either a removable disk or an MTP Device/Portable Media (audio) player, Open ""My Computer"", then right-click on the icon that corresponds to the device and select ""Explore"". Sometimes Windows may allow you to ""Open"" the device, which may do the same thing. Once you do this, you are now browsing through the files on the device as you would files in any folder.
Copy the ones you want into a place on your hard drive (for example, ""My Music"") and then, once finished, open Windows Media Player. You should have Windows Media Player 10 or 11 for this particular method. If you have an older version, upgrade. It's free, it's easy, there's more features. No reason not to. In Windows Media Player, select ""Add to Library"", and then you can choose single files or an entire folder.
Pick the ones you want to import, and Windows Media Player will import them into your media library. If the music is stored in ""My Music"", Windows Media Player may import it automatically when the program starts.

"
"
Use the same steps as described above.",How to Upload Music from an Mp3 Player to Windows Media Player4," In the unlikely event that you have a Sony PSP, the steps are mostly the same, except, after connecting the cable from the PSP to the computer (and powering on the PSP) but before opening the device in Windows Explorer, you have to set the PSP to USB Connection mode.


On the PSP, arrow left to Settings, arrow up to ""USB Connection"" and press X. Now the PSP is in USB Connection mode. Windows should mount the device as a removable disk, and you will be able to browse the folders stored on your memory stick.

"
"
Connect your PSP to a wireless network.,
Open the Settings menu.,
Select ""System Update"".,Select ""Update via Internet"".,
Select your network connection.,
Download any available updates.,
Start the update.",How to Upgrade Your PSP Firmware1," Your PSP will need to be connected to the network in order to download the update files.

If you don't have a wireless internet connection, you can update your PSP using your computer.;
, This is located on the far-left end of the XMB., This can be found at the top of the Settings menu.,, If you don't have any networks to select, you will need to setup a connection first., The PSP will search for updates. If one is found, you can press ""X"" to start downloading it., After the update has been downloaded, you will be prompted to start installing it. Press ""X"" to start the update process.

If you need to go back and install the update later, navigate to Settings, select ""System Update"", and then select ""Update via Storage Media"".

Determine why you need an mp3 player.,
Search google and find consumer reports about different mp3 player brands.,
Make sure to look at the big online retailers first, because they often have cheaper prices.,
If you are comfortable with auctions on high-priced items, you can often find a significant deal there.,
Check out any other department stores with online sites such as:


Wal-mart
Radioshack
Circuit City
Target

,
You can often find sites like Pricewatch or Pricegrabber that will compare these prices for you.,
Go to the sites of mp3 player manufacturers to learn the technical specifications and what kind of computer equipment they need to run on.

AC adapter

This is good for charging up your mp3 player when you don't have access to a computer, such as in a hotel or when you're at school or work.",How to Select and Buy an MP3 Player,"


Will you be watching videos or just listening to sound?

How much space will you need to store your songs?

Estimate how many songs you get in a month, and then multiply by 100 for the amount of MB you will need. (This number is a general rule of thumb taking into consideration that each mp3 song is about 2.5-3 MB in size, and you will probably want your mp3 player for 3 years before deleting stuff.)

For example, if I know I get 15 songs a month, then I will want a 1500 MB mp3 player, which is 1.5GB.
If I know I will get 50 songs a month, then I will want a 5 GB mp3 player. (1024 MB is one GB)


This is a general rule of thumb and you should purchase what you think you will use.



Are you planning to join a music subscription service?

If so, research the various services to find out which mp3 players they do and do not work with.



Will you be carrying your mp3 player with you everywhere you go?

If so, you may want a smaller type that can easily fit in your pocket.

The amount of space that you give to the virtual hard disk will not be immediately allocated. The space taken up by the virtual hard drive's file on your actual hard drive equals the total size of the files written to it. For example, if you create a 100 GB virtual HDD, its file will take up no space on your real HDD, but if you install an operating system that takes up 5 GB of space in the virtual HDD, the file's size will increase to 5 GB.

If all else fails, ask the person for their phone number or information.,
Record all interactions with a blocked caller and give them to your local law enforcer.",How to Call Back a Blocked Number1," This should only be done under circumstances where blocked or private calls are threatening or obscene. Your phone company will be notified of the call and will record their number and the date and time of the call. You are then expected to carry out legal action by notifying the police or any law enforcement agency about the call you traced by letting them know the date and time of the call. However, your phone company will only release the blocked or private caller's number to a law enforcement agency. A recording will play to let you know the call has been traced and is being kept in your phone company's records, as well as any further instructions on how to pursue legal action against the caller.


You must answer the call for Call Trace to work. Even if the caller hangs up the moment you pick up, tracing the call is still possible as long as a connection was made.
Some phone companies and law enforcers will require you to trace the call at least three times successfully before they can take action.Most phone companies will charge you a small fee whether or not you choose to report the call to law enforcements. This fee can cost up to $10 per call.
Call tracing should only be used for calls that are malicious, obscene, or harassing in nature.;
, Since it is so difficult to find a blocked caller’s ID, then it might useful for you to reject all blocked calls in the future from calling you.

Call Return can only gather information from the last person that called you.Unfortunately, this does not work for blocked or private calls. If the number is blocked or private, an error message will notify you that your provider could not gather data from the caller.
If you have Anonymous Call Rejection activated and still receive malicious or obscene calls, you can now use Call Return to retrieve their number.
This service may need to be activated by your phone company so call your provider to see if they offer Call Return services.
You don't have to pick up the call to use Call Return. Some malicious callers or telemarketers will call around the same time of the day, so you can always wait for the phone to ring to the end, and then use Call Return to retrieve their information.

, Request that telemarketers place you on their “Do Not Call” list. Most telemarketers need verbal confirmation to put you on their ""Do Not Call"" list or they will continue to call you until you either buy their services or tell them not to.


It may be difficult to speak to or reason with some callers. Don't give out your personal information and don't let the phone call go beyond your comfort level. Remember, you can hang up to escape the situation.

Learn about unblocking services and decide if it's right for you by visiting their websites and reading reviews.,
Set up your smartphone to use Trapcall or any other unmasking service app.,
Unmask a blocked number.",How to Call Back a Blocked Number2," There are several unblocking services you can download on your smartphone like Trapcall and the Caller Identification App (CIA). Most of these services cost money to activate and will work on most smartphone devices. They can unmask blocked or private calls, records your calls, and help blacklist any unwanted callers.


Trapcall: Trapcall is a subscription service with a number of plans that offer different features. The most basic plan will help you reveal a blocked caller’s phone number as well as other basic information associated with the number.Caller Identification App: Although this service does not unmask blocked phone calls, it can help you block unwanted numbers as well as retrieve information about the caller from public databases., This means downloading their app on your smartphone device by searching and installing it from your smartphone's app store. You may need to purchase the app or buy a subscription service to access their unmasking services.


The service should walk you through the steps on how to set up your phone. For example, setting up Trapcall mostly consists of dialing a few numbers and hitting send. Each phone has a particular set of numbers that is specific to your phone number, carrier provider, and location, and is provided to you by Trapcall on their website. They will then ask if you'd like to test out your phone and call you with an automated number to complete the test.

, Each service will have a different set of instructions on how to unmask a blocked call. Most services will require you to wait for the blocked or private caller to call you and then hit ""Decline"" or ""Reject"" on your smartphone. And a few moments later, another call or message will come in with the blocked number's ID exposed.

Get an internet connection.,
Look for a good website that sells phone load for the network you may be using.,
Take time to research, if possible.,
Choose the amount of phone credits on the appropriate network once you have a site to buy from.,
Look for ways to save.,
Check the total and computation to make sure everything is up to scratch.,
Wait for your purchase to be confirmed and then wait for the reload to arrive.",How to Buy Prepaid Cell Phone Cards Online," To buy online, you need to be connected to the Internet, obviously. While you can do this on your laptop or desktop, you can also do it through your phone or any other Internet-ready device.;
,


It may be useful to add your country to the search term when you run a search online. For instance, if you are a cellphone user from India on the Vodafone network, you should type ""recharge phone Vodafone India online"" or something along those lines. Most of the sites are country-specific and offer reloads from all the cellphone network providers in that country, so you just need to find one that caters to cellphone users in your area.

, Don't be afraid to look around if you have the time for it -- this is obviously inapplicable if you are trying to buy a reload for an emergency, but shopping around for the best prices and deals can be beneficial.


Take note, though, that price isn't everything: some sites may have lower prices on the phone credits they sell but may also have bad delivery time (slow to apply the reload to your phone) or may have bad guarantees on their product. Go with something that you can trust (a solid guarantee is always a great indication) so that you don't end up wasting your money on something that never even reaches you... or which takes a week to show up.

, Again, going with the Vodafone example, if you want to buy 300INR's worth of prepaid phone credits, look for that option on the site's products and add it to your cart. Then check out.

, Most sites offer discounts if you have a coupon. If you have one, apply it to your checkout total, since this is where the ""enter coupon code"" prompt usually shows up. And if you don't have one but have the time to look for one... well, hey, what are you waiting for? Search for some coupons online.

, Then pay using the appropriate payment method. Online, this is usually PayPal or credit card.

, The best sites send the reload to your phone almost immediately, but they too can be subject to the vagaries of payment processors: they have to wait for the payment processor they are using to confirm that you have paid for the purchase.


In most cases, if any tardiness does occur, it may well be the payment processor holding up the transaction. 24 hours is the longest you should wait (although most reloads are delivered far, far faster than that). If it passes that mark, you should open a complaint already.

If you plan on purchasing a cell phone at a discounted price by signing a contract with a mobile phone carrier, it is important to first choose the carrier.,
Once you've determined a carrier, or if you will be purchasing an unlocked phone at full retail price, use a phone finder such as the one on Phone Scoop's website (listed in External Links).

,
If you are a non-technical user (you want to use the cell phone exclusively as a phone, not a handheld game console or pocket-pc), then features such as a camera, mp3 ring tones, video playback and messaging are not needed.

,
If you are a mid-range user, look at phones that have features such as a camera or mp3 ring tone support.,
If you are a high-end user, look into features such as mp3 playback, support for trans-flash expansion cards, a camera over 1 mega-pixel, video playback, or blue tooth.

,
If you are a real hacker and want to learn a lot, think about the open, programmable device that runs Maemo, OpenMoko or something similar.,

,,, Mid-range users tend not to purchase phones with multimedia players as these tend to add a significant cost increase.

,, Such phones, however, are really more for studying and may be less convenient in the daily use.

,, Ask yourself if you misplace things often or if you drop things often. Choose a cell phone that is covered by cell phone insurance. An additional fee is required per month but it will save you hundreds of dollars if your phone is lost, stolen or if there is any physical or liquid damage.

, For example: only displaying the time when service is available, limits on text message storage, and shutdown sounds that can't be turned off (really embarrassing at the movies). Ask a sale person or a friend who owns the same model about specific features before you buy.

, Often if a handset has been out for a month users will have already found out about any major problems with their handset and posted on a consumer websites. You can be confident you are choosing the right mobile phone before making your high ticket purchase.

, Get a feel for the handsets and a look at the various sizes, display screens and operating systems to see what best suits your personal abilities and hand size. You can also get demonstrations and any questions you may have. They will try to encourage you to sign up but you can always say no thanks once you have the information you want.

Remove the battery cover and battery from the cell phone.
Look for a small, white, round dot or square sticker located on the inside of the phone where the battery normally resides. If the sticker is colored red instead of white, this indicates that the phone has been exposed to liquid.

Power the cell phone on and test all physical parts of the phone; including the flip or slider features, the battery charger, and antennae, if applicable.
Make an outgoing call, send an outgoing text message, test the camera, and the Internet service, if possible. If the seller or a friend is willing to help, have them call you and text you to determine that the incoming services also work.

Depending on the carrier you choose for a no-contract phone, your pay-as-you-go rate and terms will vary.
You can unlock a carrier-locked phone if you meet your carrier's unlocking criteria. Usually, you have to have paid off a certain amount of your phone's contract, and you'll probably have to pay a fee on top of that.

, Unless you decide to get a SIM-unlocked phone, you'll need to buy a phone licensed by AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, or Verizon. Purchasing a carrier-licensed phone does not enroll you in a contract--it simply determines the cellular network you'll be using.

If you travel a lot, you may want to use a Verizon phone due to optimal coverage., Your iPhone will use one of two cellular data frequencies: CDMA or GSM. Verizon and Sprint phones use CDMA, while AT&T and T-Mobile phones use GSM.

Also note that GSM is more widely-used throughout the world than is CDMA., Purchasing an iPhone from a carrier store means you'll most likely end up with a carrier-locked phone and a contract.

To start your search for the best prepaid phone service, you should ask yourself some basic questions:


How much do you really use your cell phone?,
Do some research.,
Determine if you want to use your existing device or if you are looking for a new one.,
Choose the plan that's right for you.",How to Buy a Prepaid Cell Phone Plan," Every day? All day? Just for emergencies? A few times a month? To send tons of texts? The type of phone and number of minutes you need directly relates to the way you use your phone.
How much data do you consume? If you use a lot of data, some prepaid wireless carriers will charge you extra if you go over your data limit, even if you have an unlimited data plan, or they could cut off your service if they feel you’re abusing the network.
Where will you primarily use your mobile phone? Check the coverage maps of various wireless providers to see which one offers the best service in the area where you’ll use your phone. If you plan to use it internationally, make sure it will work in the countries you travel to or call the most.;
, Ask friends and family for their opinions and recommendations (make sure they use their phones in the same place that you’ll be using yours) about coverage and customer service. Compare service plans and rates, and make sure to read the fine print to avoid any overage costs or hidden charges. Take a look at online sites that compare mobile providers, too.

, Consider the way use your phone and your budget.


If you would like to continue using your existing device, select a new prepaid carriers that has a ""Bring Your Own Phone"" or a ""Bring Your Own Device"" program (BYOP/D). Some carriers that do have this program include Straight Talk, Net10 and Simple Mobile. Straight Talk's BYOP site does a really good job of outlining the process. Take a look and decide if a BYOP program is something that interests you: http://www.straighttalksim.com.
If you want to get a new phone, consider what kind of cell phone you want? Each type—camera phones, smartphones, flip phones, slider keyboard phones, Bluetooth-enabled phones—has a different price tag. Most prepaid carriers don’t subsidize the cost of the phone (like carriers do when you enter into a multi-year contract), so you’ll most likely pay full price for your phone. If cost is a concern, online sites like TracFone have loads of phones starting at just $10.

, Remember that it’s important to select the prepaid wireless provider that has a plan that best meets YOUR needs (rates, coverage, plan details), and a phone that you want. There’s no single answer to this question because some mobile providers are better than others for different users and different coverage areas.

Access your Drive account and click “New”. Then select “Google Forms” from the “More” sub-folder. Clicking this icon will take you to a blank form. This form is editable at anytime and will automatically update so that anyone accessing the Form from the field will always see the Form in its most current version. ;
, Double click in the ""Title"" field and enter a name for your Form.

, Click the “Add Item” icon and insert the question or data point you wish field personnel to collect in the “Question Title” field. Once this is complete, choose how you wish for field personnel to answer this field in the “Question Type” drop down. If you choose “Multiple Choice”, “Check Boxes” or “Choose From List”, you will be prompted with pre-determined responses from which field personnel can select. Once you have your question looking the way you want it, click the “Done” icon.

, Repeat Step #3 until until you are satisfied with your form. Each question can be edited, duplicated or removed at any point by simply choosing the appropriate icon to the right of the question.

, Go to the confirmation section at the bottom of the page and double click the text box at the top of the section.  Type in the confirmation message you would like field personnel to see once they have successfully submitted a Form.

, While in the confirmation section, ensure the “Show link to submit another response” check box is checked. This will allow field personnel to easily complete multiple Forms without having to reload the webpage manually.

, Click the “View Live Page” icon at the top of the document. Clicking this icon takes you to the live, operational version of this form. Review the Form for any errors or revisions.

, Copy the web address from the address bar of this 'live page"" and email it to the field personnel who will be collecting data using their smart phone.

, The Google Form that you so diligently crafted is now a powerful data collection tool in the hands of your smart-phone wielding field personnel. First, field personnel will need to access you form by clicking on the hyperlink in your email or selecting it from their browser bookmarks on their smart phone.

, Field personnel will populate the form and then submit their findings by clicking the blue “Submit” icon at the bottom of the form.

, Field personnel will receive a confirmation message when their information has been successfully submitted. The confirmation message will offer up a link to complete and submit another form.

, A sister spreadsheet is created along with every new Google Form. Both documents live in the creators Google Drive. These two documents are linked so that every time a Form is submitted by field personnel, the data from the Form is automatically added to the spreadsheet. Since the spreadsheet (or Google Sheet) is cloud based, it syncs in real time with its sister Form. The data can be reviewed, manipulated and graphed in much the same way as you would on an Excel spreadsheet.

, If location is something in your Form that you would like to see automatically mapped from data in your spreadsheet, we will need to complete a few more steps. One useful feature in Google Sheets is the ability to use add-on features created by outside developers. For the purpose of mapping our data points, an add-on named Mapping Sheets is a perfect fit. You can download Mapping Sheets for free by clicking “Get Add-Ons” in the “Add-Ons” sub-folder.

, After downloading Mapping Sheets, add its functionality to your spreadsheet by hovering over the “Mapping Sheets” icon in the “Add-ons” tab and then clicking on the “Start Mapping” option. Choosing this option will add a page at the bottom of your Google Sheet called “Data”. The Data page which was added is the page used by the Mapping Sheets add-on to plot your spreadsheet data onto a Google Map. Unfortunately, Mapping Sheets will only allow the user to show limited data on the map. For the most part, it consists of the location the data point, name the location and add a category for this data point. Hopefully they will flesh this add-on out a bit in the future but even in its current incarnation, it is still a very useful add-on.

, Now you must tell the Mapping Sheet spreadsheet to automatically populate cells with information from your Google Sheet which is receiving information from your Google Form. To accomplish this, start by selecting the first “Name” cell A2 and insert the following function in the function box: =IMPORTRANGE("""", ""!C2:C1000"")

, The function will remain largely the same for each of these columns but you will need to make sure the range for each column is changed accordingly.

, Once this step is complete, you are ready to test your map. Click the “Build” icon on the Mapping Sheets sidebar to the right.

, After a moment of processing, the “View” icon should become available. Click the “View” icon to view your mapped data points. Pretty exciting, eh? Note at this point that although the Mapping Sheet cells will automatically populate every time your field personnel submit a Form, you will have to repeat the “Build” process every time you wish to update your map with new data.

, In order to create a more robust spreadsheet, you may want consider hyperlinking photos or documents to it for easy reference. This process will likely be performed by the project manager after field activities have occurred during post-processing. For the purpose of this exercise, we will be hyperlinking photos to the master spreadsheet. In order to hyperlink photos to the master spreadsheet, you will first need to make sure that all the photos you wish to use have been uploaded to Google Drive. It is a good idea to group all photos into a folder where they will remain permanently because moving the photos will deactivate the hyperlink. It is also a good idea to use standardized nomenclature for your photos so that they are easily identified.

, To insert a new column on your master spreadsheet, right click on the column adjacent to where you want your “photo” column to live and then choose either “Add 1 Left” or “Add 1 Right”. If you would like to create more than one column for additional photos or supporting documentation, repeat this step as many times as required.

, Double click on the first row of your newly added column and then type in the name of the column. If you have added multiple columns, repeat this step for each newly added column.

, Now that you have added, the appropriate amount of columns to your spreadsheet, go back your photos folder on Google Drive and right click on the photo you wish to use. Select the “Get Link” option. This will generate a new window with a link to the picture. Highlight this link and then copy the link by right clicking and selecting the “copy” option.

, Select the cell where you want to place the hyperlink for the photo, right click and then select the paste option. If you wish you can rename the hyperlink to fit your specific format needs. To do this, right click on the hyperlink and select the “edit link” option. Enter the name of the photo as wish it to appear on the spreadsheet in the “Text” text box then hit the “Apply” button.

The analysis drill ought to include projecting what future processes should look like as well as making sure the processes conform to business requisites. These requisites and process evaluation data comes in handy when approaching potential ERP solution vendors and screening their product’s capabilities before deeming it a fit.;
, It is important to understand how a potential ERP solution will adapt to the current IT infrastructure and/or platform. For instance, a business that is aboard Microsoft platform is most likely to find a great technical fit with an ERP software built on .NET platform.

, It is quite common for businesses to fall prey for marketing gimmicks used by substandard vendors out there only to regret later. Ensure to unravel any hidden costs related to software maintenance, hardware upgrades, additional implementation costs, etc.

, Devise an all-inclusive ERP project implementation plan well beforehand.


This plan should not only include activities required for installing the system, but should also entail the list of resources responsible for ensuring that the solution is tested, optimally functional and well-accepted by end users.
Devise this plan prior to finalising a particular ERP software in order to acknowledge the resource and cost requisites to make its implementation a huge success.
Further more, the implementation plan ought to include all the nitty-gritty right from workflow design to test iterations and data migration to core organizational activities.

, Failing to do so plays a huge spoilsport for a successful ERP rollout. For instance, if a business intends to curb costs, boost revenue and scalability, it is essential to assess and project ERP software’s benefits against these three metrics.

, It is quite relevant when choosing ERP software. Many business owners tend to commit the grave mistake of choosing a solution based on what their competitors are opting for or go for a solution simply based on brand name.


A sound and intuitive practice is considering a number of options at hand and select the one that best fits the business requisites, budget and objectives.

Establish what you want: The very first thing in finding the right software vendor is establishing what you hope to achieve.,
Look at the credentials as well as certificates of your vendors: This is an extremely beneficial exercise that must be done if you want to find the right software vendor.,
Consider scalability and customization: Another important consideration when choosing software provider is determining the scalability and the room allowed for customization.,
Be on the lookout for any hidden costs or fees: Some vendors are tricky with the aim of taking advantage of your innocence.",How to Choose the Right Software Vendor," This means determining the needs that you want your software to meet within the organization. Doing this will strategically align you as you can narrow down your software vendor search. Be clear from the very beginning to facilitate an easy and proper search.;
, Looking at their credentials and certificates will not only enhance your search but also increase confidence on the vendor you finally choose. Beware of software providers who refuse to give you access to these important documents.

, It is important to note that correctional facilities, businesses and hospitals may expand their activities and size sometime in the future. Will you be required to change your management software, accounting software, EHS system, or any other software when this happens? If yes, this might eat deep into your company budget yet there is a route you can follow at present to counter such anticipated challenges. Look for a vendor whose software bears adequate scalability and customization abilities to gain maximum benefit.

, If you are not careful, you will find yourself unknowingly paying for additional costs such as in-person training, maintenance or set up fees and monthly support fees among many others. Read the contract carefully to detect any hidden costs that may allow your software vendor to hike the fees during the period of the contract. Also check if there are provisions permitting you to end the contract six months later if the software does not meet your expectations.

Select your finalists.,
Get input from your internal users.,
Make your final selection.,
Select your implementation service provider.,
Do a final evaluation.,
Establish your timeline.",How to Choose Business Software," What are your reasons for shopping for new software? Make a list of the challenges you’d like the software to address and separate it into two categories; Needs and Wants. Your Needs list should be very brief and should consist only of the features absolutely necessary in order for the software to work for your company. Your Wants list can be much broader and features should be listed in order of importance, encompassing all of the capabilities that will make life easier. For instance, you may need a segmented general ledger in order to track performance for individual divisions, but it may be just a Want to close out the quarter for each division at separate times.;
, Calculate how much you can afford to spend, including any new hardware needed as well as first-year implementation and support. The cost of the software is important, but it is equally crucial to know what your recurring costs will be. Will you need someone to set up new hardware? Can you use a general accounting application or will you need extensive customization? Database consulting and customization is generally $100-$200 per hour depending on the platform and the experience of the consultant so the further down your list of Wants you go, the more expensive the software implementation will be.

, Once you are equipped with your Needs list and a preliminary budget, you should be able to quickly eliminate many products based on a lack of features or too high of a price tag. There are many sites listing available accounting software packages and allowing you to search by features or platform. Many of these sites also include pricing information, making it much easier to quickly whittle down your list of potential vendors. Choose 4-5 packages that look like a good fit based on factors like specialization in supporting your size or type of business, longevity, depth of product line and breadth of support for the product. Focus on companies that are clearly designing products with one eye on the future. This is evident if they are building products that will easily integrate with other software packages and they are using platforms and technologies that are supported by industry leaders. Choose a platform that has a broad base of users (like Microsoft Access or Visual Basic) so you won’t have trouble finding resources to keep it running down the road.

, Which packages offer the most features from your Wants list? Even if they are not within your budget now, you may be able to purchase add-on modules down the road. What product enhancements are planned? Are they features that will be useful to you and how quickly will they become available? Often you can negotiate a discount on additional modules prior to their official release.

, Most software companies will allow you to download demos of their software or request a demo on CD. This will allow you to familiarize yourself with the interface and see how some of the key functions work. Look for good design and clearly marked functions. Is it easy to figure out how to enter an order? Can you easily switch functions and does the software allow you flexibility in creating new records or do you have to follow a strict data entry procedure? This is a true test of which products are going to be a good fit. You can rule out products that are under- or over-qualified for your business and narrow down the 2 or 3 products that you are comfortable with.

, The people who will use the software are often your best resource in making decisions. Ask your order entry specialist about the limitations of your current system; does invoicing take too long resulting in decreased productivity? What other features would your internal users like to have? How would they save time and increase profitability? This will quickly point to any inefficiencies in your current package and alert you to the features you should look for in potential packages. Additionally, this has the added benefit of speeding internal buy-in when you do begin implementing your new software. Employees will be much more receptive to a package that improves their workflow.

, Before doing so, make sure that you feel comfortable with the product as well as the vendor. If the salesperson is too pushy or you feel that they are not able to provide you with the information you need, don’t be afraid to ask to speak with someone else. It is important that you feel comfortable with your decision because you will be spending money and, more importantly, time in implementing your new software.

, You may be able to find service providers through referrals from other business owners and friends, particularly if the package you’ve chosen is written in a widely-supported database like Microsoft Access. However, even when this is the case, it is often a good idea to request some referrals from your software vendor. In many cases this may save you money by introducing you to a consultant that is already familiar with the product you’ve selected and can reduce the time required to get you up and running. It is vital to work with someone you can communicate easily with to set expectations and budget at the beginning so that costs don’t spin out of control.

, Review the information you received from the vendor and the implementation service provider to ensure that the products you are purchasing dovetails with the services you have planned. This will ensure that there are no gaps once you get to the implementation stage and will give you a chance to finalize your upfront costs as well as project your ongoing costs for training, support and maintenance on a yearly basis.

, Plan your implementation carefully to avoid your peak busy times and to allow for system redundancy to ensure that none of your data is lost during the transition period. Many businesses feel compelled to change accounting systems at the beginning of the fiscal year, but often this means implementing your new system at the end of a fiscal year when most businesses are focused on sales and business performance. Most accounting systems will allow you to begin implementation at any time without any loss of data or additional work. Don’t feel rushed to do it at the end of the year; schedule it for a less stressful time and let your implementation service provider work with you to ensure a seamless transition from your old system to your new one.

While some email service providers cost less than ten dollars a month, others have rates that can climb to hundreds of dollars each month. Keep in mind that you will pay more for premium services. For example, a provider that gives you around the clock tech support will cost more than one that only provides email ticket tech support., When you are choosing an email service provider, you need to consider how much tech support you will expect from the service. Some services will offer around the clock support. Others may only provide clients with limited ticket support., It is important to choose an email service provider that is well established and has a good reputation. For example, you should refrain from choosing a new email service provider that has been in business for only a short period of time. Read reviews online and talk to friends, family, and colleagues about their email service provider experiences., Some email service providers offer free trials. Consider trying out several services that offer free trials. You can then compare the email service providers and choose the one that best suits your needs.

, Some email service providers can integrate with social media channels. This can expand your reach and help you meet marketing goals. When choosing a provider, ask about their social media capabilities."

Select a provider that offers efficient subscriber management.,
Choose a provider that will give you a private IP address.,
Inquire about deliverability rates.,
Pick a provider with multiple Internet connections.,
Choose a provider that provides detailed reporting.",How to Choose an Email Service Provider2," Managing your subscribers is one of the most important services an email service provider provides. Research how the provider manages subscription forms, unsubscribe centers, and subscriber content preferences. These are all key to acquiring and personalizing email services for your subscribers., The IP address your email service provider assigns you indicated the origin of an email. You do not want to share an IP address with other customers at your email service provider. For example, excessive spam complaints against another client with the same IP address could prevent your emails from being delivered., Before you decide on an email service provider, ask the company about email deliverability rates. You want to make sure the emails you are sending end up in subscribers’ inboxes instead of getting marooned in cyberspace or spam filters., Your email service provider should have multiple, high speed Internet connections through several sources. This will ensure reliability should one of the Internet connections fail. For example, if your email service provider’s Internet connection goes down, your subscribers won’t be able to click links in the emails you send., An email service provider provides detailed reporting on your email campaigns. This reporting should include the rates at which subscribers open emails, daily delivery success rates, and the rate at which subscribers click links included in the emails. You should be able to view which of your subscribers completed each of these actions. This will help you measure how effective your email campaigns are."

Once Windows 8.1 is installed and started, you'll find that your resolution is set to 800x600. The registry hack mentioned above no longer works with Windows 8.1. The good news is that you can go higher, but the bad news is that you can't go higher than the maximum.

,, You should always use the latest stable version of the toolkit. There may be more than one version listed, so look closely at the release number.For example, if you are presented with JDK 8u101 and 8u102, choose 8u102.

, The option is just beneath the JDK version number.

, Once you click the link, follow the prompts to select a save location on your computer and start the download.

, See Installing on macOS, Installing on Windows, Installing from an Archive on Linux or Solaris, or Installing from a Package on Linux for help installing the kit.

, After downloading the Java Software Development Kit installer, double-click the downloaded file in the Downloads window of your web browser or in Finder., This icon looks like an open box. The JDK installer will launch.

, Now you’ll see the Installation Type window.


If you see a window that says “Destination Select” after clicking continue, click “Install for all users of this computer.” Not all users will see this window., Type your password to allow this.”

, Type your administrator username and password into the provided blanks .

, When the confirmation window appears, you can close it.

, Now you’ll run a quick test from a terminal window to make sure the installation was successful. You can get to this folder by clicking “Go” and selecting “Applications.”

, Here you’ll see a list of system utilities.

, Now you’ll see the command prompt.

, Just beneath the command you ran, you should see the JDK version number you installed (e.g. “1.8.0.1”). This means the installation was successful and you can get to your coding.


Once you’ve made sure the installation is successful, you can delete the DMG installer file you downloaded to conserve hard drive space.

, Once you’ve downloaded the Java Software Development Kit installer, navigate to the download location you chose earlier to launch the installer.

, Depending on your version of Windows, you may be prompted to give permission for JDK to install. Click “Yes” or “OK” when prompted, and the installer’s Welcome screen will appear., Now you’ll move through a series of screens that will guide you through the JDK installation.

, This will begin the installation, which may take a few minutes depending on your computer. The green progress bar will show the progress of the installation., This button will not appear until the installer has finished.

, Now that the JDK is installed, you’ll need to tell Windows how to load it.A menu will appear at the bottom left area of the screen.

,, Now you’ll see the System Properties panel.

, You’ll see a few different areas where you can adjust various system settings.

, This new dialog box displays two separate areas—one for User Variables (settings specific to your user account) and another for system-wide settings (System Variables)., Follow these instructions exactly, as there is no “undo” option., This step only applies to Windows 10:


Type c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_xx\bin (but replace the “8.0_xx” part with the version number you installed).
Click the “Move Up” button until the path you typed appears as the top of the list.
Click “OK.”

, Skip this step if you’re using Windows 10. You should see the “Edit System Variable” window. Make the following changes to the “Variable value” field only (don’t delete what’s there though):


Type C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_xx\bin (but replace the “8.0_xx” with the correct version number) in FRONT of the other directories.
Add a semicolon (;) to the very end of what you just typed, just like this: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_xx\bin;

There should be no space before or after the semicolon, so the entire line should look something like this: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_2\bin;C:\Program Files\Intel\xxx

Click “OK.”

, The installation is complete.

, Now you’ll check to make sure the JDK path is correct., Now you’ll see a terminal window containing the command prompt.

, You should see the full path to the JDK that you entered earlier.

, The version of JDK you installed will now appear on the screen.


If either part of this command-prompt test does not produce results, you may need to load the new environment variables by rebooting the computer.

, If you downloaded an archived tarball of the JDK (it ends with *.tar.gz), use this method to complete the installation.


This method assumes you know how to use basic Unix shell commands.
If you downloaded a .rpm package file instead of a tarball, see Installing the JDK from a Package on Linux.

, You can install the JDK in any directory for which you have “write” permissions. Note that only the root user can install the JDK to a system directory., Use the mv command to get the archive file into the correct directory.

, The command is different depending on your operating system (and in the case of Solaris, the processor type). Once installed, a new directory called ""jdk<version>” will be created in the current directory. In these examples, replace the name of the *.tar.gz file with the name of the one you downloaded.Linux: tar zxvf jdk-7u<version>-linux-i586.tar.gz

Solaris (SPARC): tar xf -

Solaris (x64/EM64T): tar xf -


, Use the rm command to delete the archive file if you want to conserve disk space.

, If you're using an RPM-based Linux system (such as SuSE or RedHat), you can install the Java Development Kit from an RPM package. Make sure you've downloaded the You'll need to su to root (su root) so that you have the correct permission to install the package.The file you downloaded should end with "".rpm""
This method assumes you know how to use basic Unix shell commands.

,


rpm -e <package_name>

, You'll be using the ""rpm"" command again, but this time with different flags:



rpm -ivh jdk-7u<version>-linux-x64.rpm (replace ""jdk-7u<version>-linux-x64.rpm"" with the actual package name)

, When the package is finished installing, you'll be returned to the command line. If you want to conserve disk space, you can delete the downloaded package file with the rm command.

Adj Cos: Edit Go To cell range A6:A17285 and enter into A6 w/o quotes the following formula, ""=17*COS((ROW()-6)*0.25/12*PI()/180)"" and Edit Fill Down. The .25 is for 1440*.25 = 360. 17280/12=1440. So we are taking 1/12th of 1/4 or 1/48th of 17280 = 360, the degrees of the trig function cosine for a circle. PI()/180 converts radians to degrees. (ROW()-6) in row 6 = 0, so we start off taking the cosine of 0, which is 1, and multiplying it by 17. 17 is twice the Stretch factor, and if I recall rightly, is 1/2 the radius of the ring (the Stretch factor operates from each sphere's center). However, Shrinker is also involved, as you'll see later.
Adj Sin: Edit Go To cell range B6:B17285 and enter into B6 w/o quotes the following formula,""=17*SIN((ROW()-6)*0.25/12*PI()/180)+17""and Edit Fill Down, which is different than the above one for cosine by the addition of 17 to it. All in all, that give us 4*8.5, and that is the radius, as I recall.
Indicator: Select cell C6 and enter 1. Edit Go To cell range C7:C17286 and enter w/o quote the formula, ""=IF((ROW()-7)/MAGIC=INT((ROW()-7)/MAGIC),1,IF((ROW()-7)=0,1,0))"" and Edit Fill Down. This formula says, 'Take a look at the row I'm in, divide it by the number of rows per sphere (MAGIC) and if that number is an integer, return a 1, otherwise if I'm in the next-to-top row also return a 1, otherwise, return a 0.' So now there is an indicator of where 1 sphere ends and the next one begins, no matter how many spheres the user selects to chart.
MODIFIED: Randy: Edit Go To cell range D6:D17286 and enter into D6 w/o quotes the following formula,""=RANDBETWEEN(4,7)/100"" and Edit Fill Down. Warning: Make calculation Manual before adding this variable or column into your formulas, especially as a factor, as it can take 20 minutes to calculate and draw the new chart. It is not currently employed, but a copy of its formula has been saved at the bottom of the x and y formulas. Edit Go To cell range D6:D17285 and Insert Name Define Name Randy to cell range $D$6:$D$17285. Also, Edit Go To cell range D6:D17286 and Copy, then Paste Values right back to cell D6:D17286.
t: 0 to nπ: Select cell E6 and enter 0. Select cell E7 and enter the formula ""=(2*PI()/MAGIC)"". Edit Go To cell range E8:E17285 and enter w/o quotes into E8 the formula ""=IF(C8=1,2*PI(),2*PI()/MAGIC+E7)"" and Edit Fill Down.
z1_: Edit Go To cell range F6:F17285 and enter w/o quotes into F6 the formula ""=CEE*COS(AYE*E6)"" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range F6:F17285 and Insert Name Define Name z1_ to cell range $F$6:$F$17285.
Adj_x1: Edit Go To cell range G6:G17285 and enter w/o quotes into G6 the formula ""=IF(C6=1,A6,G5)"" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range G6:G17285 and Insert Name Define Name Adj_x1 to cell range $G$6:$G$17285. This makes a constant adjustment as if one were referencing a new center of every new sphere from Adj Cos, else it takes the value just above itself.
Adj_y1: Edit Go To cell range H6:H17285 and enter w/o quotes into H6 the formula ""=IF(C6=1,B6,H5)"" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range H6:H17285 and Insert Name Define Name Adj_y1 to cell range $H$6:$H$17285. This makes a constant adjustment as if one were referencing a new center of every new sphere from Adj Sin, else it takes the value just above itself.
x: No z: Edit Go To cell range I6:I17285 and enter w/o quotes into I6 the formula ""=SHRINKER^2*(Stretch_x1*(((BEE^2-CEE^2*COS(AYE*E6)*COS(AYE*E6))^0.5 *COS(E6)))+Adj_x1)"" and Edit Fill Down. This is the x part of the heart of the sinewave sphere formula from the text, without the z dimension added or multiplied in, which is why it took me so long to discover how to make it work.
y: With z: Edit Go To cell range J6:J17285 and enter w/o quotes into J6 the formula ""=SHRINKER^2*(Stretch_y1*(((BEE^2-CEE^2*COS(AYE*E6)*COS(AYE*E6))^0.5* SIN(E6))+z1_)+Adj_y1)"" and Edit Fill Down. This is the y part of the heart of the sinewave sphere formula from the text, with the z dimension added in, which is why it took me so long to discover how to make it work. In the spirallic spheroids Garthwaite Curve, the z-dimension is multiplied into both x and y parts. Furthermore, there was no adjustment for the GOLDEN MEAN Long Leg, which was expected all along, until it worked without it. The other curve doesn't.
Select cell I17286 and enter the formula w/o quotes ""=I6"" and select cell J17286 and enter the formula w/o quotes ""=J6"". This makes the top connecting line from the last sphere to the first.
Edit Go To cell range I6:J17288 and do Format Fill sky blue. Edit Go To cell range M6:N17288 and Format Fill sky blue.
Select cell D5 and Format Fill light sea green, font red, Border navy blue outline bold. Copy this cell to H17287. Then do Edit Paste Special Format of this cell to cell C6, E6, E7, I17286, J17286, M17286 and N17286 to make distinct the format of those cell's formulas/values.
NEW: COPY CELL RANGE A11:J17285 and then PASTE SPECIAL VALUES right back atop the same cell range. Format Fill Red and Font White. This means that the top Variables section is no longer operative in any useful way until you Edit Fill Down the formulas from row 10, which may mean having to wait a considerable length of time, as in 25 - 40 minutes. It can also take that long to save the workbook, so ...
NEW: Save the workbook.
NEW: Adj_y2: Edit Go To cell range L6:L17285 and enter w/o quotes into L6 the formula ""=IF(C6=1,Randy,L5)"" and Edit Fill Down. COPY CELL RANGE L11:L17285 and then PASTE SPECIAL VALUES right back atop the same cell range. Format Fill Red and Font White.
NEW: y2: With z: Edit Go To cell range M6:M17285 and enter w/o quotes into M6 the formula ""=SHRINKER^2*(Stretch_y1*(((BEE^2-CEE^2*COS(AYE*E6)*COS(AYE*E6))^0.5* SIN(E6))+z1_)+Adj_y1*0.5)+Adj_y2"" and Edit Fill Down. COPY CELL RANGE M11:M17285 and then PASTE SPECIAL VALUES right back atop the same cell range. Format Fill Red and Font White.
Select cell N17286 and enter ""=N6"", w/o quotes.
Hopefully, that avoided all the waiting and waiting for processing time to pass. We'll see.

,

Edit Go To cell range I6:J17286 and from the Ribbon or Chart Wizard select Charts All/Other Scatter Smoothed Line Scatter and Copy or Cut the chart that is atop the data worksheet and paste it to the top left of the Chart worksheet. Hover over the lower right corner until the cursor becomes a double-headed arrow and pull it open to become a large approximate square.
Click in the Plot Area and select Chart Layout from the ribbon and at far left under Current Selection select Series 1, then under that, Format Selection. Set Line to Kelly Green, Smoothed line, Transparency 27%, Weight = 1 pt. and Dashed = Heavy Dashed Dots. Set Shadow to checked Outer 315 degrees, black, Size 100%, Blur 4 pt, Distance 54 pt, Transparency 2 %. Set Glow to fire engine red Size = 4 pt. 74% transparency, Soft Edges 0 pt. Then click on OK.
Do Current Selection under Chart Layout as Plot Area, Format Selection. No Line, No Glow and No Shadow. Set Fill to Gradient to Aubergine left 0% and Foresty Blue Green at 70%; Radial Centered and Rotate gradient with shape check-box in lower left checked. Then click on OK.
Do menuitem Chart Add Data and respond to the range query by selecting M6:N17286 on the Data worksheet. This you will want to edit in the Chart worksheet formula bar until it becomes ""=SERIES(,'DATA 01'!$I$6:$I$17286,'DATA 01'!$N$6:$N$17286,2)"", w/o quotes.
Click in the Plot Area and select Chart Layout from the ribbon and at far left under Current Selection select Series 2 (or 3, whatever), then under that, Format Selection. Set Line to Bright Sky Blue, Smoothed line, Transparency 0%, Weight = 2 pt. (see TIPS below -- the example above is 3.75 tho) and Style Dashed is Solid. Set Shadow to checked Outer 315 degrees, black, Size 100%, Blur 4 pt, Distance 96 pt, Transparency 57 %. Set Glow to fire engine red Size = 4 pt. 50% transparency, Soft Edges 0 pt. OK - done √

Make use of helper articles when proceeding through this tutorial:

See the article How to Create a Spirallic Spin Particle Path or Necklace Form or Spherical Border for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation.",How to Create a Curve in Excel," I have found ""CRC STANDARD CURVES and SURFACES"" by David Von Seggern to be excellent as a source text -- please see Sources and Citations below for the full reference. When researching on the internet, search terms ""CURVE FORMULAS"", ""HORIZONTAL CURVES"", ""Curve Equations"" and ""3-Dimensional CURVE FORMULAS"" should get you started. ""MyCurve.org"" will lead you to a personal website related to the author of this article where instructions are given to graph one type of curve in particular -- a ring of spheroids. You may also find curves under Fractals, Algebra and Geometry and other types of Math, esp. Trigonometry and Calculus. Here are the classifications of Curves and Surfaces from the CRC Standard text:

;
, The first curve of the section is the Hyperbola, y=c(x^2 - a^2)^.5, with 6 variations of a and c given. To start with simply, choose a curve where everything is set equal to y, as above. Here is my smoothed line chart of the curve chosen, as depicted above, with the addition of some little ""bumps"" along the x-axis which will be discussed later:
, For this project, Worker1 will hold both the data and the charts, as well as a picture from the text to be used for comparison as the charts are created. Then pasted pictures of these will go onto the other sheet to preserve original input and any further trial variable changes, or creative constructions.,
In Edit, set all the first options to checked except Automatically Convert Date System . Set Display number of decimal places to blank (as integers are preferred). Preserve the display of dates and set 30 for 21st century cutoff.
In View, click on show Formula Bar and Status Bar and hover for Comments of all Objects . Check Show grid lines and set all boxes below that to auto or checked.
In Chart, allow Show chart names and set Data markers on hover and leave the rest unchecked for now.
In Calculation, make sure Automatically is checked and Calculate before save is also checked. Set max change to .001 as goal-seeking is not done in this project. Check Save external link values and Use 1904 system

In Error checking, check all the options.
In Save, select Save preview picture with new files and Save Autorecover after 5 minutes
In Ribbon, keep all of them checked except Hide group titles and Developer .

, It helps by placing the cursor between the A of Column A and the 1 in Row 1 in the upper leftmost corner and selecting the entire worksheet. Format Cells Number Number Decimal Places 4, Font Size 9 or 10.,
In B2, enter Givens:
In C2, enter AYE1_ and in D2 enter .1 (given as ""a=.1"" ...
In C3, enter AYE2_ and in D3 enter ""=AYE1_+0.1""  (... but then this is given as ""a=.2"" ...)
In C4, enter AYE3_ and in D4 enter .""=AYE2_+0.1""    (... and this was given as ""a=.3"" but you see, Excel must plot Y1, Y2 and Y3 for each 'a' given, and we cannot name them a1, a2 and a3 because to do so would conflict with cell name references. Even if we name them AYE1, on a fill down Excel will change the next one to AYE2, which is not necessarily what we want when just the value of x is supposed to be changing, not also the value of a. We need a separate column for each a=AYE_ and the 3 AYE_s must be distinct from each other.)
Select cell range C2:D4 and Insert Name Create Names in Left Column, OK. Align the AYE's right and center-align the 3 values and set them Formula Fill yellow (for input). Command+Select C2:D2, C3:D3, C4:D4 and E2:F2 and do Format Cell Border Blue bold outline and set Font to Blue too.
In E2, enter CEE and in F2 enter ,2 and Formula Fill yellow F2. Insert Name Define Name CEE for cell $F$2.
In G2, enter CEE2_ and in H2 enter ""=-CEE"" w/o quotes. This was not given and had to be figured out from the fact that the the givens resulted in a chart above the x-axis only.

,
Input AYE1_ into D6 and input Charting Y1 into D7.
Input AYE2_ into E6 and input Charting Y2 into E7.
Input AYE3_ into F6 and input Charting Y3 into F7.

, Select cell range B6:B89 and do Edit Fill Series Column Linear Step Value=1, OK. We won't be doing the sort but know that I used it to confirm that the X values could not be sorted from minimum to maximum, or the reverse, and have the chart come out correctly. This is a tool you must learn how to use and trust -- to completely rearrange the data for some experiment or other and then restore its order to original condition.

, I tried -20 to 20 and found that the lines converged horizontally per the givens at -6 and 6. I also wanted a tighter closeup of the curves, so I decided on -2 and 2 as my range, but left it open to the user's discretion. Input -2 to cell C8 and Insert Name Define Name Top to cell $C$8.
Input 2 to cell C89 and Insert Name Define Name Bottom to cell $C$89.
Input ""=-(Top-Bottom)/40+C8"" to cell C9 and select cell range C9:C48 and Edit Fill Down. Excel will automatically fill in +Top for +C8 when you type in the formula, so be careful to overwrite it.
Enter 0 to cell C49 and Format Cell Number Number Custom ""CEE IS NEGATIVE:"" including quotes. If you just type text into the cell, it alters the chart. You could also use value -2.
Select cell range C50:C88 (one up from Bottom) and enter ""=C9"" w/o quotes into C50 and Edit Fill Down. We're copying the X values because those will remain the same as we change CEE to CEE2_ under Y1, Y2 and Y3. Thus the idea to try sorting them as similar values. Didn't work. Didn't expect it to really. But one of my main objectives is to ""play with the data"" in order to achieve new effects, i.e. new curves.
Input ""=(CEE*(X_n^2-AYE1_^2)^0.5)/X_n^2"" to cell D8.
Input ""=(CEE*(X_n^2-AYE2_^2)^0.5)/X_n^2"" to cell E8.
Input ""=(CEE*(X_n^2-AYE3_^2)^0.5)/X_n^2"" to cell F8.
Select cell range D8:F50 and do Edit Fill Down. Do Edit Clear Contents for cell range D49:F49.
Edit the formula in D50 to read ""=(CEE2_*(X_n^2-AYE1_^2)^0.5)/X_n^2"" by changing CEE to CEE2_.
Edit the formula in E50 to read ""=(CEE2_*(X_n^2-AYE2_^2)^0.5)/X_n^2"".
Edit the formula in E50 to read ""=(CEE2_*(X_n^2-AYE3_^2)^0.5)/X_n^2"".
Select cell range D50:F89 and do Edit Fill Down.
You will notice some ""#NUM!"" error values towards the middle of each of the two data sets, top and bottom. No one said they'd be there; there's no note in the text or anything. Usually what this sort of error means is that we're trying to take the square root of a negative number. Excel can handle complex numbers, but awkwardly, in my humble opinion. It can also mean division by zero. I think those two explanations cover all these errors. The result of them is some funny little ""bumps"" per the curve-smoothing algorithm of Excel -- when the actual value is zero because errors return a value of zero mostly, Excel is saying, 'No, there ought to be a little bit of a curve there, and would be, if you took interpolative values ...' -- which probably just isn't so in this case. I made an unsmoothed line chart to show you and prove it. Here it is:






, Using Chart Layout on the Ribbon, set the Axes to reasonable minimum values that won't interfere too much with the curve's display, do away with the legend, and introduce vertical grid lines if you like. The usual preference is for Line Weight to equal 1. You can change the value of Top in cell C8, which you should Format Fill yellow (for input) to see those effects. Other than that, you have just charted a random curve and even allowed for some error values to be ignored, for if you hover over the plot series line on the chart at the little bumps, you'll find that the bumps consist of the error values. That there are no bumps in the photo from the text tells me that they either erased them or they interpolated that section of the curve ... until and unless someone provides a better explanation.

Therefore, between the formula in C6 and the one in D6, the {x,y} coordinates of the first cell would be {1,0} if nothing else were affecting them. It proceeds counterclockwise from there. so that is how to read the chart, from 0 degrees counter clockwise back to 360 degrees. Even though there are basically 2880 rows being charted, and 2880/360 = 8, the factor = 1/8th at .125, so a level of detail is achieved while keeping everything normalized for a single cycle in the typical case.

Do Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =VLOOKUP(V5,Goal_Looker_Eggbasket,2), i.e. it will look up the Spheroid number from column V here and then go on the Goal Looker worksheet's #2 B column of the Defined Range 'Goal_Looker_Eggbasket' there in cells A2:C65 matching that Spheroid number -- i.e. it will return a unique (random?) value per Spheroid for the number of Spheroids the user has input.""
Select cell X4 and type Eggbasket.
MODIFIED: Edit Go To cell range X5:X64 and with cell X5 active and high-lighted, enter the formula,""=VLOOKUP(V5,Goal_Looker_Eggbasket,3)"" and do Edit Fill Down. Do Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =VLOOKUP(V5,Goal_Looker_Eggbasket,3), i.e. it will lookup the Spheroid number from column V here and then go on the Goal Looker worksheet's #3 C column of the Defined Range 'Goal_Looker_Eggbasket' there in cells A2:C65 matching that Spheroid number -- i.e. it will return a unique (random?) value per Spheroid for the number of Spheroids the user has input. This (random?) value will be returned to Main X and Main Y.""
Edit Go To cell range U5:X105 and Insert Define Name  SpreadLooker to cell range $U$5:$X$64.
MODIFIED: Do Format Cells Fill sky blue. Select cell U6 and do Format Cells Fill color rosy red and font red because the formula is different from the others in the column.
Select cell range W5:X64 and Format Cells Number Decimal Places 2.

,

MODIFIED: Input the Column Headings. A1: RANGE; B1: Pasted VAL; C1: EggBasket; D1: RandBetween; E1: Spiral. Select columns A:E and do Format Column Autofit Selection, Format Cells Number 2 decimal places OK.
MODIFIED: Edit Go To cell range A2:C65 and Insert Name Define  Goal_Looker_Eggbasket  to cell range $A$2:$C$65.
Edit Go To cell range A2:A65 and with A2 the active high-lighted cell, input 1, then do Edit Fill Series Columns Linear Step Value 1 OK.
USUAL INSTRUCTIONS (come back and do when done exploring) -- SKIP TO NEXT SUB-STEP. Copy and paste column C's content's to an empty column, saving them for now. Edit Go To cell range C2:C65 and input .33 into cell C2 and do shift+tab and input -.33 into cell C65 and do Edit Fill Series Column accept the proposed Step Value (-.01) OK. select cell C101 and input 0. Then Edit Go To cell range C65:C101 and do Edit Fill Series Columns Linear Accept proposed Step Value OK. You can copy these values and do Paste Special Values into cell range B2:B65 to see the small spiral effect on the chart.
MODIFIED: Edit Go To cell range D2:D65 and with D2 active, enter ""=randbetween(60,78)/100"" and Edit Fill Down. Your values will come out differently than mine. Copy the cell range and do Paste Special Values to cell B2.
MODIFICATION FOR ANOTHER TIME -- SKIP FOR NOW: Copy column B;s contents to a safe empty column for now. Edit Go To E2:E65 and input 1.5 into cell E2 and do shift+tab and input 0 into cell E65 and do Edit Fill Series Column accept the proposed Step Value OK. You can copy these values and do Paste Special Values into cell range B2:B65 to see the large spiral effect on the chart. You may notice that since there are 24 divisions of 2880 due to 24 typically being the number of Spheroids, that if you look across from 24 in column B or E that the last value is .95, not the bottom value of 0. It's possible to do Insert New Comment about this at the top on the label Spiral or in the first active formula cell.
MODIFIED AGAIN: Edit Go To D2:D65 and with D2 the active high-lighted cell, enter the formula ""=RANDBETWEEN(0,35)/100"" and do Edit Fill Down. Copy these values and do Paste Special Values into cell range C2:C65 to see the random effect on the chart. Do Insert New Comment into cell D2 and edit in ""Original formula =RANDBETWEEN(40,100)/100 but =RANDBETWEEN(40,150)/100 also works just fine -- it just creates a larger spread of random numbers is all.Now is =RANDBETWEEN(0,35)/100"".

, To get a good chart, columns E:N of the Data worksheet should be error-free. See the Warnings section below for help in errors reduction.,

MODIFIED: Activate Data worksheet and Edit Go To cell range H6:I2886. Either do Chart Wizard or select Chart on the Ribbon (activated in Preferences) and select All, Scattered, Smoothed Line Scattered. If using Chart Wizard, a new Chart worksheet will be created. Otherwise, copy or cut and paste the chart into the upper left corner of the Chart worksheet you created at the beginning, and hover the mouse over the lower right corner until it becomes a double-headed arrow and then use it to pull the chart into an expansion of a large Square. Format Selection solid and Line Weight 1 and Green (to the yellow) from the color table, transparency 0%. This is the main large flower design of 12 large spheres..
MODIFIED: On the Chart worksheet, do menuitem Chart Add Data. In response to the Range request, activate the Data worksheet again and Edit Go To cell range E6:F2886. When I do it, it does not work right and it takes another column instead of column E. Click on the second standard ring series, or double-click until it appears in the formula bar and edit it until it reads as follows: =SERIES(,Data!$E$6:$E$2886,Data!$F$6:$F$2886,2). Edit the line of Series 2 to be solid and 1 point line weight and Red-Orange in hue. It has a very heavy 8 pt yellow 255 transparent glow. This is the bright glowing external planet design ring.
Any other series which Excel creates should be deleted by clicking on it and deleting it from the Formula Bar.
MODIFIED: On the Chart worksheet, do menuitem Chart Add Data. In response to the Range request, activate the Data worksheet again and Edit Go To under RoseX and Rose Y cell range J6:K2886. When I do it, it does not work right and it takes column E or something instead of column J and K. Click on this next/center series3, or double-click until it appears in the formula bar and edit it until it reads as follows: =SERIES(,Data!$J$6:$J$2886,Data!$K$6:$K$2886,3). Do Marker Style Round Dot Size 5 and Marker Fill Deep Purple (if I recall right - it came up as automatic instead of my last setting for its color).
MODIFIED: On the Chart worksheet, do menuitem Chart Add Data. In response to the Range request, activate the Data worksheet again and Edit Go To under EGGIES X and EGGIES Y cell range M6:N2886. When I do it, it does not work right and it takes column E or something instead of column J and K.This time, we want =SERIES(,Data!$M$6:$M$2886,Data!$N$6:$N$2886,1). Edit the line of Series 4 to be 1 point line weight and very bright purple in hue.. This is the internal flower of fragrance..
Double-click on the Plot Area and set the Gradient to be Radial, Centered, Teal Blue on far right and Purple on far left. I have No Line set for either the Plot Area or the Chart Area, no Chart Titles, No Axes which are all controlled by Chart Layout (which appears on the Ribbon when you click on the Chart Plot Area).
Copy the formulas  from A1:X64 to the Saves worksheet and then, below the formulas, paste them again, and then do Paste Special Values right over them. Then with the shift key held down, tale a picture of the chart under each of the two series definitions, Pasting Pictures with the shift key depressed into the Saves worksheet under the data.
Save the workbook.

MODIFIED: I4: Input ""=1.5"". Insert New Comment and edit in ""Original formula =ShrinkExpand is most usual value as Standard or Goal, e.g. 100% of Normal. But if 80% of Normal is the New Goal, say for a Personal Fitness Program, then a little math is required.  ShrinkExpand2 = 1/.80, or 1.25 would be the new input. This is because it was thought the natural trend would be to want to shrink by say a factor of 2, so 2 = 1/.50 and the New Goal is to be 50% of Normal, or shrink by a factor of 2 (as a divisor). You may change the formulas and comments so that ShrinkExpand and ShrinkExpand2 are multiplicative instead of divisive if preferred. Was 1.19122798149309; Now is 1.5"" Expand the comment frame if need be.

,, Expand the comment frame if need be. Do Format Cell Fill Light Rose color to distinguish it from the other cells in the column. The returned value in this cell should be 617748.4178 (=tip).
MODIFIED: Edit Go To cell range A7:A2886 and with A7 the active high-lighted cell, input ""=(A6+(-Tip*2)/(AjRows))"" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell A7 and copy the the formula in the formula bar and do Insert New Comment and edit comment ""Original formula ""=(A6+(-Tip*2)/(AjRows)) to bottom A2886 (as adjusts per cell on the way down)"". Expand the comment frame if need be. The value in cell A7 should be 617319.4259

617319.4259/6848 = 90.2086 (not 12pi). A different effect is being sought is why.
Edit Go To cell range B7:B2886 and with B7 the active high-lighted cell, input ""=B6"" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell B7 and copy the the formula in the formula bar and do Insert New Comment and edit comment ""Original formula =B6 to bottom B2886 (as adjusts per cell on the way down)"". Expand the comment frame if need be.
Edit Go To cell range C6:C2886 and with C6 the active high-lighted cell input ""=Spheroids/KEY*(COS((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))"" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell C6 and do Insert New Comment and edit it ""Original Formula =Spheroids/KEY*(COS((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))"". Expand the comment frame if need be. This formula and the next one form the ring the Spheroids occupy, By taking the cosine of the cell 6 rows above the cell it's in, C6, the formula is taking the cosine of 0, which = 1.
Edit Go To cell range D6:D2886 and with D6 the active high-lighted cell input ""=Spheroids/KEY*(SIN((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))"" and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell D6 and do Insert New Comment and edit it ""Original Formula =Spheroids/KEY*(SIN((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1)). By taking the sine of the cell 6 rows above the cell we're in, C6, the formula is taking the sine of 0, which = 0. Therefore, between the formula in C6 and the one in D6, the {x,y} coordinates of the first cell would be {1,0} if nothing else were affecting them. It proceeds counterclockwise from there. so that is how to read the chart, from 0 degrees counter clockwise back to 360 degrees. Even though there are basically 2880 rows being charted, and 2880/360 = 8, the factor = 1/8th at .125, so a level of detail is achieved while keeping everything normalized for a single cycle in the typical case.
MODIFIED: Edit Go To cell range E6:E2886 and with E6 the active high-lighted cell, input the formula, ""=((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*COS(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+C6)/ShrinkExpand"" w/o quote marks and do Edit Fill Down. Select cell E6 and do Insert New Comment ""Original Formula =((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*COS(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+C6)*VLOOKUP(ROW(),SpreadLooker,3)/ShrinkExpand is now =((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*COS(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+C6)/ShrinkExpand which originally multiplies each term of the standard formula for a spherical helix per 'CRC Standard Curves and Surfaces' by David von Seggern,  1993, by GM (Golden Mean) to keep things proportional, with the z dimension added into the x and y dimensions. This is then multiplied by the Lookup Table SpreadLooker, which either randomizes the data or accepts inputs per the Goal Lookup worksheet. Lastly, it is subject to ShrinkExpand, a variable for normalizing or growing or shrinking its chart relative to the Standard or Goal chart data series of Second X and Second Y."" Expand the comment frame as much as necessary.

Edit Go To cell range E6:F2886; using the Chart Wizard or the Ribbon, select Charts, All/Other, Scatter - Smoothed Line Scatter. If in Chart Wizard, a new Chart should appear if you so choose, after selecting various chart options such as no grid lines, no axes and no legend. If working from the Ribbon, a chart will appear atop the Data worksheet data and this should be Copied or Cut and Pasted to the NEW Chart worksheet's upper left hand corner. Hover over the lower right hand corner until the cursor becomes a double-headed arrow, then pull the chart into an expanded version, but still within the window frame. Using Chart Layout, get rid of the axes and grid lines and legend. Your squared-up chart should look like this:
Click in the Chart Area and then select Chart Layout and, at left, Chart Selection Data Series 1, Format Selection. Select Line Weights and Arrows and set to 1. Select Line Gradient, Style Radial, Centered, then do Add Color twice to get two more Color Indicators. The three left colors should all be the same flat metallic blue and the far right indicator should be white so far.Then you want to change it to: 1) Leftmost White 18%; 2) 2nd Leftmost Light Sky Blue 36%; 3) 3rd Leftmost Lightest Sky Blue 52%; and 4) Rightmost White 71%. For Glow, I set it at Yellow Size 2 pt, transparency 30% and 0 soft edges. For the Chart Area, I set it at Navy Blue from the Color Wheel for the border. For the Plot Area Fill, Style Radial Centered Blue Purple leftmost to Dark Purple at 62% from the Color Wheel Side Box, where darker and lighter hues instead of vibrant saturated ones are available. For Shadow, I doubt that it matters, but I set it at yellow size 0%, blur 5pt, Distance 6 pt and Transparency 24%, Inner. Resetting it to black produced no discernible difference, so it was returned to yellow.

This formula and the next one form the ring the Spheroids occupy, By taking the cosine of the cell 6 rows above the cell it's in, C6, the formula is taking the cosine of 0, which = 1.

Therefore, between the formula in C6 and the one in D6, the {x,y} coordinates of the first cell are {1,0}. It proceeds counterclockwise from there. so that is how to read the chart, from 0 degrees counterclockwise back to 360 degrees. Even though there are basically 2880 rows being charted, and 2880/360 = 8, the factor = 1/8th at .125, so a level of detail is achieved while keeping everything normalized for a single cycle in the typical case.

, Either do Chart Wizard or select Chart on the Ribbon (activated in Preferences) and select All, Scattered, Smoothed Line Scattered. If using Chart Wizard, a new Chart worksheet will be created. Otherwise, copy or cut and paste the chart into the upper left corner of the Chart worksheet you created at the beginning, and hover the mouse over the lower right corner until it becomes a double-headed arrow and then use it to pull the chart into an expansion of a large Square.
On the Chart worksheet, do menuitem Chart Add Data. In response to the Range request, activate the Data worksheet again and Edit Go To under Second X and Second Y cell range H6:I2886. When I do it, it does not work right and it takes column E instead of column H. Click on the second standard ring series, or double-click until it appears in the formula bar and edit it until it reads as follows: =SERIES(,Data!$H$6:$H$2886,Data!$I$6:$I$2886,2)
The first series, after clicking on it, should read as follows: =SERIES(,Data!$E$6:$E$2886,Data!$F$6:$F$2886,1). Any other series which Excel created should be deleted by clicking on it and deleting it from the Formula Bar.
Edit Series 1 ( the one with the last digit = to 1 in the series formula, and the one randomized or input by you or spirallic) by double-clicking on it for line weight = .25, glow = canary yellow size 8 point 25% transparent, if you want to start off resembling mine.
Edit the line of Series 2 to be dashed and 1 point line weight and Foresty Green to Lawn Green to Leafy Green in hue. It's a yellowish-green, not a blue-green.
Double-click on the Plot Area and set the Gradient to be Radial, Centered, Dark Purple on left and Prussian Blue on right. My pigments are all put away right now or it would be easier to say if it was Prussian, Cerulean, Ultramarine, Cobalt or some other blue. Sorry - get them mixed up.

Open again in Preview with all three side by side and there's the Cyclical Progress Chart, voilá!, The top graphic shows, from right to left, the same pattern. But the underlying standard or goal changes: 1) in the first image on the right, the diabetic is exceeding normal parameters apparently by a factor of 2 -- the blood glucose level would be about 200 on average where 100 is the norm; 2) in the center image, the diabetic hits some dangerous lows and risks going comatose, so insulin is probably increased and/or glyburide is taken at mealtime; 3) in the leftmost image, the diabetic has achieved normal blood glucose readings with fairly acceptable fluctuations, but needs close monitoring daily, at least twice a day at the very least. The diabetic needs to keep some energy bars and orange juice on hand in case of sudden drops in blood sugar with attendant shakes and possible headaches. If this level can be maintained, this diabetic might be a good candidate for an exercise and weight loss program, possibly starting with some non-stressful yoga. All in all, the chart shows the diabetic ate about the same food, but less of it apparently, as the same cycle was maintained over the research periods. If the chart is a 24 hour clock, 0 degrees to the right might be 12 AM, 90 degrees straight up would be 6 AM, et cetera, and one can see that a midnight snack and a more well-rounded breakfast would probably be good ideas.

Or, the same charts, read left to right, would mean a diabetic who was under control has lost control and is at serious risk currently due to overindulging on their favorite and usual menu.

Both these and the output on your iPod or MP3 player are 3.5 millimeters, so they'll work with standard auxiliary cables.


Some old models of amps have 6.35 millimeter inputs, which match 1/4 inch headphone adaptors. These won't accept standard 3.5 millimeter auxiliary cables.;
, You can find these on Amazon or in any electronics store, like Radio Shack or Best Buy, for about $5.00. This cable allows you to attach your MP3 player or iPod to the ""left"" and ""right"" audio inputs in the back of your amp.If you have an amp with a 6.35 millimeter input, purchase a 3.5 millimeter auxiliary cord and a 3.5 millimeter to 6.35 millimeter adaptor. You can also find these on Amazon--they start at around $4.00., The RCA to 3.5 millimeter cable you'll use for a modern amp should already be assembled., This way, you won't encounter any electrical issues while trying to play your iPod or MP3 through your amp.

, You are now ready to plug your media player into your amp!

, This cable should go in the same output as your headphones would.

, Though the input location will vary based on your model and style of amp, it will normally entail two 3.5 millimeter input holes--one red and one white, to match the RCA cables--under a name such as ""AUX-IN"" (for auxiliary). You can also plug into the ""CD"" or ""VCR"" inputs if there is no ""AUX"" option.If you're working with a 6.35 millimeter input, the large end of your cable should plug into the headphones jack in the front of the amp.
Make sure you're plugging your cable into an input slot, not an output slot.

, Make sure everything is on before turning on your iPod or MP3 player.

,, If you can't hear anything initially, turn the volume up on your iPod or MP3 player before cranking the volume on your amp.

, Do this gradually so you don't hurt your ears.

, For example, if your amp has a distortion feature or a bass-boost, turn these down or off to ensure the clearest audio signal possible.

Purchase your phone.",How to Buy a Cell Phone," From the nature of your device to the specs of your plan, there are an overwhelming amount of options when purchasing a cell phone. Conducting the right research beforehand can save time and give you a leg up in the purchasing process Answer the following questions to determine the type of research you should conduct.


What's your budget?
Do you have an existing cell phone plan, and if so, do you have a free upgrade?
Are you looking to switch carriers, or to sign your first service contract?
How is your credit?
Are you willing to sign a service contract at all?;
, Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, and T-Mobile are the largest service providers in America,but they are not the only options. Assuming you are willing and able to sign a contract, you should look into options of larger, and smaller, more local service carriers before researching your preferred device. This may seem backwards, but there are good reasons to prioritize researching your carrier:


Carriers don't offer coverage everywhere. For example, until 2013, Verizon did not offer service in Alaska,so if you lived in Anchorage, it was ill-advised to waste time researching Verizon-exclusive products.
Carriers offer a wide array of contracts at a wide array of prices. Some carriers may simply be out of your budget. No use researching their products.

, Once you think you've pinpointed the ideal carrier, double check with people who spend time in the same areas as you.


What carriers do they use?
Are they satisfied with their service?
Are there particular places that your neighbors or coworkers don't get service?

, Pre-paid cell phones are available at a much larger range of retailers. They come with a set number of minutes (sometimes with the option of purchasing additional minutes), and they are a one-time purchase, as opposed to a cell phone with a contract that you pay every month. As an investment, a pre-paid cell phone doesn't make much sense, but depending on your circumstances, it can be a logical option.

, You've done the carrier research; now it's time to start thinking about what's important to you in the actual device. Smart phones have gotten so sophisticated that it's impossible to list all their capabilities, but use the following features as a jumping off point for your consideration.(If none of these features are important to you, and your only priority is a phone that can make and receive calls, you probably don't need a smart phone at all. This is fortuitous, because more basic cell phones are inexpensive, and require much less research to pick out.)


Camera. Most cell phones have cameras, but there can be a huge range of camera quality from one device to the next.
Media player
Durability
Wi-Fi
Mac-compatibility

, Now that you know what features you're seeking in your new phone, you should take advantage of the multitude of online consumer report guides.Everyone knows about the iPhone, but that's not the only viable smart phone option. Cross reference prices and features of available devices with the features you want. This should narrow down your list, and put you in a better position when you go to the store to buy a phone.

, Online research is great, but talking to people you trust can give you a whole new perspective. Take into account what you know about the people you're asking. Are they tech savvy? Are you? Do they share your priorities? Factor in the answers to these questions as you ask your friends about their experiences with their phones and whether they would recommend the devices.

, These days, most of the larger carriers—Sprint, Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, etc.—support a large range of cell models. But there are plenty of exceptions. If you've fallen in love with a certain model of phone, double check that a carrier supports it before taking the time to discuss contract options.

, ""Cell Phone Store"" is a general term, which applies either to smaller stores owned by the service carrier—e.g. the Verizon Store—or larger retailers like Best Buy or Costco, which encompass smaller stations from a variety of service carriers. Before you engage with a sales representative, take a minute to look around the store at the products on display.


Does the store carry the same products you've been researching? If not, you've lost your advantage, and you may want to look elsewhere.
If you are familiar with the devices, compare their listed prices to the prices you've seen online.

, Eventually, you're going to have to talk to a salesperson. But remember, this person is trying to sell you something. Beyond commissions, the salesperson may have incentives to sell you a specific device,so take everything s/he says with a grain of salt.

, When you communicate with a sales rep, it's wise to keep some things to yourself. With that said, you should be forthcoming about whether or not you have an existing contract. If you tell the salesperson you do have a contract with a certain carrier, and you don't, you may lose out on new-customer discounts.If you tell the representative you don't have a contract, and you do, then you'll either wind up paying two bills, or you'll have to start from scratch when you eventually come clean.

, While it's logical to reveal whether or not you have an existing cell phone plan, you shouldn't be so forthcoming about your plans for the future. Telling a sales rep that you're committed to signing a new contract, or that you're committed not to, reduces your leverage as a consumer. Remaining noncommittal will put the sales rep in the position of offering you the best deals available.

, There are a few reasons to play your phone knowledge close to the chest.


You might learn something from the salesperson's recommendations. Sometimes we're conditioned to see salespeople as enemies, but the reality is that they're often experts in their field, and they can offer valuable insights
You might learn something about the salesperson. If you've consistently read bad reviews about a device, and the salesperson recommends it, that tells you what kind of person you're dealing with—either incompetent, or insincere.

, After your initial interaction with the salesperson, this is a good segue into discussing specific devices. By describing your desired features, you won't reveal too much about your expertise, but you'll steer the conversation in the direction of the devices you want.

, Hopefully, by this point you've done enough research on carriers and devices that you're ready to move forward. But don't tell the salesperson just yet.

, This is when you reveal that you're an expert consumer. You've decided what you want, and the salesperson has probably quoted you a price; try the following strategies to see if you can sweeten the deal.


Tell the salesperson you've seen the device elsewhere, for a better deal, which could simply mean a better price, or with additional accessories—car chargers, Blue Tooth headsets, etc. Back this up with advanced knowledge of the product.
Tell the salesperson you have a fixed budget (less than the quoted price). This seems simple, but sometimes this sort of pretense is all you need to get a better price.
Ask the salesperson to contact you if a better deal becomes available, and leave. This shows you mean business, and it's risk free. If the salesperson never contacts you, you can get the same deal at another store, and if s/he does, then more power to you.

, If you've followed these steps, you should feel confident about your purchase, and pull the trigger.

Phones sometimes offer different ways of texting. Make sure to read the manual and allow yourself a few hours to explore all the options. Once you’re comfortable with one, train your fingers to type or swipe quicker and think about the position of your hand.


Using a mobile phone can trigger several joint problems. Use yours wisely.;
, It is important to keep your contacts organised on your phone if you want to find your interlocutors as quickly as possible. Use their full first and last names and try to avoid nicknames.


If you have several contacts, use directories and lists. Separating your friends, your family and your colleagues is the best way to be fast and avoid mistakes.

, Depending on your phone, the SMS tool might be too basic or totally unreliable. It might be worth installing a new application to make texting far more efficient and user-friendly. There are many applications available online. Try to look for one with a predictive text system to gain time.
Applications don’t always support all languages. If you don’t use English, check carefully that your language is included.
Some applications use speech recognition to text. This can be useful if you have to text and drive.

Do not pay attention to unknown callers.,

Do not confirm or deny your identity until you know who is calling.,
Decide how to proceed depending on your comfort level after getting the information.,
Check the legitimacy of any agency, organization or company calling you cold by doing a quick online search while on the phone.,
Do not disclose personal information or passwords.,
Ask what the caller wants early in the call.,
Never give a confirmation.,
Record the call.,
Do not go to websites following the prompts of cold call.,
Be strong and put safety first.",How to Avoid Phone Scams," It is recommended to avoid unknown calls and entertain any unknown service provider that tries to sell services to you. Moreover, if you are really inclined towards their services, ensure you perform online research to know reputation of the company.;
, Many scammers ask clients to wire money; it is impossible to reverse cash when using wired money given. If a seller keeps on insisting you to wire transfer for making payments, do not act unless you are sure about the authenticity of the deal.

, No matter, whether you are receiving messages in the forms of text, email, advertisement, or phone call; you need not to share your financial or personal information with the unknown message senders. This is called ‘phishing’. Eventually, these crooks try to trick you for stealing sensitive information.

, Though it is illegal to play foreign lotteries, people take interest in getting into these deals. This increases the chances of losing money through fraud sweepstakes. There are fake messages that tempt you by saying you have already won money in so-n-so lottery. They ask you to pay “custom duties”, “taxes” or “fees” for collecting your prize. Ensure you do not get involved in such messages and never make payments for receiving the prize – as they could trap you, irrespective of any promises or guarantee.

, For example: Sometimes you will get a caller who won't tell you who they are until you identify yourself first. Be clear: the person who called -- and not the person who answers the phone -- must identify themselves first.


A typical conversation would be: \*ring\* \*ring\* You: Hello? Them: Hello. May I speak with Mr. X? You: Who is calling? With this introduction, you neither confirm nor deny your identity. You require them to identify themselves first.

, After the caller has identified themselves, you have the option to (A) acknowledge yourself, (B) gather more information about the caller without identifying yourself, or (C) just hang up.

, Ask for the caller's name and company (including phone number and contact address) and reason for calling you. If this is not provided to you within 10 seconds, hang up. Any lack of identification is a scam. Just type the address or phone number into Google. The first result had better be them. If it's a real company, then they will happily give you their contact information. If you can't search while talking at the same time, ask the caller to wait a moment while you locate your notebook or glasses, but use the time to check out the company on the internet. If it doesn't exist, immediately be suspicious. You could also look for feedback about the company or type of call. Government sites aimed at revealing scams may be helpful here too.


You can even be polite. For example, ask them for their phone number, extension, and what this is regarding. Then let them know that you will call them back. If they do give you a phone number never call them back at that number. Use that number to look up the company. And use the company's contact number to call them back. Otherwise, you will get a scam artist saying a valid company's name and giving you a non-company phone number. You'll see that the company is real, and then you will call the scam artist back. A few callers will give you their contact information, but really want you to stay on the line. ""There's no need to call us back. I can help you right now!"" This is a clear indication of a scam. Real companies want you to call them back. Sales calls are more likely to make a sale if you call them. And banks get a thrill when customers practice real security by calling back on the bank's official support number. If the caller pressures you to stay on the line, then it is a scam.
If you get a ""political survey"" from a ""non-profit"" that refuses to identify itself, do the following. Terms like ""non-profit"" and ""political organization"" are specific conditions that can be used to get around no-call lists. However, the organization must be a registered non-profit or political organization. The IRS offers a very convenient search tool. Just select the type of form (8871, 8872, or 990; if you don't know, just select all three) and enter the organization's name. Leave everything else blank. If the search does not identify the organization, then they are not exempt -- regardless of how much they lie by saying that they are exempt. The searches may return multiple organizations with similar (or same) names. This is where the address and phone number comes in. Click on the search results and see if the name and address matches the registered organization. If none of the records match, then they are not exempt and are probably a scam or fraudulent caller. Remember: anyone can call you up and say that they are conducting a political survey on behalf of a non-profit. Just because they say it does not mean it is true. Just because they say that they are a registered non-profit does not mean that they are. Always verify.

, Do not confirm computer usage, ownership of anything in your house or account numbers. Once again, it is nobody's business and the fact callers are asking for this sort of information should immediately alert you to the possibility of a scammer.


Tell the person you are recording them if they are persistent or belligerent. Say something like: ""In accordance with state law, I am obliged to inform you that I am recording this call. If you do not wish to proceed, let me know now."" Sound official. If the person is not legitimate, they'll hang up and you're done with them.
If you have identified yourself and greeted the caller but the caller fails to acknowledge this and speak instantly in a conversation, but asks to speak with you, suspect that they are transferring you between sales teams or the like and are not someone who knows you.

, Your time is precious but so is the fact that the more hot air the caller exudes, the more likely it is that they're trying to lull you into buying their stardust. Replies should be very specific, such as: ""This is a call regarding your credit card."" Which credit card? Don't tell them what cards you have. Just ask which card they are calling about. And don't accept a generic answer like ""your Visa card"". You might have multiple Visa cards. And even if you only have one Visa, they don't know that. If they are legitimate, then they should be able to tell you the name of the issuing bank and the last few digits on the card. ""This is Bank of America calling for Neal X regarding his Visa card that ends with 1234."" Anything less specific is a scam; just hang up.

, This is an important lesson to learn and a hard habit to break. Never give any kind of positive confirmation on the phone until you are absolutely certain who you are talking to. For example: You: Hello? Them: Is this Neal Krootz? You: Yes this is. How can I help you? The instant that you say ""Yes"", they have a positive confirmation. They can record the call, edit the recording, and use your innocent 'Yes' to authorize them for whatever they want. This his how your telephone line can be slammed (illegally switched to a different provider). Thus, never give a positive confirmation. Instead, you could say: ""Is this Neal?"" ""This is he."" ""That is me."" ""Speaking."" ""Correct, this is Neal."" Never say ""Yes"". The same goes with ""Uh huh"", ""Yup"", and any other vocalization that could be used in place of an authorized confirmation.

, You will be amazed at the number of cold calls that hang up on you when you ask these basic questions. ""Who is calling?"" \*click\* ""What is your address?"" \*click\*. Any caller who won't give their name or address is a scam. And if they hang up, then it's definitely a scam. Right now, about 50 percent of callers should have hung up after you asked for their address. The next step is to tell them that you are recording the call. Regardless of whether the call is really being recorded, tell them it is being recorded. Real companies with real offers won't mind being recorded. Real surveys do not require privacy. If they hang up, then it is a scam.


A real company won't hang up on a prospective or existing customer. Remember that.

, If you do, chances are that you're downloading a virus, allowing access to your computer or giving away precious personal information that they'll do unspeakable and ruinous things with. Just do not do it!


Ask things such as: ""How do you know my computer is running slowly/hacked into/busted/not working as it should?"" They don't have cameras in your house! And if they're somehow watching your online activities, that'd be a matter for the police. You can tell them as much.

, You get all sorts of phone calls. Friends, family, business associates, scams, and fraudulent callers. Just asking basic questions and verifying caller information can easily stop you from making a big mistake. Some of these rules may come off sounding rude. But remember: it's rude for a scammer, telemarketer, and fake non-profit to call you. Real companies won't be offended.

Make it short.,
Avoid errors in grammar, punctuation and style.,
Be precise and as clear as you can.,
Use emoticons with care.",How to Be a Good Texter2," A good text should always be concise. If you cannot convey your message in less than 200 characters, you should probably write an email or call your contact instead.

, A text is sometimes the first point of contact with a potential employer or someone you like. The best way to make a good first impression is to make sure that your text is mistake-free.Most modern phones and tablets have automatic spelling checkers and dictionaries. They are not always perfect but can still detect most mistakes.
if you are unsure about the quality of your text, keep it short and simple.
If your phone can access the internet, quickly check a grammatical rule online.
Avoid abbreviations as much as you can. They might be useful to save words but will inevitably diminish the overall impact of your text.

, Before you start writing, think of what your interlocutor will need to know. Think of what you want to say and make it easy for the reader to answer you. If you’re asked a question, offer a clear answer and make sure to use only one text.


Try to anticipate a question. If you are asked where to meet, give a precise location and the time of the rendezvous.
Make sure that your interlocutor knows who you are. Not everybody has your phone number saved. If you text someone you barely know, identify yourself at the beginning of the message.

, Smileys and other emoticons are great to encapsulate your mood quickly or make a conversation more dynamic but they should be used properly. Although there are exceptions, moderation is generally advised when using emoticons. Your interlocutor will probably prefer reading your writing than looking at a generic yellow man.


If you have any doubt, use emoticons only with family, friends and partner. You might want to avoid emoticons with your boss, colleagues or people you know less.

Each day, nine people die in the United States as a result of distracted drivers.Even more people are injured when texting while walking. Use a speech recognition text application if you drive a lot. It will keep you safe.

, Paying more attention to your smartphone than to the people in the same round is both sad and incredibly rude. Warn your friends or family if you have to text and do so when you aren't in the middle of a conversation.

, There are times in life when calling is better than texting. If you just had a baby or if a member of your family passed away, make sure to call your relatives. Talking is far more personal and effective in extraordinary times.

, Texting is usually fun and rewarding but it can also lead to severe cases of abuse. Remember that your interlocutor deserves to be treated with respect. In several countries, the law has changed to punish text stalkers and cases of harassment by mobile phone. If a text conversation becomes heated, put the phone down and go for a walk. It's sometimes better to let things cool down.

Use a third-party backup app.",How to Back Up Your Mobile Phone3," The process for backing up your Android will vary significantly depending on what device you're using, but you can back up essential information to your Google account on most devices.

, The exact wording may vary a little depending on what device you're using.

, This will backup your device settings and preferences to your Google account. This backup does not count against your Google Drive storage space.The Google account backup saves your contacts, calendars, app data, Wi-Fi passwords, and some basic phone settings. It will not backup photos and SMS messages.
If you don't have a Google account associated with the backup process, you can add an existing one or create a new free one.

, Besides the Google backup services, your device may also have a backup service provided by the manufacturer, such as Samsung or LG. This service can be found in the same ""Backup & reset"" menu, usually at the top.The process and data backed up will vary depending on the manufacturer and device. Follow the prompts to create a backup either on your device or stored in the cloud.

, The Google Photos app allows you to store all of your photos on your Google account for free at high quality. You can also store your photos in their original quality by using your Google Drive storage. All Google accounts come with 15 GB of free storage.


Download the Google Photos app from the Play Store if you don't have it already. Open it, tap the Menu button, and select ""Settings.""
Tap ""Back up & sync"" and toggle Backup on at the top of the screen. Sign in with your Google account if you aren't already.
Tap ""Upload size"" to select what quality you want to use when uploading images. High quality pictures will have slightly reduced quality but there is no limit to how many you can upload. Original pictures are unaltered but count against your Google Drive storage.
Tap ""Back up all"" to begin backing up your photos. All of the pictures from your Camera folder will be backed up to your Google account. You may want to connect to Wi-Fi before you begin the backup.

, A common way to back up all of your Android data is to connect it to a computer and copy all of the contents of your phone.


Connect your Android via USB cable to your Windows or Mac computer. If you're using a Mac, you may need to install Android Fire Transfer (android.com/filetransfer/).
Open your Android device in your explorer. You can press ⊞ Win+E to open this in Windows.
Copy all of the contents to a new folder on your computer. Select all of the folders on your Android device and drag them to a new folder on your computer. This will begin copying all of the data to your computer, including pictures, videos, app data, and more. Don't disconnect your Android during the copy process.

, There are a variety of third party apps available that can backup your Android device. These are more useful if your Android is rooted and you want to backup your custom ROM, but they can be useful for non-rooted devices as well. A backup app may not be necessary for many users, as the Google backup, manufacturer backup, and Google Photos will saves virtually all of your data.Some popular backup apps include Helium, Ultimate Backup, Titanium Backup, and Easy Backup & Restore.

Obtain a blank ICE card.,
Include important health information on your ICE card.,
Complete the card, and put a copy in your wallet or purse.,
Create ICE cards for all of your family members and encourage them to use them.",How to Add ICE to Your Cell Phone," You should choose emergency contacts who know about any allergies or medical conditions that you may have, and who know how to contact your family. You should also notify anyone that you designate as an emergency contact that you have done so, and make sure they are clear on what information they might need to share to help you in an emergency. , Open the address book or contacts section on your cell phone and create a new entry with the name ICE. Then add the contact information for your chosen emergency contact. It is also a good idea to enter additional information about the contact, including his or her name and relationship to you under ""Notes"" or in another unused field.Some people add a dash or a space after the word ""ICE"" followed by the person's first name, so that emergency personnel know who they are calling. For instance, you might call the entry ""ICE – Sarah"" or ""ICE – Mr. Smith.""

, Having more than one emergency contact is a good idea, in case the first person called is not immediately available. You can prioritize these contacts by naming the entries ""ICE 1,"" ICE 2,"" and so forth.

, If your phone is password protected and you are incapacitated, an ICE contact won't do any good. Fortunately there are now apps available for Android, Windows, and iPhones that can add emergency contact information to your lock screen. Search for ""ICE"" or ""ICE lock screen"" in your appropriate app store to find one that works on your phone.
Install the app and input the relevant information. An emergency responder can then pick up your phone and access your emergency contact information, even if you are unable to supply the password.

, ICE stickers with blanks for contact names and numbers are a great way to clearly label your phone, bike helmet, or laptop with important emergency contact information. These stickers can be found at many pharmacies and doctor's offices, or purchased online.Be sure to complete the contact information clearly, preferably using waterproof ink.
Don't forget to replace and update the sticker as needed to keep the information current.

, You can create an ICE label using computer label paper or decal paper available at any office supply store, or even using waterproof tape and a permanent marker. Creating your own label will allow you to add as much information as you would like about allergies and medications.


Remember to replace your label if the text becomes worn off or illegible.

, These are often available for free at doctor's offices, hospitals and pharmacies, but you can also download a free emergency contact or ICE card blank. These are available on many different websites, including the American Red Cross. There are even ICE cards that can be completed using online forms so you don't have to worry about less-than-perfect handwriting., If you have allergies, prescriptions, or medical conditions, include that information on the card along with your blood type and emergency contact information.Carrying an ICE card is important, even if you wear medic alert jewelry, in case your medic alert is missing or damaged at the time of an emergency.

, You should also consider keeping a copy in the glove compartment of your car, or in your gym bag.


Runners and others who exercise outdoors can get identity tags to affix to their running shoes. These can be found at most sporting goods stores, or online by searching for ""shoe ID"" or ""shoe tag.""
Shoe tags are also a great option for children who might not carry a bag or phone.
Remember to replace or update your ICE card if any changes occur.

, You can place an ICE card inside your child's backpack or school bag. Be sure to add one to Grandma's purse or Grandpa's wallet, as well.


Many parents also add emergency contact stickers to children's car seats. You can create your own custom labels, or order them online through agencies such as the W.H.A.L.E program."

, Sometimes even when a defect is fixed the software functionality will not perform as intended. It happens when the developer has fixed only the secondary issues and not the root cause of the defect. So, first find the causative factors and fix it.

, In certain cases when a developer fixes a bug it might create new bugs that may go unnoticed. So when doing regression test the tester should be vigilant and alert.

The installer does not contain any adware.;
, You will be greeted with the main menu window.

, This will launch the tool that will allow you to select any video file to convert and burn to a blank DVD-R.

,


Change the filetype settings to ""All Files"" if your video file can't be found. This may be necessary to add .mkv files.

, If you're adding episodes from a TV show, you can likely fit several onto the DVD. The free space remaining will be displayed at the bottom of the WinX DVD Author window.


Once clips have been added, you can change the order by right-clicking on a clip and selecting ""Move Up"" or ""Move Down"".

, If you want to add subtitles to the video, click the ""Subtitle"" button next to the clip in the list. You will then be able to choose the subtitle file that you want to use.

, This will allow you to adjust a few settings before proceeding.


Change the ""DVD Language"" menu to English, or your preferred language. Note that this will not affect the audio or any subtitles.
Select your DVD type. Most blank DVD-Rs are DVD5, which is a single-layer 4.37 GB disc. DVD9 discs are dual-layer 7.95 GB discs

, If you are adding video files that aren't supported natively, such as .mkv, they will be converted before you move on. This will likely take a little while to complete.

, After the conversion process is complete, the menu creation tool will appear. You can choose from a variety of presets, or you can add your own background images and create your own button layouts. You can create a title menu, which is the main DVD menu, as well as chapter menus. This is especially useful for a DVD with multiple episodes.


Make sure when creating button layouts to not place any buttons along the edge of the menu. Sometimes the edges will get cut off by some DVD players or TVs, resulting in hidden buttons.
Once you're done setting up your menu, click the "">>"""" button to set your burning options.

, Make sure your blank DVD-R was inserted before opening this window, or the correct options won't be available.


Set the ""Write Speed"" low, between 2X and 4X. While a higher write speed means a faster burning process, it can lead to problems with reading the disc, especially in older players. A lower write speed will help ensure that your DVD works everywhere.
You can change your encoder settings for higher quality-which will result in a longer conversion time, or lower quality which will result in a quicker conversion time.
DVD-R discs are the best format for burning video discs. DVD-RW discs allow re-burning, but they don't work in all DVD players.

, Any files that aren't .vob will now be converted before burning based on the quality settings you chose.


This process may take a while, especially if you are burning full-length movies.

Burn the ISO file.",How to Burn a Movie3," This is a powerful free DVD authoring program for Linux. You can install it from the Terminal by typing sudo apt-get install devede.

, After installing DeVeDe, you can launch it from your Linux menu. It will be in the ""Sound & Video"" section, or you can search for it.

, This will start a new video DVD project.

, This will let you browse your computer for video files to add to your project.

, If you are in the US, select NTSC. If you are in Europe, select PAL.

, If you know what you're doing, you can use the Advanced options to adjust the audio and video quality settings for the file conversion process. Most users can leave these at their defaults.


One major setting you may want to use in the ""Advanced options"" section is the ""Split file into chapters"" option in the ""General"" tab. This will add chapter markers to your video file at the interval you set, allowing you to quickly skip between parts of the movie. This is especially useful for full-length movies.

, Once you've added the video file, you'll need to adjust the Title settings for it. Select ""Title 1"" from the ""Titles"" list and click ""Properties"". This will allow you to change the name of the Title and modify the behavior for the Title button if you want.

, The amount of space available on the DVD will be displayed in the bar in the ""Disc usage"" section.

, DeVeDe will create a very basic menu for your DVD by default, which you can preview by clicking ""Preview menu"". Clicking the ""Menu options"" button will allow you to create a custom menu using your own images and music.

, Like your video format, you'll need to choose NTSC or PAL for your disc format.

, Once you're happy with your video files and menu, you can click the ""Forward"" button to begin the ISO creation process.


You will be prompted to select where you want the ISO file to be saved. DeVeDe doesn't actually burn the project to disc, but creates an image that you can burn with another utility.
Once you've selected the location you want to save the ISO to, DeVeDe will begin converting the video and creating the ISO file.

, This is the best format for burning DVD videos. DVD-RW discs allow you to reburn, but they don't work in all DVD players.

, Virtually all Linux distributions come with a burning application installed, but the actual app will vary depending on the distribution you are using.

, Use your burning app to burn the ISO file to your blank DVD. Once the burning process is complete, your video DVD is ready to use in any DVD player.

, A default home internet upload speed is only around 1mb per minute. This may be too slow for graphics, videos, etc.

, Before you can build a LAMP server, you must have the Linux operating system. Visit distrowatch.com and select one you like. They are mostly the same, but be sure to pick one with an interface (KDE, Cinnamon, etc.) pre-installed if you are not a usual terminal user. Further, if the Linux version does not include a Windows installer, you will need to create a Live CD or USB flash drive (instructions in other wiki how articles). The following instructions work with Ubuntu Linux.

, Apache is a free and open-source web server that is well-known for running on Unix operating systems. There are two ways of installing Apache. You can use your console or a terminal window session.


At the command prompt, type: sudo apt-get install apache2
In order to keep installing Apache, you will have to have your sudo password.

, You’ll have to point your browser to the server’s IP address. This will let you know if Apache is running or not.

, PHP is a scripting language that was originally used for creating dynamic web pages. However, developers use it to create individual graphical applications while network and system administrators use PHP for command line interface abilities.


At the command prompt, type: sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5

,


Restart Apache by typing at the command prompt:sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

,


Use the Apache document root to create a test file. The root will be /var/www. Your test file name’s extension must end with a .php.
For the content, type: < ?php phpinfo(); ?>

,


Then point your browser to the following address: http://IP_ADDRESS/test.php
Make sure you type your server’s IP address before /test.php.

, The browser should display, “Test PHP Page” on the screen.

, MySQL stands for “My Structured Query Language.” MySQL is a relational database program. This application operates as a server, in which multiple users can access many databases. There are many software applications that use MySQL, such as WordPress. Even Google and Facebook use MySQL.


At the command prompt, type: sudo apt-get install mysql-server

,


In the command line, type: mysql -u root
You should then see a command prompt that will look like mysql>
At the command prompt, type: SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('YOURPASSWORD');

Release Control of the Machine.",How to Install Software Remotely," In order to act as an administrator on a second machine, it’s important that both computers have a remote control program allowing this to take place.  There are many different programs available on the market that allow remote control, including both paid and free options. A simple search engine query should pull up plenty of different options available. Once you have found a suitable program, you will want to install that program on both the first and second machine.;
, Depending on the remote control program being used, you will need to determine how to take control of the other machine. In most remote control programs, you will use one login for both machines, and specify which computer is intended to serve as the host and which is the administrative machine.

,, Once the administrator has taken control of the machine, installing the necessary software is an easy process. Much like using any other computer, the administrator can use his keyboard and mouse to navigate to the web browser and download and install the necessary software. It is important to remember that if there are passwords in place on the host machine, the administrator will need to possess those passwords in order to install a new application.

,  Once the application has been installed and all of the necessary information has been transmitted between the two computers, the host machine no longer needs to remain under remote control. Most software programs have a simple disconnect option that allows the connection to be broken. This will return the first computer to the control of its owner, or in the case of a secondary computer, will simply break the remote connection.

Type/Copy/Paste: notepad main.cpp
make sure you save the Qt source code file as main.cpp
or

Type/Copy/Paste: start wordpad
using Wordpad as a text editor you will manually have to save the Qt source code file as main.cpp

,
Create the application in the notepad or wordpad text editor, enter the following below

Click OK when finished

, The numbers 5.0.2 denote the version number of the Qt SDK which changes with each new upgrade of the Qt SDK, substitute the new version numbers for your Qt SDK version number.

, This is critical if you have another version of the MinGW C/C++ compiler installed on your Windows system you must remove the other MinGW from the Windows system PATH, because this will cause conflicts with the Qt version of MinGW and your Qt applications will not compile and build correctly from the command line properly. Essentially, if you use another version of the MinGW C/C++ compiler your Qt applications you create from the command line will crash and exit with multiple system error messages. You must use the version of MinGW C/C++ compiler included with the Qt SDK.

, To check if you have the ability to compile from the Windows command line, open up a command line prompt and issue the following command below.

,,, Open up a command line prompt and enter the following commands below.

This tutorial will illustrate the basic process with a simple drawing, but the same steps can easily applied to even the most complex compositions.,
Open CorelPainter and create a new document.,
Create a rough sketch with the 2B pencil tool using a color other than black.,
Create a new layer and name this ""outline."",

Duplicate the outline layer and rename this layer ""flat colors"" Use the fill tool to color your outline.,
Create a new layer and name it ""shadows."",
These shadows are rather harsh and, frankly, ugly.,
When you have the shadows finished, create a new layer and call this ""highlights."",
Now add some texture to the picture.,
Give the image a simple, single color background with a cast shadow under the figure.",How to Color Drawings Using Corel Painter,";
, Create a new layer and name it ""sketch."" This is where your underdrawing will go.

, Try using light blue. This will be the base for your drawing and will not show up in the final product.

, This is where your uncolored line-art will go.

, The detail airbrush tool, when used at a small size, will create a much smoother outline than the pencil. Make sure that all the shapes are closed, which will make it easier to color. Clean up your outline with the eraser tool where needed.

, This is where having closed shapes is important, so that color only goes where you want it.

, Using the color picker tool, grab the color of any object. Use the color wheel to darken the color, lower the opacity and apply it using the airbrush tool. Pay attention to where the light is falling and the material that you are shading. Use the shadow color to create folds in fabric as well.

, Soften them up using the Blur Blender tool.

, Change the color to white and use the airbrush to apply highlights to the image in the same way you did shadows. Use the Blur Blender brush to soften the highlights.

, This example uses a light orange and brown airbrush at a low opacity to create a mottled effect on the skin. The Blur brush is also used to soften this effect.

, To do this, create a new layer and name it ""background"". Move this layer below the outline layer and fill it with a color (e.g. gray). For the shadow, use the airbrush tool, starting with a slightly darker color than the background and layering darker colors until you get to the center of the cast shadow.

Use BMP to print graphics such as logos or icons.,
Use TIF for scanned images and photographs.,
Use GIF for line drawings and pictures, drawings with large areas of solid color and animations.,
Use JPG for photographic images and images with subtle color gradations.,
Use PNG for any type of Web graphic except animations.,
However, .png sequences can be exported from many applications such as Maya or 3D Studio Max and are excellent for use in film and animations when used in software such as Adobe Premiere or After Effects.

,
Use .eps (photoshop or illustrator) for logos or graphics you wish to import into programmes such as InDesign.",How to Choose the Correct Graphics File Format," With BMP, file quality can be maintained when file is resized, and it loads quickly since it is not compressed. But, it cannot be used on the Web and it has a large file size.;
, TIF images can be very high resolution and can be used by most scanning and graphics programs. However, it also has large file size, but it supports various lossless compression schemes (image isn’t degraded when file is compressed), so they can be smaller than a corresponding BMP image without a loss of quality.

, GIF format has small file size, can be used on any browser, can be animated, transparent, or regular, has lossless compression (image doesn’t degrade when file size is reduced). Unfortunately, it can contain only 256 colors or fewer and is 8-bit only. Never send a gif to a printer or a design agency for artwork that is designed to be printed. The end result will look terrible and the designer will not thank you for it.

, JPG's contain millions of colors (24-bit palette). On the other hand, they use a lossy compression scheme -- when files are reduced in size, image is degraded because of a LOSS of information -- and may take longer to load because of decompression time.

, This image type can be 8-bit, 24-bit or 32-bit, has lossless compression, is endorsed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), can store alpha channel (variable) transparency, supports gamma correction (cross-platform control of image brightness), and supports two-dimensional interlacing (a method of progressive display). The drawback is that it is not supported by older browsers.

I2891: Enter ""=0-H2891"" w/o quotes.,
In Excel, if I let the x value of {x, y} Cartesian coordinate pairs of a graph equal the cosine of rows 0 to 360, and then I let the y values equal the sines of rows 0 to 360 -- I have just taken all those row numbers and treated them as angles, right?,In the Garthwaite Curve -- that ring of spiral balls you see me use all the time in many various ways -- I found out how to get 3-dimensionality out of Excel, by combining the z-dimension formula in with x and y (or in some other curves, just with y).,
The formula for the ""ball"", formally called a ""spherical helix"", is short but a little difficult to explain, so I won't.,
Imagine a triangle made by extending the hypotenuse at 30 degrees, then 45 degrees, then 60 degrees.,And, for other curves, we are usually distorting the sine and/or cosine by adding/multiplying/subtracting or dividing it by something else.,
Just when you think you understand, and you say to yourself, ""Aha!,
Why?,
So if the sine and cosine vary between 0 and 1 ordinarily (without further adjustment), and they are ADDED together as one is small and the other is large, they will tend to equal 1.,
If you can grasp that much, you are ahead of the game in terms of grasping trig and its ability to produce beautiful and unique designs that possess a unique clarity of definition, because when the ""half-curve"" is applied to a variable of 10pi to 0, the result is 5pi turns of the spiral of the helix of the sphere from one endpoint of 0 to the other endpoint of 0, which is a nice aesthetic number of turns to behold as a minimum.

, So the result is a circle.,, Suffice it to say that it multiplies the sine by the cosine and again by a cosine, or the sine by the sine and then by the cosine, of various values -- be they constants or variables. Now the sine of an angle, given r=the hypotenuse, is y/r, and the cosine of an angle is x/r. If we let r=1, then sine = just the distance up the y axis and the cosine = just the distance along the horizontal x axis., At first, x is longer than y is tall. Then, at 45 degrees, both are equal. Then at 60 degrees, the roles are the exact reverse of what they were at 30 degrees and y is now taller than x is short by exactly the amount that x was longer than y at 30 degrees. So, therefore, in a circle, if the sine is long, the cosine is short and vice versa, or they're even. It's also possible that they measure 1 or 0, but those are the maximum and minimum values for a unit circle of radius r = the hypotenuse = 1.,, Then the sine times the cosine produces a rectangle, the diagonal of which is the radius! I get it! I'm a genius!"" ... it's not quite that simple, and yet it is also exactly that simple at the same time. It's just that the sine times the cosine do not define the endpoint of that diagonal when multiplied together, any more than 4*6 = 24 says anything about the point {4, 6} at the corner of the rectangle. Seems unfair, I know! I can sympathize, believe me. But you are a genius perhaps if you can agree that their multiplication as their values change produces the sequence (0, .25, .50, .25, 0, -.25, -.50, -.25, 0, .25, .50, .25, 0, -.25, -.50. -.25, 0)!!!, Because at 45 degrees, the sine and cosine = 1/2 the square root of .5, or .7071, and so there are 4 occurrences of .50 (2 positive and 2 negative), because there are 4 places on the circle where the sine and cosine are equidistant from the x and y axes. The .25's occur at each 15 degrees and there are 8 of those, two on either side of a .50. Then, there are 5 zeros: at 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180, 270 and 360 degrees. Of course there are a lot of other values in between the 0 and the .25 and the .50, etc, etc., but that is the main way to understand it. This is then a ""half-curve"", relatively speaking., But if they are MULTIPLIED, they will equal at most .50 and at least, -.50,,

Select cell range E7:F1446.,Save the Defined Variables section and the upper formulas and their values for each chart you save as you experiment, Copy the data cell range all the way over to the right and down to about row 16 or 20 and paste it to the Saves worksheet; then, a few rows under that, paste it again and, directly atop that, do Paste Special Values (which saves both Formats and Values).,
Allow for a few rows, make a note if you wish, and holding down the shift key, do a COPY PICTURE of the Chart and release the shift key (or you'll select both worksheets) and activate the Saves worksheet, use the shift key again and do Paste Picture (of the chart).,
Insert ""New Comment"" for each variable and column formula's Original Value or Formula by copying what's in the formula bar and pasting it into the comment as ""Original formula: ..."" That will prove easier than coming back here to find the original formula, as this article may have been deleted by the powers that be.,

, Select Row 6 and Format Cell Font Underline., Do Format Cell Fill Purple because the formula in the cell below it is different, and that's unusual. Do Format Cell Number Custom ""Keeper! "" 0.0 The quotes for ""Keeper! "" are required.
Edit Go To cell range A8:A1447 and with A8 the active high-lighted cell, input the formula,                 ""=((A7+(-TOP*2)/(AdjRows)))*Adjuster"" and do Edit Fill Down. That's 1440 cells; 1440/360=4.
Edit Go To cell B7 and input the formula w/o quotes, ""=ROUND(-EXP((PI()^2)+(B5*-(db_))),0)+c_adj"". Do Format Cell Fill Rosy-colored because the next cells formulas are different.
Edit Go To cell range B8:B1447 and with B8 the active high-lighted cell, input the formula, ""=B7"" and do Edit Fill Down. That's why the c heads the column; it stands for constant.
Edit Go To cell range C7:C1447 and with C7 the active high-lighted cell, enter the formula, ""=PI()/25*COS((ROW()-7)*Factor*PI()/180)+SIN((ROW()-7)*Factor*PI()/180)"" and do Edit Fill Down. By taking the cosine of the row 7 rows less than row 7 when the formula is in row 7, it is taking the cosine of 0. It will then take the cosine of 1,2,3, ... up to 1440. So 4 cycles of 360. But the Factor = .25 so that's 1 cycle. Multiplying by PI()/180 converts from radians to degrees for the trigonometric functions.
Edit Go To cell range D7:D1447 and with D7 the active high-lighted cell, enter the formula, ""=PI()/25*SIN((ROW()-7)*Factor*PI()/180)+COS((ROW()-7)*Factor*PI()/180)"" and do Edit Fill Down. At the very bottom of your worksheet, in cell A1450 is the note to yourself, ""r=π; 2πr = 2(π^2) = Avg Ring Circumference; 2r=D=2π. Spinning Diam. D 180º is 2π*π is C = 2π^2 (for External Ring, not GMLL or GMSL Rings on sep Chart "". That may not be correct, though.

Edit Go To cell range Q2:R65 and Insert Name Define name SPHEROIDS_COUNT_LOOKER. Nice. You are done with the DATA sheet pretty much as far as data entry goes!

, Using either the Chart Wizard or the Chart Button on the Ribbon (activated in Preferences), select All, Scatter, Smoothed Line Scatter. Depending on your version of Excel, a new chart window will be created or you will need to either cut or copy and paste the just-created Chart onto the CHART worksheet. Stretch it until it's big and square and it should look pretty much like mine.
ERRORS: If you have errors or error values, you've made a mistake somewhere along the line. Select the cell that has the error value that is furthest left and topmost first. Look for a typo in a formula or unmatched parentheses. Possibly, a Defined Name is wrong -- they need to be input into the formulas exactly as they were defined. Do Insert Name Define to check. if you have DIV/0! If you don't, look for a variable that somehow did not get filled in with a value perhaps. At any rate, what you want to do is select the cell with the error, and after checking all those typical errors, do Tools Auditing Trace Precedents and/or Trace Error. If fixing a few topmost leftmost errors does not fix the rest of your errors on your worksheet, you may need to do it the hard way, from the bottom right upwards then leftwards.
The next chart has 3 chart series. Select each range indicated (eg. G7:H1446 for #1) and do Chart All Scatter Smoothed Line Scatter. Do Chart Add Data for #2 and #3. You may need to edit the series by double-clicking on the plot-series line that comprises the chart. Here are the correct series from the innermost outwards:

1)   =SERIES(,DATA!$G$7:$G$1446,DATA!$H$7:$H$1446,1) 
2)  =SERIES(,DATA!$I$7:$I$1446,DATA!$J$7:$J$1446,2)       
3)   =SERIES(,DATA!$E$7:$E$1446,DATA!$F$7:$F$1446,3)


Notice that series C7:D1446 is missing from the above. Chart that if you like. It is the basic tilted ellipse form the others all rely upon. If PI(()/25 is removed, the skew will go away. You may choose also to just do the COS() function for X and the SIN() function for Y. Keep Factor and PI()/180 -- please see Tips below and picture.

,, That way, you have the formulas with checkable data results in order to re-create the chart long into the future., I've written 89 articles and had 5 deleted already, which meets the auditing standard for materiality of data loss., You're done!

Start out by placing your regular HTML codes, then add the link you wish to color.,
With CSS you have to write in the HEAD section of your site.,
You shouldn't end the code yet, however some website designers do end the code before it's finished and then work on the closed tag.,
Add onto the CSS stylesheet.,
Type the following after all of them {color:#;}

,
You're going to need a basic understanding of hex code to get specific with your colors.,
When you have all of this done, you should add </style> to close the tag.

,
It is recommended, however not required, that you add comments so that it will be easier to edit your codes later on.",How to Change the Color of a Link in CSS," For the sake of doing this without any errors, we'll use images from Adobe DreamWeaver. And we'll use google for the link.;
, So you should type <style type=""text/css""> where it says <head>.

, Links consist of 4 elements. Link, hover, visited, and active.


Link is the primary color of your link, this is what color it will normally display.
Hover is a variable to make it change color, and stand out when your mouse goes over the link.
Visited is an after click variable, it will display this color anytime after you've clicked the link.
Active is the click on color, it will become this color the moment your mouse clicks and release it to activate the link.

, You want to make 4 elements after it, with an enter separating them. a:link , a:hover , a:visited , a:active. It's recommended you don't capitalize any of them.

,, Alternatively you can simply type {color:;} the the selection of colors is much more limited.

,, To do this in a CSS stylesheet, simply put /* */ .

Get to know the brush tool.,
Press E to access the eraser when you need it.,
Use the bucket tool to fill color.,
Use the eyedropper tool to remember what colors you created or edited.,
Press N to access the pencil tool.,
Make sure that you're on the first frame with Bitmap ON (on the bottom of your screen).,
Draw what you'd like for your first frame, For the starting animation, maybe try a stick figure.,
When you're done, look near the bottom left of your screen.,
Keep repeating this process until you've got a really nice animation.,
Click on the small color box above your color list on the far right of your screen.,
Select any color you like, and then press OK or ""Add To Custom Colors."",
Use ""undo"" when you make mistakes.,
Look out for issues with your view.",How to Animate with Pencil2D," It's quickly accessible with the B key. This tool will allow you to draw colorful, thick, luscious lines. You can change the color on the far right side of the screen, or create a custom color.
, You can change the size of the eraser on the far left, and hold down left-click in order to erase anything on your screen., It can be used by pressing K. It's a little glitchy, so look out for issues if you use it., You can access it with the I key. If you created a custom color, just press the I key on your keyboard, left-click on the spot you want, and voila! You've got your custom color back!, This will draw thinner lines, and it can be useful for more advanced detailing., This will guarantee that you don't have blank frames at the beginning of your animation., Try to make it seem realistic, and take your time to make sure it's the way you want it to be!, You should see 3 circular buttons that are arranged in this order. (+) (-) (+)

Pressing the first button will add a new blank slide.
If you left-click the second button, it will remove the most recent slide, or whatever slide you're on.
If you click on the third button (arguably the most useful one), then it will duplicate your slide and create another one.

, If you want to just test out all of the features before creating your first real animation, then try to make a stick figure running in the forest, park, or wherever else you can think of!, A massive color wheel should appear., After that, you've got a brand new color! You can use it with the tools mentioned above., If you accidentally get bumped while animating, move your mouse the wrong way, or, put simply, mess up while drawing something, you can always push Ctrl+Z or ⌘ Cmd+Z, and it will undo your last action., Let's say that you're casually creating an animation, thinking that it looks awesome, and then suddenly, when you try to undo an action with Ctrl+Z or ⌘ Cmd+Z, you click something else and your screen rotates weird. Oh no! What do you do? Left-click on the View button on the top-left of your screen and click on ""Reset Zoom/Rotate."" Then, your animation will be saved, and you can safely keep working on it once more!"

Pay attention to the amount of space the MP3 player has.,
Think about portability.,
Look at the interface.,
Examine how the device is powered.,
Consider accessories that you may want.",How to Choose an MP3 Player," Consider the amount of storage available. At the lower end of the market a 512mb to 1Gb player will generally hold up to 200 songs. If you have a large music collection then you should look for devices that offer at least 20 GB's of storage. In general every 10 GB's will hold around 2,900 MP3 files;
, If you have an active lifestyle then you will need a player that is small and compact. If you intend to use your player whilst jogging or whilst training in the gym, then a flash-based system will be a better choice as they contain no moving parts and therefore won't skip.

, Will it be easy to access and use on the move or will it require 100% of your attention to choose your songs? This is one area that is often overlooked and is often a source of dissatisfaction among users.

, Many MP3 players come with built in rechargeable batteries. These are very convenient and can last for a long time, but if you are not able to recharge them or don't have access to a computer with a USB port then you will need to wait Till the player gets all charged up again!!.

, Most MP3 players come with headphones but usually they are not very good quality. Investing in a new pair may improve sound quality. If you use your MP3 player in the car then consider an in car charger.

, If the headphone jack is snug, remove the connector with firm, steady force. If you yank it, you can damage the prong.

, This may seem obvious, put putting your headphones on the floor is a surefire way to accidentally damage them. Always place them on your desk or table, or put them away when not in use.

, When you're not using your headphones, don't leave them plugged in. If you accidentally get caught in the cable, you can cause damage when trying to get up or move.

, This is especially important for portable headphones without braided cables. If the cable gets tangled or bunched up, it can kink and wear away the connection. Don't just stuff your earbuds in your pocket.


You can use a binder clip or cut some notches into an old rewards card as a cheap way to securely wrap your headphone cables.
Avoid tying the cables or putting any stress on them.

, If gravity is tugging at the headphones, you're putting unnecessary stress on the cable's connection to the headphones. Avoid letting the headphones dangle from your desk or bag.

, Like all electronic devices, headphones and water don't mix. If they do get dunked, remove them from the water immediately, pour rubbing alcohol over them, and let them air dry for a few hours.This should allow you to recover from most minor water incidents.

, Besides the damage that it can cause your hearing, rolling over while you sleep can bend or snap your headphones.

, If you're transporting your headphones often, consider picking up a case or soft bag for them. You may be able to find a case for your specific headphones, or get a generic case designed for many different headphones.

, Cheap headphones cut costs everywhere, including construction quality. If you put your headphones through regular punishment that can't be avoided, you may be better off with a more expensive pair that can withstand a bigger beating.


A braided cable will prevent the cables from becoming tangled and knotted, which will preserve them much longer.

, Plugging headphones while high-volume audio is playing can damage them. Turn down the volume from the audio device before plugging the headphones in, and keep them off your head until after plugging them in.Once your headphones are plugged in, raise the volume until it's at a comfortable listening level.

, High volume can not only damage your hearing, but can also blow out your headphone speakers. This can cause permanent distortion and buzzing. If you hear the sound start to crack, your volume is too high.Avoid setting the audio volume to its maximum, as this can increase the chances of damaging the headphone speakers. If you need to increase the volume of your headphones but can't increase the source volume any more, look into a headphone amplifier., Most headphones don't have powerful bass drivers, and heavy bass can quickly damage the speakers. Bass is a low-frequency sound, which can put a lot of stress on speakers that aren't built for it. Use your source's level mixer to lower the bass levels, and make sure any ""Bass Boost"" option is disabled.

, This isn't really an issue if you're plugging headphones into your phone or computer, but when connecting to high-end stereo equipment, make sure that your headphones can handle the power output. Using weak headphones on a powerful source can quickly blow them out.


Check your headphone documentation to determine the ohms that it can support, as well as the ohm output of your audio source.

Understand the Graphical Processing Unit.,
Understand video card memory size.,
Understand video card memory type.,
Understand the video card bus interfaces.,
Understand the display interfaces.,
Consider extraneous video card features.,
Consider your budget limitations.",How to Buy a High Performance Video Card," The GPU is the most important part of a video card, as it performs all of the calculations necessary to display beautiful, real-time graphics on your screen. A GPU's strength is measured in clock speed, notated with ""hertz"" as its unit of measurement. In general, the higher the clock speed, the more power it has. Upper tier GPUs will have a clock speed between 700 and 800 MHz.;
, Video cards have their own memory banks on which they can store data for graphics calculations. Without a large video memory size, the video card would then have to use the computer's RAM for data storage, which would ultimately slow your computer down. A high-performance video card will have at least 1 GB of memory.

, There are different kinds of video card memory, with DDR memory being the most common. DDR2 and DDR3 are similar to DDR but they can perform more calculations in the same amount of time. GDDR5 is more recent and was designed specifically to handle high-end graphics while requiring less energy and producing less heat. For high performance, try to find a video card with DDR3 or GDDR5 memory.

, The bus interface is the type of connection slot used to connect the video card to the computer motherboard. There are 2 types: AGP and PCIe. AGP is older, has fewer features, and is much slower than PCIe. If you want to buy a high-end graphics card, PCIe cards perform better than AGP. However, first make sure your motherboard accepts PCIe cards by checking your motherboard's manual.

, The display interface is the type of connection used to connect the video card to your monitor. Cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors will likely require a VGA connection. Liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors will likely require an HDMI or DVI connection. Check your monitor's manual to see which display interfaces it supports.


As a bonus, if you purchase a high end card with HDMI output, you will be able to connect your computer to an HDTV, which will allow you to extend your computer display onto the television. Similarly, high end cards often have multiple display ports, allowing you to connect multiple monitors and extend your desktop across said monitors.

, Some video cards come with multiple GPUs for faster processing. Some video cards come with shader effects, which are used to calculate specific graphical effects in real-time applications. These extra features can be very useful but they have specialized roles and will result in a higher price tag.

, Selecting a high-performance video card means that you'll need to set aside a good amount of money. Be prepared to spend at least $150 to $300 on a video card with high-end features. If you need to compromise due to a tight budget, start by dropping the extraneous features.

Try having a friend call or using their phone. If you have called repeatedly and gotten no answer, it's possible that the other party is choosing not to pick up your calls. Calling from a friend's phone or a payphone can help rule out this possibility.;
, If you're wrong about the number being a cell phone, it will likely be public information. Search the white pages in the U.S., or use a search engine to find your own area's public database.

, The phone number's owner or associated institutions may have posted the number on a personal or corporate website.

Retrace your steps.,
Contact your service provider.",How to Find a Lost Cell Phone1," The easiest way to find a cell phone is to call your phone number from another phone. You can do this to find any cell phone, regardless of whether it's a smart phone. Just ask someone you know to call your number, or use a free website service like wheresmycellphone.com or freecall.com to dial your number from a computer., A close second to calling your cell phone is having someone else text your phone. If your phone is truly lost (as in lost at a public place, not misplaced around your apartment), you can text your contact info to your phone so that anyone who finds the phone will know your identity and how to reach you.If you can't find anyone to text your phone you can use a free website service like txt2day.com.
You can also try texting a reward offer to your phone. This may convince someone who finds your cell phone to contact you and arrange a meeting., Retracing your steps can help you find any lost or misplaced item, not just cell phones. However, if you had your phone at an earlier location and have realized that you left your cell phone somewhere, retracing your steps can help you locate your mobile phone (as long as it hasn't been taken).Whatever you do, don't panic. Panicking will only worsen your situation, and might make it difficult to concentrate or think clearly.Sit down for a moment and think about where you've been and what you've one. Consider when and where you last remember having or using your phone, and work your way forward from there.
If you frequented any restaurants or stores before you lost your phone, try asking an employee if anyone found/returned a lost phone. If the phone was left with an employee, you should be able to simply give a description of your phone, or tell the employee your phone number so he can call it and verify that it's your phone.

, Some cell phone service providers have GPS location services available to customers. Even if your provider does not offer such an option, they can at least cut off service to your phone.Find your provider's customer service number online, or look up your provider's local offices in a phone book.

Balance the safety and convenience.,
Return to the cord phone or land-line phone.,
Limit the length of your calls on your cell phone.,
Use a hands-free device or wireless headset to increase the distance between the phone and your head.,
Stay still when using a cell phone.,
Turn the cell phone off when not in use.,
Consider either not giving cell phones to children or limiting their usage to emergency circumstances.,
Look for products designed to shield you as a cell phone user.,
Purchase a cell phone that rates as low as possible on the scale of radiation emissions.",How to Protect Yourself when Using a Cell Phone," While there have been ample studies showing that there may be side effects to cell phone usage, there have been many studies refuting the health impacts, causing a large level of uncertainty and misunderstanding. It's human nature to keep using something that works for us unless proven hazardous, so this uncertainty has worked in favor of continued, increased use of cell phones. Understandably so too – cell phones are convenient, they allow you to find people fast, do business anywhere, and stay in touch around the world. However, they are also a ""massive human experiment"", with more than 2-4 billion people in the world experiencing 70 to 80 percent of the cell phone's energy penetrating the skull, with unknown long-term outcomes.When weighing up this convenient tool with the questionable health impact, do you want to take this risk with your health? Choosing to err on the side of caution and taking measures to reduce your exposure to radio frequency (RF) emissions from your cell phone is a good preventative health action over which you have control.;
, Try taking most of your calls using the ""old-fashioned"" way of a phone plugged into the wall. If you like pacing as you talk, get a longer cord. At least make a large effort to take calls that you know will last a long time on a corded phone for your day-to-day communications.


Don't substitute it with a cordless phone for long conversations. These have their own questionable health impacts. For example, digital cordless phones radiate continuously even when they're not in use., Prolonged extended use of cell phones increases your exposure to the radiated signals from your device; even a two minute call has been shown to alter your brain's natural electrical activity for up to an hour afterward.By reducing the amount of time spent of the cell phone and by relegating it to emergency use, you can reduce your exposure to it. Turn it off and keep it in a carrying bag, away from your body but handy should you need to use it.

, The best approach to using a cell phone to create distance between you and the radiating phone. When speaking, place the phone on speakerphone. The speakerphone option is a good one because it allows you to hold the phone away from you as you speak.


Use texting more often than talking to keep the cell phone away from the head. However, even texting should be kept to a minimum. And keep the cell phone away from your body while emailing or texting.Keep the phone away from you when dialing to connect. Phones use more radiation during connection time, so just watch the screen and then move the phone to listen once you're sure the connection has occurred., If you keep moving around with it, more radiation is emitted because the phone needs to keep track of you.This covers walking and being inside a vehicle; as you move, the phone continues to scan to keep up with the changes in position.

, A cell phone that is in standby mode is still emitting radiation. When it is off, this ceases. Do not carry the cell phone next to your body; instead, keep it in a bag. This is especially important if you have become used to wearing it in a pocket next to your groin; research has shown that men wearing cell phones next to their groin have up to a 30 percent reduction in sperm count.Keep it away from all vital organs (heart, liver, etc.).

, Keep in mind that children are more susceptible to the radiation emitted from the cell phone. Their skulls are thinner and their brains are less developed. Moreover, since they are growing, their cells divide at a much faster rate, which means that the impact of radiation can be a lot worse., There are several devices on the market offering their own claims. Read the information accompanying the products and decide what is likely to work best for you. Some of the possibilities include:


A cell phone EMF protective device. These are small chips or button that are adhered to the phone reducing the impact of the transmitter signals.
A screen type shield. This is a screen placed over the phone's earpiece.

, Some cell phones are definitely better than others on this scale, so as a consumer, vote with your purchase power and let cell phone companies know that less radiation is what consumers demand.


You can work out the rate of radio frequency being absorbed by the body by checking out the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for your brand of phone at the US FCC website here: http://transition.fcc.gov/cgb/sar/. Click on the brand names to see how your existing phone stacks up.
The less fancy your phone, the less energy it needs to run, and the less radiation you'll be exposed to. It may sound disappointing if you're used to playing on your phone a lot but that's what laptops, portable game consoles, and iPads are for!

You’re moving to a location where the carrier doesn’t provide service. Usually, you’ll need a convincing reason for the move, such as an employment change or death in the family.
You’ve been terminated from your employment, and simply can no longer afford your contract., It’s a good bet that you won’t have any success with a lower-tier customer service representative. If that’s the case, ask to speak with a manager. This individual may have more authority when it comes to making decisions on terminating the contract., If your complaint relates primarily to poor phone service, file a complaint with the BBB. You can also register a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. Once you’ve done that, try contacting your carrier again, to let them know the actions you’ve taken. You may find them more receptive."

Start with free reverse cell phone lookup services.,
Cautiously evaluate the services.,
Pay the fee for their service only after exhausting free options.,
Hire a private investigator.",How to Trace Cell Phone Numbers2," If you tried the free methods already (which you should), you've likely already found advertisements for these services. Start by only trying the free services; these are unlikely to work but are an easy first step.



Do not sign up for any free trial that asks for your credit card number or other personal information.

, Many ""reverse cell phone database"" websites that charge a fee to conduct the search will try to scam you or give you unhelpful information. Enter false or familiar phone numbers to test for accuracy. Search for a couple random strings of numbers (in the correct phone number format). If the search still comes up with ""results"", especially GPS location, it's likely a scam or joke site.Similarly, you can enter your own phone number and see if the results are accurate.
Search for reviews of the company. An online search for the company name can reveal complaints from scammed customers. For a more official perspective, you can search the better business bureau directory for detailed records of the company's response to customer complaints.

, These sites typically run the same searches you did when you tried the free methods, so paying money is very unlikely to turn up new results and may result in your information being stolen or your credit card overcharged.

, Even after you've tried all the above options, you will often still not have the information you need. Hiring a private investigator is an expensive option, and you'll want to research several options before selecting one. Make sure you get an estimate and detailed information on terms before you hire anyone. A refund is often available in the event the investigator fails to find the information you're looking for, but ask about this in advance.

Check your call log or caller ID.,
Ask for ""call return"" service.,
Enable ""call trap"" or ""call trace"" functions.",How to Trace Cell Phone Numbers3," All mobile phones will automatically identify most incoming phone calls. If you're on a land line (home phone), contact your phone provider to enable caller ID.


Consult your phone manual or contact the manufacturer if you don't know how to check the call log for recent incoming phone numbers on your mobile phone.
There are ways to bypass caller ID or even trick it into displaying the wrong number. If caller ID is unsuccessful, move on to the following options.

, Contact your phone provider and purchase ""call return"" or ""last call return"" service. This may require an initial fee and/or a fee each time you use the service.


The call return code varies depending on country and phone provider (and may not be available in all regions). Ask your provider for the code or search the internet for ""call return code for "".
In the United States, this service is also called *69 (after the code used in that country).
After the call you want to trace has ended, enter the call return code and you should hear a voice message reading the telephone number of that caller, with the option to return the call.
In some regions, call return is available automatically. Fees may still apply.

Warning: in some regions (such as California), call return will only return the last incoming call without telling you the phone number.

, If you are receiving repeated harassment calls from an unknown number, contact your phone provider and ask if these services are available:


Call trap: After requesting a call trap, write down the dates and times you receive harassing phone calls for the next couple weeks (or for as long as your provider requests). Once you report this information to the phone company they will identify the harassing number and report it to law enforcement.







Call trace: Once this service is enabled, pressing the call trace code immediately following the harassing call will send the phone number to law enforcement. (This code is *57 in the United States; your provider should tell you which code to use if you are in a different country.)






Call traps are usually free, while call traces may cost an additional charge. If call trap is not available, or if the harassment is severe, you may be able to convince your phone provider to give you free call trace service.

Evaluate paid services carefully.,
Search for reviews and complaints about the company online.,
Never provide payment information to an untrustworthy site.,
Never enter unnecessary personal information.",How to Trace Cell Phone Numbers4," ""Reverse cell phone lookup"" websites are notorious for scamming customers, either by failing to provide any useful information for their money or by willfully stealing the customer's credit card information.

, The the better business bureau directory is a good place to look in addition to ordinary search engine queries.

, Do not enter your credit card number if your browser warns you that the website is insecure, if the site asks you to pay using a third party website you've never heard of, or if the site seems ""sketchy"" and unprofessional.


This includes ""free trials"" that claim your card will not be charged.
Try to find a service that has you pay using PayPal or another well-known third-party system.

, Your social security number and similar private information is never required for a legitimate phone lookup service.

Track your family's whereabouts.,
Install an app to keep track of your own phone.,
Find a lost phone.",How to Trace Cell Phone Numbers5," Any smartphone or regular phone with a GPS chip can be tracked. Here are some options for keeping track of your family's location at all times:

Contact your cell phone provider to ask if they offer a family tracking plan for an additional monthly charge. This may also come with parental control abilities.Install a GPS tracking app on your family's smart phones. Some apps allow the user to voluntarily share her location with friends, while others are intended for parents to track children. Browse your phone's app store or do research online to find the app that suits your needs.






Install AccuTracking on non-smart phones. AccuTracking is one of the few third-party location trackers that works on non-smart phones. See their website for which phone models it works with and monthly fee information.
If you are trying to track someone's location without his permission, install an app hider on their phone and use it to conceal the tracking app. Alternatively, you can put the tracking app in an obscure folder of their phone to minimize his chance of finding it.

, If you're worried about losing your phone or having it stolen, there are many apps designed to let you track your phone's GPS location from a computer and/or prevent a thief from using it.


Browse your phone's app store or search online for a tracking or anti-theft app that works on your device.
AccuTracking is one of the few services that can track (GPS-enabled) non-smart phones.

, If you already lost your phone and did not previously install any tracking software, you still have a chance to locate it:


Many smart phone manufacturers can automatically locate your phone. Call customer service or search online for instructions for your model. If you have access to a computer, you will likely be able to track your phone's location and/or set it to make a loud sound at regular intervals.
Some tracking apps (such as Android's ""Plan B"") can be downloaded remotely onto your phone from a computer. Make sure to do this before your smart phone runs out of battery.






Your cell service provider may offer GPS location for a fee, remotely activating your phone's GPS chip. This may be your only option for locating a non-smart phone.

File a police report immediately.",How to Protect a Mobile Phone from Being Stolen," This means, do not leave it out on the edge of tables, exposed in your bag or stuck in a pile of textbooks. Make sure your phone is within 5–6 inches (12.7–15.2 cm) of you and make eye contact with it every few seconds or when a person walks by, to be sure it is with you.;
, A majority of phones are stolen this way, you go to pick up that mocha latte and bam--your phone is gone along with your tablet you let sit there.

, That is an invitation for thieves to steal it. Be aware of where it is and tuck it away or hold it securely at all times.

, Even if you feel like answering that text John sent you 2 seconds ago, leave it in your pocket and refrain from touching it until you're somewhere safer.

, When thieves see Apple headphones, they assume that you are you using an Apple phone, which is the most valuable. Instead, consider using a cheap pair of knock off headphones for out and about in areas where you're uncertain about safety.

, Although there are a lot of cameras, thieves will still take an opportunity to steal your phone. If you're bored on the train or subway, wait until you are on the train to take your phone out. Even then, you should probably wait until the train is not too crowded before you take out your phone.

, When people ask for the time, look at a watch or say you simply do not know. Thieves often ask this to see if your phone is worth stealing, so be polite and just say you do not know. And wait until they walk away to look at your phone.

, This will make your phone look like an old monochrome phone. A very experienced hobbyist can also replace all white SMD LEDs in the phone with lime-green ones (better not only in display, but also in keyboard). Such a mod will distract most thieves. However, note that it may attract a rare group of thieves who hunt for vintage items.

, Unless you are sleeping of course, always have your eyes on the phone.

, Make a record of all your phone information and keep this in a safe place. Include the following elements in the information:


Your phone number
The make and model––keep a copy of your phone's manufacturer code so you can have all your info ready when you call them
Color and appearance details
The pin or security lock code

The IMEI number (on GSM phones) (If you live in the USA, not all of these tips will work for you. Some US cell phone companies won't disable your phone using the IMEI number in this same manner.)

, Use an ultra violet pen to print your post code and house number onto both your mobile handset and battery. This makes it easily identifiable as your property if lost or stolen. It would also be good if you write your alternate contact number or email id on your phone. This would help the finder of your handset to contact you if he or she intents to return it. The ultra-violet pen marking will wear off every couple of months, so reapply it when you feel necessary.

, This will make it less valuable to a thief and deny them access to personal numbers stored on your SIM card.

, If your phone is stolen, report the loss to them immediately. Using your IMEI number, they may be able to block your hand set and account details. Some wireless carriers are willing to do this, and some aren't. If done, this will prevent anyone from using the phone across any network, even if the SIM card is changed.


Keep in mind that once the phone is disabled, it may not be able to be used again, even if you get it back.
Keep records of this call--the date, time, name of the person you spoke to, what they said, and their extension. Ask for confirmation in writing that your phone has been disabled.This is important in case the thief makes fraudulent charges on your account.

, There are suppliers that provide modern anti theft software for your phone. The software enables you to remotely contact your mobile and stay in control. For example, one of the recently published solutions for Symbian and Android is Theft Aware; others provide Windows Mobile or Blackberry support (GadgetTrak, ).

, In addition to reporting your phone lost or stolen, you should also disable your phone number (not account) so that no further charges can be applied. This is in case the thief figures out how to access your account through another hand set, or in case the carrier is unwilling to block the handset. Remember that, as mentioned earlier, many thieves stand to benefit from using your service rather than selling your phone, especially between the moment they steal it and the moment you realize your phone is missing.As in the previous step, keep detailed records of when you requested your account to be disabled.

, Sometimes this can prevent (or at least delay) the carrier from launching a collections effort and tainting your credit, if things get ugly. , Time is money, literally. A thief can add over US$10,000 to your cell phone bill in just hours by making international calls, and you might end up being asked to foot the bill. Some phone companies may require proof that the phone was actually stolen, versus it having been lost. A police report serves as evidence, which will make your wireless provider more cooperative, especially if insurance is involved.
If you continue to encounter problems with your wireless provider in that they are not disabling the phone or your account in a timely manner and insist that you cover the charges made by the thief, let them know that you intend to file a complaint with the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), your state attorney general's office, and your state's public utility commission (PUC) (or the equivalent authorities in your country)."

Be aware of the etiquette standards regarding cellphone use in public.,
Set a tight schedule.,
Select a loud location.,
Engage the other person in conversation.,
Ask the other person if he or she would like to reschedule lunch.,
Take the phone from them during mid-conversation.,
Call your lunch date’s cellphone.,
Get tough if the occasion calls for it.,
Deal with the permanently distracted cellphone player.,
Bet on it.",How to Persuade Someone to Stop Using Their Cellphone During Lunch With You," Apart from keeping cellphone discussions quiet so that nobody else hears the cellphone owner's personal life history, it is polite to turn off the cellphone at any dining table. The other form of politeness involves exceptions––any cellphone user must explain in advance of the meal why they may need to answer the cellphone during the meal and apologize in advance for this possibility. However, use of an exception is not an open invitation to gossip and chat away; it is for short, to-the-point confirmation or updating of mostly emergency or time-pressed issues.


Acceptable reasons for an exception include: A doctor on call (or any other vital job on call), receiving news of progress on a sick child or relative, being called up for emergency surgery such as a transplant, etc. It is not appropriate to take appointments for a tree clipping or plumbing business during a lunch date, nor is it appropriate to catch up with someone not spoken to for a few days. Voicemail exists for a sensible purpose.;
, If this person is notorious for talking on his or her cellphone during lunch, set aside only 30 minutes (or even less) for lunch. That way he or she won’t think that you have all the time in the world and can wait as they talk on the phone.


Let the other person know that you're extremely busy and must stay on schedule due to meetings or appointments. Hopefully your lunch date will get the message and won’t squander your time together.
If you suspect that they'll assume that cutting into your short time by answering their phone is acceptable, you have every right to insist that given the short amount of time you have, that it'd best if both phones were turned off. At least this way, you're participating in the ""no-phone"" pact. Turning off cellphones at the beginning of a meal is proper etiquette.
Suggest that both you and your lunch date remove the phone from the table and put it away in a pocket or bag. Perhaps if the phone isn’t visible, your lunch date won’t feel as compelled to use it during dinner.

, While dining in a noisy environment may not always be pleasant, it certainly isn’t conducive for cellphone conversations either. Try to find a cafe or restaurant which has a buzz level of noise that is pleasant and uplifting for you as diners but is likely to make phone conversations unpleasant.


Another response is to find a cafe or restaurant that isn't afraid to have a ""no cellphones"" policy. In response the many frustrated diners, more and more of these exist and if they're good enforcers of the policy, you're off the hook. All you need to say is something like: ""Sorry Aunt Beryl, they have a no cellphones policy here and they ask that you take your calls outside. But if you do go outside, your meal's going to get cold and I'm going to get lonesome here.""

, Take control of the conversation and keep your lunch date engaged and on topic. If you're in the middle of a compelling discussion, he or she may be more inclined to hit the “go to voicemail” button if a call comes in.


Don't be shy to cut in while the phone is ringing and ask them ""Oh can't you let that go to voicemail please? We haven't finished our chat yet."" Or, try a simple act of placing your hand gently over their phone and shaking your head softly, while making eye contact. It's hard to ignore such a gesture.
If you want to inject a little science into a gentle dig at your lunch partner to stop playing with the cellphone, tell them about Dr. Mark Lieberman's research. A linguist at the University of Pennsylvania, he has researched into distraction and found that hearing other people's conversation on a cellphone distracts us as we try, without even wanting to, to fill in the unheard side of the conversation. In other words, the non-cellphone talking table partner grows ever more curious, while the whole relationship between the two face-to-face diners is totally consumed by the phone call.

, People know (or should know) when they are being rude due to too much cell phone interaction. If you’ve been at the table for more than a few minutes and your lunch date seems set on having a full conversation on the phone, don't be afraid to ask him or her if you should reschedule. It'll clarify that enough is enough and that you consider your time is being wasted.


Wait an appropriate amount of time before requesting that lunch be rescheduled. If your lunch date is trying to firm up a few meeting dates with a boss or speaking with a teacher from his or her child’s school, allow a few minutes to pass first, as the call may be important. However, if your date is gabbing away about what was eaten for dinner last night or is simply gossiping, give it a few minutes and then bounce.
Tell the person you want to reschedule. Vocalize how you feel, over the other person’s conversation to get his or her attention. State that it's clear to you they have a very important conversation to deal with and that you are available to reschedule the lunch tomorrow (or whenever). This will let them quickly understand that your time is valuable.
Be clear about your intention to reschedule the lunch date. Get up from the table and gesture that you are going to leave. If needed, write down on a piece of paper or a napkin that you're going to dash and state something like: ""let's reschedule lunch for when you're free; I'm free X date and time."" Your date may have no idea that he or she is being rude but you can clear up the confusion at a later date.
Silently get up and leave. Let your lunch date try to figure out why you haven’t returned from the bathroom. You are basically showing your lunch date the same courtesy he or she is showing you. This is a fairly confronting move, so don't do it to someone unless you believe they deserve it and will bounce back from it (nor if they're the person about to give you a job offer).
Text the other person a goodbye. You could either send a text message from the table or you could combine the silent departure with a text and text him or her once you're back at your office.

, This guerrilla-approach may not work with some people, but if it’s your spouse or children, by all means swipe the phone.


Tell them you’ll return the phone once lunch is over. Once again, your co-worker may not find this technique very desirable but if it’s a family member, especially your child, this may be the best way to stop the cell phone conversation and be used as a teachable moment.
Make a pointed comment such as: ""Do you think you're Clark Kent?"" The answer will be ""No, why?."" Your response will be: ""Because you're treating this café like a phone booth.""

, If your lunch partner is gabbing away while you silently sip your iced tea, waiting for them to finish, don’t put up with being completely blown off. Call them! Let your call interrupt the conversation they're having, so they know you're done having lunch alone.


Call them from a payphone or the restaurant's phone for anonymity. They may be perplexed when they see an unknown number, answer the phone only to find it’s you calling them from the restaurant bathroom.
Send them a text message. Many phones will sound an audio alert when a text message comes in. Your lunch date will momentarily glance at your message and read, “Please put down the phone and have lunch with me!”
Call them openly from your cell phone. While staring directly into their eyes, dial your lunch partner’s cell number and watch for their reaction as they bumble to read who else is calling them.

, Suggest that your cellphone gabbing lunch date leave the table if they're intent on phone chatting. Why should you leave, especially if he or she starts talking when your delicious lunch has arrived? If your date is going to be rude, he or she should be the one to leave.


Tell your date to take it outside. Explain that the restaurant has a ""no cellphone policy"" (even if they don’t, just say it anyway) and that they will need to go outside if they're going to keep talking. Ask them if the cold meal is worth the call.
Stare at your date until he or she catches your glance and then point or nod to the exit. Sometimes you can say so much more without ever saying a word.

, The previous steps have all dealt with cellphone conversations. There are so many things a person can do on a phone now that you may be confronted with any number of distracting activities from a cellphone user, including updating their Twitter or Facebook accounts, harvesting their crops on a simulation game, texting their pals, checking the weather and, most irritating of all, stopping your conversation every few minutes to ""check the facts"" on the internet!


Ask the cellphone player if they'd mind putting away their phone and spending more time chatting with you. Impress upon them that you haven't much time and that you'd really like to get up-to-date with their news and to share some of your own rather than competing with their cellphone.
Try some of the relevant options above, such as suggesting rescheduling to a time they're more likely to be free or texting them a message like: ""No more games, let's eat lunch.""

, Put your phone on the table and ask that others with you do the same. The first person to touch their phone before the end of the meal gets to pay.

Find an Android phone.,
Search for a BlackBerry phone.,
Locate an iPhone.,
Track down a Windows phone.",How to Find a Lost Cell Phone2," If you've lost an Android phone there are two ways to track it down. If the phone is still turned on and in range of a wireless signal, you can track it from a computer using Device Manager. If the phone is turned off or is out of service range, you can check your phone's last reported location from a computer.To use Device Manager, sign into your Google account from a computer or another device. Google's Device Manager should instantly show you your phone's location on a Google Maps screen. Device Manager has additional options to lock your phone, make the phone ring, or remotely wipe its contents and data clear.
Check your phone's last recorded location by going to google.com/settings/accounthistory. Then click on ""Places You Go,"" and ""Manage History."" However, this option relies on wi-fi and mobile signals instead of GPS, so it will not be as accurate at locating your phone as the Device Manager.

, BlackBerry devices do not typically include their own tracking apps or services. However, you can sign up for a third-party service like Berry Locator. This service costs $6.95 and will send a message to your lost device, as well as show you on a map where your device is located., The primary way to locate a lost iPhone is by using the Find My iPhone app. If your phone does not have the app downloaded, you'll need to download it through the App Store. The Find My iPhone app is fairly accurate, but it requires the phone to be turned on and connected to the internet in order to work.Using a computer or another mobile device, log into your iCloud and open Find My iPhone. Your phone's location should appear on a map, which you can use to track your phone's movement.
Find My iPhone gives you the option of remotely making your iPhone make sounds (to alert you or others nearby of your phone's location and its status as being lost/stolen), send a message with contact information to your iPhone, or wipe the contents and data clear off your device.

, Windows Phone users can use the built-in lost phone feature that comes on all Windows 8.1 and later models. Simply visit the Microsoft devices page from a computer or another wireless device to view a list of all the Microsoft phones and tablets you own. You can then use the location service to track down the device of your choosing.Once you're logged into the Microsoft lost phone service, you can remotely lock your cell phone or wipe the contents and data off your device.

Be smart and safe.,
Cancel your passwords and logins.,
Contact the telephone company.,
Report it.",How to Find a Lost Cell Phone3," If you feel that your device has been stolen, do not try to retrieve it yourself. Instead, report it to the police and let them take care of the problem for you. Trying to retrieve your phone yourself could land you in serious trouble, and may even cost you your life.

, The speed with which you need to do this and the extent of it will depend on how much you use your phone for online interaction. For some, this may be very little, while for others, it could be a huge task. You may also want to cancel any credit/debit cards that were registered to any online stores through that device (like the App store, for example).


If you're worried that the phone is in someone else's hands, the sooner you do this the better, as identity theft is a serious and widespread issue.
It's better to take the time to reset your passwords and logins before physically hunting further for your phone. This will minimize the potential damage someone could do with access to your information, and if you do find your phone then using new passwords is only a minor inconvenience.
Start with your most important passwords. This typically includes email, bank accounts, Facebook, and online storage. Deal with financial and personal information first. After you have changed your major passwords, you can reset passwords for less important services.

, Have your account details handy, so that your account can be closed down. You may need a password or passcode, if you designated one for your account. Having your service provider cancel the phone will help keep someone (whether a thief or someone who finds your phone) from making unauthorized calls with your SIM card.


If you have a phone that is paid by usage rather than prepaid, and you cannot find it within 2 hours, it usually is a better idea to call your phone company immediately and tell them to deactivate your phone.

, Visit the police station. Smartphone insurance providers will often want a police report, if you intend to file a claim through your pre-paid insurance option. Some phone companies may also require a police report just to deactivate your account.


Lost phones are often turned in and left unclaimed because people assume that nobody would have been kind enough to have handed them in.

Know your phone's serial number.,
Register your phone online.,
Have a designated place for everything.,
Prepare to avoid future losses.",How to Find a Lost Cell Phone4," Every cell phone is equipped with an electronic serial number. Depending on the type and model of cell phone you use, your phone's unique number may be called an IMEI (international mobile equipment identity), MEID (mobile equipment identifier), or ESN (electronic serial number). It's often located on a sticker under the battery, though its location will vary depending on your phone.Find your cell phone's serial/identification number when you first purchase it. Write the number down and keep it in a safe place at home.
If you ever lose your phone, you can report your serial/identification number to the police and to your wireless provider.

, Some online services, such as MissingPhones.org, allow you to register your cell phone with the website. This can help you in the future, should your phone become lost or stolen down the line.In order to register your phone, you'll need the serial number from your device.

, If you're prone to losing things, you may want to work on reducing the frequency of those losses, no matter what the item may be. Try getting into a habit of leaving things in particular places, which can help you know where to look next time.If you tend to lose your phone at home, try to keep it on a nightstand or coffee table whenever it's not on your person.
When your phone is on your person, give it a designated pocket and always check that you have everything when you get up to leave. For example, you might tap your pockets to confirm in a particular order that you've got your keys, wallet, and cell phone.

, There are certain precautions you can take to assist your efforts in the future, should you lose or misplace your phone again. You can register your phone for a GPS tracking service, either through your wireless provider or through an independent service like AccuTracking or Belon.gs. You can also keep a written record of your phone's serial/identification number in your wallet or at home."

Contact your carrier to determine the process.,
Find someone willing to buy into your existing plan.,
Consider swapping plans with someone.,
Think about using an online service to sell or swap.",How to Get out of a Cellular Service Contract2," Let your carrier know that you’d like to sell your plan, and find out what’s needed to put that into effect. You may be told that this can be done with what’s known as an Assumption of Liability. This is a transaction that legally transfers your existing contract to another person.The person taking over your plan will most likely be instructed by your carrier to read the carrier’s Terms and Conditions of Agreement, and agree to abide by them.
Your carrier may also have an Assumption of Liability form, which will probably have to be signed both by you and the person taking over the contract.

, The odds are that you either know someone, or have access to someone, who’s looking to change his or her cellphone plan. Ask around to your friends and family. You could also post a query on your social media sites. Obviously, make sure you’re dealing with someone who’s reliable and financially stable, if you expect the carrier to approve the change., If you’re not having any success finding someone to buy your plan, you might want to look into swapping plans, in which case you literally switch your plan with someone else’s. You’re a bit more limited in this scenario, because you’ll need to find an individual who currently has a plan you’re interested in—and vice versa., If you either don’t know anyone to sell your plan to or swap with, or you’d just as soon not be bothered looking around, there are services that will do it for you.


Conduct a browser search, and you’ll find a number of companies willing to assist you. However, expect to pay a fee for the service.Obviously, do your homework on the company you’re thinking of using. Ask around to see if anyone you know has ever used the company before. You can also do a BBB search to see if the company is listed there, and what its rating is.

Determine the amount of your existing Early Termination Fee (ETF).,
Check competing major cellphone plan carriers.,
Look into alternative carriers.",How to Get out of a Cellular Service Contract3," One of the reasons people don’t leave a carrier they’re unhappy with is because of the dreaded ETF. However, carriers do prorate their ETF, basing the amount owed on the time remaining in your contract.Call your carrier to determine the amount you’d be liable for if you terminated your agreement. You can also look here for an ETF calculator.

, Once you’ve figured out what your ETF is, research other major carriers (the major carriers are usually considered to be Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile) to find a plan that works for you. Once you’ve done that, contact the carrier to see if it would be willing to absorb your ETF if you made the switch to their service., You don’t have to be locked in to one of the major carriers to get a satisfactory cellphone plan. It may be worth your while to consider:


A smaller local carrier. These carriers (like Cincinnati Bell and Cellular South) usually offer a variety of fairly cheap plans. However, you’d have to check as to whether or not the carrier requires a contract. Most—if not all— smaller local carriers have nationwide calling. You may even find some that are willing to pay your current ETF if you migrate to their service.Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs). Unlike the major carriers, these service providers (such as Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile) don’t have their own network infrastructure. Rather, they purchase the excess capacity of the larger carriers.Many MVNOs don’t require contracts. However, you’d have to check with the individual carrier to see if it would be willing to pay your ETF on an early termination of your existing contract.

Determine if modifications were made to the original contract terms.",How to Get out of a Cellular Service Contract4," If you don’t have a copy of your cellphone plan agreement, contact your carrier to get a copy. If for some reason the carrier doesn’t have it, then it's possible that there is no contract. That could be your way out. This is probably unlikely to happen, but you never know., When you do get your contract, read through it carefully. See if there are any terms that talk about potential modifications to the agreement, and make note of them.

, Here’s where you could find a possible escape route. It’s important that you note any changes as soon as they occur.


If the contract makes no reference to future modifications, and your agreement terms were modified by the carrier during the contract period, you could claim a breach of the agreement. Be aware, however, that many of these contracts do have a provision that says the carrier can change the agreement at any time.Even if the contract contains a term addressing future modifications, you should be able to break the contract if the change is “materially adverse” to you. Granted that’s kind of a nebulous term, but the reality is that if the carrier has changed rates, or added small fees that weren’t there when you signed the agreement, you’ve probably met the “materially adverse” threshold."
"
Find out if there’s a grace period.,
Follow the proper procedure for cancelling.,
Return the phone.",How to Get out of a Cellular Service Contract5," If you’ve just signed up for a plan, and are struck with instant buyer’s remorse, don’t wait to take action. You probably have a grace period (usually 14 days) within which you can cancel the agreement. Check your contract immediately, or call the carrier to find out the exact timeframe for cancellation., Determine if there’s a particular method that you have to use to take advantage of the grace period cancellation provision. See if merely speaking with a customer service representative is enough, or if you have to submit a request in writing.

, Assuming you haven’t bought your phone outright from the carrier, obviously they’re going to want it back. Again, find out how the carrier wants that done, and act accordingly. Also, don’t be surprised if you’re assessed a restocking fee of about $35."
"
Air your grievances on social media sites.,
Use appropriate hashtags.,
Notify customer service if you’re getting significant activity.",How to Get out of a Cellular Service Contract6," If you have a legitimate complaint against the carrier, and you’ve had no success dealing with the various levels of customer service, you can always take your gripe online. Obviously, the more Facebook or Twitter followers you have, the better. And don’t hesitate to encourage your readers to re-post what you’ve written.

, Mention the carrier in the hashtag to your posts. You want to make sure that the carrier is specifically referenced, so that other dissatisfied customers of the company can find your posts more easily.

, If you find that your posts are getting a lot of views, you might want to consider contacting your carrier’s customer service department again, to let them know of the success of your campaign. They’d really prefer not to have their company’s public relations crisis management team get involved in the dispute if at all possible. That might be enough for them to let you go without a fight."

Increase your background knowledge of the device you'll be reviewing.,
Introduce the smartphone.,
Break down your review into categories.,
Always include the phone's drawbacks along with its better features.,
Take clear, detailed photos of the device for written reviews.,
Reach a conclusion.",How to Write a Smartphone Review," The best smartphone review will result from drawing on your extensive personal experiences with the basics of the device. Without understanding these thoroughly, your review won't be able to enlighten potential buyers, so be sure to be thoroughly comfortable with the basics.


If you don't already own the smartphone in question (for example, if you're reviewing a range of phones for your blog), visit one of the smartphone carrier's retail store and play around with the phone, or ask a friend who owns the device if you can use it for a day. Learn about the phone's features, design, pros, cons, and the price.;
, Start with the facts. Be sure to provide the smartphone's name, and any nicknames that it might have acquired in the market as consumers use it. Some consumers will only refer to nicknames when searching, so cover all bases. Give a basic rundown of its cost, availability, network coverage, plans, etc. as relate to your region (noting that it is also important to point out where you're reviewing from and the mobile carrier you're using, given that the internet is worldwide). It's also really helpful to introduce the review with the reason why you have chosen to review it.


Be sure to include any relevant hyperlinks to help customers find the information you're referring to, perhaps even purchase locations.

, At this point, you can give your opinion about the phone's particular features. Outline or detail the features in different categories, such calling, text messaging, camera, MP3 abilities, navigation, web browsing, etc. This way, your review will be more thorough without being too confusing. It's a good idea to headline each category and to write succinct explanations for each part of the phone; a potential buyer won't linger too long for the advice.


Talk about what you like about the smartphone you're reviewing, how easy it is to use, what features in particular are of worthy note.

, Readers of your review will be more pleased with an honest, fair opinion of a popular smartphone than a highly biased or positive review of a particular device. Plus, it's a lot more trustworthy if your review is balanced. In addition, it can be really helpful for future designs of the phone and for customers to know the ways in which you think the phone could be improved. This helps to give customers a heads up on weaknesses that they can choose to manage around or perhaps prefer a different phone instead.


Look at the advertising blurb accompanying the smartphone. Consider whether you think the smartphone in question lives up to the hype or whether there are aspects that you don't agree with. It will be important to compare your experience with the advertised promises.
Even summarizing the review with the best ""pro"" and the most annoying or disabling ""con"" can be a good overall summary for readers. For example, ""Pros: This smartphone has a battery that outlasts any of its competitors in the same niche. Cons: Its price and the limited color range.""

, Be sure to include photos detailing all of the features described. If you are recording a video review, try filming with a high-definition camcorder for optimum viewing because the clearer it is, the better.

, At this stage, it is helpful to conclude by giving your overall impression of the smartphone and your experience of using it, along with encouragement to try it. It helps to clarify if you think the smartphone will only be of use to some people (such as a business person or a teenager, etc.), or whether you think the phone is ideal for anyone; once again, that sort of conclusion is up to your opinion of its utility.


Post your review on a blog, on a review site, or anywhere else relevant and be sure to respond to comments made to you. Sometimes developers will also respond if your review has struck a chord, so it pays to monitor your review actively for a good period of time.

Consider resource availability when estimating task durations.,
Create and organize all your resources.,
Assign each work task to a resource.,
Check the resource allocation in the resource graph view.",How to Allocate Resources in Microsoft Project," This step is crucial but often overlooked. Resources must be considered during the construction of the schedule, not just afterwards. Pay special attention to concurrent tasks (those that happen at the same time) that use the same resources. For instance, you might rightly assume that both the interior and exterior walls of a building could be framed at the same time. If you only have 1 carpenter on the project though, this won't be possible.


Begin your task duration estimates by estimating the total number of man-hours needs to complete the task. By focusing on man-hours rather than total workdays, you take into account how many resources will be needed.;
, The best way to keep your resources organized is through the resource sheet. To access this sheet, click on the ""View"" menu and select ""Resource Sheet."" Make sure all of your resources have clear names, and make sure you at least specify the resource type.


�Work"" resources are the most useful, and should be used to categorize people who will spend time working on tasks. On a small project, this type of resource could refer to each team member by name. On a larger project, this resource could specify different subcontractors.
�Material"" resources should refer to materials that get used up during work, such as lumber, nails, and gasoline.
�Cost"" resources should be used to track resources that have a clear cost rate attached to them. The daily rate for renting a crane or a field trailer could be tracked as a cost resource.

, After creating the schedule in the Gantt chart view, you will need to specify which resource(s) is associated with each task. To do this, find the task's line in the left panel, and click the cell in the ""Resource"" column. A drop-down menu will appear listing all the resources you have created. Select the appropriate resource; for instance, a task called ""Wire light fixtures"" could be assigned the resource ""Electrician.""

, After creating your schedule and assigning resources, you can check for over-allocation. To do this, click on ""View"" and select ""Resource Graph."" You will be allowed to select each resource and view its allocation throughout the project. Each workday is shown along the horizontal axis, and resource usage is expressed as a percentage along the vertical axis.


Any point at which a resource exceeds 100 percent usage represents an over-allocation (meaning the resource can't possibly perform all the tasks assigned to it in the given time). Over-allocation is represented in red. To remedy this, increase the task durations, assign more resources to the tasks, or shift concurrent tasks to create less overlap.
Any point at which the resource is being used very little may point to inefficient under-allocation. Consider decreasing the task durations or using fewer total resources.

Identify the business needs.,
Research how a restaurant management or a Point of Sale (POS0 software will benefit your restaurant.

,
Make a list of popular software available to you.

,
Always ask for a demonstration of the software system prior to purchasing one for your organization.

,
Buy the hardware on which the software will be installed.,
Call the software provider to install software on your system since it will require some technical steps.

,
It is always better to ask for training from the software sellers.",How to Automate Your Restaurant," For most restaurant owners it is possible to manage without using any software. However, using one is always preferred and helpful. The first step is to identify the business needs. What does the revenue stream consist of and what major inventories are being processed to prepare food items? Such questions might help to identify the real business requirement.;
,,,, Remember to buy it in consultation with the software vendor.

,, Training your employee will help you to handle operations through the restaurant management and/or a Point of Sale software.

Consider paying the ETF.,
Cancel the contract and pay the fee.,
Think about selling your current phone.",How to Get out of a Cellular Service Contract7," Sometimes it just pays to fork over the ETF, and be done with the aggravation. If you’ve made up your mind that this is the route you want to take, find out the exact amount you owe by contacting the carrier directly.

, Notify the carrier of your decision. You may have to do this by phone, so a terribly distraught customer service representative can try to convince you to ease his or her pain by staying with the company. Maybe they’ll offer you an incentive to stay, like a phone upgrade even if you’re not due for one. If an incentive doesn’t do it for you, find out how the ETF will be paid, cancel, and bid the carrier farewell.

, You’re probably planning on moving to a new carrier, and taking advantage of one of their phone offers (especially since trying to convert your current phone to a new carrier’s system can be a hassle, at best). If that’s the case, think about selling your phone as a way of offsetting some of the ETF you had to pay. Companies like Gazelle.com and Glyde.com handle these types of transactions."

People power.",How to Make Your Software Releases Much Better," You need to know what your problem is in order to fix it. You will need to get the key members of your team to do a walkthrough with you (and possibly the people helping you with you release system problem) on the current release management process so that you can know exactly where the problems are.;
, You will need to establish a regular release cycle for your software. This has the benefit of creating a routine, which will align team activities and allow you to develop a realistic schedule that will ensure you gain and retain customer confidence. Just remember that your release cycle relies on when you can deliver a quality product, not on when your customer wants it.

, The thing about implementing change is that you need to take it slow. Implement some small ideas and processes that do not need a lot of bureaucratic approval and will not take too much time, training and effort to be accepted by the development and testing team. This way, you can see if these ideas really work and make adjustments to suit your specific team.

, Make sure that the necessary infrastructure is ready to facilitate the deployment and use of the software, before the software engineers are through with the product. Provide the engineers with all that they need to develop the product for instance a salesforce API. Clear up any hardware, licensing, storage issues and any other infrastructural hiccups, and fix any missing links to make sure that when the product is ready, there will be due deployment.

, Automate as many processes as you can so that you can free up manpower for the main business of software development and standardize the processes so that you are consistent at each point of development every time.

, With regard to the release cycles, the development and test teams need to be involved in determining when the product would be ready for deployment. Make sure that the entire team understands what it needs to do, when and why so that everyone is on the same page. Synchronizing your efforts will ensure that you streamline your software release management process.

, The thing about working with people is that if you really want excellent work done then you need to care about them. Make sure every member of the team feels acknowledged, respected and valued. Once you develop great team dynamics, then you will easily improve release management system.

This guide is for installing the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for browsers.,
Visit the Java home page.,
Start the installer.,
Follow the installation steps.,
Test the installation.",How to Install Java," For instructions on installing the developer tools (JDK), see this guide. Java is also different than JavaScript. If you need to enable JavaScript, see this guide.;
, Java installs system files which all browsers use, so there is no need to follow special instructions for specific browsers. You can get to the Java installer from the Java home page.


The Java installer will download files during the installation process. If you need to install Java on a device without a network connection, download the Offline Installer, available on the Manual Downloads page.
Depending on your browser settings, you may need to accept the Java installation download before it begins.
For Mac OS X 10.6, Java comes preinstalled. For OS X 10.7 and above, Java is not preinstalled. You will need OS X 10.7.3 or newer to install Java. You must also be using a 64-bit browser such as Safari or Firefox (i.e. not Chrome).For Linux, Java needs to be downloaded, manually installed, and then enabled in order to work. See this guide for detailed instruction on installing Java in Linux.

, Once the installer has finished downloading, run it to begin the installation. On OS X, double-click the .dmg file to begin the installation.


Close any browser windows before starting the installation, as they will need to be restarted anyway after installation is complete.

, Read each screen of the installation program. Java will try to install extra software such as browser toolbars unless you uncheck the boxes. If you don't want your browser changed, make sure to read each screen carefully.

, After you have finished installing Java, test the installation to make sure everything went OK. You can find the Java testing applet on the Java website, or by searching for ""java test"" and selecting the first result.


You will need to allow the plugin to run, and you may be asked multiple times before it can load. This is because, in general, Java can be a dangerous tool which can grant others access to your computer if you are not careful. Always be sure you trust the website that you are running Java applets on."
