Specify the location of the Android SDK.",How to Install Eclipse and Setup ADT," Eclipse and ADT are built on the Java platform, so in order to run them you will need the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK). The JDK is available for free from the Oracle website. Make sure to download the version appropriate for your operating system.


If you don’t have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed, Eclipse will fail to open.;
, Before you can install your Android-specific tools, you will need to download the Eclipse IDE, which is what the Android tools are built on top of. Eclipse is available for free from the Eclipse Foundation.


For most Android developers, Eclipse Standard package will contain everything you need.

, Eclipse will be downloaded as a ZIP file. Simply extract the ZIP file into a folder of your choosing, such as C:\. The ZIP file contains a subdirectory called “eclipse”, so extracting the file into the C:\ drive will result in the folder “C:\eclipse”.


Many users report issues with using Windows’ built-in unzipping program. When extracting the file, use an alternative program such as 7-Zip or Winzip.

, Since Eclipse isn’t “installed” in the traditional sense, you might want to create a shortcut to it so that you can quickly access the program from your desktop. This will also allow to easily specify the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that you will be working with.Right-click on eclipse.exe and select Send To. Click “Desktop (create shortcut)”. This will create a new shortcut on your desktop that will point to the eclipse.exe file.

, If you have multiple JVMs installed on your computer, you can set Eclipse to always use a specific one. This can prevent errors from occurring if your machine switches default JVMs through other programs.


To specify your installation of the JDK, add the following line to your Eclipse shortcut, replacing the path with the location of your javaw.exe file:-vm C:\path\to\javaw.exe, This is available for free from the Android website. Select the “Use an Existing IDE” option to download just the SDK. You can download an ADT bundle that includes Eclipse and comes preconfigured, but this method ensures that you have the latest version of Eclipse.


After installing the SDK, the SDK Manager should open automatically. Leave it open for the next step.

, Before you can begin using the SDK for development, you will need to add the packages you want to use to your Android SDK. In the SDK Manager, you should see a list of all the available packages for download. For basic development, be sure to grab the following:


The most recent Tools package in the Tools folder.
The most recent version of Android (This is the first Android folder in the list).
The Android Support Library, which can be found in the Extras Folder.
Click Install when finished. The files will be downloaded and installed.

, You will be installing ADT from within the Eclipse program. If Eclipse won’t start, ensure that you have specified your JVM (see previous section).

, The ADT plugin will need to be downloaded within the Eclipse program directly from the Android developers’ repository. You can quickly add that repository to your Eclipse installation.


Click Help. Select Install New Software. This will open the Available Software screen, with a list of your available software from the repository you have selected.

, This is located to the right of the “Work with” field. Clicking this button will open the “Add Repository” dialog box. Here you will enter the information to download the ADT plugin.


In the “Name” field, enter “ADT Plugin”
In the “Location” field, enter “https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/”
Click OK.
Check the “Developer Tools” box. Click Next to display the list of tools that will be downloaded. Click Next again to open the license agreements. Read them and then click Finish.
You may get a warning that the validity of the software cannot be established. It is OK to ignore this warning.

, Once the tools have finished downloading and installing, restart Eclipse to complete the installation. Upon restarting, you will be greeted with the “Welcome to Android Development” window.

, IN the Welcome screen, click “Use existing SDKs” and then browse for the directory of the SDK you installed at the beginning of this section. Once you click OK, your basic ADT installation is complete."

Choose a free Media Player that supports MKV files.,
Download and install the media player.,
Launch VLC.,
Open your video file.",How to Play MKV Files1," A wide variety of free media players are available for download online. Some are quite well-made - better, in some ways, even, then the default media players included with your computer. Others aren't well-made. Different media players offer different options and features for video playback - in this case, what you want is the most-recent version of a well-made, easy-to use player that can decode and play MKV files with a minimum of effort.


The VLC Media player (often called simply ""VLC"") is a free, widely-used player that meets all of these requirements (and more). The rest of the steps in this section will assume you've chosen VLC.
VLC isn't the only suitable player, however. You have many options when choosing MKV-compatible players, most of which function similarly to VLC. For instance, Media Player Classic (MPC) and MplayerX are both great choices.;
, Though the rest of this section assumes you've chosen the VLC player, this step will be very similar for nearly all media players. Find a download link online for the free media player of your choice. Be sure that the site is reputable and secure - Cnet.com is a safe, widely-used site that contains download links for a wide range of software, including the VLC Player. If you use Cnet, simply use ""VLC Player"" into the search bar for relevant results. Download the player, then run its installation app and follow the onscreen instructions to install it on your computer.


For ease of use, you may want to create a shortcut for the player on your desktop. This makes it easy to locate your new player on your computer - a great choice if you're not tech-savvy.
Be sure to download the correct version of VLC for your operating system. VLC has separate versions for both Windows and Macs.

, Once VLC is installed, launch the player. You may be required to confirm the player's ability to access information from the internet. You should see a black window with an orange traffic cone icon in the center. From here, you can access all of VLC's functions, including playing videos.

, Click the ""Media"" button in the toolbar at the top of the VLC window. Next, select ""Open File."" Locate and select your MKV file. In the vast majority of cases, your MKV should play perfectly fine!


Note - the above instructions are for the Windows version of VLC.
Though VLC should play the majority of MKV files without any problems, issues have been reported for MKV files that includes a video compression format called RealVideo. In this case, you may need to use a RealVideo-compatible player.

Understand the advantages and disadvantages of codec packs.,
Download and install an appropriate codec pack.,
Play the MKV file in your preferred media player.",How to Play MKV Files2," A codec (short for coder-decoder) is a computer program used to encode or decode any sort of digital media. In this case, we need a codec that will allow us to decode and play MKV files. Luckily, a variety of free ""codec packs"" exist online that supply codecs for not just MKV files, but a large selection of other types of files. These codec packs have several advantages and disadvantages over other methods of playing MKV files.


Advantages: As mentioned above, the types of codec packs we're interested in usually contain codecs for a wide variety of video format types - not just MKV files. This means that you'll probably be able to play many different kinds of video files after you download and install the codec pack. If you get your video files from many different sources, using a comprehensive codec pack may be an appealing option because it will ""cover"" most of the file types you'll come across.
Disadvantages: Codec packs are the ""brute force"" method of playing a stubborn video file. They will usually work, but if you're only trying to play one type of video file, you're downloading a lot of codecs that you don't need, which means you'll be basically wasting hard drive space. Additionally, if something eventually goes wrong and you find yourself unable to play certain video files, it can be difficult to tell which part of the codec pack is causing the problem.

, If you've decided to go the route of codec packs, you will want to download one that is safe, well-regarded, and, most importantly, includes support for MKV files. The official Matroska website recommends the Combined Community Codec Pack (CCCP)for Windows computers. Another good choice for PCs is the K-Lite Codec pack, available for free download on codecguide.com. Download the codec pack of your choice, then run its installation file, following the on-screen prompts.


Macs may have more success simply by downloading a compatible media player. Perian, an open source project that adds expanded video functionality (including MKV support) to the Quicktime Player will probably work, but, unfortunately, the project hasn't been updated since 2012. It's worth noting that on the Perian site, the developers recommend several media players as alternatives: Niceplayer, VLC, and MPlayer OS X.Note - before installing a new codec pack, it's a good idea to uninstall any old or out-of-date packs you already have on your machine to help avoid compatibility issues.

, Once the codec pack is installed, you should be able to play your video file in most, if not all, media players. Most codec pack developers will recommend a free, frequently-updated option (like VLC, Media Player Classic, etc.) However, even your computer's default players (Windows Media Player, etc.) should work.


Immediately after installation, you may be prompted to adjust ""filter"" options. Unless you're tech-savvy and understand what you're doing, it's usually not a good idea to adjust the default options.
If you find that you still have difficulty playing a certain file, try playing other files of the same type. If you can successfully play these, the issue may be that the file itself is corrupted or otherwise unplayable.

Use a free MKV diagnostic program.,
Use a third-party diagnostic program.,
Download a RealVideo-compatible player.",How to Play MKV Files3," Despite the best efforts of the creators, MKV files can be terribly tricky to get to play, especially on PCs. Developers at Matroska know this, which is why they have created a tool specifically to diagnose issues with MKV playback. This tool, called matroskadiag.exe, analyzes your MKV file and determines whether you have the right codecs and filters installed to be able to play the video. This diagnostic program is available for free download on the official Matroska website, matroska.org.

, The official diagnostic tool described above isn't the only tool on the market for analyzing your video files. Many free diagnostic tools aren't just limited to analyzing one file format, either. One comprehensive third-party option for diagnosing video playback issues is KC Software's VideoInspector, which is available for free download on afterdawn.com.

, The media players and codec packs listed above should solve most MKV playback issues. However, one common, persistent issue with MKV playback that even the solutions above may not be able to fix has to do with something called RealVideo. Realvideo is a type of video compression format. Basically, it's possible for MKV files to be compressed in the RealVideo format, and, in this case, you may encounter issues when attempting the normal playback options above. Unfortunately, to play MKV files that contain RealVideo, you'll need to download a special, compatible player. The official RealVideo player is called, fittingly, RealPlayer, and it is available for free download from real.com.


Alternatively, if you don't want to download the official player, you can also download a free third-party player that plays RealVideo files. Real Alternative, available for free download from a variety of sources online, is such a player.

Use a grid tool to align page elements.,
Select a single visual element on which your readers can focus.,
Apply the Golden Ratio to your layout design.,
Make your margins different sizes.,
Always include a headline or title.",How to Use a Better Layout for Brochures," The human eye is very sensitive to alignment. If the outer edge of a graphic does not line up with the outer edge of the brochure, a reader may be distracted away from the brochure. A grid tool can help you make sure your elements are aligned. If you are using Word, use the Ruler feature.;
, You can have more than one graphical element on each page of your brochure. This just means you should focus on one centerpiece image and all other elements should support or draw the reader to this point of focus. In a newspaper article, this single visual element would be the main article picture.

, This principle can also be remembered as the Rule of Thirds. Divide the page into thirds both vertically and horizontally. Where the lines cross are excellent points on your page for important visual elements like an image or even a headline. Use the other lines to line up body text, graphics, or other page elements as you have opportunity. Note that a tri-fold brochure automatically incorporates the Golden Ratio, but you cannot put too much content along the fold so use the horizontal lines across the page for important graphical elements.

, A general rule is that your footer margin should be the largest, the outside or right-side margin should be the second largest, followed by the top margin, with the smallest margin being the inside or left-side margin. This creates an interesting visual arrangement on the page. Perfectly centered tends to be uninteresting. On a tri-fold brochure, your inside margin will change. For example, when the brochure is fully opened, the left panel content should be closest to the fold, shifted towards the right. On the right panel, content should also be nearest the inside of the brochure, so shift the content to the left., The eye of the reader will look at the image first, followed by a headline. Without a headline, the reader will simply move on. You want your readers to read the rest of the brochure and eventually make a purchase. Use headlines to draw them to the rest of the text and ideally, a completed sale.

Set up all the accounts in your exact business name, or something very close to it, if they are not available.;
, The number 1 rule in social media is consistency. You cannot attract and maintain customer interaction if you do not update your status often with interesting content.


Appoint someone who knows the differences, strengths and weaknesses of all these social channels. For example, Twitter accounts should be text-based and conversation-oriented. Facebook is great for pictures and event marketing. LinkedIn content should be focused towards professionals, employment and press releases.

, More and more, companies are interacting with their customers on Facebook and Twitter, encouraging both problems and praise to be posted. Encourage customers to direct message the company accounts with customer service problems, questions, reviews and more, making sure your rep always responds in a timely, consistent manner.


Appoint someone who is talented at handling criticism. Most customers are savvy enough to know that there are always a few bad reviews in a mountain of good reviews, because mistakes are occasionally made. The mistake is not as important as how you react to it. Choose someone who can take criticism, offer a solution and turn it around to your advantage, rather than deleting the comment.

, Create a list of parameters in which they should feel comfortable to post, share and comment. Make sure they never post anything that is inappropriate or damages the company image.


If you do not feel your entire staff has either the Internet experience or a good grasp of using social media for business, invite individual employees to contribute. They may be paid for their time or they could be rewarded based on the popularity of their posts.

Create a new PHP file on your web server, and open it in your favorite text editor.,
Start your file by typing the open and close PHP tags with some space in between to work with.

,
Type this on a new line between the two PHP tags.

,
Whenever you want to create a function, always start on a new line with the word ""function"", hit the space bar and type its unique and descriptive name followed by two parenthesis, then type an open curly brace.,
Now type this code inside the curly braces.,
Type the code below on a new line after the closing curly brace of the function.,
Now type this code on a new line.,
Add three lines of code to your script.

,
Add these before any other code at the beginning of your function.

,
Add this line right after the closing curly brace of your function.

,
For sake of clarity here is the entire code sample.

,
A variable declared inside a function cannot be used outside the function.,
Play around with functions!",How to Create and Call PHP Functions,";
,,, In this case i chose to call the function ""my_function,"" in your scripts you should give your functions better names.
You may have noticed the ""$input"" variable in between the parenthesis. This is called an argument. It is the input that the function will return as an output. PHP functions can have multiple arguments, as long as they are separated by commas. Observe the example above.

,
The command ""return"" does exactly what is says, it returns the output. In this case the output is $input minus two, times 10. Take note that once the output has been returned the function is exited, and no code after it will be executed.

,
This line of code is making a call to ""my_function."" In this case we will give my_function an input of 8, and PHP will echo the returned output value. Test the script, you will get a value of 60.

,
The magic of coding with functions is the ability to reuse and recycle the same code over and over. We are now calling my_function two more times and reusing its code. Also notice how the in the code above the call to my_function is treated like a number. Always treat calls to functions as the datatype you expect to get back (whether it is a number, string, boolean, or resource). Test the script, you will get a value of 60 followed by a value of 260.

,,,,, For example if i tried to echo $input outside of the function, PHP would throw an error because i have not created that variable outside of the function. So note that variables created in a function (including the arguments) can only be used inside that function. Variables declared outside of a function can only be used outside of functions (unless you use them as an argument of course).
That said, there is a command that allows you, in a function, to use a variable created outside a function. That command is ""global"", in the code above we use global with the variable $num so we could change it or access its value in our function. If you test the code, you will get the values 50 and 240.

, Build your own function that is really useful. Use them in your future PHP projects. Using functions can improve code modularity and the size of the overall project.

You may also want to sign up to receive the analytic information that Foursquare gathers about the customers that walk through your door.

, Most marketing firms have found that people don't respond well to constant ""pitching"" of new products. It is important to post educational articles, cross-promote partners, explore company culture, post industry articles, post pictures and videos, and ask your fans their opinions.

, This can be a printable in-store coupon or a promo code for your website, but both will allow you to give your loyal customers something, track how popular it is and post on your accounts. Announce your large contests on your website, social media account and by email at once to increase its likelihood of success.


You may want to stagger promotions on Foursquare, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, so that you can track what account is most useful to you. Each promotion should be slightly different so that people will want to follow more than 1 account. After 6 months to a year, you may be able to determine that only a few social media channels work well for your business, and you can cut back.

, Encourage people to ""like"" or ""follow"" you. If you have any upcoming promotions, then include a statement saying Internet-based coupons, promo codes or contests will be going on frequently.

, This works particularly well for musicians, film makers and event promoters. Allow your customers to access exclusive website content using a code that they can find on a social media channel.

, Social media provides you a chance to talk to your customers directly and publicly, and to show them that you care, an extremely important part of customer loyalty. Pay attention to the trending topics on the Internet and engage with your customers about what is important to them.

, Also, consider sending out simple survey questions asking what your customers want in the future. You may find this to be a cheap and effective way to do market research and show you care about your customer's opinions.

, Most businesses try to encourage people to refer their friends or family. Give out a code that users can pass on to friends, in order to enjoy exclusive content, enter a contest or get a discount, and then track your rate of referrals through an analytics program on your website.

, Although this may not be evident when you first start, see what customers respond well to and post according to what's successful. Develop a strong voice and personality that is consistent with your company's motto.

The process of creating a variable is also known as declaring a variable.,var age;

,
called age.,
You can declare more than one variable by separating each with a comma and still use one var command, as:

,var state, city, zip, country;

,
When you declare a variable, keep the following JavaScript restrictions in mind to a variable name:

,
A variable name cannot be one of the reserved words in JavaScript.,
The first letter of a variable name must be a letter or an underscore (_).,
A variable name cannot contain any space characters.,
Remember that variable names are case-sensitive.,
Also, keep your variable names meaningful.,Declaring variable without var command

,
As noted above, to explicitly declare (create) a variable in JavaScript we use the var command.,age = 50;

,
declares a variable called age and signs he integer value 50 to this variable.

,
The following shows some more examples of variables being created when a value is assigned to a variable:

,<script language=""javascript"">

,
sum = x = y = 0; // declares three variables and each is set to 0.

,</script>

,
Alternatively, you may declare and assign the values using the var command:

,<script language=""javascript"">

,
var sum, x, y; // declares multiple variable with the var command.

,sum = x = y = 0; // sets each variable to 0

,
</script> Datatypes in Javascript are :


String
Number
Boolean
Function
Array
Object

",How to Declare a Variable in Javascript," When you declare a variable, you tell the computer to reserve some memory for your program to store some data. To declare a variable in JavaScript, use the var command. For instance, the following command creates a variable;
,, With the above command, computer will reserve some memory and allow you to store to or retrieve from that memory with the name you chose, age. Remember at this point our variable age is null or has a garbage value–whatever computer's memory slot happens to hold.

,,,, Examples of reserved words in JavaScript include var, or document.write. Basically, reserved words have a specific purpose in JavaScript, they cannot be used as a variable name.

, age, year, _month are all valid variable names. However, 11month, 9_ are not valid variable names.

, If your variable consists of more than one word, separate each word with an underscore (i.e., first_name, last_name) or use camel case (i.e., firstName, lastName).

, In JavaScript, a variable named first_name is considered different from first_Name or FIRST_name.

, Avoid using a variable name such as k, l, m, z, or a because you may have hard time figuring out what each variable represent in the future or in a long program.

,, In JavaScript, however, you can also declare variables implicitly by using the assignment operator to assign a value to the new variable. For example,

Import needed modules.,
Create a new thread.,
Create thread process.,
Create the global variables.,
Create the main server process.,
Save your work.",How to Write a Server with Python2," The two modules needed for this code are “socket” and “threading”. This can be done by typing on the first line “from socket import *” and on the next line “import threading”.

, This will handle matching 2 clients up with each other. Threads are processes that can be running while the main program runs. Type exactly like how the figure shows. This will set up the variables in the thread so that they can be called later.

, For clients to communicate directly you need to send to each the other’s information, which includes their IP address and which port they are using. To do this you must create a socket object which can be done with “variableName = socket(AF_NET, SOCK_DGRAM)”. This will create a socket object that uses the UDP protocol. Next Bind the socket to your IP address with a certain port number with “roomSocket.bind((‘ ‘, self.port))” The blank area stands for your own pc IP address within your local area network and self.port assigns the port number that is included when you call this thread. The last thing you have to do with this socket is send information through it. Since this is a UDP socket you simply must know the IP and port of the computer you are sending information to, the syntax for sending is “socketName.sendto(IP, port)""

, For this step you will need to define several variables, which includes a user list, port numbers, client count, clients for the thread, and the room ID. You will also need to create a socket so that your server can interact with the internet. This is done by creating a new socket object and binding it to your IP address with a certain port number. (The port number can be anything but it is usually something high to avoid having either another process using it or using reserved port numbers.)

, This will take in client address as well as start the thread created earlier. This includes waiting to receive data from the buffer and getting the client address and saving it to be used in the thread. The way to get information from your socket is to call by “socketName.recvfrom(1024)”, the number here is just the amount of bytes that gets read at a time. In this example we are storing it into a variable called userAddr, and once this happens you can save this address in the list that was created in step 4. The if statement will create a room thread if two people connect and will only create a room when two different connections happen.

, This should be done in a directory that is easy to get to so that it can be accessed easily for testing.

You can find out your computer name by right clicking on My Computer and going to properties.

, This should be in the same directory as the server code.

, Go to the start menu and in the search bar type in “cmd” and hit enter. Do this three times. The windows should look like this.

, You will have to type the exact path when using the command window. You will need to run the server code first on one command window and then the test client code on the other two. If everything was successful you will get something these messages in your window.

Plan your program.,
Write the code.,
Calculate the mean.,
Display the result.",How to Write a Program in Java to Calculate the Mean," Planning your program is essential. Think about where your program will be used. Is the program going to deal with very big numbers? If yes, you may want to consider using data types like long instead of int.


Try to calculate the mean of a few numbers manually. This will help you understand your program.;
, To calculate the mean, you'll need the following parameters:


The sum of all the inputs provided by the user; and,
The total number of inputs provided by the user.

For example, if the sum of the inputs = 100, and the total number of inputs = 10, the mean = 100 / 10 = 10



Therefore, the formula to calculate the mean, or the average, is:Mean = Sum of all inputs / Total Number of inputs

To get these parameters (inputs) from the user, try using the Scanner function in Java.

You'll need to get multiple inputs from the user for each of the terms you want to find the mean of. Try using a loop for this. In the sample code below, a for loop is used. You can try using a while loop too.



, Using the formula given in the previous step, write the code to calculate the mean. Make sure that the variable used for storing the value of mean is of type float. If not, the answer may not be correct.


This is because, the float data-type is 32 bit single precision that even considers decimals in mathematical calculations. Thus, using a float variable, the answer for a mathematical calculation like 5 / 2 (5 divided by 2) will be 2.5

If the same calculation (5 / 2) if done using an int variable, the answer will be 2.
However, the variables in which you stored the sum and number of inputs can be int. Using a float variable for the mean will automatically convert the int to float; and the total calculation will be done in float instead of int.



, Once the program has calculated the mean, display it to the user. Use the System.out.print or System.out.println (to print on a new line) function, in Java, for this.

You must add the paths to the the binaries for MinGW and MSYS tools to your PATH.",How to Run Program C/C++ Program in Netbeans,",,,,,,,, After installing the Plug-In, you then require a compiler for compiling C/C++ Codes. The NetBeans C/C++ module has been tested with compilers from Cygwin and MinGW. If you install both Cygwin and MinGW, be careful to keep their installation locations completely separate and do not mix tools from Cygwin and MinGW in one tool collection in the IDE. Install the GNU gcc and g++ compilers, make, and gdb debugger from cygwin.com as follows.

, Note: The bits of Windows OS, Java, and NetBeans IDE installed on your machine must match. For example, if you are running the 64-bit version of Windows operating system, 64-bit Java and 64-bit Cygwin (that is setup-x86_64.exe) are required to be installed.

Add the path to the cygwin-directory\bin directory to the Path variable, and click OK. By default, cygwin-directory is C:\cygwin (for 32 bit Cygwin distribution) or C:\cygwin64 (for 64 bit Cygwin distribution). Directory names must be separated with a semicolon. Your edited path should look something like %SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;C:\Program Files\QuickTime\QTSystem;C:\cygwin\bin
Click OK in the Environment Variables dialog and the System Properties dialog.
See Verifying the Installation to verify that the tools were installed correctly for the NetBeans IDE.

Get a CPP compiler.,
Open a new project file, and choose ""console application"" on your compiler.,
If your compiler is a Microsoft Visual CPP, then first enter the following on the first line - #Insert ""stdafx.h"".,
On the next line (if you've entered the previous statement, otherwise this would be the first line), enter #include <iostream> .,
Go to the next line to enter your function, the set of instructions that defines the structure of your program and tells the compiler what to do, in this case to display the message ""Hello World!"",
Go to the next line and use a flower bracket ""{"", to mark the beginning of this main () function.

See this guide for more details on writing a game design document.;
, Draw a basic layout of what you want the screens to look like. These don't have to be very detailed, but you should at least have an idea about where the various elements will be placed on the screen. These will be incredibly useful later when you start building the interface for your game.

, Traditionally, you would need to learn how to code in ActionScript 3 in order to create Flash games. While you can still do that, there are programs available that can make game creation much easier to learn that require no coding experience. Some of the most popular options for making games include:


Stencyl - This is a newer tool that allows you to build games using objects and logic scripts. These games can then be converted into Flash projects and uploaded to any website that supports Flash games.
Construct 2 - As Flash gets older, it has started to be replaced by other means of creating games. One of the newest ways to create an online game is to use HTML5. Normally this requires a lot of coding knowledge, but Construct 2 allows you to create games using objects and scripting, much like Stencyl.
Flash Builder - This is the traditional method for creating Flash games. This requires a fair amount of ActionScript knowledge, but it is one of the easier languages to learn the basics of. Flash Builder costs money, but you can use the open-source FlashDevelop program to get most of the same functionality.

, Stencyl is a game creation program that doesn't require any coding knowledge. Instead, you can use a variety of logic tools to manipulate objects in the game.


Stencyl can be used for free if you only want to publish your game online. The free version will have a Stencyl logo appear at the beginning. If you get the paid version, you can publish to other platforms.

, When you start Stencyl, you will be shown a list of your games. There will be several example games on the list that you can look at to see how they work. To start working on your own game, click the box with the dotted line labeled ""Click here to create new Game"".

, There are several kits that contain premade assets and objects that can help you get your game up and running quickly. Select a kit if you'd like, or select ""Blank Game"" if you plan on making your own.


You can download kits that other users have made online.

, Before you start creating your game, you'll need to enter a few pieces of information.


Name - This is the name of your game. You can change this later to whatever you'd like.
Screen size - This is size of your game screen, and is very important as it will affect the art that you use. Since people will most likely be playing your game within their web browser, the screen size doesn't have to be very big. Try Width: 640 px Height: 480 px. This is a good size to get started with.

, When you first load your new game, you will be taken to the Dashboard. This is where you can see all of the scenes for your game and access any resources. You can also change your game settings from here. You will be spending most of your time working in the Dashboard.


Scenes - This is the main window of the Dashboard, and shows the actual game and all the assets. Your game will be a collection of scenes.
Resources - This is the list of all the objects and assets in your game. it includes actors, backgrounds, fonts, scenes, logic, sounds, and tilesets. The resources are organized in a tree on the left side of the screen.
Settings - The Game and Settings options allow you to adjust how the mechanics of your game works, including controls, gravity, collisions, loading screens, and more.

, An actor is any object that moves or can be interacted with in the game (player, enemy, doors, etc.). You will need to create an actor for each object in your game. To create an actor, click the ""Actor Types"" option in the Resources menu. Select the actor you want from the list (the list is determined by the kit you chose).


Assign the actor to a Group (Player, Enemy). This will help determine the collision properties of the actor. Select your actor to open the Actor Editor. Click the Properties tab, and then choose the appropriate group from the drop-down menu.
Add behaviors (jumping, stomping, walking). Behaviors are what allow your actor to perform actions. Click the Behaviors tab, and then click the ""+ Add Behavior"" button in the lower-left corner. Select a behavior (such as ""Walking"") from the list, and then click ""Choose"".
Set the controls. If you are creating a player character, then you'll probably want to allow the player to move it. When you add the Walking behavior, you will be taken to the Walking attributes screen. You can use the drop-down menus to choose what keys will move the actor left and right. You can assign animations as well if the kit you are using contains any.
You can add multiple behaviors to customize what an actor can do.

, The scene is what the player sees when playing the game. It is the background, as well as any objects and actors that are visible. To create a new scene, click the Scenes option in the Resources tree, and then click the dashed box. Give your new scene a name to continue.


Background - Your scene will be sized automatically, so you don't need to worry about that at the moment. You can choose to use a color as a background, which will have tiles placed over it. You can choose from a solid color or a gradient. Click ""Create"" when you're finished. This will open the Scene Designer.
Place tiles - The tileset included in your kit will be loaded on the right side of the window. Click the Pencil tool in the left menu, and then click the tile that you want to use. You can then place the tile onto your scene. Click and drag with the mouse to place multiple tiles.
Placing actors - Click the Actors tab above your tileset to switch to your available actors. You must have created them previously for them to appear in this list. Click the actor you want to place, and then click where on the scene you want it to appear. If you hold down ⇧ Shift, the actor will snap to the grid.
Adding gravity - Click the ""Physics"" tab at the top of the window, and then enter in a value into the ""Gravity (Vertical)"" field. Entering 85 will simulate real-world gravity.

, After you've created a scene and placed some actors, you can test the game out. Click the ""Test Game"" button at the top of the screen to play what you have so far. You can use the keys you set when creating your actors to control your player character.


Find any aspects that don't work, and try to fix them. For example, are the enemies behaving correctly? Can you defeat your enemies? Are there are any platforms that are unreachable or chasms that can't be crossed? Return to to the relevant area of your game editor to fix any of the problems you find. This may take a little while, but the end result will be a much more fun and playable game.

, Now that you have a working, playable first scene, it's time to start building the whole game. Add more levels and challenges, and keep testing your additions to ensure that they're fun and working properly.

, If you are going to be uploading the game to a site that hosts Flash games, or uploading to your own site, you'll probably want to enable ""Site Locking"". This will prevent your game from being played if it's not on the allowed list of sites.


Open ""Game Settings"" from your ""Resources"" tree. Select the ""Loader"" section. Enter the sites that you want to allow into the ""Site Lock"" field, separated by a comma with no space. For example, newgrounds.com,kongregate.com.
While on this screen, enter your home page into the ""Your Home Page"" field, if you have one. This will let players who play your game get linked to your site.

, Once you're satisfied with your game, you can export it into the Flash format. This will let you upload the game to a site that hosts Flash games, or to your own website. Click Publish select Web and then click Flash. Save the file to an easy-to-find location on your computer.

, Once you have your Flash (.SWF) file, you can upload it to the host of your choice. There are a variety of sites online that host Flash games, and some may even let you make money from ad revenue with your game. You can also upload your game to your own website, but you'll want to ensure that you have the bandwidth to cater to players if the game gets popular.


See this guide for uploading your game to your own web site.
If you want to upload your game to a site like Newgrounds or Kongregate, you will need to create an account and then go through the upload process for the site. The terms and conditions will vary from site to site.
If you want to publish your game to the Stencyl Arcade, you can do so from within the Stencyl Program. Click Publish select Stencyl and then click Arcade. The game will be automatically uploaded, so make sure you're happy with the name before doing this. Stencyl Arcade has an 8 MB file size limit., This program allows you to create HTML5 games with very little coding. You will have to assign some variables, but this is all done through menus with no actual coding required.


Construct 2 is free, though some features are limited unless you upgrade. The free version cannot publish to any other platforms than HTML5.

, When you first start Construct 2, you will be greeted with a Welcome menu. Click ""New Project"" link to begin a new game. There are also a couple of included examples that you can use to see how basic games are created.


When creating a new project, you will be given a list of templates. For your first project, you'll probably want to start with an empty project. This will allow you to get a hang of the basics without templates getting in the way.

, In the left frame of the project window, you will see a series of items in the Properties frame. You can use this to set your screen size and enter in your game and company information.

, Double-click the layout. Select ""Tiled background"" from the General section. Click on your layout to place the background. This will open the background editor. You will need to create your own using image editing software, or download textures from a variety of locations online.


Set background to the size of the layout. Do this by selecting the background object and changing the size in the Properties frame.
Change layer name and lock it. You'll want to lock the layer to prevent accidentally moving it while placing other objects. Click the ""Layers"" tab on the right side of the screen. Select the layer, and click the Pencil icon. Name the layer ""Background"", and then click the ""Padlock"" button to lock the background.

, In the Layers tab, click the ""+"" button to create a new layer. Rename it to ""Main"". This will be the layer that most of your game objects reside on. Ensure that the Main layer is selected before continuing.

, In Construct 2, your inputs will need to be added as objects to your game. They are invisible, and will enable keyboard and mouse use throughout the project.


Double-click your layout and select ""Mouse"" from the Input section. Do the same to insert the ""Keyboard"" object.

, It's time to start adding some game objects to your layout. Double-click the layout and select ""Sprite"" from the General section. Use the crosshairs to choose where you want to place the sprite. The image editor will open, allowing you to either load an existing sprite or create a new one.


When you select the sprites on your layout, the sprite's properties will load in the left frame. Change the sprite's name so that you can identify and refer to it easier.

, To add a behavior, click the object you want to add a behavior full to select it. Click the ""Add/edit"" link in the Behaviors section of the Properties frame. A list of available behaviors will appear.


Behaviors are pre-configured pieces of logic that allow you to quickly add functionality to your objects. You can choose from a wide variety of premade behaviors that can perform a wide range of functions. For example, to make the floor solid, give it the ""Solid"" behavior. To move the player-character in eight directions, give it the ""8 direction movement"" behavior.

, You can edit existing behaviors to customize the the way your objects work. You can change the values to change the speed, direction, and other properties.

, Events are a list of conditions, and are what drive the game. If conditions are met, event occurs. If conditions are not met, event doesn't occur. The event sheet is typically run around 60 times per second. Each time it runs is called a ""tick"".

, Double-click in the blank Event sheet. A list of available objects will appear. Select the object that you want to create an event for, or you can create a System event.


Select when the action occurs. After selecting the object, you will be asked to select when the event should occur. This can be based on other events or at certain times. ""Every tick"" is always.
Add an action. You will be asked to select one of your objects. Choose from a list of actions. For example, if you are making a top-down shooter, and want the player's character to always be looking at the mouse, you would create a ""Set angle toward position"" action on every tick set to the Player object. When asked for the coordinates, enter ""Mouse.X"" for X and ""Mouse.Y"" for Y. This will keep the player's ship always pointed towards the cursor.

, These are the backbone of your game. Adding and tweaking behaviors and events will help you make a unique and fun game that people will be clamoring to play. Experiment with different events to try to get the exact game you want.

, There are two types of variables in Construct 2: instance variables and global variables. These allow you to set custom values for your objects and game, such as health, time limits, scores, and more.


Instance Variables - Instance variables are variables assigned to single objects. They are used for things such as enemy and player health. You can add instance variables after selecting an object by clicking the ""Add / edit"" link in the Variables section of the Properties frame. Give the variable a name that can be referred to in an event, as well as an initial value.
Global Variables - Global variables are variables assigned to the whole game. They are used for things such as the player score. To create a global variable, open the Event sheet and right-click on a blank space. Click ""Add global variable"", give it a name that can be referred to in an event, and then enter an initial value.

, When creating an interface, it's usually best to do so on a new layer. This is because the interface rarely moves or changes, so it's good to have it on a locked layer. In the Properties frame for the new layer, set ""Parallax"" to 0. This will keep the layer from scrolling when the screen does.


Use Text boxes and variables to create your interface. You can set your text boxes to display remaining health, score, ammo or anything else the player would need to see on a regular basis.

, Now that you've got some objects on the screen with events and behaviors, you can start testing and adding content. Click the ""Play"" button at the top of the screen to build and test the game. Make note of anything that didn't work, and try to fix it so that your game will be playable and fun.

, If you're satisfied with your game, you can export it so that it can be uploaded to a website and played by anyone. To export the game, click the File menu and select Export. Save the project to a location that you can easily locate.

, There are several sites that allow you to upload HTML5 games for others to play. You can also add the game to your own website. See this guide for details on uploading the game to your own web site."

Prepare for the scrum sprint planning meeting.,
Hold the sprint planning meeting.,
Sprint!,
Hold the sprint review.,
Repeat.",How to Run a Sprint," You can prepare a project wall chart with columns and rows for posting the sprint backlog, task assignments and the progress until completion.


Get participant buy-in. Present the backlog of tasks (for developing a new system or enhancements to an existing system) to be achieved. Participants are the software development team (including the Programmers, Quality Assurance and Technical Writers), and the Product Owner (PO). The PO steers the sprint, and so if this contact person doesn't participate, the process is pointless (the PO is usually part of the development organization and has a customer of his/her own to understand and to please).
Sprint is a development period for a product X during which requirements for X do not generally change except to remove obstacles. While discussing X at the planning meeting, a ""new"" item/feature Y might be discovered that should have been, but was not, on the Product Backlog until then. Considered in a larger context Y may require a rethinking of the backlog. If it is not essential to the sprint, Y might be tossed back onto the backlog not part of this sprint.Prepare the product backlog -- the prioritized list of all features or changes yet to be made -- a project-level ""ToDoList"".
Organize the meeting - the product owner should host the meeting. A Scrum Master (not the PO) is the team member responsible to interface with the PO and the world outside the Scrum Sprint team, and to facilitate helping to coordinate with the PO so s/he can remove/resolve blockages that impede the team's work within the Scrum Sprint.;
, Select a sprint duration, that is, how long the sprint will be. One month is a common duration. Durations are sometimes as short as one or two weeks.


Identify which items/features from the product backlog make sense to work on first. Sometimes you want to pick the things you know involve the most technical risk, other times you may want to do the things that provide the highest business value. Some authors, like Kent Beck, suggest that you pick items for the first iteration that will allow you to build the whole system in a skeleton form. The product owner's input in this step is very important.
Scope out and communicate the sprint goals and commitments (at the beginning of each Sprint, the Team and the Product Owner agree on a selection of backlog items from the list that will make up the Sprint Goal).
Having selected which items to work on, your goal, the team next breaks the items down into tasks and sizes each task/feature. A feature might be split into multiple, smaller items for completion. In this way, the feature description and estimate are better defined, and sometimes new tasks/features are discovered.
Once the tasks for the sprint have been identified, the team evaluates whether they have the capacity to complete the work planned for the iteration. If there is too much work, it will be necessary to reduce the number of items from the product backlog the team will attempt to complete in the current sprint iteration. If there are not enough tasks to keep everyone busy, the product owner may want to add another item and its tasks from the product backlog to the sprint.

, Work on completing each item in the sprint backlog. For an item to be complete, it must be coded, tested and documented.


Each day, all the development staff (coders, testers, writers) gather for a short (usually 15 minutes) meeting, sometimes called a scrum. In this meeting, each member of the staff answers three questions very briefly (everyone listens to see how other tasks are progressing):

""What did I do on the project yesterday?""
""What am I going to do on the project today?""
""What obstacles or impediments am I facing on the project?"" -- the product owner may want to talk to some of the participants one-on-one, later.


Track your progress. How much work is complete on the tasks? How much work is left (does someone need help)? The team may want to adjust their focus based on how the sprint is going.

, Participants should include the development team and the product owner at a minimum. Having customers and other people interested in the project is a plus.


Set the context, remind the participants of which items were selected from the product backlog, and why.
Demonstrate what the team has accomplished.
The product owner provides feedback to the team on whether the features in this sprint match the product owner's expectations.
Get feedback from the other participants, too. Customer feedback is especially valuable.
If the team failed to meet any of the sprint goals, give status on those items.

, Use the feedback to decide how to improve sprint. Keep what works in sprints, and scrub what doesn't. You won't get better faster cheaper after one sprint. ""Action reveals the next step.""

Get lots of sleep.,
Take breaks.,
Be passionate about your project.,
Plan ahead.,
Get into a routine.,
Don't do it just for the money.,
Don't leave programming if you find it frustrating.",How to Love Programming," Because you will likely spend a lot of time in front of a computer when you are programming, it is advised to get lots of sleep before hand. Make sure you are awake and alert.;
, Looking at a computer screen for a long period of time puts strain on the eyes, and the mind. Take short breaks every hour or so. Within these breaks you can have a power nap, read a book, pay the bills, anything which does not involve electronics.

, If you are developing something which you are not passionate about, then there is something wrong. You must be determined to get through the project, and complete it.

, Try to know what you are going to do, and when. Organize your time, so when you sit down to begin programming, you know what you are going to do, whether it is improving UI, adding features or debugging.

, Try to create regular time periods to program in. You may even look forward to starting your days work. Don't leave a project to rot, unless you are leaving it forever, keep it active, otherwise you may begin to doubt it, which will in result lessen your chances of Step 3!

, You may be programming within work, or as a hobby, and very likely, you are doing it to get paid. Problem is, if you are really not enjoying it, then stop it, quit your job (be careful though) and do something that you enjoy.

, Programming becomes real problem sometimes. But don't ever leave it. For example:- If you leave your girlfriend for a small matter then you will feel regret later.

Ensure that there is sufficient time.,
Start planning early.",How to Tackle the Issues That Arise During Testing1," Sometimes the software testers do not get sufficient time for testing and the result is too much work crammed in too little time. Here the greatest casualty would obviously be quality since less time means less data for test results and quality metrics.;
, The solution for this is known to all but not at all put into practice and that is to start activities early so that adequate time is there for planning, design, testing, bug fixing, re-testing, and documentation.

Recognize that non-availability of resources is the next big issue.,
Do what you can to be prepared.",How to Tackle the Issues That Arise During Testing2," Sometimes there will be no hardware or tools to carry out testing and sometimes the shortage may be related to manpower.

, The Team Lead should be intuitive enough to expect these situations early on. And therefore should keep the back up ready so that the team doesn’t falter when these issues crop up.

Practice collaboration.,
Examine different test management systems.",How to Tackle the Issues That Arise During Testing3," In this age of global collaboration teams working in different geographic locations has become quite common. But this creates a lot of difficulties and one such issue is the inability to collaborate effectively.

, Well, nothing can be done about outsourcing as it is done to reduce costs so teams have no other choice but to work in different time zones. But now the different test management systems available in the market will definitely help you in this as most of it facilitates instant collaboration.

Make the requirements clear.,
Continue to preserve the clarity.",How to Tackle the Issues That Arise During Testing4," Testing is done not only to ensure quality but to validate whether the product that is being developed is in sync with the user’s requirements. So if the requirements are unclear, incomplete, general and less than perfect, problems are bound to happen.

, The quality of a product can be guaranteed only if the requirements are clear, complete, detailed, cohesive, attainable, and above all testable.


So it is highly essential that there should be flawless access to latest info and also business requirements.
Not only that, the team developing requirements and the team performing the test should work hand in hand so that the testing process goes off without any glitch and the expected results are obtained.

Make a conscious effort to ensure good work relationships.,
Keep the team informed.",How to Tackle the Issues That Arise During Testing5," The success of any testing effort depends upon the camaraderie between the testers and the developers. They should work as a team so that the expected results are obtained. If there is lack of communication between the two teams then it would severely affect the project schedule.

, The solution for this is that the testers should be kept informed about the build to be tested so that time is not wasted on wrong builds and also on defects that have been already fixed. The development team, on the other hand, should be informed about the defects that have been found so that it can be fixed immediately.

Understand basic commands.",How to Start Programming in Assembly," Before embarking upon any attempt to write code, it's always a good idea to first understand the language itself. There are a number of available resources ranging from textbooks to online guides.;
, For example, you'll want to know that an IDE (integrated development environment) provides a coding interface that handles things like text editing, debugging and compiling. You may also wish to better understand the way assembly actually works, like the fact that ""registers"" are what store the numbers associated with program code. Better understanding terminology will make it easier to learn the code-writing process itself.

, Remember that there are a number of programming languages, including some that provide far more functionality than assembly. There are, however, still a range of applications for which assembly is useful—from creating standalone executables for telephone firmware and air-conditioning control systems to developing certain processor-specific instructions.

, Assemblers like A86, NASM or GNU generally perform less complex functions and may be appropriate starting points for beginners. Every assembler works a bit differently, so subsequent instruction will work under the assumption that you're using MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)—a basic assembler that works with Windows operating systems. It uses x86 assembly language and Intel syntax., You can find the latest version of MASM contained in Visual Studio Enterprise 2015 (a comprehensive IDE including a number of tools), but the more basic original version (MASM 8.0). MASM 8.0 is free to download. Note that some assemblers—like Flat Assembler—can be used on multiple operating systems including Windows, DOS and Linux. Other assemblers—including Netwide Assembler (NASM) or GNU Assembler (GAS)—will work with Mac operating systems.


To download MASM 8.0, simply click on the Download button near the top of the page referenced in this step.
System requirements will vary depending on the assembler you select, but MASM 8.0 requires Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP Service Pack 2.
Installing MASM 8.0 will also require that you have previously downloaded and installed Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition.

, Simply perform a search for ""WinAsm download"" to find and install the WinAsm IDE, which generally works well with MASM. Other IDEs may be more appropriate depending on which programming language you're using. One popular alternative is RadAsm.

, You may begin the installation right away by clicking Run once the program has downloaded. Alternatively, you may wish to install it at a later date, in which case simply click Save. Upon clicking Run, MASM 8.0 will be installed to your “\bin” directory and labeled ml.exe., After WinAsm has been downloaded, you simply extract the files and copy them to your ""c:\program files\"" folder. You may also wish to place a shortcut on your desktop in order for easier access.

, First, launch the WinAsm program. If you've placed a shortcut on your desktop, simply double-click it. Note that this process will differ if you're using another assembler or IDE.

, Begin by clicking on WinAsm's Tools tab, selecting Options from said tab and finally selecting the Files and Paths tab. Then change the first three entries (referencing paths) to your MASM installation folder. When finished, click OK.


Upon adjusting information under the Files and Paths tab, the first three entries should read as follows. The Binary Path should be C:\Masm32\Bin; the Include Path should be C:\Masm32\Include; and the Library Path should be C:\Masm32\Bin.

, Begin by launching WinAsm and clicking on the File tab. Then select New Projects, and you'll see several options. Those options include Console Application and Standard EXE. If you're attempting created a GUI (graphical user interface) based application, for example, you'd select the latter.

, A typical structure might include a line defining architecture, a data section (section.data) including initialized data or constants, a bss section (section.bss) that declares variables and a text section (section.text) in which you place your actual program code. That final section always begins with a global _start declaration. Each sequence is known as a block of code.

, There are three kinds of statements in assembly language: executable instructions or instructions (these tell processors what to do via operation code), assembler directives or pseudo-ops (these describe assembly processes to the assembler) and macros (these serve as a text-substitution mechanism).

, For game making, it would be beneficial to learn one of the C languages. For web development, you should start with HTML and CSS and move on to whichever server-side language you require, such as Perl or PHP.

, For example, if learning PHP, you will need to download and install a server such as Apache, as well as PHP itself. For a C language, you might have to buy a program, however there are good programs you can get for free to compile a C language.

, Start by the manual for your program, and work your way through the examples. You might try some beginner tutorials.

, Pick something simple. If you're learning how to program games, try an easy game such as a number guessing game.

, You will probably find it difficult and have to reference the manual or tutorials quite often, but it's a start.

,


Eventually you will have enough of a grasp of the language and its syntax, as well as the ""theory"" of programming, that you can complete more difficult projects.

, A good mentor will accelerate your learning process and help prevent you from making common mistakes.

Re-trace and compare the actual code to the pseudocode.",How to Write Pseudocode," Pseudocode is a step-by-step verbal outline of your code that you can gradually transcribe into programming language. Many programmers use it to plan out the function of an algorithm before setting themselves to the more technical task of coding. Pseudocode serves as an informal guide, a tool for thinking through program problems, and a communication device that can help you explain your ideas to other people.
, Pseudocode is used to show how a computing algorithm should and could work. Coders often use pseudocode as an intermediate step in programming, in between the initial planning stage and the stage of writing actual, executable code. Good pseudocode can become comments in the final program, guiding the programmer in the future when debugging the code, or revising it in the future. Pseudocode can also be useful for:

Describing how an algorithm should work. Pseudocode can illustrate where a particular construct, mechanism, or technique could or must appear in a program. Senior programmers often use the pseudocode to quickly explain the steps their junior programmers need to follow in order to accomplish a required task.
Explaining a computing process to less technical people. Computers need a very strict input syntax to run a program, but humans (especially non-programmers) may find it easier to understand a more fluid, subjective language that clearly states the purpose of each line of code.
Designing code in a collaborative development group. High-level software architects will often include pseudocode into their designs to help solve a complex problem they see their programmers running into. If you are developing a program along with other coders, you may find that pseudocode helps make your intentions clear.

, There is no set syntax that you absolutely must use for pseudocode, but it is common professional courtesy to use standard pseudocode structures that other programmers can easily understand. If you are coding a project by yourself, then the most important thing is that the pseudocode helps you structure your thoughts and enact your plan. If you are working with others on a project—whether they are your peers, junior programmers, or non-technical collaborators—it is important to use at least some standard structures so that everyone else can easily understand your intent.

If you are enrolled in a programming course at a university, a coding camp, or a company, you will likely be tested against a taught pseudocode ""standard"". This standard often varies between institutions and teachers.
Clarity is a primary goal of pseudocode, and it may help if you work within accepted programming conventions. As you develop your pseudocode into actual code, you will need to transcribe it into a programming language – so it can help to structure your outline with this in mind.

, An algorithm is a procedure for solving a problem in terms of the actions that a program will take and the order in which it will take those actions. An algorithm is merely the sequence of steps taken to solve a problem. The steps are normally ""sequence,"" ""selection, "" ""iteration,"" and a case-type statement.

In C, ""sequence statements"" are imperatives.
The ""selection"" is the ""if then else"" statement.
The iteration is satisfied by a number of statements, such as the ""while,"" "" do,"" and the ""for.""
The case-type statement is satisfied by the ""switch"" statement.

, If you can implement a ""sequence"" function, a ""while"" (looping) function, and an ""if-then-else"" (selection) function, then you have the basic tools that you need to write a ""proper"" algorithm.SEQUENCE is a linear progression where one task is performed sequentially after another. For example:

READ height of rectangle
READ width of rectangle
COMPUTE area as height times width


WHILE is a loop (repetition) with a simple conditional test at its beginning. The beginning and ending of the loop are indicated by two keywords WHILE and ENDWHILE. The loop is entered only if the condition is true. For example:

WHILE Population < Limit

Compute Population as Population + Births - Deaths


ENDWHILE


IF-THEN-ELSE is a decision (selection) in which a choice is made between two alternative courses of action. A binary choice is indicated by these four keywords: IF, THEN, ELSE, and ENDIF. For example:

IF HoursWorked > NormalMaximum THEN

Display overtime message


ELSE

Display regular time message


ENDIF



, Imagine that the program must replace all instances of the word ""foo"" in a text file. The program will read each line in a file, look for a certain word in each line, and then replace that word. You can see that the steps to be repeated are indented with spaces in the pseudocode, just like it would be ideally in real code. A first draft of the pseudocode might look like this:

open the file
for each line in the file:

look for the word
remove the characters of that word
insert the characters of the new word


then close the file.

, One of the strengths of pseudocode is that you can lay out the basics and leave the hard stuff for later. Notice that in the word-replacement example above, there is no detail about how to look for the word. You, the programmer, can re-write the pseudocode to include algorithms for removing the characters of the word, and inserting the characters of the new word. A second draft of the pseudocode may look like this:

open the file
for each line in the file:

look for the word by doing this:

read the character in the line
if the character matches, then:

if all of the following characters match,
then there is a true match.
remove the characters of that word
insert the characters of the new word






then close the file.

, Pseudocode helps programmers think their way through a problem, just like intermediate steps in a math problem. When used properly, pseudocode can make a complicated programming challenge seem simple. You can improve the pseudocode little by little, one step at a time:

open the file
ask the user for the word to be replaced
ask the user for the word with which to replace it
for each line in the file:

look for the word by doing this:

read the character in the line
if the character matches, then:

if all of the following characters match,
then there is a true match.




Count the occurrence of that word.
remove the characters of that word
insert the characters of the new word
display the amount of occurrences of the word,


then close the file.

, Each statement in your pseudocode should express just one action for the computer. In most cases, if the task list is properly drawn, then each task will correspond to one line of pseudocode. Consider writing out your task list, then translating that list into pseudocode, then gradually developing that pseudocode into actual, computer-readable code.Task list:

Read name, hourly rate, hours worked, deduction rate
Perform calculations
gross = hourly rate * hours worked
deduction = gross pay * deduction rate
net pay = gross pay – deduction
Write name, gross, deduction, net pay


Pseudocode:

READ name, hourlyRate, hoursWorked, deductionRate
grossPay = hourlyRate * hoursWorked
deduction = grossPay * deductionRate
netPay = grossPay – deduction
WRITE name, grossPay, deduction, netPay



, In the above example, READ and WRITE are capitalized to indicate that they are the primary functions of the program. Relevant keywords might include: READ, WRITE, IF, ELSE, ENDIF, WHILE, ENDWHILE, REPEAT, and UNTIL., Some programmers write pseudocode like a computer program: they write something like ""if a % 2 == 1 then"". However, most readers must stop to reason through lines that are so abstractly symbolic. It is easier to understand a verbal line like ""if an odd then"". The clearer you are, the more easily people will be able to understand what you mean., Everything that is happening in the process must be described completely. Pseudocode statements are close to simple English statements. Pseudocode does not typically use variables, but instead describes what the program should do with close-to-real-world objects such as account numbers, names, or transaction amounts.

Some examples of valid pseudocode are:

If the account number and password are valid then display the basic account information.
Prorate the total cost proportional to the invoice amount for each shipment.


Some examples of invalid pseudocode are:

let g=54/r (Why: Do not use variables. Instead, you should describe the real-world meaning.)

do the main processing until it is done (Why: You should be specific about what 'main processing' means, and what qualifies the process as 'done'.)




, Even if there is no standard for pseudocode, it will be easier for other programmers to understand your steps if you use structures from existing (sequential) programming languages. Use terms like ""if"", ""then"", ""while"", ""else"", and ""loop"" the same way that you would in your preferred programming language. Consider the following structures:

if CONDITION then INSTRUCTION – This means that a given instruction will only conducted if a given condition is true. ""Instruction"", in this case, means a step that the program will perform. ""Condition"" means that the data must meet a certain set of criteria before the program takes action.
while CONDITION do INSTRUCTION – This means that the instruction should be repeated again and again until the condition is no longer true.
do INSTRUCTION while CONDITION – This is very similar to ""while CONDITION do INSTRUCTION"". In the first case, the condition is checked before the instruction is conducted, but in the second case the instruction will be conducted first. So in the second case, INSTRUCTION will be conducted at least one time.
for a = NUMBER1 to NUMBER2 do INSTRUCTION – This means that ""a"", a variable, will be automatically set to NUMBER1. ""a"" will be increased by one in every step until the value of the variable reaches NUMBER2. You can use any name for the variable that you think fits better than ""a"".
function NAME (ARGUMENTS): INSTRUCTION – This means that every time a certain name is used in the code, it is an abbreviation for a certain instruction. ""Arguments"" are lists of variables that you can use to clarify the instruction.

, Blocks are syntactic tools that tie several instructions together into one instruction. You can use blocks to order information (say, steps in Block 1 always come before steps in Block 2) or simply to wrap information (say, Instruction1 and Instruction2 are thematically related). In general, indent all statements that show ""dependency"" on another statement.There are two ways to do this.

Using curled brackets:

{
INSTRUCTION1
INSTRUCTION2
...}


Or using spaces. When using spaces, every instruction of the same block has to start at the same position. Blocks within blocks have more spaces than the parent block. An instruction from a parent block ends the child block, even if there is an instruction later with the same amount of spaces in front.

BLOCK1
BLOCK1

BLOCK2
BLOCK2

BLOCK3


BLOCK2

BLOCK3




BLOCK1



, This gives you a way to judge whether the pseudocode is complete: in short, if the pseudocode accomplishes the purpose, it is complete. Continue by writing down the process. If the process is simple, this may take only one pass. Look at what you have written down and ask the following questions:

Would this pseudocode be understood by someone who is at least somewhat familiar with the process?
Is the pseudocode written in such a way that it will be easy to translated it into a computing language?
Does the pseudocode describe the complete process without leaving anything out?
Is every object name used in the pseudocode clearly understood by the target audience?

, The first parts of a code typically define the variables and other elements that you will use to make the algorithm functional.


Include dimension variables. Write code that shows how each variable or data element will be used.Set up controls. You will need to define your controls in pseudocode—from text and image boxes in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages to basic controls in simpler codes—much as you would in a regular project., Use pseudocode principles to add specific ""event-driven"" or ""object-driven"" code when you have completed the ""setting"" for your project. Each line of your code should describe a sequence function, a looping function, a selection function, or another distinct action.

, In actual computer code, comments serve the role of identifying tasks and parts of the code to the reader. Pseudocode should clearly explain these steps in nearly-plain English, so you will probably not need to use comments until you translate your pseudocode into a programming language.


Many programmers choose to work their pseudocode into the final code in the form of comments. This helps other programmers—who might be collaborating, reviewing, or learning from the code—understand the intention behind each line.
Begin comments with / / so that the computer does not read them. Make sure that the double slashes are indented. For instance:

//IF robot has no obstacle in front THEN

// Call Move robot
// Add the move command to the command history
// RETURN true


//ELSE

// RETURN false without moving the robot


//END IF



, Again, syntax does not have to be exact, but your pseudocode should still make sense. Try to put yourself into the shoes of another person reading this code, and consider whether your directions are as clear as they can be.


Assess your code modules according to the various elements that they comprise. For example: core operations for the computer include reading or getting information from a file, writing to a file or display on the screen, doing mathematical calculations, valuing data variables, and comparing one or more elements. Each of these has its own place in a computer code project, as well as in the pseudocode that you write to support that project.
Work specific tasks into the pseudocode. When you have identified each task, represent it with readable pseudocode that, while mimicking the actual code language that you will use, need not exactly follow the computer programming language.
Make sure all of the applicable elements are in the pseudocode. Even though you may not need some of the more technical items, like variable declarations, you will still need to represent every task and element clearly in the text.

, Once the pseudocode describes the process reasonably well, without gross errors, review it with any other stakeholders in the project. Ask your team members to give you feedback on which parts of the pseudocode need improvement. Descriptions of processes are often incomplete, so this will help fill in the details of the process. If you are working on the code all by yourself, read through what you have written and consider asking someone else to proofread it.

If your team does not approve the pseudocode, rewrite it for clarity. Ask your team what went wrong: are your steps just unclear, or did you forget to include an important piece of the process?

, Once you and your team have approved the pseudocode, save it in an archive. When you write the actual computer-readable code, be sure to include the pseudocode as a comment in the computer code file. Again, begin comments with / / so that the computer does not read them., The pseudocode presents you an algorithm. For instance, the code might sort an array list in alphabetical order. The basic, ""genetic"" code will guide you as you build out the algorithm in your preferred programming language., These elements might include declaration of variables, if statements, and loop statements. Each procedure line can be implemented in many different ways. Your options depend on the level of your programming language.

For example, try to display data for the user to see. You can use a notification window to display the data, or you can use the existing graphical interface on which you are designing.

, Write the pseudocode neatly, simply and efficiently. A well-written pseudocode could make the entire algorithm more efficient and error-free when you launch the program., Make sure that your actual, implemented code follows the instructions laid out by the pseudocode. For example: if the Pseudocode accepts input and output, try all possible inputs, and compare the output of your implemented code to the output computed from the pseudocode. You can ask a fellow programmer to do the tracing or recommend a better method to your code."

Do not use comments.,
Use variables as little as possible.,
Use obscure variable and method names.,
Use overly complicated solutions for simple tasks.,
Write useless code.,
Ignore indentation.",How to Write Unmaintainable Code," Comments exist solely to help developers navigate through their code. Remove all comments.


If needed, write all comments in a note document or on a sheet of paper so that you are the only one able to view your comments.;
, Never use constants. Numbers should be valued directly in code. This will make your code very hard to modify and follow.

, If you have to use a variable, no one will be able to figure out what the variable actually exists for without digging into the code if it has a very non-descriptive name. Try names such as single letters of the alphabet, or, if you are feeling particularly silly, completely unrelated nouns (such as ""dog"" or ""cat"").

, A good way to do this is to use methods where they are unnecessary. Try to use the most complex features that the language has to offer. For example, C offers a goto command which can be used to jump around code in a very confusing manner.

, Create classes, methods, and files that have nothing to do with the overall function of your code.

, Do not indent your code.

"
"
Stop just before you are about to write a comment.,
Name the subroutine in a way that makes its purpose clear, or move it to a class where the name of the class plus the name of the subroutine together make the purpose clear.,
Name the variable for what it represents.,
Write a unit test for the subroutine.,
Break the subroutine into smaller subroutines, each of which should be simple and have a name that tells what it does.,
To communicate the intention behind a complicated expression: Define a subroutine that has that intention as its name, and move the expression there.,
Define classes carefully.,
As a last resort—write a comment.",How to Write Readable Code Without Comments," Or, go ahead and write the comment. Now think, ""Why am I writing this comment? What do I want another programmer to know about this code, which is not already apparent from the code itself?""
,


For example, if you were about to add a comment saying, ""Updates the maintenance schedule for the moving van"" to a subroutine named updmaint, try calling it updateMaintenanceSchedule() and put it in a class named MovingVan. Better yet, use a word more specific than ""update"": calculateMaintenanceSchedule(), setMaintenanceSchedule(), etc., depending on what the subroutine actually does.
A subroutine that returns a Boolean value should nearly always be named as the verb phrase that would follow the word ""if"" in a sentence. For example, isOutOfDate() or needsNewSchedule(). Then, in an if statement, you can simply write, if (van.needsNewSchedule()) { whatever(); }


,


If you want to indicate that the variable must be treated in a certain, special way or that some of its values have special meanings, then define a new class and make the variable an object. For example, if you have an integer to represent ""number of messages posted"" but you use a -1 to mean ""user registration is pending approval"", it's probably time to define a User class, and have distinct variables for numMessagesPosted and isPendingApproval. Defining a class and making the variable into an object is particularly important if your comment was of the form, ""Whenever you modify this variable, also be sure to...""

,
The main information that a person needs to know about most subroutines is: what set-up is required and what a caller can expect on exit from the subroutine (sometimes called the ""contract"" fulfilled by the subroutine). The unit test performs the necessary set-up and passes the subroutines the correct parameters. The assertions at the end of the test tell what the subroutine guarantees to its caller. Just like a comment, the unit test defines the programming contract. Unlike a comment, the unit test is executable, and will fire automatically if anyone ever modifies the code in a way that violates the contract., Then, the code to call the smaller subroutines will spell out exactly what happens and in what sequence, at a high level. But unlike a comment, this narrative is guaranteed to match the way the code really works., For example, you might use a fairly complicated expression to determine the nearest gas station to a given moving van. Just move this to a subroutine named nearestGasStation. It's OK if the subroutine is only one line long. The code is now much clearer. It's also easier to write a unit test for, and it's easier to re-use that expression for some other purpose., They should explicitly represent the different situations that the variable must be adjusted for. Make these ensure that each is always handled correctly.


For example, to remove the comment from this statement:
    index--; // adjust for zero-based indexing
define two classes, OneBasedIndex and ZeroBasedIndex, and initialize index to be of the appropriate class. In C++, you can define a conversion between these classes so that the code that uses indices never needs to care whether it's zero-based or one-based.
The code is now more readable because it doesn't contain ad hoc tweaks to indices inside tricky if statements sprinkled throughout the code. It is also less likely to contain bugs, easier to test, and explicitly represents the reason for adjusting the indices.

, If searching for a way to make the code readable on its own really turns up no way to communicate what needs to be said, then, OK, write a comment. Comments are not always a sign of poor code; there's no need to be dogmatic about it.

This instruction set will be using Lynx.,
Most popular text based browsers are available as packages or even come pre-installed on a variety of Linux distributions.,
SSH into your web server.,
Check if the text based browser you chose is available as a package.,
Install the text based browser using a package manager.,
(Optional) Build your text based browser from it's source.,
Start your text based browser.,
Go to a page.,
Type the url of the page you'd like to visit.,
Navigate the page.,
Click an element.,
Congratulations!",How to Surf the Internet with a Text Based Browser from a Web Server," Although, a wide variety of text based browsers exist. Some of the other popular ones include Links, and w3m. You'll need to choose one of these.;
, If a package for a specific web based browser exists for your operating system, it would benefit you to use that one because it will streamline the installation process.

, One way to do this is to type:


ssh user@1.2.3.4

, Depending on your operating system, the text based browser you chose may exist as a package. On CentOS for example, Lynx is available in yum. On Debian and Ubuntu, Lynx is available in apt.

, To install the text based browser Lynx using your package manager, you can use one of the following commands:


On CentOS: yum install lynx
On Ubuntu & Debian: sudo apt-get install lynx

, If you do not have the option of using a package manager to install your text based browser, you can build it yourself using your favourite text browser's source.

, For lynx, you can type lynx in your shell to start it.

, Use your text based browser's hotkey for going to a page. In Lynx, it's g by default.

, Hit enter.


Web pages will look different than they normally do in a regular browser. Although, your text based browser will preserve the positioning of the web page, so you can expect things to be in the same place they'd be in a normal browser.
Some text based browser may prompt you about accepting cookies or executing scripts on web pages, respond to these accordingly.

, To navigate the page, use the arrow keys. You'll see different elements of the page start to become highlighted. This means that they're selected. This is equivalent to hovering your mouse over an element on a web page. An example of selection can be seen in the image above, where EXPLORE is selected.

, The equivalent of clicking on an element in Lynx is by pressing enter on the element.

, You now know the basics of using a text based browser.

Learn about the FORTH kernel: The FORTH kernel is the entire FORTH development environment.,
Learn about the command line interpreter: The command line interpreter receives input from the user.,
Learn about the STACKS.,
Learn the difference between the Data Stack and the Return Stack.,
Learn about the 'extra stack': many implementation have a third stack used for advanced math functions.

,
Learn about the dictionary structure: The FORTH dictionary is list of FORTH words that are the routines used in FORTH.,
Learn about memory access: External memory access refers to RAM or any memory external to the CPU.,
Learn about the DPANS94 standard: DPANS94 is the formal ANSI-FORTH standard.,
Find the references: STARTING FORTH and THINKING FORTH are two of the common references used to learn about FORTH

",How to Write Computer Programs Using Forth," It is interactive and extensible, and consists of the parts described as follows:;
, If the input is a FORTH word, the interpreter tries to execute it. It the input can be interpreted as a number, the interpreter put the value on the stack. It is is neither of these, the interpreter gives a message like ""UNDEFINED WORD"" or ""Huh?"" depending on the sense of humor of the person that implemented the version of FORTH.

, Access to a CPU stack is very fast. Access to external memory is much slower. Avoid external memory when things need to be fast, and use external memory when things need to be saved.

, The data stack is usual referred to as 'the stack' and the return stack is specifically referenced as the 'return stack'. In most cases, the user manipulated values on the data stack (the stack), while the return stack hold the value of the routine that called the one currently executing. The return stack is somethings used to temporarily store values within a single function, but care must be taken not to interfere with the return value that must be present at the end of the function.

,, The user adds definitions to the dictionary using previously define FORTH words in the dictionary

, The FORTH words (routines) that access memory are usually some form of @ ""fetch from memory"" and ! ""store to memory"". @ and ! usually fetch and store values of the default cell size defined for the system. Other size values are C@ and C! for character (8 bit byte), W@ and W! for word (16 bit 2 byte) L@ and L! for LONG (32 bit 4 byte). Other memory access can be defined as EC@ and EC! for EEPROM character fetch and store, and so on depending on the system implementation.

, This is usually the starting point as a reference for a FORTH system. Any variations from the standard are usually stated for the convenience of the intended users.

Add an end to the last line of your program and save your program as your function name.,
Test your function out on the command prompt!",How to Write a Function and Call It in MATLAB," This button will be on the upper left side of your screen.;
, The name of your function should be the name of your file, so when you save this new script file it will be the name of your file. In this case, for example, you can name our function slope-equation.

, An input is something you need the user to give to you. For example, if you want to determine the slope equation y = mx+b, you need the user to tell us what is the slope value(m), the x coordinate and the y-intercept(b).

, Skip to line 2 in your program and type for example, “%m is the value of the slope of the line”. Repeat this for each 3 inputs. Commenting is useful in programming for you and others who modify your program to understand all the variables and things you have done and how they are defined.

, What this means, in this case, is you want your equation to define a variable y as the product of our input m and x and then add the y intercept value (b) to it. In line 5, you define your equation. Do not forget the semicolon this semicolon suppresses the output! What does that mean? That means the software Matlab automatically assigns the y variable the value of mx+ b and it doesn't output the value to the screen.

, An fprintf statement is used to output information to the user of the program. You will first define the fprintf statement and then go into more details. Type in at line 6 fprintf(‘blank message’);

, Replace the words blank message with your own words your sentence should be descriptive of the output of your function. You can say, “The y coordinate of this line is:”

, This means since you are dealing with integers you should use “%i” this will call an integer value from our fprintf statement. What are the different data types? Well the most common one is integer which in an fprintf statement is defined as %i but there is also a whole list of numeric data types at this website http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/numeric-types.html where you can look and decide at which data type you would like your answer to be formatted in!

, In your case the output is the value y so after the single quotation you type “, y”. The fprintf statement automatically recognizes this variable and puts it in the first %(datatype) it sees in between the single quotation marks.

, This line just simply is to make your program look neater. It makes your program enter after your initial fprintf statement. This is just the line “fprintf(‘\n’);’. The new line character in other programming languages is “/n”; in MATLAB it will only work with the backwards slash.

, This end will close our function and is necessary in every function you create in MATLAB. If you do not save your program you will get the wrong output or no values when you execute.

, This part is considered calling your function; you go to the command prompt and type “yourfunction(inputvalue1, inputvalue2, inputvalueN)”. This means you type your function's name and the values you want to assign to the inputs. Test your function with the input value of 4, 5 and 6. That means on the command prompt you would write slope Equation(4,5,6). As you can see from the picture mistakes are bound to happen in your code just refer back to these steps and the warnings and see what you missed or messed up on!

Get into the coding environment.,
Identify your variables.,
Start the while loop by writing a do while command.,
Put your intended tasks and implementation code inside the while loop.,
Input your else command.,
Evaluate your while loop in the context of the overall program.,
Address any syntax issues.,
Run and debug.",How to Write a While Loop," Open up the program and get to the portion of code where the while loop is needed.;
, Many times, a while loop uses a variable for definition. For instance, if your variable ""x"" will be the value that determines how long the loop lasts, it's important that you define ""x"" as a whole number or similar data type.

, The syntax is different in various computer languages. The while command usually includes the words ""do while,"" along with other minimal code.

, Everything that needs to be continued must come between the ""do while"" command and a separate ""else"" command that will cause the program to skip ahead if the while condition is not true.

, This command comes in many different syntax structures, but the idea is the same: the loop will not continue if the condition referenced by ""while"" is no longer valid. For example, if the command is ""do while x > 4"" the else command will trigger changes when the variable ""x"" becomes greater than 4.

, Part of writing an effective while loop involves anticipating how your code function will act. This kind of prediction can be the difference between a smoothly functioning piece of code and a failed attempt.

, Each computer programming language has its own syntax, which is the way that the code words are structured for use and understood. The idea behind a while loop can be great, but if the words are out of place or misused in any way, the result will not work.


Run through each line of code and consider what happens when. A while loop can become excessively broad or global within a program. Looking at each line of code helps the programmer to dial back into the most basic elements and uses of the while loop.

, The run time is often the place where developers catch any last glitches. If your while loop is written well, your program will work as you want it to at run time.


Watch for typos. Any typing errors can cause the code to crash or to not work. Scan the code and catch any errors.

Learn about batch programming and do it in Notepad.",How to Use the Command Prompt and Write in Batch Language," Notepad isn’t any old text-editing program, because when you save it you can add any extension. Command Prompt or CMD is like DOS but it has loads more functionality.


So at the Command Prompt to make things easier to use you need to right click at the blue bar at the top and select properties. Under the Tab options you need to make sure QuickEdit Mode is enabled. Click OK. A box will appear to say if you want to apply them or save them. Click on the box saying ‘Save properties for future windows with the same title’. Click OK.;
, You might think at this point that it is going to ruin my system. It can if you have no idea what you are doing. So to start, you need to know how to navigate between directories.


Type CD c:\ then hit ↵ Enter. You will have noticed that you have gone from your documents and settings directory to your C drive's root directory. If you follow the following instructions, you are going to see every file and folder that is in that directory.
Type DIR and hit ↵ Enter. Now you should see a long list. The rows of text in the last column tells you the names of the directories branching from the root directory (the top) of your C drive or in any other case, the directory you are currently in. If it is a folder, you will see <dir> in the column left of the name column in the same row. If it is as file it will not have <dir> next to it and will have a file extension (*.txt, *.exe, *.docx) at the end of the name.

, Type MKDIR mybatch. You just ordered windows to make a new directory or folder called mybatch. If you want proof it is there type DIR again and look around. You should see it as a DIR.

, If you don’t have Internet connection you can skip this part but if you do you need to know it. Ping means to send packets of data around a website and it to return back to you. If it does it means the website is working and is alive.


You are going to test the Google search engine as an example. Type PING Google.com then hit ↵ Enter. You should see something saying like ‘Reply from 72.14.207.99: bytes=32 time=117ms TTL=234.’ It might have this about four times. If it says that it cannot ping your Internet connection isn’t working or the website is dead. It will also say how many packets it sent, received and lost. If it lost 0, the website is working 100%.

, This is easy. Just type something like mspaint.exe and it will open the paint program. It is harder to open a program within a directory and you already did this using the user interface when you opened Command Prompt and Notepad earlier.


The way to open a file or program from inside a directory is harder. Assuming you still have notepad open type hello world. Then click File > Save As > Helloworld.txt in mybatch folder in your C directory. Reopen Command Prompt and you will be in your documents and setting folder. Now type cd c:\mybatch, hit ↵ Enter and then type helloworld.txt .You will not normally need to open Command Prompt again but it makes it a little bit more challenging because you don’t normally start in the C directory.

, To delete a directory you need to use the RMDIR command. For example, RMDIR deleteme basically means ""delete the directory named ""deleteme"". Even though the command is RMDIR, it will work with files as well as sub-directories or folders.


A little tip: when using the RMDIR command, navigate to the directory that contains the file or sub-directory you would like to delete, and then type RMDIR * with * being the name of the file or sub-directory you want to delete. Navigate to the C drive then type RMDIR deleteme. Then it will ask if you are sure you want to delete the directory. Type Y for yes and then hit ↵ Enter. You have just deleted the folder called ""deleteme"".

, You can use any of these two commands; they are both exactly the same, REN and RENAME so make a directory called ""idon’tlikemyname"" then type REN idon’tlikemyname mynameisgood. You have just renamed the directory. Now you can delete it.

, You do not need to buy expensive software for something you can do for free. In Notepad type:







@echo off
Echo this is a batch file
Echo I can tell the time
Echo tell the time
Time /t





You have just told it to echo three sentences. This is writing that will be shown on the screen. @echo off means that you won’t see on the screen the commands because if you did it would say:




Echo hello
Hello





The command time /t tells you the time! You must put ""/t"" or it will want you to change the time.
Go to File > Save As > (Save it in your mybatch folder) called Timefirst.bat. Notice that is has been saved as a bat file and not text. Don’t get confused and called it Timefirst.batch because it will not work.

, These statements tell the computer that your program will use two pre-existing libraries that are already built-in to C++. The iostream library contains code for input and output to the console. The string library contains code for creating and manipulating text strings. Including these libraries makes your programming life easier because you are taking advantage of the resources already available to you.




#include<iostream>
#include<string>




, The text you type should appear on a new line. This text will inform the computer that you are using some abbreviated conventions for certain text that will appear later. For example, later on in this process, instead of typing “std::cout”, you will only have to type “cout”. Do not type the comments (statements that follow two forward slashes) as you proceed with this process.




#include<iostream>
#include<string>
 
//new text appears below this line
using namespace std;




, This program will only have one function, the main function, which is a part of every C++ program. The right curly brace will automatically appear on most text editors after you type the left one. The same is true of all symbols with an ""opening"" and ""closing"" case (such as parenthesis, ""()"", brackets, ""[]"", and curly braces, ""{}""). All of the code you type within the main function is automatically indented to indicate its placement and improve readability. Make sure the rest of the code you type is within these two curly braces.




#include<iostream>
#include<string>
 
using namespace std;
 
//new text begins here
int main()
{
 
}
//new text ends here




, Within the curly braces of the main function, type the new text shown below. This text establishes ""str"", ""length"", and ""isPalindrome"" as variables which store a text string, integer, and Boolean value respectively. The variable “str” will store the word that may or may not be a palindrome. The variable “length” will store the number of letters in the word. The variable “isPalindrome” will store whether or not the word is a palindrome. For the purpose of this program, we first assume the word is a palindrome, and then examine it to see if it is not a palindrome. If it is not a palindrome, we will change the value of “isPalindrome” to false.

    cout << ""Enter a word: "";
 
//new text begins here
    getline(cin, str);
//new text ends here
}




, The length of the word is needed so the computer knows when to stop looking through the letters in the word.




#include<iostream>
#include<string>
 
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    string str;
    int length;
    bool isPalindrome = true;
 
    cout << ""Enter a word: "";
 
    getline(cin, str);
 
//new  text begins here
    length = str.length();
//new text ends here
}




,  Put as simply as possible, this text creates a loop that will examine each letter with its corresponding mirror letter to see if they match. Since the number of examinations is half the size of the word, we divide the length by 2 in the code. When you type the left curly brace, the right one should automatically appear again. The next line of code should be typed within these new curly braces.




#include<iostream>
#include<string>
 
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    string str;
    int length;
    bool isPalindrome = true;
 
    cout << ""Enter a word: "";
 
    getline(cin, str);
 
    length = str.length();
 
//new text begins here
    for (int i = 0; i < (length / 2); i++)
    {
    }
//new text ends here
}




,  This statement carries out comparisons. A given letter, denoted “i"", is compared with the letter in its mirrored position in the word. For example, in the word “madam”, the two m’s will be compared, then the two a’s, and so on.




#include<iostream>
#include<string>
 
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    string str;
    int length;
    bool isPalindrome = true;
 
    cout << ""Enter a word: "";
 
    getline(cin, str);
 
    length = str.length();
 
    for (int i = 0; i < (length / 2); i++)
    {
//new text begins here
        if (str!= str)
            isPalindrome = false;
//new text ends here
    }
}




,  If the word in question is a palindrome, the variable “isPalindrome” will still be true. Otherwise, it will be false. This “cout” statement displays the ""true"" instance to the user.




#include<iostream>
#include<string>
 
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    string str;
    int length;
    bool isPalindrome = true;
 
    cout << ""Enter a word: "";
 
    getline(cin, str);
 
    length = str.length();
 
    for (int i = 0; i < (length / 2); i++)
    {
        if (str!= str)
            isPalindrome = false;
    }
 
//new text begins here
    if (isPalindrome == true)
        cout << str << "" is a palindrome"" << endl;
//new text ends here
}




, If the word in question is not a palindrome, the variable “isPalindrome” will have a new value of “false” and the “else” statement will execute, displaying this fact to the user.




#include<iostream>
#include<string>
 
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    string str;
    int length;
    bool isPalindrome = true;
 
    cout << ""Enter a word: "";
 
    getline(cin, str);
 
    length = str.length();
 
    for (int i = 0; i < (length / 2); i++)
    {
        if (str!= str)
            isPalindrome = false;
    }
 
    if (isPalindrome == true)
        cout << str << "" is a palindrome"" << endl;
 
//new text begins here
    else
        cout << str << "" is not a palindrome"" << endl;
//new text ends here
}




,  This statement tells the computer that the program executed correctly. Make sure the final curly brace from the main function appears after this statement. If you are using a standard text editor, the indentation and spacing will happen automatically within the curly braces and this will be less likely to be a potential problem.




#include<iostream>
#include<string>
 
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    string str;
    int length;
    bool isPalindrome = true;
 
    cout << ""Enter a word: "";
 
    getline(cin, str);
 
    length = str.length();
 
    for (int i = 0; i < (length / 2); i++)
    {
        if (str!= str)
            isPalindrome = false;
    }
 
    if (isPalindrome == true)
        cout << str << "" is a palindrome"" << endl;
 
    else
        cout << str << "" is not a palindrome"" << endl;
 
//new text begins here
    return 0;
//new text ends here
}

Understand the purpose of commenting a computer program.,
Think of a short, simple way to get across your point.,
Write the comment using the appropriate syntax given by the programming language.

Ask yourself if the comment you've written is detailed enough.",How to Write a Comment in a Computer Programming Language,"


Readability is the key thing here. When you look at a comment you should know that it is a comment and not a line of code.
The comment should also be helpful not just to you, but to anyone else that might read the source code of your computer program.;
, Comments don't need to be a work of art. They should be concise, neat, and straight to the point.


This should not, however, discourage the use of multiple lines for a comment. The point is that the information needs to get across to the reader.

Provide a broad subject statement describing the changes.,
Add a body to the commit message.,
Include a procedure for testing your change, if possible.,
List any caveats to the change you made.,
Squash minor changes together.",How to Write a Commit Message," This shouldn't be anything specific, but it should still be helpful. If you introduced a new feature, give it's name and purpose. If you fixed a bug, state which one (by ID, if applicable). Don't say how exactly you changed something (in terms of code), but do describe why you did it that way.


Good example: Added a script to find missing LocalRepo files
Bad example: loop through all the files in the table and if they're in the repo output them to the screen;
, The body should contain more details about your change, such as any new components or classes added, and changes that may affect what other developers are working on (if you don't know what other developers are doing, that's a good reason to read the revision log, and another reason why commit messages are important). You should also describe why it was important to make this change (if it's a bug fix, it should be self-explanatory, but if you're refactoring something, you should state why)


Good example: Created a new VideoProcessor class to handle processing for uploaded videos and separate the background processes from the user interface component (formerly Video class, now EmbeddedVideo).
Bad example: Made some new classes and renamed the video class

, Testing your code thoroughly is important before deploying it. It will help you and other developers to test once it's live as well if you include a testing plan with the relevant commit.


Good example: Verify that links from the search results are now rewriting properly and no redirect loop exists on SSL.
Bad example: Make sure links work now

, If it creates a new bug you're aware of then you should work on it before pushing it into any shared repository. If there are limitations of the feature or fix, though, state them. Anything else you can leave to well-placed comments in your source code.


Good example: Following r5923, use of the getError() method is deprecated, all code following should handle errors using the Status object returned by getStatus() instead.
Bad example: Use getStatus() instead of getError()

, This is really useful for things like whitespace changes and typo fixes. Things like this are really minor and shouldn't affect functionality at all. In that case, squash them together so that you and other developers don't have to scroll through all of them in the log to find a more important commit.


Don't squash things that aren't related to each other

'SQL' is usually pronounced 'S-Q-L' (Structured Query Language).,
There are various dialects of SQL but most widely used database engines today adhere to the SQL99 standard from ANSI, and many vendors have implemented extra features to extend that standard (the Microsoft 'flavor' of SQL is called T-SQL or Transact-SQL, the Oracle version is PL/SQL).

,
Getting the Data Out!,
A simple example would be something like: 'select * from tblMyCDList' which would get all columns (that's where the * comes in) and rows in the table 'tblMyCDList'.

,
Queries are usually much more complicated than this.,
If we want to filter the rows returned by the select statement, a where clause is needed to qualify the record sets returned.,
INSERT and UPDATE statements are used to add and change data in an SQL database (check the links below for some excellent tutorials that can take you further).

,
The DELETE statement is used to remove data from an SQL database.

",How to Use SQL," SQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce in the early 1970s. This version was called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language).;
,, This is what it usually is all about. For this we use the SELECT statement; it will query or retrieve data from an SQL database.

,, The select can be used to tease out particular columns and rows out of a table and even link data from multiple tables or, for that matter, databases together.

, 'select * from tblMyCDList where CDid = 27' will retrieve the rows where the field CDid is equal to 27. Or 'select * from tblAttribute where strCDName like 'Dark Side%' ' uses a wild card representing zero or more instances of any character and will hopefully show that my collection does have my favorite Pink Floyd album.

Learn from the above table the Excel VBA Variable Data Types.,
Learn that generally, it’s best to use the data type that uses the smallest number of bytes yet still can handle all the data that will be assigned to it.,
Learn various Assignment Statements.,
Learn that VBA has many reserved words, which are words that you can’t use for variable or procedure names.,
Learn that syntax error messages aren’t always descriptive.,
Learn that for worksheet calculation, Excel uses the Double data type, so that’s a good choice for processing numbers in VBA when you don’t want to lose any precision.,
If you don’t declare the data type for a variable that you use in a VBA routine, VBA uses the default data type, Variant.,
You can use the VBA TypeName function to determine the data type of a variable.,
Learn that VBA lets you create custom, or user-defined, data types.,You define custom data types at the top of your module, before any procedures.,
After you create a user-defined data type, you use a Dim statement to declare a variable as that type.,
An array is a group of elements of the same type that have a common name.,
You declare an array with a Dim or Public statement, just as you declare a regular variable.,
When you declare an array, you need specify only the upper index, in which case VBA assumes that 0 is the lower index.,
By default, VBA assumes zero-based arrays.,
When you want to declare multidimensional arrays, do the following:

The array examples in the preceding section are one-dimensional arrays.,
Following is a declaration for a 3-D array that contains 1,000 elements (visualize this array as a cube):

Dim TheArray(1 To 10, 1 To 10, 1 To 10) As Integer

Reference an item within the array by supplying three index numbers:
TheArray(4, 8, 2) = 0



,
When you want to declare a dynamic array, use a blank set of parentheses.",How to Use Excel VBA Variable Data Types,";
, When VBA works with data, execution speed is partially a function of the number of bytes that VBA has at its disposal. Thus, the fewer bytes used by data, the faster VBA can access and manipulate the data.

The Decimal data type is rather unusual because you can’t actually declare it. It is a subtype of a variant. You need to use the VBA CDec function to convert a variant to the Decimal data type.

, The following list contains some examples of assignment expressions that use various variable types. The variable names are to the left of the equals sign. Each statement assigns the value to the right of the equals sign to the variable on the left.



DataEntered = True
DateStart = #04/18/2015#
Interest_Rate = 0.025
LoanAmount = 2000000.00
MyNumber = TheNumber * 1.25
UserName = “Terrence O'Malley”
x = 10
x = x + 1



, If you attempt to use one of these words, you get an error message. For example, although the reserved word Next or True might make a very descriptive variable name, the following instructions generate a syntax error: Next = 64; True = True., If an instruction produces a strange error message, check the VBA Help system to ensure that your variable name doesn’t have a special use in VBA. If the Auto Syntax Check option is turned on you get the error: Compile error: Expected: variable. If Auto Syntax Check is turned off, attempting to execute this statement results in: Compile error: Syntax error. It would be more helpful if the error message were something like Reserved word was used as a variable., For integer calculations, you can use the Integer type which is limited to values less than or equal to 32,767. Otherwise, use the Long data type. Using the Long data type even for values less than 32,767 is recommended, because this data type may be a bit faster than using the Integer type. When dealing with Excel worksheet row numbers, you want to use the Long data type because the number of rows in a worksheet exceeds the maximum value for the Integer data type., Data stored as a Variant changes type, depending on what you do with it.

The following procedure demonstrates how a variable can assume different data types:

Sub VariantDemonstration()
TheVar = “124”
TheVar = MyVar / 2
TheVar = ”Answer: ” & TheVar
MsgBox TheVar
End Sub
In the VariantDemonstration procedure, TheVar starts out as a three-character string. Then this string is divided by two and becomes a numeric data type. Next, TheVar is appended to a string, converting TheVar back to a string. The MsgBox statement displays the final string: Answer: 62.


To further demonstrate the potential problems in dealing with Variant data types, try executing this procedure:

Sub VariantDemonstration2()
TheVar = “124”
TheVar = TheVar + TheVar
TheVar = ”Answer: ” & TheVar
MsgBox TheVar
End Sub
The message box displays Answer: 124124. This is probably not what you wanted. When dealing with variants that contain text strings, the + operator performs string concatenation.



, Here’s a modified version of the previous procedure. This version displays the data type of TheVar at each step.

You see that it starts out as a string, is then converted to a double, and finally ends up as a string again.

Sub VariantDemonstration3()
TheVar = “124”
MsgBox TypeName(TheVar)
TheVar = TheVar / 2
MsgBox TypeName(TheVar)
TheVar = “Answer: “ & TheVar
MsgBox TypeName(TheVar)
MsgBox TheVar
End Sub



, A user-defined data type can ease your work with some types of data.

For example, if your application deals with customer information, you may want to create a user-defined data type named CustomerData:

Type CustomerData
Company As String
Contact As String
RegionCode As Long
Sales As Double
End Type



,, Usually, you define an array. For example:

Dim Customers(1 To 100) As CustomerData
Each of the 100 elements in this array consists of four components (as specified by the user-defined data type, CustomerData).
You can refer to a particular component of the record as follows:

Customers(1).Company = “Ace Tools”
Customers(1).Contact = “Tim Roberts”
Customers(1).RegionCode = 1
Customers(1).Sales = 150000.00


You can also work with an element in the array as a whole. For example, to copy the information from Customers(1) to Customers(2), use this instruction:

Customers(2) = Customers(1)


The preceding example is equivalent to the following instruction block:

Customers(2).Company = Customers(1).Company
Customers(2).Contact = Customers(1).Contact
Customers(2).RegionCode = Customers(1).RegionCode
Customers(2).Sales = Customers(1).Sales



, You refer to a specific element in the array by using the array name and an index number. For example, you can define an array of 12 string variables so that each variable corresponds to the name of a month. If you name the array MonthNaming, you can refer to the first element of the array as MonthNaming(0), the second element as MonthNaming(1), and so on, up to MonthNaming(11)., You can also specify the number of elements in the array. You do so by specifying the first index number, the keyword To, and the last index number — all inside parentheses.

For example, here’s how to declare an array comprising exactly 100 integers:\

Dim TheArray(1 To 100) As Integer



,

Therefore, the two statements that follow have the same effect:

Dim TheArray(0 to 100) As Integer
Dim TheArray(100) As Integer
In both cases, the array consists of 101 elements.



, If you would like VBA to assume that 1 is the lower index for all arrays that declare only the upper index, include the following statement before any procedures in your module: Option Base 1, VBA arrays can have up to 60 dimensions, although you’ll rarely need more than three dimensions (a 3-D array).
The following statement declares a 100-integer array with two dimensions (2-D):

Dim TheArray(1 To 10, 1 To 10) As Integer
You can think of the preceding array as occupying a 10-x-10 matrix. To refer to a specific element in a 2-D array, you need to specify two index numbers. For example, here’s how you can assign a value to an element in the preceding array:
TheArray(3, 4) = 125



,, A dynamic array doesn’t have a preset number of elements.

Dim TheArray() As Integer
Before you can use a dynamic array in your code, however, you must use the ReDim statement to tell VBA how many elements are in the array. You can use a variable to assign the number of elements in an array.
Often the value of the variable isn’t known until the procedure is executing. For example, if the variable x contains a number, you can define the array’s size by using this statement:

ReDim TheArray (1 to x)


You can use the ReDim statement any number of times, changing the array’s size as often as you need to. When you change an array’s dimensions the existing values are destroyed. If you want to preserve the existing values, use ReDim Preserve. For example:

ReDim Preserve TheArray (1 to z)

Learn the following key concepts of the FIND command:


The syntax of .Find is:

expression.Find(What, After, LookIn, LookAt, SearchOrder, SearchDirection, MatchCase, MatchByte, SearchFormat)
Expression (Required): is any valid range Object.,
You can adapt the following code to your own uses by copying it (down to where it says #** End Sub) in Advanced Editing and pasting it to a word processor and doing a REPLACE ALL for ""#** "" (w/o the quotes but with the trailing space please).,
Open a new Excel workbook.,
In your browser, go to https://www.wikihow.com/User:Chris-Garthwaite and do (View More) under Articles Started, and select just to the left of the first top one down to just to the right of the bottom one's Views, and copy it.,
Then.,
Note that if you were to use Excel's menu-driven Find command, it would return in the upper left corner (to the left of the formula bar) the cell reference it found, if any, for the string you searched on in the given range of cells, but you would have to hit the right arrow and left arrow (or some such combination) to select the actual cell as the sole ActiveCell I believe.,
Note that the underline used at the right end of code lines is to extend the line to the next line down, so the next line is in fact part of the entire sub-procedure or expression.

,
You can easily adapt this code by changing the sheet name reference and the cell range reference, and if it's not an Article you're searching for, you can certainly change that everywhere as well.

Decide the specific use of regular expressions you need.,
Design and decide the regular expression you want to use.,
Decide the regular expressions matching options you want to use.,Create a RegexOptions object and add all options (by using bit-wise or ""|"") - This step is optional

,
Choose the member method you want to use.,
Decide whether you want to use the static version of the method or the instance version.,
Use the results obtained at the end of step 6 in the rest of your code.",How to Use Regular Expression Classes in the .Net Framework," Regular expressions are normally used for one of the following:


Check if a string has a certain pattern within it
Validate a string against a pattern
Replace a specific pattern with another pattern
Split a string using a pattern delimiter
Find all occurrences of a certain pattern within a string
Extract pattern pieces/groups from a string (like in syntax checking/highlighting);
, Visit an online library of regular expressions, The setting you need to decide are:


Case sensitivity of matching
Whether you want to ignore any white spaces within the regular expression while matching or not
Whether the matching is multi-line or not (this changes the meaning of ^ and $ to match to the beginning and end of lines and not only the beginning and end of the whole string)
The direction of the matching process (left-to-right or right-to-left)
Whether . will match any character including or not including new line
Whether to compile the regular expression to the assembly (slow start up, fast processing) or not (the contrary)
Whether to ignore culture variance/change or not
Whether to use ECMA Script compliant mode or not
Whether to capture every group (any sub-expression within parenthesis) or only groups that are named

,, This depends on your choice in step 1. You have the following choices:


Is Match() - if you only need to check whether a match was found or not
Match() - if you want to get the first match found. Calling this method again will get the next match and so on.
Matches() - if you want to retrieve all matches of the pattern in one call
Split() - if you want to split the string at the matches of the pattern
Replace() - if you want to replace the matches of the pattern with another pattern or string

, Static methods do not require the creation of a Regex object but they do not keep the status of matching between calls. According to your choice, follow the following steps:


For static versions of the methods:

Declare an appropriate reference to hold the results of the operation if necessary. Here is a list of the methods and the type of results they return:

Is Match() - bool
Match() - Match
Matches() - Match Collection
Replace() - string
Split() - string[]


Call the appropriate method from the Regex class passing it the regular expression, the string, the options, and the replacement pattern in case of Replace() and assign the result to the reference you declared in the previous step.


For instance versions of the methods:

Create a Regex object passing the regular expression you created, and the matching options to the constructor.
Declare an appropriate result reference to hold the results obtained (like step 1 in the static version of the method)
Call the method you choose from the regex object passing it the string to be matched and assign the result to the reference created in the previous step.

Understand that there are generally three main parts to object oriented programming.,
In Object-Oriented Programming Languages, programs are designed with the concept of objects, where each object contains its own set of variables to store data about or relevant to that object, and functions to perform action (like outputting text or making an API call to the operating system), perform calculations, add data to variables inside the object, etc.,
Objects represent various things in a program, like a Square.,
In the case a math program was intended to calculate the area of not only squares, but other shapes, such as a circle, ""Inheritance"" would be used.,
Many programmers have a hard time deciding which programming language to use.",How to Understand Object Oriented Programming," These are Abstraction, Inheritance and Encapsulation.;
, This contrasts with Structured Programming Languages, in which programs are designed with collections of functions that are called in different parts of the program, more like a script or job list.

, This is called Abstraction. An object for a square in a math program would have a set of variables, length and width, that can only be accessed by functions inside the object. This is called Encapsulation. This concept reduces the chance of 'breaking' something when programming, as when done properly only the object itself can directly manipulate its variables, so debugging problems is easier. The next part of an object, functions, represent things that the object can do or ways to interact with it. In the case of the square object, a function called ""area"" would calculate the area of the square the object represents, using the contents of the length and width variables inside the object. Those variables may already contain the length and width of the square, in the case they did not, the area function might also take user input for the length and width of the square the object represents and then calculate the area based on the user input.

, Inheritance is when an object is created based on another object, so therefore, it ""inherits"" all of its variables and functions. For example, an extension to the earlier square area calculation program would have a main object, called a polygon. In geometry, a polygon is basically a ""closed shape"", i.e a square, triangle, circle, cube, etc. All polygons can have their area calculated, just the method of achieving such is different. So, in our program, the polygon object would have length and width variables, and an area function. Since a polygon is not actually a shape, but a class of shapes, the area function would not do anything. When you want to create an object for a particular kind of polygon (i.e a triangle), you would use inheritance to create the object with all the properties of its ""parent"", the polygon object. You would then cite the actions the area function inherited would perform. This concept is called ""Inheritance"". It makes much more sense when dealing with large programs, where objects typically contain lots of lines of code, in which rewriting an object similar to another would be tedious and pointless, when Inheritance can be used to get the same properties and methods of the parent object.

, In Object-Oriented Programming, the two big languages are Java and C++. Both are good languages for various things. Many people will try to tell you that one is good and the other is bad, though you should try both and decide for yourself which one you like more.

Below is a macro which builds cell references, and although it does not select them, it does perform other useful tasks with them.,Set up a workbook with Sheet1 having in cells A1 to A60000 the values 1 to 60000.,
In the Excel Menu, Preferences, set the Ribbon Developer to checked or On, so you can work with macros.,Copy the macro below using Advanced Editing to a text processor like MS Word and do a REPLACE ALL for ""#** "" (w/o the quotes and with the trailing space) over all the entire selection.,Copy the selection and paste it over your dummy macro in Excel by choosing the (VB) EDIT(OR) icon button under Developer on the Ribbon.,
Run the macro by choosing menuitem Tools .. Macros .. and the name of the macro, or,Create a button by selecting the button icon to the right of the Record icon, and assigning your macro to it, then pressing the button on your worksheet to run the macro.,
Here's the macro to do the REPLACE ALL on (down to End Sub):

Set UserRange = Application.InputBox _
(Prompt :=""Range to erase:"", _
Title :=""Range Erase"", _
Default :=Selection.Address, _
Type := 8)
' Type 8 refers to a cell reference, as a range object.
',The user will select the range with the mouse and/or shift key and the absolute reference will appear in the Input Box prior to erasure.,This sort of macro can also be used to fill a range with random numbers, etc.,Watch as much of the following video as you care to, and then come back here by using your ESC key or the BACK button in your browser while in YouTube.",How to Select Cells and Ranges in Excel Visual Basic,",,,,,,,,,,, The first example shown above will return an error if the active cell is in columns A through D, since moving four columns to the left would take the active cell to an invalid cell address.

,,,,, Note also that the Union method does not work across sheets. For example, this line works fine

Set y = Application.Union(Range(""Sheet1!A1:B2""), Range(""Sheet1!C3:D4""))
but this line
Set y = Application.Union(Range(""Sheet1!A1:B2""), Range(""Sheet2!C3:D4""))
returns the error message:
Union method of application class failed



,, Each example states the range of cells in the sample data that would be selected.,,, _ End(xlDown).Address).Select
When this code is used with the sample table, cells A1 through A4 will be selected.

, _ End(xlUp).Address).Select

When this code is used with the sample table, it will select cells A1 through A6.



, The range selected by the CurrentRegion method is an area bounded by any combination of blank rows and blank columns. The following is an example of how to use the CurrentRegion method:

ActiveSheet.Range(""a1"").CurrentRegion.Select
This code will select cells A1 through C4. Other examples to select the same range of cells are listed below:
ActiveSheet.Range(""A1"", _ #*ActiveSheet.Range(""A1"").End(xlDown).End(xlToRight)).Select or
ActiveSheet.Range(""A1:"" & _ ActiveSheet.Range(""a1"").End(xlDown).End(xlToRight).Address).Select
In some instances, you may want to select cells A1 through C6. In this example, the CurrentRegion method will not work because of the blank line on Row 5. The following examples will select all of the cells:
lastCol = ActiveSheet.Range(""A1"").End(xlToRight).Column lastRow = ActiveSheet.Cells(65536, lastCol).End(xlUp).Row ActiveSheet.Range(""A1"", ActiveSheet.Cells(lastRow, lastCol)).Select or
lastCol = ActiveSheet.Range(""a1"").End(xlToRight).Column lastRow = ActiveSheet.Cells(65536, lastCol).End(xlUp).Row ActiveSheet.Range(""a1:"" & _ ActiveSheet.Cells(lastRow, lastCol).Address).Select

There are dozens of languages to choose from, and all excel at different tasks and implementations. Some of the most popular languages for new developers include:C - One of the older computer languages, but still widely-used. Learning C will also give you a leg up when you expand to C++ and Java.

C++ - One of the most popular languages in use today, especially in software development. Learning C++ will take a while, and mastering it even longer, but there are countless opportunities once you know it.

Java - Another incredibly popular language that can be scaled to work on nearly any operating system.

Python - This is one of the simpler languages in use, and the basics can be learned in just a couple days. It is still quite powerful, and used in a lot of server and website applications.;
, You will need a few tools in order to start writing code. These tools are referred to as your ""development environment"". What you will need varies depending on the language you are coding.

Code editor - Nearly all programmers will benefit from having a dedicated code editor installed. While you can write code using a simple text editor like Notepad, you'll find the process much easier if you have a program that highlights syntax and automates a lot of the repetitive programming tasks. Some popular code editors include Notepad++, TextMate, and JEdit.
Compiler or interpreter - Many languages, such as C and Java, need to be compiled before you can execute the code. You will need a compiler for your chosen language installed on your computer. Most compilers will also perform bug-reporting duties.
IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - Some programming languages have a code editor, compiler, and error-catcher all integrated into one program called an IDE. You can usually get this IDE from the programming language's website.

, If you've never programmed before, you're going to need to start small. Find some tutorials online that can walk you through the basic concepts of your chosen language. This could include learning about syntax, variables, functions, routines, conditional statements, and how they all fit together.

There are a variety of places online that provide good tutorials, including Udemy, Khan Academy, Codecademy, Code.org, and many more., Manipulating sample code can help you learn how to perform tasks using that language. There are countless sample and open-source programs available that let you access all of the code that makes the program work. Start with simple programs that are related to the kind of programs you want to make., When it comes time to start writing your own code, start with the basics. Write a few programs with simple inputs and outputs. Practice techniques you'll need with more complex programs, such as data handling and subroutines. Experiment and try to break your own programs., Being able to talk to a knowledgeable programmer about any issues you have is invaluable. You can find countless like-minded programmers on various sites and communities around the internet. Join a few related to your chosen language and read everything you can. Don't be afraid to ask questions, but be sure that you've tried to come up with a solution on your own first., You won't be able to make a program the first time you sit down at your keyboard (not a complex program, anyway). Learning how to use the programming language effectively takes time, but with practice you'll soon be coding much faster and more efficiently., Before you start coding your program, it will help to have some written material to refer to during the programming process. The design document outlines the goals of the program and describes the features in depth. This allows you to stay focused on the function the program.

The design document should discuss each of the features you want to include and how they will be implemented.
The design document should also consider the user experience flow and how the user accomplishes his or her task using the program.

, Create a map for your program, indicating how the user gets from one part to another. A simple flowchart is usually perfectly fine for a basic program., The goals of the program will dictate the structure that you pick. Knowing which one of the following structures best relates to your program will help focus the development., This is the most simple type of program, and allows you to get comfortable with your programming language. Basically, a 1-2-3 program starts, asks for input from the user, and then displays a result. After the result is displayed, the program ends.

The next step after a 1-2-3 is a REPL (Read-Execute-Print Loop). This is a 1-2-3 program that goes back to 1 after displaying the output.
Consider a Pipeline program. This is a program that transforms user input and runs continuously. This is a method good for programs that require little user interaction, such as an RSS reader. The program will be written as a series of classes that share a loop.

, A prototype usually focuses on the main feature of the program. For example, if you're creating a personal organizer program, your prototype may be the calendar and event-adding function., Your prototype should be able to be used as its own program. It will be the foundation of everything else, so make sure its working properly. As you iterate on the feature, continue to refine it until it works smoothly and efficiently.

The prototype allows you to make rapid changes and then test them out.
Have others test your prototype to ensure that it functions properly.
Expect the prototype to change as you work on it.

, The whole point of the prototype is to experiment before committing. The prototype allows you to see if the features you want are possible before you dive into coding the program proper. If the prototype is doomed to fail, scrap it and return to the drawing board. It will save you a lot of headache down the line, This is the skeleton for your project, and will serve as the base for future coding. Pseudo-code is similar to code but won't actually compile. Instead, it allows programmers to read and parse what is supposed to be happening with the code.

Pseudo-code still refers to the syntax of the programming language, and the pseudo-code should be structured just like regular code would be.

, You can use your existing prototype as the base for your new program, or you can adapt the prototype code into the larger structure of your full program. In either case, make good use of the time that you spent working on and refining the prototype., This is the real meat of the process. Coding will take the longest time, and will require numerous compiles and tests to ensure that the code works. If you are working with a team, starting from pseudo-code can help keep everyone on the same page., Use your programming language's comment feature to add comment to all of your code. Not only will this help anyone who works on your program figure out what the code does, but it will also help you remember what your own code does when you come back to the project later., Every new feature added to the program should be compiled and tested. The more people that you can get to test, the more likely that you'll be able to spot errors. Your testers should be made aware that the program is far from final and that they can and will encounter serious errors.

This is often referred to as alpha testing.

, Once you've implemented all of the features in your program, you should begin a round of intensive testing that covers all aspects of the program. This round of testing should also include the largest number of testers yet.

This is often referred to as beta testing.

, As you continue to make adjustments and add assets to your program, make sure that the version you intend to release has been thoroughly tested., The nature of the program will determine the assets you will need. Do you need custom sounds? Artwork? Content? All of these questions should be answered before you release your program., If you need a lot of assets, but don't have the manpower or talent to create them yourself, you can consider outsourcing asset creation. There are countless freelancers out there that may be willing to work on your project., Make sure that they do not interfere with the functionality of your program, and that there is nothing superfluous. Adding assets usually occurs int eh final stages of the programming cycle, unless the assets are integral to the program itself. This is most often the case in video game programming., This allows others to take the code you've made and improve on it. Open-source is a community-driven model of releasing, and you will likely see little profit. The benefits are that other programmers could take interest in your project and help expand the scope significantly., If you want to sell your software, you can create a storefront on your website to allow customers to buy and download your software. Keep in mind that if you have paying customers, they will expect a working and error-free product.

Depending on your product, there are a variety of services that you can sell it through as well.

, After releasing your software, you will likely start receiving bug reports from new users. Categorize these bugs by their critical levels, and then start tackling them. As you update the program, you can release new versions or patches that update specific parts of the code.

Strong post-release support can increase your customer retention and spread good word of mouth.

, People will need to know your software exists before they start using it. Give out review copies to relevant review sites, consider creating a free trial version, write a press release, and do everything you can to spread the word about your software."

Understand comments.,
Use variables.,
Use control structures.,
Use data structures.,
Use proper syntax.,
Utilize tools.",How to Program1," Comments are text which does not appear or affect the program in any way. These are used by programmers to leave notes or information for themselves or future programmers. Generally, one or a series of characters will tell the computer that text is a comment and not part of the program, though what those characters are will depend on the programming language being used.For example, using the Python language the hash or number sign indicates a comment. In C++, it’s //.;
, Variables make up a large portion of any program code. These are how the program stores information. Essentially, you will create a tag for the information you are storing and then tell the program what the information is. This can look something like: spam = ‘wikiHow rocks’. Now whenever the program later searches for spam, it will know that that is wikiHow rocks.


This type of code can be used, for example, to let a program learn someone’s name, by recording it from an earlier input and attaching it to a variable.

, Basically, control structures tell your program how to navigate or what to do. If you’ve ever done a choose-your-own-adventure book, this is pretty much what control structures are. In programming, this usually takes the shape of statements that use “if”, “while” or “for” statements, for example. You will need to use these statements and use them correctly if you want to program correctly.

, Data structures are a program’s shorthand for accessing a lot of information at once. This will keep you from having to type in lots of variables, as you can instead just type in any new information and attach it properly to the list using code. Examples of data structures you might use include lists or key/value pairs (sometimes called HashMaps)., Programming languages really are just like other languages in many ways. And just like other languages, there are rules that make programming ‘sentences’ either work or not work. Syntax refers to the specific order or layout of words, symbols, and numbers that make a programming language function. It is important that you learn the proper syntax for the programming language you are learning, since (unlike in spoken language) the computer will not automatically understand when you make a mistake and compensate for it.

, There are a number of tools that can be used to help you write your code, such as IDEs. Programs like IDEs can allow you to better visualize your code. Make sure you research and know some of the tools that are available to you, as this can make programming much simpler.


While most IDEs are specific to a particular programming language, others are more multipurpose, like Microsoft’s Visual Studio.

Be persistent.,
Be Judicious.,
Practice tact and diplomacy.,
Be Persuasive.",How to Recognize a Good Software Tester from the Lot," Good testers find it exciting to explore unknown domains. Finding bugs is their passion and therefore are not afraid of being in any unknown situations.;
, Good testers like to solve issues and therefore never back out till they find out the root cause for the non-functioning of the application or software satisfactorily.

, Good testers never take no for an answer. They keep on trying till they uncover all the bugs in the application or software. They make use of every possible means but will never accept defeat.

, Good testers exercise good judgment. Before the testing actually starts they decide upon issues like what to be tested, what kind of testing to be done and if a bug is discovered they double-check it so as to make sure that it is worth to be filed. They take utmost care not to waste valuable time and resources unnecessarily.

, When a tester exposes a bug it is actually pointing a finger at the programmer who has written the code. A good tester knows how to handle the situation tactfully so that he doesn’t rub the programmer/programmers in a wrong way. He manages crunch situations delicately so that the atmosphere remains calm and cool.

, Sometimes the defects filed by the testers may not look serious enough to be fixed. Good testers know how to convince others with his cogent remarks and also demonstrate why the bugs need to be fixed.

Let kids learn programming too!",How to Program2," Lots of colleges and universities have programming degrees or certification programs. This will be the best way to learn as you will have a teacher who can answer all your questions and help you learn key skills in the correct order. A programming degree can also help you get lots of jobs very easily, as it is a skill that is very much in demand.

, There are a number of online universities that you can attend for a fee or for free. These sometimes may not offer degrees but will offer the same amount of education. If you pay tuition, you should generally expect that a degree will be offered.


Good free online university programs in computer programming include MIT’s OpenCourseware and Coursera.

, There are several companies who offer help with programming, especially since they are very reliant on programmers improving their product. Use the resources provided by these companies to learn even more about programming. Examples include Google’s University Consortium and Mozilla’s Developer Network.

, Lots of regular people have lessons in programming available on their own personal websites as well. These can be really useful for learning how to do specific things in a variety of programming languages.

, There are even a number of programs designed to help kids learn programming. Since programming is really just another language, they’ll have an easy time picking it up while they’re still young. Avoid kits, as these don’t really teach anything, but programs like MIT’s Scratch can be very helpful.

Consider C, C++, C# and related languages.,
Try Java or JavaScript.,
Consider Python.,
Try PHP.,
Consider other languages as well.",How to Program3," These programming languages are mostly used in creating computer software. C is one of the most basic languages and is a great place to start when learning programming. C++ is relatively easy and commonly used but largely on the way out in favor of C#.

, Java is used in computer programs but is mainly used extensively for internet plugins and displays. Javascript is used frequently in programming games for mobile platforms and computers. Both are very commonly used and seem to be going strong, so these are good languages to learn if you want to work in those industries.

, Python is a very powerful programming language that can be used in all sorts of contexts, from web to software. If you want to get a job as a programmer, this would be an important language to learn. Python was designed to be easy to use and for some people it will be much easier to learn than other languages as well.

, PHP is usually used for web-based programming. It is a simple language which is usually used to collect data or generate content. If you just want to do internet stuff, PHP can be a good language to learn. It is especially helpful for hackers, as many website vulnerabilities are accessed through PHP.

, There are too many languages to list here, but you should certainly look into all of your options. If you want to learn programming in order to get a job as a programmer, you should look at as for the type of jobs you want to get. Look at the common languages asked for in those ads and try to learn those languages. You will probably have to learn more than one language if you want to do serious programming.

Start your program running under the debugger.,
While it is being slow, halt it manually.,
Record the call stack.,
Restart it, halt it again, and record again.,
Examine the call stack samples for common statements.,
Examine statements that appear on multiple call stacks.,
Fix the problem.,
Do it all again, and again.",How to Optimize Your Program's Performance," If it is a kind of program that normally runs very fast, but you want it to go faster, you can add a temporary outer loop of say, 1000 times, to give you enough time to halt it.;
, Do this by striking a break or pause key that makes the program stop wherever it happens to be. Do not do this by setting a breakpoint in the code, because then you will not be able to see what it was doing when you struck the key.

, What you need to record is the file and line number of each statement on the call stack. Hopefully there is an easy way to copy-paste this information into a text editor, but if not, do it the hard way, with paper and pencil.

, You can either continue execution from where you were, or completely restart the program. Either way is OK. You can do this several times, up to about 20.

, You may find it helpful to group the call stack samples into an indented tree structure, so you can see the commonality between samples. It is important to remember that you are capturing statements, not functions. The line numbers are really important.

, These are your candidates for optimization. For example, if there is some statement at file Foo.cpp, line 127, that happens to show up on 8 out of 20 samples, then you should take a good look at that statement and see if what it is doing is really necessary, because if you could get rid of it, you would save about 40% of the execution time.

, And enjoy the speedup.

, Until you can't find anything else to optimize. Chances are your program is now many times faster than it was to begin with.

, A full stop . is the output command. This reads the number in the current square, then outputs the corresponding ASCII character (this is why you need the ASCII table).

, A comma , is the input command. This will ask you to input a string of characters. It will take the first character and store it's ASCII value in the current square, overwriting any value already there.

, Otherwise, it will continue to the next instruction. When the program encounters a ], it will skip back to the corresponding [ Loops can be nested (placed one inside the other).

, If you understand the instructions above, you should be able to figure out how it works. It will print Hello World! on the screen.   ++++++++>+>+>->>+<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.

, There are many derivatives of brainf**k. Some of them add new features. Others simply replace the instructions with different words.


Ook! is a simple derivative of brainf**k. It doesn't change any instructions, it just replaces them with ooks. Here's the translation: < = Ook? Ook.   > = Ook. Ook?   + = Ook. Ook.   - = Ook! Ook!   . = Ook! Ook.   , = Ook. Ook!   = Ook? Ook!      Ook! was designed to be read by orangutans (as a joke).
Blub is another simple derivative. It's exactly the same as Ook!, just swap the word Ook for the word Blub e.g. [ = Blub? Blub!      As Ook! was designed for orangutans, Blub was designed for fish.

Make sure that your parallel world gets to GPU as well.",How to Program a 2D Engine," This is the most basic step of what you select. You can use C/C++ along with some functions rewritten with assembly. This will make your engine faster and reveal the innermost of the libraries you use.

C is a good and fast choice.
C++ is much better in design, but suffers on performance a bit.
Java can be good. It's OS independent, speed and structured.
Assembly is a hard one, but controlling it is the best bet.;
, You could start with an API like OpenGL or DirectX, but it depends on your adventure. If you want a reliable engine and do not want to spend time, use an API. But if you have plenty of time and want to learn the innermost of the engine, then the recommendation is simple: go solo., You have to search the web for reliable content on things like raster graphics, vector graphics, lightning and shadows, collisions, physics (for a fighting simulation, of course), and much much more.

Wikipedia is your best friend. Search its portals and you will find amazing knowledge on every aspect.
Buying the books on programming games might come in handy.

, You will be frustrated by the difficulty of the job, but do not turn back. Always be motivated. Learn. Create. Don't look back., Prepare an idea of what you will make and what you won't. Clearing your mind at this step will help in the long run., Draw your required graphics, like the screen, players etc., As you may know, parallel programming is faster. So divide it. Some portions include:-

Rendering pipeline
Gravity
AI
Next screen
Controlling the above elements (the most important!)

, Just think what will happen, how and why and who will make that happen. It will help in coding.

Donald Knuth said that pre-optimizations are root of the evil. Throw away the faster and the slower parts, and focus on the engine. But remember to sort them out after the engine is completed.

, Rastering is the displaying of every pixel on the screen.

Use the ""ignore the color"" format to erase the previous image. In BitBlt of Windows, this has raster code BLACKNESS and WHITENESS. Note that, you have to draw the background of the screen if you have it.
Use the ""AND"" format to draw the Sprite of the image. In BitBlt of Windows, this is the raster code: SRCAND.
Use the above format to draw texture on the sprite.

, You'll need to understand and provide for the dynamics of your environment., Strictly speaking, lighting is not required in 2D engines, but you can add it if you'd like., You can use the shadow volume technique for shadows. However, it's not needed since you don't need lighting., Depending on the type of engine and game, you can think of yourself that ""What would I do in this situation"" and create its algorithm. For example, in a fighting simulation, if the AI is at 4th floor, and there are 2 opponents at the first floor and a rocket launcher spawned at the 3rd floor, then instead of going straight to the first floor, the AI should head to the 3rd floor. If you are using OOP, then in your AI class, this will be a decide function., This involves drawing everything to an bitmap in the memory, and then drawing the bitmap to the screen.This will be a bit slow and memory inefficient, but it will remove flicker and make the engine more smooth., For example, in a simple animation, a simple algorithm will state that ""erase:decide:draw"". However, if the decide is more complex, there will be a significant difference in the erase and draw, producing flicker. You must use ""decide:erase:draw""., When the engine starts, occupy a useful amount of RAM and divide it in your engine using programming. The OS is busy and will show latency in fulfilling your demand, so have RAM in advance., Use some of the most important elements often so that they are stored in L1 cache. Doing this would speed things. Cache of L2 uses 7ns, whereas reading 1MB from RAM takes 250 us., Use SIMD special instructions to work in parallel. Moreover, take full advantages of so many cores of processor by creating parallel units. The CreateThread function in Windows and Fork in Linux are beneficial., The latest integrated GPUs have 10 execution cores with 1200 MHz. Too slow to compete with GTX 8800, but is an overkill for your engine."
"
Since a cellular automaton produces visual phenomena, you will need to use a programming language in which you know how to render graphics to the screen.,
Assuming that you have a programming language in which you know how to create simple graphics, the first task is to understand what a cellular automaton looks like and how it evolves over time.,
That's basically all the Game of Life is - just a 2D grid of cells.,
To draw this grid to the screen, you need a double-nested loop which reads each cell, calculating each position depending on its place in the grid.,You will then need a loop which constantly reads the cells and generates the next generation from them using the Game of Life's rules.,
The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:

If a cell (whether ON or OFF) has exactly 2 or 3 ON cells in the 8 cells surrounding it, then that cell becomes (or remains) ON.,After the new generation has been created, it should replace the old one and become the current generation.,
Now the process repeats: clear the screen, redraw the grid, calculate the next generation as described above.,
That's it!,
Once you've got it working and have had fun watching it, you might want to try making your own rules.",How to Make the Conway's Game of Life Cellular Automaton," It doesn't have to be anything fancy - just blobs will do for the Game of Life. It may also be possible to render the Game of Life as text characters on a terminal.
,

The Game of Life is a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can either be ON or OFF.
Every timestep (normally called a 'generation'), every cell in the grid is checked, and it is turned ON or OFF depending on the rules of the CA. The rules of the Game of Life will be explained later.
This yields a new configuration of the CA. The process then repeats, such that the configuration of the CA keeps changing after every timestep. The result is surprisingly complex, and the shifting patterns of cells are often compared to the behaviour of single-celled organisms.

, The easiest way to model this is as a two-dimensional array. You can use any datatype you want, although since the Game of Life's cells have only two states, you only need a boolean datatype (ie. TRUE for ON, FALSE for OFF)., For example, if you have 100x100 cells, and you want the grid on screen to stretch from screen coordinates (0,0) to (600, 600), then the cell at index should be placed at position (x*6, y*6). You can represent the cells however you like: for example, filled blue blobs for ON cells, white blobs for OFF cells.,,
If an ON cell has fewer than 2 cells surrounding it as described above, it becomes OFF.
If an ON cell has more than 3 cells surrounding it, it becomes OFF.

,,, However, you won't see anything unless you provide an initial generation of ON cells for it to work from, since OFF cells don't do anything by themselves in the Game of Life. A suggestion for that is made below., For example, how about 'all cells with one ON cell next to them become ON'?"

Open a new Excel worksheet by opening the Excel application from the dock or Applications folder.,
Obtain the actual tartan and, probably with the aid of a magnifying glass, write down the color and number of the threads across in columns and do the same down in rows.,
Begin in column 2.,
Then do row 2, selecting the row, and make the color match as closely as possible to the tartan's actual thread color.,
Then do column 3, then row 3, then column 4, then row 4, etc., etc.,
Use the Grab application or do Copy Picture by using the Shift Key with Edit Copy and then do Paste Picture to a new worksheet by using the Shift Key again.,Open the application Preview and do File, New from Clipboard.,Export the file to the Desktop or into a new ""Tartans XL Work"" folder as a JPG file or PNG file format file and name the file ""My XL Tartan Picture"".,Quit Preview.,Click on Excel to activate it as the active application and choose the Media Tools icon along the very top of all the Tool Bars -- it has two tied piano notes in front and to the right of some images as its icon.,Select from within the Media Tools window, Shapes, and select the Heart Shape, or whatever shape you'd like your tartan to be within.,Click on a blank portion of the Excel worksheet, and a small heart (or the shape you've chosen) will appear.,Re-size it as you prefer -- about 3"" by 3"" on the screen is probably about right.,Do Format Shape Fill Picture and then choose the file, My XL Tartan Picture.jpg, to use as fill.,
Your image should resemble this one:
,
Done!,
Here is the macro code to create the tartan.,
OK. Before you can access the Visual Basic Editor, you'll need to go to Excel Preferences and set the Ribbon to checked for Developer.,

",How to Make a Tartan Heart Image in Excel,"

Set Preferences: In General - Set Use R1C1 reference style to checked or On.
Set column 1 to Format Column Width .5"" and Format Row Height .25""
Select Rows 2:200 and set Format Row Height to .06"" (but see Tips).
Select Columns 2:512 and set Format Column Width to .03"" (but see Tips).
Read through these steps and tips entirely before actually setting to work -- there's a time-consuming route (given first) and an easier way (via making a copy of the given macro) that will save a lot of time and effort! But to create your own tartan's pattern, you must be familiar with the concepts conveyed in the first part, starting with this next step:;
, Be exact as you possibly can be, it's important in achieving the exact effect of really replicating the tartan, precisely. Here's a picture of a tartan closeup which had its threads counted.
, Select the column. Make the color match the tartan's beginning thread color. Use the Color Wheel. Format Cells Fill the column (or to a designated row# stopping point) with the color., Use the Color Wheel. Format Cells Fill the row (or to a designated column# stopping point) with the color., continuing over and under this way until you've filled the screen with the full image of the tartan! Be patient with yourself and do the job right, although it may take you hours, or even days to finish. Working with the macros, however, takes much less time in the end., Then, whether you used the Grab app, or Paste Picture, do Command+v, copy.,,,,,,,,,, Well worth it, eh?, You use Advanced Editing to copy All the code to Word and do a Replace All of ""#* "" with nothing, and the code will result, which you can then paste into over a Visual Basic dummy macro you recorded that was meaningless. Read on first, however.

Note: In Sub Macro2(), at the end, there are some Directory path names in code lines which need to be changed to match your computer, please. You can find out what these are by recording a macro to save a file into the folder where you plan to save the tartan work and tartan macro.
It is suggested that you make a text copy of any modifications you make to the macro and store them in a Word file to the same folder, for example if you modify the code to make a different tartan than the Anderson tartan.
Remember, you can always broaden the columns and row heights to get a better look at what's what in terms of thread count relative to the vertical looping down the rows in Sub Macro3().

, Then Developer will appear on your Ribbon and when you click on it, you'll see the Record icon button., Macro1 say, before its end, perhaps overwriting the dummy recorded code, type in Macro2. That will call this Macro2 below, which you've copied in and pasted below Macro1. You therefore can RUN either Macro2 or Macro1 and accomplish the same effect -- completion of the tartan!  :D, The macro can take anywhere from 3.5 minutes to a half hour or more to run, depending on your processor (speed). The code could have been written to run quicker but it would have been less easy to understand. The line numbers are there to break up the code between different colors; a long section of code actually goes from what would be Line 841 to Line 870, typically. There are shorter sections where there were only single or double threads (otherwise, looping was used, so the max loop value for the last X03 of 5 means that there are 5+2 = 7 rows or threads in the last weft section of black. It is black because of Macro3 leaving the top cell of the 7 black. The first two rows have every other cell pasted from this origin cell; after that, the entire done rows are copied and pasted below per the X03 loop, which is much quicker. They are only done singly, however, as multiples would get confusing, given that the tartan is very inconsistent in how many threads per weft section there are, actually. That said, the macro is so very much faster than doing it manually, there is just No Comparison!!

Get a compiler.,
After installing DEV-CPP, open it.,
Get ready to write a program to display text in a textbox.,
In the main screen of DEV-CPP, go to File -> New -> Project.,
At the begin of your source, type ""#include <windows.h>"" (without the quotes).,
Write one method to handle all the messages and write another method where we will handle the messages from the resources.,
Make a Resource Script.,
Make your first control: a simple menu.,
The ""IDR_THEMENU"" part defines your menu as THEMENU.,
Now for the button part.,
The IDD_SIMPLECONTROL defines your dialog.,
That's it!,
Go to File -> New -> Source File.,
Save this file as resource.h Do you remember we did ""#include ""resource.h""""?,
Get back to the source, our Simple Program.c or whatever you called it.,
Don't worry too much with all the technical stuff here.,
Type:BOOL CALLBACK SimpleProc(HWND hWndDlg, UINT Message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam){switch(Message){case WM_INITDIALOG:return TRUE;case WM_COMMAND:switch ( LOWORD (wParam) ) {case ID_HELLO:MessageBox(NULL,""Hey"", ""Hallo!,
This part handles the dialog messages.,
Make sure that your SimpleProc comes before the int WINAPI WINMAIN part!,
Press F9 to compile and run your program!

",How to Make a Window (an Application)," A compiler transforms your raw source code (which you will soon write) into an executable application. For the purpose of this tutorial, get DEV-CPP IDE. You can download it here.;
, You will be presented with a window with a text area where you will write your source code.

, Before you begin writing the source, keep in mind that Win32 applications don't behave in the same way as other languages, such as JAVA.

, You will be presented with another screen. Choose the little picture which says ""Windows Application"" and set the language as ""C"", not ""C++."" At the text box where it says ""Name"", enter ""Simple Program."" Now, DEV-CPP will ask you where you wish to save it. Save the file in any directory, but just be sure to remember it. As soon as you are done with that, you will be presented with a template on the source screen. Do Ctrl+A and then Backspace. The reason we are doing this is so that we can begin anew.

, This includes the windows library so that you can make an application. Directly beneath that, write: #include ""resource.h"" And then type: const char g_szClassName[] = ""myWindowClass"";

, Don't worry if this is confusing. It will become clear later on. Now, save your source as SimpleProg.c. We will be leaving it as is for the moment.

, A Resource Script is a piece of source code which defines all your controls (e.g: TextBox, Buttons, etc.) You will incorporate your Resource Script into your program and Voila! You will have a program. Writing the Resource Script isn't hard, but can be time consuming if you don't have a Visual Editor. This is because you will need to estimate the exact X and Y coordinates of the controls, etc. In your DEV-CPP main screen, go to File -> New -> Resource File. DEV-CPP will ask you ""Add resource file to current Project?"" Click YES. At the top of your resource script, type #include ""resource.h"", and also type #include <afxres.h> This takes care of all the controls.

, Type:, You can call it whatever you want, however. The BEGIN part is self explanatory. The POPUP ""&File"" makes a new menu category called File. The & sign allows the user of your application to type Ctrl+F on the keyboard and quickly access your menu :) The MENUITEM ""E&xit"", ID_FILE_EXIT adds a menu item to the File category. You must, however, define the menu item by doing ID_FILE_EXIT.

, Your button will be inside a dialog, so we must make the dialog first. Do this by typing:, The four numbers after the word ""DIALOG"" determine x-pos, y-pos, width, and height of the dialog. Don't worry too much about the Style part for now. The MENU IDR_THEMENU puts our old menu into the program. The CAPTION speaks for itself as does the font. The DEFPUSHBUTTON creates our button named ""Hello!"" and we define it by saying ID_HELLO and give it x-pos and y-pos and width and height coordinates.

, We're done with our resource script. Only one more thing remains. We have to assign values to all the things we defined in our resource script (e.g. IDR_THEMENU, etc.) Save the resource file as SimpleProg.rc

, Add the source file to the current project? Yes. You will be presented with a blank screen. To assign values to our defined controls, we give them numbers. It doesn't matter too much on which numbers you give your controls, but you should make them organized. For example, don't define a control by giving it a random number like 062491 or something. So type:, Well, this is why we did it. We needed to assign values.

, Type:, Just know that this parts returns the dialog to our message handling procedure called Simple Program.

,"", MB_OK)break; case ID_FILE_EXIT:EndDialog(hWndDlg, 0);break;}break;case WM_CLOSE:EndDialog(hWndDlg, 0); break; default: return FALSE;}return TRUE;}

, For example in the case ID_HELLO (our button), we make a message box saying hello. Also, in the case where we go to File and Exit, we close the window in case ID_FILE_EXIT.

, This is important if you want your program to work.

If you're on a Mac, download the latest version of webkit.Since the CSS module that can create marquees is a part of the webkit specification, you will need to get webkit installed on your machine.,
If you're using Windows, download the developer toolset.,
Add a CSS reference to your HTML file.,
Create a “div” line in your HTML file.,
Save your HTML file.,
Open a separate text document for your CSS style sheet.,
Set values to define the marquee.,
Set an 'overflow' on a new line.,
Save your CSS file.,
Open your HTML file with your browser.",How to Make a Scrolling Marquee in HTML1,";
, Unlike on Mac, there is no self-extracting installer for Windows. Windows users will need to install a number of developer tools to use webkit. All necessary tools and specifications can be downloaded here

, Open your HTML file and reference your CSS style sheet with the following code:.<head>
<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""mystyle.css"">
</head>


You can write the CSS reference before creating the CSS file, but you must be sure that the CSS filename matches the one in your code (in this example, “mystyle.css"").
Your HTML and CSS code will remain separate, but run together when you load your HTML file., Your code might look something like:.<div class=""marquee"">Scrolling text goes here.</div>


div is an HTML element that defines the area on the page that will contain components of the code, in this case your scrolling marquee.

, “Go to File > Save As…” Append your HTML file with a .html extension.

, The shorthand syntax for creating a scrolling marquee with CSS is : “-webkit-marquee: ”. The webkit tag is necessary because the CSS module that contains the marquee class is part of the Webkit CSS specification.will define which direct the marquee scrolls
measures the pixel distance between each step of the scroll
is the number of times the marquee will run
can determine a simple scroll or bouncing text
is how fast the text moves.

, Set the values in the brackets (remove the brackets, since they are just a placeholder). This will tell your marquee how to act on the page. Your code might look like:.-webkit-marquee: auto medium infinite scroll normal;


The ‘auto’ direction uses the default right-to-left, ‘medium’ sets a default interval of 6 pixels, ‘infinite’ sets the marquee to run an unlimited number of times, ‘scroll’ sets the style to a linear movement, and ‘normal’ is a default setting for scrolling speed.

, Add .overflow-x: -webkit-marquee; to a new line in your code. This will make the text scroll continuously along instead of stopping at the edge of the div.’overflow-x’ specifies what to do with text that exceeds the limit of the space on the x-axis.
'-webkit-marquee' is directing the overflow command towards the marquee module in webkit.
Your full code might look like:.-webkit-marquee: auto medium infinite scroll normal;
overflow-x: -webkit-marquee;


, “Go to File > Save As…” Append your CSS file with a .css extension.

, Drag and drop the file to your browser to open. Your scrolling marquee will display on the page.


Use a webkit supported browser, like Chrome or Safari to make sure the marquee displays as expected.

Create more!",How to Make a Program Using Notepad," Since Notepad is a plain text editor, you can use it to write code for any language, from C to HTML. You can open Notepad from the Accessories folder in your Start menu, or by searching for ""notepad"".


In the sections below, you will find some basic examples for a few different programming languages.;
, If you want to use your code in the compiler or interpreter for the language you are programming in, you will need to save the file in the language's format. Click File → Save As. In the ""Save as type"" drop-down menu, select ""All files (*.*)"". Enter the extension for the language you are writing.

, While you can certainly write entire programs in Notepad, it's definitely not the easiest way. Notepad doesn't contain any syntax highlighting or indentation options, making it difficult to use for writing larger pieces of code. Consider a program such as Notepad++, which is designed around programming syntax and is also free.

, Notepad is most commonly used to create Batch files. Batch files are programs used to automate functions through the command prompt. You can use batch files to apply changes to a number of files at once, create backup systems, and more.


Below are a few basic Batch file examples.

, This is a simple program that can backup files from one folder to another, only backing up files that have been modified since the last backup.

, If you find yourself testing networks and internet connectivity often, this batch file will quickly display the IPConfig and Ping information for you.

, When writing a Batch file in Notepad, you will want to save it as a .BAT file. This will change the file into a Batch file that can be executed by double-clicking it or running it from the command prompt.


Click File → Save As. In the ""Save as type"" drop-down menu, select ""All files (*.*)"". Enter the extension "".bat"" at the end of the file. When you save it, the file will turn into a Batch file, allowing you to run it.

, There is a lot that you can do with Batch files. You can add delays, make a program for compressing files, add a password, and much more.


See this guide for more details on creating Batch files.

, Python is a popular programming language for web scripting, and is one of the easier languages to learn. Python programs don't need to be compiled; you just need the interpreter installed on your system. Most Python programs are run through the command line interface.


Below are a few basic Python file examples.

, This is one of the easiest programs to create and teaches you the basics of constructing programs in Python. It simply displays the phrase ""Hello, World!"" on the user's screen.

, This simple program will calculate Fibonacci numbers up to 100. You can change the 100 value in the second line to whatever you'd like to change the number of results you get. Make sure to include the indentations, as that is how Python designates functions.

, You do not need to compile Python programs in order to run them. If you have a Python interpreter installed on your system, you can simply run the saved Python file to execute the program. Click File → Save As. In the ""Save as type"" drop-down menu, select ""All files (*.*)"". Enter the extension "".py"" and save the file. This will allow your Python interpreter to open the file.

, Even though it's a fairly simple language, Python is very powerful and you can make a lot of useful stuff with it. You can create lists, loops, and graphing charts. You can even make games using Python.


See this guide for more details on learning the Python language.

, C is one of the older programming languages around, and is the base for many of the more popular languages being used currently, such as C++ and Objective-C.


Below are a few basic C file examples.

, This is one of the easiest programs to create and teaches you the basics of constructing programs in C. It simply displays the phrase ""Hello, World!"" on the user's screen. Make sure to include the indentations, as they denote functions.

, Much of what you'll be doing in C involves taking and manipulating user input. This basic program allows you to take a number and store it as a variable, which is the first step towards constructing larger programs.

, C requires a compiler in order to turn the code into a working program. Click File → Save As. In the ""Save as type"" drop-down menu, select ""All files (*.*)"". Enter the extension "".c"" and then save the file. This will allow you to open it in your compiler.

, This is the very tip of the iceberg when it comes to C, which is a very powerful programming language. There is a lot you can do with C programs: you can compare strings, delay the program, make an alert, and much more.


See this guide for more details on programming in C.

, It's probably the most simple language so far out there.


Below comes a few examples

,


As it sounds, it's literally ""print Hello World"" (without quotes) you type.

,

Plan on what information you want your cookie to collect.,
Use HTML.,
Note however that standard HTML does not have commands.,
Consider tracking cookie software as an alternative to writing your own code.,
Add security to your cookie.,
Give your cookie an expiration.",How to Make a Tracking Cookie," Before you make a tracking cookie, you should determine what type of information you want to track from visitor's to your Web site. For instance, you may find it important to know the zip code of a person visiting your Web site if your Web site sells products that require shipping costs and certain sales taxes.;
, If you have created your Web site using HTML code and are somewhat familiar with programming, you can make a tracking cookie from scratch.


Use the “Response” command to write a cookie on a visitor's computer. “Response.Cookies(“CookieName”)=value” is the most basic form of this code. The code: “Response.Cookies(""VisitorName"")=Request.Form(""UserName"")” would allow you to keep track of a visitor's user name.
Use the “Request” command to retrieve the cookie. “Request.Cookies(""CookieName"")” would allow you to retrieve the information from the visitor's computer when the visitor returned to your Web site.

, ""Response"" and ""Request"" are part of Microsoft's ASP (active server pages). See http://www.w3schools.com/asp/coll_cookies_response.asp If your web server does not support ASP, you'll have to investigate other methods of generating cookies, such as CGI scripts or PHP.

, There are software programs out there that will do the heavy coding for you.


Software will allow you to make certain kinds of cookies; sometimes a single type of software will only allow you to make a specific cookie. Some of this software is considered “freeware,” and thus won't cost you anything. Tracking cookie software can help with restricting how many times a visitor can download software from your Web site by remembering that the software was already downloaded.

, Internet security is a key concern of most Internet users. It’s important to provide security so that visitors' information is protected.


A domain property will restrict the cookie from being read by another Web site. A sample of the code for this is: Response.Cookies(""CookieName"").Domain = ""www.mydomain.com""
A path property restricts the cookie to being read by a specific path. A sample of the code for this is: Response.Cookies(""CookieName"").Path = ""/maindir/subdir/path""

, A cookie will expire once the Web browser the visitor uses to view your Web site is closed. An expiration date must be set if you want to store the cookie so that when the user comes back the information is saved. An example of this code is: Response.Cookies(""CookieName"").Expires=#January 01, 2010# (assuming a January 01, 2010 expiration date).

Open your HTML document.,
Set a background color.,
Set a scrolling direction.,
Specify the number of loops for your marquee.,
Specify the marquee text.,
Load your HTML file.",How to Make a Scrolling Marquee in HTML2," Note that using the HTML marquee tag is outdated and strongly discouraged in web design. HTML files can be opened with a simple text editor If you are starting from scratch, open a text file and enter this sample code:



.<marquee style=”background-color:#000080;”direction=”right” loop=”20” width=”75%”>This is a scrolling marquee</marquee>


, You can change the background of your marquee by specifying a hexadecimal (hex) value, or a RGB (Red Green Blue) value after the ""background-color:"" part of the code. The default value listed in the sample code, #000080, is navy blue.


For example:.<marquee style=”background-color:#000080;”></marquee>

A full list of colors and their values can be found online., Change the “direction” attribute in the code to any of the following: right, left, up or down.


For example:.<marquee direction=”right”</marquee>


, The “loop” attribute controls how many times the marquee should loop. If you want it to run continuously, leave out this attribute entirely.


An example with the attribute omitted could be:.<marquee style=”background-color:#000080;”direction=”right” width=”75%”>This is a scrolling marquee</marquee>


, The text inside the <marquee> tag and the </marquee> tag will be the scrolling text of your marquee. Write whatever you want your marquee to say here.


For example:.<marquee>Watch this text scroll by!</marquee>


, Drag and drop the file to your browser to open. Your scrolling marquee will display on the page.

Select the Rectangle tool from the Tools bar. Draw a rectangle about 10px high and 100px long and make it a movieclip (F8). This will be the bar that represents the amount of your movie that has loaded. In the Properties tab of the object, give this movieclip the instance name ""progressBar"".






Draw a text area on the stage that will hold the percentage of the movie that has loaded.When creating the textarea, make sure that the Type dropdown (near the top of the Properties tab) is set to Dynamic Text. Also in the Properties tab, click Character Embedding and select both ""Numerals"" and ""Punctuation"". (Tip: Hold down Ctrl while clicking to select multiple menu items.)Once created, give this textarea the instance name ""percentageLoaded"". Note: Do not make the textarea a symbol.

, If you've used the Actions window before, it may already be visible to you. If not, press F9 or use the menu Window>Actions.


Create a new layer in the timeline for only your ActionScript. You can use the New Layer icon below the timeline or the menu Insert>Timeline>Layer. This will keep your ActionScript separate and clear of movieclips and makes life much easier when you have hundreds of layers or movieclips.
Add the following code to the Actions frame. Read the comments in the code (marked with //) to see what each part does.

Download all the necessary software and files.,
Setup the Eclipse IDE.,

Make the project type a ""AVR Cross Target Application""
Ensure ""Debug"" is UN-CHECKED when selecting Build Configurations (and ensure ""Release"" IS CHECKED)
When asked for hardware details, make sure you select the correct frequency (typically 16000000 Hz) and the correct microcontroller, according to your arduino type ,
Extract the latest version of the arduino software from their website.,
Create main.cpp where you write your code for the Arduino in which you will declare as usual the main elements i.e.,
Optional: Fix any compiler-errors in arduino software.",How to Write Arduino Software in C," This includes:


The Arduino source code, available from . Optionally you can also download the software package for your platform (Windows/Linux/OSX) which includes all the pre-made C++ files that make arduino run, as well as the simple Java GUI aimed at non-programmers.
AVR-GCC, which is the compiler for the AVR-series of microcontrollers (heart of an Arduino). For Windows users, get WinAVR The Java Runtime Environment 32- and 64-bit are both available from Oracle.
The Eclipse IDE for C/C++ , where you will be doing your coding and uploading the code to your Arduino. Download the same version (32-bit or 64-bit) as your version of Java;
, First, install WinAVR or AVR-GCC. Then, extract the Eclipse IDE into its own dedicated folder.


Start-up Eclipse, and choose your default workspace
Go to Help --> Install New Software
Enter ""http://avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net/updatesite"" (no quotes) in the 'Work With' field , and click Add
Select the AVR Eclipse Plugin, select Next, and install
When successfully installed, you'll have to re-start Eclipse

,, Copy the entire '\hardware\arduino\cores\arduino' folder into your project folder. Now that Eclipse is installed and the plugin is configured, from now on this is the only folder needed to start new Arduino projects from scratch!

, void setup, void loop and int main. For example( In main.cpp(The main Arduino Code)). Include ""WProgram.h"" (with quotes) in this header as well; this links it to all the arduino code.
NOTE: As of Arduino 1.0, include ""Arduino.h"" instead of ""WProgram.h"".
Also, include the appropriate ""pins_arduino.h"" file from arduino-1.0.1\hardware\arduino\variants. Arduino Uno uses the ""standard"" variant.
These changes were made in the 2011.11.30 release of Arduino 1.0, according to the revisions.txt file that installs with the IDE.

, Compiler errors are going to be different for everyone depending on what your error was, which they you have to find out on your own or in the comments, because it's case dependent. As of arduino v0018, this may include the following changes;


main.cpp; delete ""#include <WProgram.h>"" at the top, and ensure your ""main.h"" is included instead
Tone.cpp; change the last two includes, <wiring.h> & <pins_arduino.h>, to have quotes instead of brackets (""wiring.h"" & ""pins_arduino.h"")
Print.h; the function declaration ""void function(int inputs) = 0;"" must be changed to ""void function(int inputs);"", or in other words delete the ""= 0"" so its not a pure-virtual function

Plan your program.,
Calculate the age in days.,
Display the result to the user.",How to Write a Program to Get Age in Days in C or C++," To calculate the age of the program-user in days, you'll first have to know his age in years and months. So, you'll have to ask the user to input is age in years and the remaining months. Try using the cin function in C++ or scanf function in C for this step.;
, You will have to convert both, the years and months into days.


One non-leap year has 365 days. Leap year has an additional day (total = 366 days). For the sake of simplicity of the program, we will take one year as 365 days. Therefore, to convert years into days, the conversion formula is:Days = Years x 365

For an accurate result, you can use 1 year = 365.25 days


One month has 30, or 31 or 28 days (in case of February). February can have 29 days, if the year is a leap year. Again, for the sake of simplicity, we take 1 month = 30 days. Therefore, to convert months into days, the conversion formula is:Days = Months x 30


, Once the calculation is complete, the result has to be displayed to the user. Try using the cout function in C++ or printf function in C for this step.

Declare Variables.,
Create some problems to use.,
Write your intro statement.,
Design how your problem system is going to work.,
Design a scoring system This is how score will be kept.,
Make the program wait for user to hit enter before it closes This is a very simple procedure:




std::cin.get();









,
Debug and compile the program.,
Run the program.",How to Write a Math Practice Program in C++,",, This is:




#include <iostream>
int main()
using namespace std;{









The first line of the code(#include <iostream>), which starts with a # symbol is called a pre-processor directive statement. Here, it directs the processor to add the contents of iostream file into the program.
, This is so that the compiler knows what type that the variables will be:




int result;
int solution;
int score;









, These can be any problems, but C++ is a very operator rich language so make sure to use parenthesis if you want a certain order of operations., This should say something about how the program works, and how to play. An example:




std::cout << ""This is math game"" << std::endl;
std::cout << ""To play, input your answer and press enter"" << std::endl;





, This should use if and else statements to tell the user if they are wrong. Your code should look something like this (note: you need to define all the variables used in this example beforehand):




std::cout << ""10 + 15 "";
std::cin >> result;
std::cin.ignore();
solution = 10 + 15;
 if ( result == solution ) {
   std::cout << ""Correct! "";
   score = score + 1;
   std::cout << ""Your current score is "" << score <<""\n"";
 } else {
   std::cout << ""You're wrong\n"";
 }





, The one in the example works by declaring score as an integer, then adding one to the score if the problem is correct. At the end, the scoring system should count up scores and tell the player if they failed or won. The code should look something like this:




std::cout << ""Your total score: "" << score <<""\n"";
 if ( score < 4 ) {
      std::cout << ""You failed!"";
 } else if ( score == 5 ) {
      std::cout << ""All correct! Nice job :-)"";
 } else {
      std::cout << ""Good job!"";
 }





,, Name it something like ""math_game.cpp""





, You should be able to play through it without any problems, assuming the code was compiled correctly.

This is the simplest way of creating a calculator in C++.",How to Write a Calculator Program in C," To download the Xcode application navigate to the App Store by clicking the App Store icon in the dock. Use the search bar located in the top right corner of the screen to search for the Xcode application by typing in 'Xcode'. Click 'Install App' to begin the installation process.;
, If not, locate the Xcode icon on your desktop and double click to open the application. Once open, the Xcode application will provide 3 options. The second option is perfect for creating simple applications such as a calculator.


Get started with a playground
Create a new Xcode project
Check out an existing project

, The command line interface will allow communication with the program. Developing a calculator requires a response to questions asked by the program and the command line interface allows visual prompts to be answered by commands.

, The name of the application should reflect the function of the program. Choose a simple yet descriptive name to be able to easily identify the program later on. Include the company name or class under 'Organization Name' to classify what or for whom this application is for. The language used in this article will be C++ so make sure the language setting is set to C++.

, To make things easier, create a folder with the name of the application and place it on the desktop for easy access. 

, This file was automatically created by the application and is a fully functional C++ program. The code in this file will not perform the functions of a calculator so it must be removed. To remove the information highlight the text and click the delete button.

, Using comments is essential in coding because it helps keep the program organized. To write a one-lined comment use 2 forward slashes followed by the comment.


//This is a comment.
Comments will appear in green and will not be taken into account when the program is compiled.
Use comments to title the program or clear up any confusing steps

,


include <iostream>  //This is a C++ standard library for input and output streams. This allows communication between the user and the program. With this library, you will be able to ask the user which numbers they would like calculated and what functions they want performed.
using namespace std; //This ensures the use of the standard libraries. This way you would not have to refer to the standard library (std) each time you wanted to call a function from that library.

, In this case, you would anticipate that the user will be inputting numbers to be calculated. Think about the simplicity or complexity of the program.


Would you like to limit the calculations to only 2 numbers?
Would you like the user to input how many numbers they would like to calculate?
In this case, using the first option to create a simple calculator will suffice.

, The program has a main function where all the code will be placed. These variables should go in the beginning of the main(); function in order to be used in later code. This calculator will only be receiving to numbers to calculate so there are already 2 variable to account for. Variables come in different types.


int //This is an integer variable such as the number 2. The number 2.5 would not be considered an int and the program would ignore the .5 after the 2 if this number was written as an int.
double //This is a decimal number such as 2.55
char // This is a single character such as 'A' or 'a'. **Note: these are 2 different characters
boolean //This returns 1 or 0 , Since this is a simple calculator, provide the 4 basic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Have the user enter a number or character to indicate which function they would like. **This would be another one of the variables to declare.


Output information using the line cout<<""info here"";
Input information using the line cin>>variable name here;
cout<<""Insert 1 for Addition"";

, To figure out which function should be performed, use an IF statement to filter through the options. IF statements will only run if the condition that follows it is fulfilled. So if the user is given 4 options (to input 1,2,3,or 4) there should be 4 IF statements to handle each option.

,, As you become more advanced there are different ways to create a more complex calculator.

Return to the included directive iostream remember this library allows the program to perform input and output of data to and from the keyboard.,
Exit code of the program.,
Run the program.",How to Use Date and Time in a C++ Program," If you are a Mac OS user Xcode, Visual Studio Code, Net Beans, Eclipse, etc. will suffice. If you are a Windows OS user Visual Studio 2015, Net Beans, Code: Blocks, Notepad++, etc. Also, there are online IDEs such as, Cloud 9, Codenvy, IDEone, and SourceKit to name a few.;
, To begin structuring a C++ program there are certain vital aspect of a C++ program that need to be in place. Let's begin with the include directives this statement is read by the compiler and lets the compiler know where to find certain methods and functions.The two included in this program are iostream library—which allows the program to perform input/output operations from a keyboard, mouse, or monitor. Secondly, the ctime library which contains built-in functions and data types for exploiting date and time information in programs.

, The next very important aspect of a C++ program is the “int main ()” declaration, which is the main(no pun intended) function where the C++ program will executed. The function is followed by two braces an open brace and a close brace. This is called the function body.

, There is a data type within the ctime library called time_t this will represent the variable for the time. This variable will be called “rawtime” Next, there is a time structure within the ctime (time.h) library that contains date and time components in a more granular manner (for example seconds after minute, days since Sunday, etc.) This variable will be named “timeinfo”.

, Also making use of the struct variable “timeinfo” this variable can be assigned to the function local time. Local time function evokes a variable with the value for the local timezone.

, In turn, the local time and date information can be display on the consoles screen.

, The main program is built to return some information, yet there still needs to be a function for the main program to know when to stop running. This is where return 0 comes into play, which simply ends the life of the main function.

, In the end, the program should run in the specified IDE with no errors and properly display the day, month, date number, time and year, respectively.

In the wizard that shows up next check the box that says empty project.

,,,

A function prototype will make a readily available function header which will be usable for underneath the programs main function, this is required for a void function to work.
Be sure to use a ‘&’ for the int variable, this will make the variable easier to move to each function.

,

Again be sure to write a ‘&’ for the correct variable in the function.

,

This header starts with ""int main()"" with brackets underneath the code to where the code for the main function will be.

,

Be sure to add the integer variable correct to equal 0 so that the program can understand how to use the integer variable correctly.

,

For instance you can type a cout function saying the question's name..
You will also use these cout functions for each answer that the user can use.

,

A ""cin"" function will let the user write down what the character for the choices in the multiple choice program.

,

To call a function you write down the functions name aswell as the parameters for example ""functionname(answer)"".
Be sure to write down the correct variables to put into the function so you do not switch them around.

,


Be sure to use a switch structure that compares the answer character that the user wrote for there answer.
Use breaks in each case to not let the program keep going through the switch structure.
Also be sure to increment the number correct on correct answers so the program knows if the user got the question right.

,,

Be sure to add the new function prototype for the next question under the first questions function prototype, this will make it so you can write the next questions function right underneath the function for the last question.

,






Be sure to add the end function in the main function so that you can send the program to the function.
Make the quiz display how many answers that the user has gotten correct, as well as writing down the percentage that the person has gotten right. Also make sure to use a double integer if you want to make the percentage have a decimal.

,






If you want to stop the program from exiting immediately type in “cin.ignore();” two times before the “return 0;” command so that you can exit the program by just hitting enter.

,

If it does not work be sure to look for any errors in the code, Visual Studio Express will show incorrect code with a red square on the scroll line and also by underlining the incorrect code.

Turbo C++ may not work in Windows Vista and Windows 7. You may have to run it through another program called DosBox.



 


Install the software DOSBox version 0.74






Create a folder,for example ""Turbo"" (C:\Turbo\):






Download and extract TC into the Turbo folder (c:\Turbo\):






Run the DOSBox 0.74 from the icon located on the desktop:






Type the following commands at the command prompt :
mount d c:\Turbo\ Now you should get a message which says: Drive D is mounted as a local directory c:\Turbo\






Type d: to shift to d:






Next follow the commands below:


cd tc
cd bin
tc or tc.exe
In the Turbo C++ go to Options>Directories> Change the source of TC to the source directory ( i.e. virtual D: refers to original c:\Turbo\ . So make the path change to something like D:\TC\include and D:\TC\lib respectively )






You can save yourself some time by having DOSBox automatically mount your folders and start TurboC++:
For DOSBox versions older then 0.74 browse into program installation folder and open the dosbox.conf file in any text editor. For version 0.73 go to Start Menu and click on “Configuration” and then “Edit Configuration“. Then scroll down to the very end, and add the lines which you want to automatically execute when DOSBox starts.;

, It is case sensitive, modular and structured., These are predefined words reserved by the language. Each keyword has a specific function. We cannot use keywords for any other purpose.

There are 32 keywords in C language.






Every keyword is case sensitive.
A keyword cannot be an identifier, variable or a function.
Examples of keywords : void, if, else, do.

, Variables are names given to certain memory blocks where the program will store certain values. To use a variable, the programmer will have to declare it first., Given below are the 4 most common and important data types and on the right hand side is their format-specifier.


int --> %d
float --> %f
char --> %c
double --> %f (Yes, float & double have the same format specifier)
Strings are a part of char but the format specifier for strings is %s

Introduce yourself to C++ language.,
Download and install a compiler.,
Find useful introductory resources and tutorials.",How to Program in C++ and Batch1," C++ is related to C programming language. Unlike its predecessor, C++ is an object-oriented programming language. The object is the primary unit of this language—every object has specific properties, functions, and methods., In order to create viable programs with C++, you will need to download and install a compiler. Compilers transform your code into operational programs. There are free compilers available for Windows, Mac, and Linux users.


Windows: Code::Blocks

Mac: Xcode

Linux: g++.

, Learning C++ is equivalent to learning a foreign language. Books, courses, and tutorials will help you establish a foundational understanding of this programming language. You will find a variety of free and purchasable resources online.


Consult a comprehensive list of books and guides.Enroll in a C++ programming course. You may find courses at your local college, library, adult education center, and/or online. You could even join a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course).
Complete a step-by-step tutorial. You can work your way through free tutorials or subscribe to a tutorial service, like Khan Academy or Lynda."

Launch your compiler and create a new C++ project.

,
Select ’’main.cpp.’’

,
Write a “Hello World” program.,
Understand the meaning of “#include <iostream>.” This line of code appears in the file’s header.,
Understand the meaning of “using namespace std;.” This line of code tells the compiler to use the standard C++ library.,
Understand comments.,
Understand the program’s function.",How to Program in C++ and Batch2,",, Traditionally, the first program people create simply reads “Hello World!”. When you create a new C++ project, the “Hello World!” program will automatically appear in the file. Erase the existing code and rewrite it for yourself:





#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//main () is where program execution begins.
int main ()
{
        cout <<”Hello World”; //prints Hello World
        return 0;
}




, The directive “#include” tells the program to include the file “<iostream>” in the current source file. Your C++ programs will not ""compile"" without this code, The standard C++ library is a collection of common functions and classes., Programmers use comments to annotate their code so that they (or anyone else reading the code) can understand more about what a particular section of code is meant to do. Comments appear in the code text but do not affect the program. In the ""Hello world"" program, ""//main () is where program execution begins"" is an example of a single line comment.


Single line comments always begin with ""//"" and stop when the line ends.

, In C++, functions execute individual tasks. In the “Hello World” program, int main() is the main function. Program execution begins at this line of code. The statements inside the brackets describe the actual function.


The statement cout << ""Hello World""; generates the words “Hello World” on your screen.
The statement return 0; terminates, or ends, the main function."
"
Understand batch files.,
Create a batch file.,
Save the file.,
Code a “Hello world” batch file.,
Understand “@echo.” In batch, commands are echoed, or displayed, on the output screen by default.,
Understand “@pause.” This command tells the command line processor to pause until the user presses a key on the keyboard.,
Run your batch file.",How to Program in C++ and Batch3," Batch files are exclusive to Windows—the Mac counterpart is a bash file. Batch files contain a one or more commands that are executed in sequence by a command line interpreter. These files are used to simplify basic and/or repetitive jobs such as opening multiple programs, deleting files, and backing up files.You may incorporate batch files into your C++ programs., Batch files are simple text files. You may create your batch files with Window’s text editor, Notepad.exe. Click Start and type “notepad” into the search bar, and select “Notepad” from the results., Click File > Save. Rename your file “HelloWorld.cmd.” Change the “Save as type” to “All Files (*,*).”


If you are using a modern version of Windows, use the extension .cmd. If you are using an older system, use the extension .bat., In the text editor, enter in the following lines of code:





@echo Hello world.
@pause




, When a program runs, you will see the command and its output. Preceding this command with an ""@"" turns off echoing for a specific line. When the program runs, you will only see ""Hello world.""You can turn of all echoing with the command “@echo OFF.” If you use this command, you can rewrite the program as:




@echo Off
echo Hello world.
pause






,, The fastest way to run your batch file is to simply double-click on the file. When you double-click on the file, the batch file is sent to the DOS command line processor. A new window will open and your batch file will close. Once the user presses a key to continue, the program will end and the window will close."
"
Incorporate functions into your code.,
Experiment with flow control statements.,
Run a batch file with C++.",How to Program in C++ and Batch4," A function is a group of statements, or instructions, that perform a specific task. Each function is assigned a type, a name, parameter(s), and statements. You will use the C++ function “system” to run a batch file. To explore functions, try coding this program:





// function example
#include <iostream>
Using namespace std;
int addition (int a, int b)
{
        int r;
        r=a+b
        return r;
}
 
int main ( )
{
        int z;
        z = addition (5,3);
        cout << “The result is “ << z;
}





This program contains two functions: ‘’addition’’ and ‘’main’’. The compiler will always call ‘’’main’’ first—in this program it will call the variable “z” of type “int’’. The call will pass along two values, 5 and 3, to the “‘addition”’ function. These values correspond to the parameters declared by the “addition” function—“int a, int b”.
Inside the “addition” function, there is a third variable: “(int r)”, that is directly related to the expression r=a+b. The two values from the “main” function, 5 and 3, will be added together to equal “r.” In this instance, r equals 8.
The final statement, “return r;” ends the “addition” function and returns control to the “main” function. Since “return” has a variable, “r,” the call to return to “main” is evaluated as a specific value and sends this variable to the “main” function.
The “main” function resumes where it left off when it was called to “addition”: “cout << “The result is “ << z;.” This line of code prints “The result is 8” on the screen., Statements are individual instructions that are always executed in sequential order. C++ programs, however, are not limited to linear sequences. You may incorporate flow control statements to alter the path of your program. The “while loop” statement is a common flow control statement—it tells the program to execute a statement a specific number of times or while the condition is fulfilled.





// custom countdown using while
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main ()
{
        int n = 10;
 
        while (n>0) 
{
                cout << n << "", "";
                 --n;
}
 
        cout << ""liftoff!\n"";
}





“int n= 10”: This line of code sets the variable “n” to 10. 10 is the first number in the countdown.
“while (n>0)”: The loop will continue as long as the value of “n” is greater than 0.
If the condition is true, the program executes the the following code: “cout << n << "", ""; --n;”. The number “10” will appear on the screen. Each time the loop is executed, the number “n minus 1” will appear on the screen.
“cout << ""liftoff!\n"";”: When the statement is no longer true—when “n” equals “0”—the phrase “liftoff!” will appear on the screen., When you run a batch file with your C++ program, you will use the “system ( )” function. The “system” function tells the command line processor to execute a command. Enter the batch file’s name within the parentheses of the “system ( )” function.source(HelloWorld.cmd)

Create the quickSort function.,

Create the variables.,

Create a while loop to begin sorting.,

Iterate through the left side.,

Iterate through the right side.,

Check if each half of the list is sorted.,

Create the list in the main function.,

Output the unsorted list using a for-loop.,

Call the quickSort function.,

Output the new list using a for-loop.,

Run the program to see the sorted list.",How to Quick Sort an Array in C++," This is a recursive void function. It requires three parameters:

The array (an int array)
The left bound (an int variable)
The right bound (an int variable; the size of the array subtracted by 1);
, These variables will be used to go through the list and to swap the values. Four variables are needed:

An int i (the left bound)
An int j (the right bound)
An int temp (a temporary variable used for swapping without losing any data)
An int pivot (the value of the middle point that splits the list to make it easier to sort)

, A loop while i ≤ j is used to go through the indexes of the list. These values will be changed as the sublists that are being sorted change., Another while loop checking if the element is less than pivot iterates through the list. If it is less than pivot value, increase i by 1. This checks if the left side of the sublist needs to be sorted., Another while loop checking if the element is greater than pivot iterates through the list. If it is greater than pivot, decrease j by 1. This checks if the right side of the sublist needs to be sorted., Assigning one value to another without a temporary variable will result in a loss of data. To avoid this, this procedure is used:

Assign the value of the list at index i to temp.
Assign the value of the list at index jto the list at index i.
Assign temp to the list at index j.
Add 1 to i.
Subtract 1 from j.

, This is done by two recursive calls. The first function call sorts the left sublist created by changing the bounds. When the left side is completely sorted, the next recursive call sorts the right sublist by changing its bounds.

If left < j, call the function with left and i as the bounds.
If right < i, call the function with i and right as the bounds.

, The array can be any size and can be initialized both explicitly and through other methods., The bounds of the loop go from 0 to the sizeof(list)/4. This piece of code gives the number of elements in list., The three needed parameters are:

The list

The left bound (0)
The right bound (the size of the array subtracted by 1)

, Again, the bounds of the loop go from 0 to the sizeof(list)/4. This is because the sorted list contains the same amount of elements as the unsorted list (no data was lost)., The number of items in list should be the same in both lists."

Even though you may not understand everything that you read, some of these pages will introduce you to important terms that will come up later (such as ""Object-Oriented Programming"").;
, A compiler is required for programming in C++, because the actual source code has to be compiled into a file that your computer can run. If you are using Windows a good option would be Visual C++ 2010 Express, or if your using Linux a good one is Geany. Both come with an IDE (independent development environment) built in, which can make the process of writing source code easier. (NOTE: Many people online will recommend that you use the Bloodshed Dev-C++ IDE and compiler. DON'T. It has not been updated in 5 years and has pages and pages of known bugs, listed here: http://sourceforge.net/p/dev-cpp/bugs/)


Learn how to use your IDE efficiently. Some IDEs that are out there have their own individual quirks that could get in the way down the road, so it would be beneficial to read through or keep a reference for the different options and settings of your IDE.

, This step is, along with the compiler, one of the most important steps of all. There are a few things that you have to make sure of during this step. First of all, make sure the guide is written for complete newbies to programming, as those are the most thorough in their descriptions. Next, make sure that the code in the tutorial follows the C++03 standard or even the new C++11 (still not standardized, so beware of compiler issues), because modern compilers will have trouble compiling outdated code, or will just reject it altogether. A few good ones are c programming.com's C++ tutorial and the tutorial at www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/.

, An important part of programming is not only reading about the different concepts, but using them in your own code. Copy-pasting the code into your IDE will only go so far. It is much more beneficial to type out each example and even try creating your own program ideas that use the concept being taught to maximize the amount of information retained.

, One of the best things about programming is that no matter what level of skill you have in programming, there will always be source code readily available that is at that same level or one step above you. A good way to learn from more complicated source code is to read through until you reach a point which you don't understand, then try to work it out in your head; if you don't know a certain part of the code, read about it in your tutorial or reference material until you do.

, The absolute best way to retain what you learn isn't just writing out source code examples, but actually accomplishing a set task with them. Both c programming.com and Project Euler have good problems that you could try solving to apply concepts in real-life situations. If you absolutely can't create an algorithm for a problem, then as a last resort check online for one done by someone else and learn from it. What's the use of solving a problem if you don't learn from the result?

, Now that you have learned about C++, you should start helping other newbies online with their problems and get them started on the same journey you had! Don't get frustrated if the person who asked you for help doesn't want to listen to your advice: someone else could learn from the answer you provide even if the original poster didn't.

Create a new windows application using Visual Studio 2005/2008.

,
Rename Form1 to Start-up form.

,
Add a checkbox to the StartupForm and rename it to Start-up Check Box.

,
Import the Microsoft.Win32 namespace using the following statement:

,
Implement the Start-up Check Box CheckChanged event and write the following code:


RegistryKey currentUserRegistry = Registry.CurrentUser;
RegistryKey runRegistryKey = currentUserRegistry.OpenSubKey
@""Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"", true);
if (runRegistryKey != null)
{
if (StartupToolStripButton.Checked)
runRegistryKey.SetValue(""MyAppName"", Application.ExecutablePath);
else
runRegistryKey.DeleteValue(""MyAppName"", false);
}

In the above code we simply create a new instance of the RegistryKey class named current User Registry and set this instance to look at the Current User logical section of the Registry.,
So we need to check the application startup option from the registry.,
Implement the StartupForm Load event and write the following code in it this event.,
Now compile the application and run the application.",How to Make Your Windows Forms Application Run at Windows Startup Using C,",,,,
We create a new instance of the RegistryKey class named run Registry Key that will point to the following registry key path HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
We check that these registry keys already exist in the registry and check if the StartupCheckBox is checked.
If it is checked we add a value to the Run key this value is a key value pain with the key is the name of the application that will be started at startup and the value is the application Executable Path on the hard drive.
If the checkbox is not checked we remove the key from the run and this will disable running the application at Windows Startup.
At this point you can compile and run the application.


Check the StartupCheckBox and close the application.
Log off windows and log in again.
You will notice that the application will run when you login. But the StartupCheckBox is not checked and you does not know if the application should run at startup or not.;
, To do so follow these steps:

,


RegistryKey currentUserRegistry = Registry.CurrentUser;
RegistryKey runRegistryKey = currentUserRegistry.OpenSubKey
(@""Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"", true);
if (runRegistryKey != null)
{
if (runRegistryKey.GetValue(""MyAppName"") == null)
{
StartupToolStripButton.Checked = false;
}
else
{
StartupToolStripButton.Checked = true;
}
}

In the above code, as in the previous code snippet we create two registry keys one that is mapped to Current User and the second that opens the Run registry key.

We check that these keys exist.
Then we get the startup key of our application using the runRegistryKey.GetValue passing application name key used in the first code snippet.
If we find that the registry key value is null meaning that the application registry key is not found and so the application will not run at startup.
If we found that the registry key value is not null meaning that the application registry key is found and so the application will run at startup.

The Application name should be the same for all method calls.







, You will notice that if the application has a key in the run registry key the Startup Checkbox is checked and vice versa.

Consider learning C++.",How to Learn to Program in C," C code needs to be compiled by a program that interprets the code into signals that the machine can understand. Compilers are usually free, and different compilers are available for different operating systems.


For Windows, try Microsoft Visual Studio Express or MinGW.
For Mac, XCode is one of the best C compilers.
For Linux, gcc is one of the most popular options.;
, C is one of the older programming languages, and can be very powerful. It was designed for Unix operating systems, but has been ported and expanded for nearly all operating systems. The modern version of C is C++.


C is essentially comprised of functions, and in these functions you can use variables, conditional statements, loops to store and manipulate data.

, Take a look at the (very) basic program below to get a good idea about how some of the various aspects of the language work together, and to get an idea of how programs function.





#include <stdio.h>
 
int main() 
{
    printf(""Hello, World!\n"");
    getchar();
    return 0;
}




The #include command occurs before the program starts, and loads libraries that contain the functions you need. In this example, stdio.h lets us use the printf() and getchar() functions.
The int main() command tells the compiler that the program is running the function called ""main"" and that it will return an integer when it is finished. All C programs run a ""main"" function.
The {} indicate that everything inside them is part of the function. In this case, they denote that everything inside is a part of the ""main"" function.
The printf() function displays the contents of the parentheses on the user's screen. The quotes ensure that the string inside is printed literally. The \n sequence tells the compiler to move the cursor to the next line.
The ; denotes the end of a line. Most lines of C code need to end with a semicolon.
The getchar() command tells the compiler to wait for a keystroke input before moving on. This is useful because many compilers will run the program and immediately close the window. This keeps the program from finishing until a key is pressed.
The return 0 command indicates the end of the function. Note how the ""main"" function is an int function. This means that it will need an integer to be returned once the program is finished. A ""0"" indicates that the program has performed correctly; any other number will mean that the program ran into an error.

, Enter the code into your code editor and save it as a ""*.c"" file. Compile it in your compiler, typically by clicking the Build or Run button.

, Comments are part of the code that is not compiled, but allows you to explain what is happening. This is useful for reminding yourself what your code is for, and for helping other developers who might be looking at your code.


To comment in C place /* at the start of the comment and */ at the end.
Comment on all but the most basic parts of your code.
Comments can be used to quickly remove parts of your code without deleting them. Simply enclose the code you want to exclude with comment tags and then compile. If you want to add the code back, remove the tags.

, Variables allow you to store data, either from computations in the program or from user input. Variables need to be defined before you can use them, and there are several types to choose from.


Some of the more common variables include int, char, and float. Each one stores a different type of data.

, Variables need to be established, or ""declared"", before they can be used by the program. You declare a variable by entering the data type followed by the variable's name. For example, the following are all valid variable declarations:





float x;
char name;
int a, b, c, d;





Note that you can declare multiple variables on the same line, as long as they are the same type. Simply separate the variable names with commas.
Like many lines in C, each variable declaration line needs to end with a semicolon.

, Variables must be declared at the beginning of each code block (The parts of your code that are enclosed in {} brackets). If you try to declare a variable later in the block, the program will not function correctly.

, Now that you know the basics of how variables work, you can write a simple program that will store the user's input. You will be using another function in the program, called scanf. This function searches the input that is provided for specific values.





#include <stdio.h>
 
int main()
{
  int x;
 
  printf( ""Enter a number: "" );
  scanf( ""%d"", &x );
  printf( ""You entered %d"", x );
  getchar();
  return 0;
}





The ""%d"" string tells scanf to look for integers in the user input.
The & before the variable x tells scanf where to find the variable in order to change it, and stores the integer in the variable.
The final printf command reads back the input integer to the user.

, You can use mathematical expressions to manipulate the data that you have stored in your variables. The most important distinction to remember for mathematical expressions is that a single = sets the value of the variable, while == compares the values on either side to see if they are equal.





x = 3 * 4; /* sets ""x"" to 3 * 4, or 12 */
x = x + 3; /* adds 3 to the original value of ""x"", and sets the new value as the variable */
x == 15; /* checks to see if ""x"" equals 15 */
x < 10; /* checks if the value of ""x"" is less than 10 */




, Conditional statements are what drive most programs. They are statements that are determined to be either TRUE or FALSE, and then acted upon based on the result. The most basic of the statements is the if statement.


TRUE and FALSE work differently in C than what you might be used to. TRUE statements always end up equaling a nonzero number. When you perform comparisons, if the result is TRUE then a ""1"" is returned. If the result is FALSE, then a ""0"" is returned. Understanding this will help you see how IF statements are processed.

, Conditional statements revolve around the use of mathematical operators that compare values. The following list contains the most commonly used conditional operators.





>   /* greater than */
<   /* less than */
>=  /* greater than or equal to */
<=  /* less than or equal to */
==  /* equal to */
!=  /* not equal to */









10 > 5 TRUE
6 < 15 TRUE
8 >= 8 TRUE
4 <= 8 TRUE
3 == 3 TRUE
4 != 5 TRUE




, You can use IF statements to determine what the program should do next after the statement is evaluated. You can combine it with other conditional statements later to create powerful multiple options, but for now write a simple one to get used to them.





#include <stdio.h>
 
int main()
{
  if ( 3 < 5 )
    printf( ""3 is less than 5"");
    getchar();
}




, You can build upon IF statements by using ELSE and ELSE IF statements to handle different results. ELSE statements run if the IF statement is FALSE. ELSE IF statements allow you to include multiple IF statements into one code block to handle various cases. See the example program below to see how they interact.





#include <stdio.h>
 
int main()
{
  int age;
 
  printf( ""Please enter your current age: "" );
  scanf( ""%d"", &age );
  if ( age <= 12 ) {
    printf( ""You're just a kid!\n"" );
  }
  else if ( age < 20 ) {
    printf( ""Being a teenager is pretty great!\n"" );
  }
  else if ( age < 40 ) {
    printf( ""You're still young at heart!\n"" );
  }
  else {
    printf( ""With age comes wisdom.\n"" );
  }
  return 0;
}




The program takes the input from the user and takes it through the IF statements. If the number satisfies the first statement, then the first printf statement is returned. If it does not satisfy the first statement, it is taken through each ELSE IF statement until it finds one that works. If it doesn't match any of them, it goes through the ELSE statement at the end.

, Loops are one of the most important aspects of programming, as they allow you to repeat blocks of code until specific conditions are met. This can make repeating actions very easy to implement, and keeps you from having to write new conditional statements each time you want something to happen.


There are three main types of loops: FOR, WHILE, and DO...WHILE.

, This is the most common and useful loop type. It will continue running the function until the conditions set in the FOR loop are met. FOR loops require three conditions: initializing the variable, the condition to be met, and the way the variable is updated. If you don't need all of these conditions, you will still need to leave a blank space with a semicolon, otherwise the loop will run forever.#include <stdio.h>
 
int main()
{
  int y;
 
  for ( y = 0; y < 15; y++;){
    printf( ""%d\n"", y );
  }
  getchar();
}





In the above program, y is set to 0, and the loop continues as long as the value of y is less than 15. Each time the value of y is printed, 1 is added to the value of y and the loop is repeated. Once y = 15, the loop will break.

, WHILE loops are more simple than FOR loops. They only have one condition, and the loop acts as long as that condition is true. You do not need to initialize or update the variable, though you can do that in the main body of the loop.





#include <stdio.h>
 
int main()
{
  int y;
 
  while ( y <= 15 ){
    printf( ""%d\n"", y );
    y++;
  }
  getchar();
}





The y++ command adds 1 to the y variable each time the loop is executed. Once y hits 16 (remember, this loop goes as long as y is less than or equal to 15), the loop breaks.

, This loop is very useful for loops that you want to ensure run at least once. In FOR and WHILE loops, the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop, meaning it could not pass and fail immediately. DO...WHILE loops check conditions at the end of the loop, ensuring that the loop executes at least once.





#include <stdio.h>
 
int main()
{
  int y;
 
  y = 5;
  do {
    printf(""This loop is running!\n"");
  } while ( y != 5 );
  getchar();
}





This loop will display the message even though the condition is FALSE. The variable y is set to 5 and the WHILE loop is set to run when y does not equal 5, so the loop terminates. The message was already printed since the condition is not checked until the end.
The WHILE loop in a DO...WHILE set must be ended with a semicolon. This is the only time a loop is ended with a semicolon.

, Functions are self-contained blocks of code that can be called upon by other parts of the program. They make it very easy to repeat code, and they help make the program simpler to read and change. Functions can include all of the previously-covered techniques learned in this article, and even other functions.


The main() line at the beginning of all of the above examples is a function, as is getchar()

Functions are essential to efficient and easy-to-read code. Make good use of functions to streamline your program.

, Functions are best created when you outline what you want it to accomplish before you begin the actual coding. The basic syntax for functions is ""return_type name ( argument1, argument2, etc.);"". For example, to create a function that adds two numbers:





int add ( int x, int y );





This will create a function that adds two integers (x and y) and then returns the sum as an integer.

, You can use the outline to create a program that takes two integers that the user enters and then adds them together. The program will define how the ""add"" function works and use it to manipulate the input numbers.





#include <stdio.h>
 
int add ( int x, int y );
 
int main()
{
  int x;
  int y;
 
  printf( ""Enter two numbers to add together: "" );
  scanf( ""%d"", &x );
  scanf( ""%d"", &y );
  printf( ""The sum of your numbers is %d\n"" , add( x, y ) );
  getchar();
}
 
int add ( int x , int y )
{
  return x + y;
}





Note that the outline is still located at the top of the program. This tells the compiler what to expect when the function is called and what it will return. This is only necessary if you want to define the function later in the program. You could define add() before the main() function and the result would be the same without the outline.
The actual functionality of the function is defined at the bottom of the program. The main() function collects the integers from the user and then sends them to the add() function to be processed. The add() function then returns the results to main()

Now the add() has been defined, it can be called anywhere in the program.

, This article covers the basics, but it only scratches the surface of C programming and all the associated knowledge. A good reference book will help you solve problems and save you from a lot of headaches down the road.

, There are lots of communities, both online and in the real world, dedicated to programming and all of the languages that entails. Find some like-minded C programmers to swap code and ideas with, and you will soon find yourself learning a lot.


Attend some hack-a-thons if possible. These are events where teams and individuals have time limits to come up with programs and solutions, and often foster a lot of creativity. You can meet a lot of good programmers this way, and hack-a-thons happen regularly across the globe.

, You don't have to go back to school for a Computer Science degree, but taking a few classes can do wonders for your learning. Nothing beats hands-on help from people who are well-versed in the language. You can often find classes at local community centers and junior colleges, and some universities will allow you to audit their computer science programs without having to enroll.

, Once you have a grasp of C, it wouldn't hurt to start taking a look at C++. This is the more modern version of C, and allows for a lot more flexibility. C++ is designed with object handling in mind, and knowing C++ can enable you to create powerful programs for virtually any operating system.

Decide the general type of property you are designing and its main use.,
Decide the data type of the property.

,
Decide the accessibility of the property.,
Decide the readability of the property.,
Decide the scope of the property.,
Decide the polymorphism behavior of the property.,
Design the code that will retrieve data when the property is used in the right side of an assignment statement.,
Design the code that will write to the property.,
Declare the property using the following syntax: accessibility-modifier returnType PropertyName{ get{retrieval-code; return returnValue;} } Where:



accessibility-modifier is one of public, private, protected, internal or protected internal.",How to Design and Implement a Property Using C Sharp," Common types of properties are:


Accessors to Fields: the property simply retrieves the value of a private field and writes to it.
Event Triggering Accessors to Fields: accessors that, besides retrieving and writing the value of the field, also trigger an event related to the field. For example firing an event when the value changes (which is the most common amongst this kind of properties)
Calculated Fields: these are used to emulate a field that is not actually stored in the object but calculated from already stored values. For example, the ""Area"" property in a ""Circle"" object is not actually stored but is rather calculated from the radius of the circle.
Data Store Values: these are properties used to retrieve data from a data storage such as a database or a file.;
,, Properties can be public, internal, protected, protected internal or private. This defines which parts of code an access this property. Usually, properties are either public, protected or private. We rarely need to create internal or protected internal properties.

, That is to decide whether users should be able to read the property only or assign to it as well.

, That is to decide whether the property will belong to the class itself and not to any particular object of the class (static scope) or belong to objects of the class (see Tips below)

, This means you decide whether you expect inheriting classes to need to change the implementation of the property or not. The property can be virtual (which means inheriting classes can override it - change its implementation), abstract (meaning the implementation of the property is not know at the moment but all inheriting classes should provide an implementation of it if they don't want to be abstract themselves, or normal which means inheriting classes must use the implementation provided or overwrite the method which renders the new implementation inaccessible via a base reference.

, For example, for the ""Area"" property, how will you calculate and return the area if the property is used in a statement like ""x = a.Area;""

, In other words, what should happen when the property is assigned a value like in a statement like ""a.Area = 20;"". This step is only done if you choose to implement a read-write property in 4. For read-only properties (like the Area example), you skip this step.

, If left out, the least possible accessibility is assumed (this is usually private)

returnType is the data type of the data represented by the property. This can not be void.

PropertyName is the name of the property you are declaring.

retrieval-code is the code used to retrieve data from the property.

returnValue is the value you want to return to the caller of the property (usually this is a result of the processing done by the retrieval code)

assigning-code is the code used to assign some value to the property. The value the user will provide in the assignment statement that will trigger this code is passed to the set method as a reference named value. For example, if the user wrote the code: a.Area = 10; there will be a reference called value inside the body of set{} that has the value of 10.
Items between squared brackets in the syntax above are optional (e.g. the set method is optional).

Decide the type of the pointer (that is, the type of data the pointer will be pointing to).,
Declare the pointer using a syntax like this: data-type * pointer-identifier; where



data-type is the type you decided in step 1

pointer-identifier is the identifier or name of the pointer variable

,
Assign the pointer to an initial memory location.,
Whenever you need to extract the data item currently pointed to by the pointer, use the value-at-address operator (*): int x = *i; where i is an integer pointer.

,
Use the indexing operator on the pointer as if it was an array whenever you want to get a memory location next to the pointer without actually advancing the pointer.,
Use the increment(++), decrement(--), += and -= operators whenever you need to change the current location.,
After you finish using the pointer, if you allocated memory to that pointer, make sure you free the allocated memory using the free() function.",How to Create Pointers in C," The following tips might help:


If you are declaring a dynamic array, use the array items' data type.
If you are declaring the pointer to access the data of a variable, use the same data type as the variable.
If you are declaring the pointer to traverse a list structure, use the list node data type (usually a user created struct).
If you are declaring the pointer to traverse a tree, use the data type of the tree node, or a pointer to the tree node type as the type (pointer to a pointer of tree node type!).;
,, This can be done using one of the following methods:


Allocating memory and pointing to it by the pointer: int * i = malloc(sizeof(int)*n); where n is the number of memory blocks to assign.
Assigning the address of a variable to the pointer: int * i = & x; where ""x"" is an integer and (&) means address-of.
Assigning an array identifier to the pointer: int * i = array1; where array1 is an integer array(int[] array1;).
Assigning a reference to the pointer: int * i = a; where ""a"" is an integer reference (int & a;).
Assigning another pointer to the pointer: int * i = z; where ""z"" is another integer pointer (int * z;)

,, For example, if you have an integer pointer i, you can use iwhich will retrieve the integer that is after the integer immediately after the integer pointed to by the reference (the integer that is 2 integers after the current location). The pointer i will still be pointing to the same memory location. Another alternative to this is getting the value at the pointer 2 steps after this pointer: *(i + 2)

, i += 5; will advance the integer pointer i 5 integers forward.

, (free(i); where i is a pointer)

"
Separate the data requirements of your class in some kind of a diagram, paper, software or any form you find appropriate and comfortable to you.,
Decide whether each data item of the class is actual, calculated, or imaginary.,
Recognize the data type of the data items that will be implemented as fields.",How to Design and Implement a Field Using C Sharp1," Prior knowledge of UML or ORM will be very useful in the design phase.;
, Only actual data items are implemented as fields. The following information will help you decide the type of data item:



Actual data items are those items that can not be inferred from other fields and that are crucial for the class to function. For example, a Circle class will not be able to do its job without having information about its center and its radius. These two are actual data items.

Calculated data items are data items that can be calculated from other fields and need not be stored separately. For example, the area of a Circle class object can be calculated from the radius of that specific Circle object and need not be stored. Another less obvious example is the count of items in an array. This can be calculated by iterating through the array adding one to a counter (although usually, the count is stored for performance enhancement reasons).

Imaginary data items are data items that are not actually stored within the class objects. For example, the contents of a file in a ""File"" object. Actually, the contents of the file are not stored within the object, but rather, in the file. Whenever they are needed, they are retrieved from the file. Most imaginary data items are actually special types of calculated data items. This type of data items are usually implemented as a property, unless there are some performance or concurrency issues that makes it necessary to keep a copy of the data within the object itself. Another confusing example is when you have an object that has a reference to another object and one of the second object's data items is considered to be a data item in the first. In this case, the data is stored in the second object and so is imaginary in the first.

, Although this step is easy in many cases, it can be confusing in certain occasions. For example, let's suppose you are designing a ""Contact"" class that will store the name of the contact as a field. At first, string seems to be the right type for the name field. However, a thorough analysis might reveal that we need to store the first, middle and last name separately. This gives rise to the creation of another data type called ""PersonName"" to store the name (or, you might use three string fields instead and create a calculated field (property) ""Name"").

"

Decide the accessibility of your field (one of: public, protected, protected internal, internal, private).

,
Decide the scope of your field (either static or instance scope).

,
Decide the changeability of your field (one of: const, readonly, or neither).,
Declare the field using the following syntax: accessibility data-type field-name ;

",How to Design and Implement a Field Using C Sharp2,",, The following points should help you decide:


Most fields are normal. That is, they are neither const nor read-only.
If your field is intended to hold a simple constant value and that value is a ValueType child that can be initialized immediately or a string value, you should declare the field as const. Constant (const) fields can be initialized only in the declaration of the field.
If your field is intended to hold a constant that is from a reference type (such as a Button, Student or any other class that is not a struct or enum), declare it as readonly. Read only fields can be initialized either in the declaration or within any constructor of the class and not anywhere else.

Install a Unix-based environment

Debian
Kali
Ubuntu
OSX;
,
Install the following programs.,
Create the executable using the C programming language and a C compiler.,
Create the sample Java application.,
Type the following into the terminal to run the program




./exec.exe                 
Hello world




The './' notation represents calling upon a program to be run; therefore, the exec.exe program that was previously built is being called upon.",How to Create Java Exe Files to Run on Computers Without Java,", Debian-based systems can use apt.

C compiler (such as gcc, or mingw32 to cross compile for Windows)
Java Runtime Environment (such as openjre)
Java Development Kit (such as openjdk)





sudo apt-get install gcc
sudo apt-get install default-jre
sudo apt-get install default-jdk




The bash code shown above uses the terminal-based apt-get to select and install the packages needed for this project. The gcc is a C compiler, default-jre is the system default Java Runtime Environment which is openjre, and default-jdk is the system default Java Development Kit which is openjdk. These commands should work on any Debian-based system, including Ubuntu, Kali, Raspian, and XUbuntu.


,

Type the following source code into a file called exec.c




#include <stdlib.h>
 
int  main(){
        system(""java -jar javaExe.jar"");
        return 0;
}




The first line tells the compiler which library to include. This 'stdlib' is built into the system by default, so it knows where to find it. The main function tells the program where to start, and the system function outputs a command to the default shell; however, in this instance, the syntax is the same for all Debian-based default shells. The return 0 tells the program that it executed correctly with no errors.




Compile the program using your compiler




gcc exec.c -o exec.exe




The gcc compiler is invoked to compile the exec.c file and to output an executable called exec.exe.


,

Type the following manifest file configuration into a file called manifest.txt




Main-Class: javaExe




The manifest file is like the configuration file for Java programs. Specifically in this case, it tells the program where to start. The program should start in the javaExe class that will be presented in the next file.




Type the following source code into a file called javaExe.java




public class javaExe
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {  
      System.out.println(""Hello world"");
   }
}




This is a very basic Java program. The first line creates the residing place of the program. The main function has a string array for an argument which represents the input of the command line, which will not be used here. The System.out.println function outputs basic text to the console.




Compile the Java program using the Java Development Environment.




javac javaExec.java
jar cfvm javaExe.jar manifest.txt javaExe.class




This shows how the Java byte-code compiler javac is compiling the Java class into a class to be used in different programs. The jar command combines the manifest file, which is like the configuration, with the class file, which is the compiled code. The result is a jar file, which is the program itself that will be run in the C program.


, The 'Hello world' text is the output of the Java program, which was called upon by the executable.

Create the Event Arguments Class:


Decide what you want to communicate with your event subscribers (other programmers who will attach event handlers to your event).,
Declare the event delegate.,
Declare the event itself in the containing class: use the event handler delegate you declared/decided in 2 as the event type.,
Declare the event-firing method - a protected virtual method that has exactly the following declaration: protected virtual void OnEventName(EventNameEventArgs e){ if(EventName != null) { EventName(this, e); } } Use the event arguments class you decided to use in 1

,
Call the event-firing method you declared in 4 whenever the event occurs.",How to Create an Event for a C Sharp Class," For example, if your event is to notify developers when a value changes, you might want to tell them the old value and the new one. If you have nothing to communicate to subscribers, use the System.EventArgs class and skip this step.
Create a public class named EventNameEventArgs where EventName is the name of your event
Inherit the EventNameEventArgs class from System.EventArgs

Create a protected field for each piece of data you want to communicate with your subscribers. For example, in an event that will notify developers of a change in a string value, you might want to tell them the old and the new strings so the fields will look like: protected string oldVal, newVal;
Create a public property for each field you created in 1.4 that has only a get{ return fieldName;} method (where fieldName is the name of the field you created in 1.4
Create a private empty constructor for the class with no implementation. The constructor should look like: private EventNameEventArgs(){}
Create a public constructor for the class that takes as many arguments as there is fields/data. For example, in a string value change event, the constructor will look like: public EventNameEventArgs(string oldValue, string newValue){oldVal = oldValue; newVal = newValue;};
, If you did not create an event arguments class because there is no data to communicate with subscribers, use the System.EventHandler delegate and skip this step. The delegate declaration should look like: public delegate void EventNameHandler(object sender, EventNameEventArgs e);

, The declaration should look like: public event EventNameHandler EventName;

,, This is the hardest part. You should know when the event you are creating will fire (what areas in your code causes the event to occur) and call the method with the appropriate event arguments class instance. For example, in the string value change event, you must see what code can cause this value to change, save its old value before the change, allow the code to change the value, create an event arguments object with the old and new values passed to the constructor and pass the object to the event-firing method.

Design and implement your members as if you have already decided their accessibility level (usually this is done by implementing all members as public);
,
Start deciding the accessibility of each member by itself repeating the following steps on all members:


Start by giving the member the lowest accessibility possible: (private)
Answer the following questions:

Will any existing code in your application or solution be affected by declaring the member on this accessibility level?",How to Decide the Accessibility of Class Members in C Sharp,", For example, some other class might have code that accesses this member or uses it and because of the current level of accessibility chosen, it won't be able to access it anymore.
Is your member designed to be used by other developers, and if so, will they be able to access it in its current accessibility level?
In your future code, will changing the accessibility of this member be near impossible?
Is your class intended to be inherited, and if so, will the inheriting class face troubles accessing this member (if it is allowed to)?


Check if the answers to all the previous questions were ""no"" or not.
If the answers were all ""no"", leave the accessibility level as it is and start deciding the accessibility of another member
If one or more of the answers was ""yes"", increase the level of accessibility one degree and repeat the steps for the same member, from step 2

If you want your alert to be portable and work on every computer, you can use the escape code ""\a"".,
Use this example code.,
On Windows operating systems, you can use the Beep(int frequency, int ms).,
Include the windows library.,
When you need a beep, use the following code:





Beep(500, 500);





,
Change the first number with the frequency of the beep you want.,
Change the second number with the duration of the beep in milliseconds.,
Try a program that uses \a to make a beep when a key is pressed, uses ESC to exit:






#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
 
int main()
{
  while(getch() != 27) // Loop until ESC is pressed (27 = ESC)
    printf(""\a"");  // Beep.,
Try a program that makes a beep of a given frequency and duration:






#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>
 
int main()
{
  int freq, dur; // Declare the variables
  printf(""Enter the frequency (HZ) and duration (ms): "");
  scanf(""%i %i"", &freq, &dur); 
  Beep(freq, dur);  // Beep.",How to Create an Alert in C,"


\a is defined as an audible alert, usually a beep. However, on some Unix operating systems it might produce a screen flash instead of a sound.;
,






printf(""\a"");





, It makes a beep of a specified duration and frequency.On the Windows7 operating system, this function sends the beep to the sound card. This works only if the computer has speakers or headphones.
On previous Windows versions, it sends the beep to the motherboard. This works on most computers and no external devices are required.

, Add the following code at the beginning of your program:






#include <windows.h>





,, 500 is close to the beep you get with \a.

, 500 is a half of a second.,
  return 0;

Know when you might need to use recursion.,
Understand how recursion is used in C++.,
Write a basic program.,
Create an int function that has one formal parameter.,
Write code in the function body that uses an if/else structure.,
Copy an example.,
Do more example problems with recursion.",How to Create a Recursive Function in C++," Imagine a scenario where you have a given mathematical problem and you need to simplify it to achieve a solution. For example, you have a number which needs to be reduced (subtracted) until it reaches a particular number. This is a very simple case of course but we can apply recursion to do this.

Another case might be finding different Fibonacci numbers. Fibonacci numbers are sums of the previous two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. We can invent algorithms to find different numbers in the Fibonacci sequence recursively. Can you think of some other examples where you might find use in recursion?;
, In recursion this process of simplification is attained when a function calls itself. In the programming language C++, you merely create a function wherein a statement exists that initiates a call to the function again. Just think of the reflection you see when a mirror is placed behind the mirror you're facing., A simple program that uses only a main function with an uninitialized int variable. In particular, this program will ask the user to input an integer number and store it in the uninitialized variable. Here's an example of such a program:





|
int main()
{
  int userNum;
  cout << ""Enter a number: "";
  cin >> userNum;
  cout << fact(userNum) << endl;   //Call to recursive function 
 return 0;
}





, This function will take as input the user-entered variable from the main function in the basic program., Here is where things will get tricky as you implement the recursive algorithm in the function. You'll use recursion here to help you find the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to it. For example, the factorial of 4 is: 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24.

The if statement will return the final solution to the problem (and is usually but not always 1 or 0) and terminate the call to the function. This is called the base case.
The else structure can be used to call the function itself using the parameter thus creating the recursion. Note, however, that the parameter should be modified in this recall so it begins approaching the value of the base case in the if structure. Otherwise this will create an infinite recursion.

, Here is an example recursive function that expands on the function call in the basic program code:






|
int fact(int num)                                   //Line 1
{                                                   //Line 2
   if (num == 0)                                    //Line 3
           return 1;                                //Line 4
   else                                             //Line 5
           return num*fact(num - 1);                //Line 6
}  





As mentioned above, this particular function allows you to find the factorial of an integer. Note the base case in Lines 3 and 4 returns 1 if the user value of num is 0. The general case in Line 6 calls the function again recursively but it reduces the parameter num by 1 to approach the base case.

, Programming concepts, like math, require practice in order for one to grasp the concept fully. The only way to fully understand recursion is by practicing more problems that implement it. As mentioned before, finding different Fibonacci numbers is a great place to start. Try constructing a recursive algorithm for this."

Open your IDE and make a new project.,
After going through everything to set up the project, make sure your main CPP file looks like this.

,
Create.,
Type the keyword ""class"", followed by the identifier, or name, of your class, then an open brace (which is this { character), a closing brace, and a semicolon at the end.,
Understand the three main keywords inside the part called the body.,
Define what the function ""printstuff()"" does and what ""stufftoprint"" is.,
Inside this function, you full access to the char array ""stufftoprint"", so you should define that with a for loop, and then print each character along with that.,
Go over to the main function and call the function.,
Call the function printstuff().,
Run it, wait for it to compile... and 5 Qs appeared on the screen (just as you defined the function printstuff() contained in the class myclass, accessing it with the object myobject).

,





Another Sample Program:
",How to Create a C++ Class,";
,, When making a class, there are two ways to do it; by declaring it in the main CPP file, or doing it in a separate header, and defining all of the functions in a separate CPP file (which is the better way to do it).

, Choose a name for your class.

, There are three more keywords which identify what has access to the data in the body. They are called ""public"", ""protected"", and ""private"". These are called access modifiers. To put it simply, public members can be accessed by anyone, and private members can only be accessed by the members of the class itself.

, To do this, use the Scope Resolution Operator. You first do the class name, myclass, the two colons, and then the data to access, myclass::printstuff(), and define it like you'd normally define a function.

, Don't forget to return a value at the end of it (unless you made it void).

, You'll need to create an object. An object is what allows you to access and call variables and functions inside your class, but it can only access publish functions and variables. To make an object, type the name of your class, myclass, and then the name you want your object to be, it's almost like defining your own data type, except you don't need to set it equal to something.

, To do that, write the name of your object, a period (.), and the name of the function or variable you want to access. This would look like myobject.printstuff();, that will call the function, printing out 5 consecutive Qs when we run the application. (Don't forget to add a pause! Use the _getch() function in conio.h, because if you didn't know already, system() commands are EVIL)

For example: 20 Questions Game.

, Right-click Source Files on the right side of the screen under the solution explorer box. Then hover add and click New File.


Source Files -> Add -> New File

,


For example: ""Main.cpp"" because this will be our main source file. This naming scheme is especially important in larger scale programs that require more than one file.

,


Type: #include<iostream>

This includes a file in the C++ library that allows console manipulation.


Type: using namespace std;

This means you’re using a standard (std) namespace.


Type: int main(){ }

This is the main function that the program will run. Everything runs through this.
In between the curly braces { }, press enter a few times. Everything goes in between the curly braces. Note: The green colored words are comments. These are for you (the interpreter) to make better sense of the code.




,


Within the main function brackets,(int main()), create the following variables:

int max = 100;
int min = 0;
char ans;
int num = 0;
int guess;

int numGuess = 0;

Note that some variables are declared with values, while others are not. This is because those variables are required by the program to be predefined. This is determined by how they're used.





,


Type: cout << “Think of a number between 1 and 100.” << endl;

This prompts the user for their number, giving them an idea of what is required of them.



, This will control all of the game logic.

Type: do{ }while(num == 0 && numGuess < 20);






Press ↵ Enter a few times between the braces. Note: num == 0 && numGuess < 20 basically means the loop will continue until num equals 0 AND numGuess is less than 20.


,


Understand the logic of the loop:

The user will enter Y or N, based on their number.
If their number is greater than or equal to guess, numGuess increments by 1 and the program makes a guess.

If the guess is correct, the program breaks out of the loop and the computer wins.
If the guess is incorrect, min = guess; effectively cutting the range of values in half and starting the loop over again.


If their number is not greater than or equal to guess, numGuess increments by 1 and max = guess; cutting the range of values in half and starting the loop over again.
The program will go through these guesses and checks until it narrows the users number down to a single number or it reaches its 20 question limit.


Save and run the program. At this point, it should do everything it's intended to do, excluding the concluding message. If the program suddenly closes when it guesses your number or when it fails to guess your number, that's normal. We will fix this in the next few steps.


, This will be the concluding lines of code that handle whether or not the player wins.


Understand the logic of the concluding message:

If the numGuess equals 20 and num equals 0, the computer could not guess you number.

Note that the value of num will never change if the users number is never guessed.


If the users number is guessed correctly, the computer will output your number and a little victory smiley face.

Note the lines system(""pause""); and return 0;

system(""pause"") simply pauses the program, allowing the user to read the message.
return 0; exists because it is good practice to return a value in the main function; even if the value is irrelevant.

There are two functions that allow you to compare strings in C. Both of these functions are included in the <string.h> library.,
Start the program with your necessary libraries.,
Start an .int function.,
Define the two strings you want to compare.,
Add the comparison function.,
Use an .If...Else statement to perform the comparison.",How to Compare Two Strings in C Programming,"


strcmp() - This function compares two strings and returns the comparative difference in the number of characters.

strncmp() - This is the same as strcmp(), except that it compares the first n characters. It is considered more secure as it helps prevent crashes from overflow.;
, You'll want both the <stdio.h> and <string.h> libraries, along with any others you may need for your specific program.




#include <stdio.h>]
#include <string.h>




, This is the easiest way to learn this function, as it will return an integer that compares the length of the two strings.




]
#include <stdio.h>]
#include <string.h>
 
int main ()
 
{
 
}




, For this example, we will be comparing two predefined char strings. You will also want to define the return value as an integer.]
#include <stdio.h>]
#include <string.h>
 
int main ()
{
  char *str1 = ""apple"";
  char *str2 = ""orange"";
  int ret;
}




, Now that you have your two strings defined, you can add the comparison function. We are going to use strncmp(), so we need to ensure that the number of characters to be measured is set in the function.




]
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
 
int main ()
{
  char *str1 = ""apple"";
  char *str2 = ""orange"";
  int ret;
 
  ret = strncmp(str1, str2, 6);
 
  /*This will compare the two strings 
  up to 6 characters long */
}




, Now that you have the function in place, you can use an If...Else statement to display which string is longer. strncmp() will return 0 if the strings are the same length, a positive number if str1 is larger, and a negative number if str2 is larger.




#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
 
int main ()
{
  char *str1 = ""apple"";
  char *str2 = ""orange"";
  int ret;
 
  ret = strncmp(str1, str2, 6);
 
  if(ret > 0)
  {
    printf(""str1 is longer"");
  }
  else if(ret < 0)
  {
    printf(""str2 is longer"");
  }
  else
  {
    printf(""The two strings are equal"");
  }
 
  return(0);
}

Make sure you have a C++ compiler or IDE that you are comfortable with and prefer using.,
Launch your C++ compiler and began a new project.,
After having your empty project set up.,
Begin your code with #include <iostream> this is to allow you to use the cout(C-out) and cin(C-in) commands which are used to output and input from within the prompt.

,
Tell the program to use the ""std"" namespace by typing 'using namespace std;'.,
Declare where your program codes by writing 'int main(){' and ending it with the closing brackets '}'.,
Inside your 'int main() {' you will tell the program to output 'Hello World!',
After you have all that, you have to stop the program from automatically closing right after it opens.",How to Code Your First Program in C++," (Ex. Microsoft Visual C++);
, In Visual C++ it's done by pressing File->New->Project->Empty Project.

, Right click Source Files and add a new item, select cpp file.

,, Always end a line of code with ';' to let the program know that the line is finished.

, This is where your code is going to go inside.

, by typing ""cout << ""Hello World!"" << endl;"" The 'cout' command tells the console to output something, in this case its the ""Hello World!"" text. The 'endl;' at the end tells the program to start whatever code you have next on a new line.

, This is done by making the program close on user input. Type ""cin.get();"" and then ""return 0"". This asks for an unspecified user input to end the program. 'cin' is the command used for user input. 'return 0' is to end the program without any errors.






             // the complete program follows:

, Begin writing in source file, using #include declare headers iostream and iomanip and using the identifier, using namespace declare std;.





#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;




, Create the main statement you are going to write the code in. Add the return statement at end of code in the main function.





int main()
{
return 0;
}




, Begin code between brackets of the main statement before the return statement. Declare int variables num1 and num2, and char variable opr.





int num1, num2;
char opr;




, Use the cout command to prompt the user to enter two numbers. Using cin Assign the input to variables num1 and num2.





cout << ""Enter two integers: "";
cin >> num1 >> num2;




, Use the cout command to prompt user to enter an operator for the equation. Using cin assign the input to the char variable, opr.





cout << ""Enter operator: + (addition), - (subtraction),"" << ""
 * (multiplication), / (division): "";
cin >> opr;
cout << endl;




, Use cout to output results of what was entered then begin switch statement to find the result.





cout << num1 << "" "" << opr << "" "" << num2 << "" = "";
switch (opr){
}




, Make case statement for when the user wants to do addition using case, use cout to output the product of num1 + num2, end the case with break.





case '+':
     cout << num1 + num2 << endl;
         break;




, Make case statement for when the user wants to do subtraction using case. Use cout to output the product of num1 - num2, and end the case with break.





case'-':
    cout << num1 - num2 << endl;
        break;




, Make case statement for when the user wants to do multiplication using case. Use cout to output the product of num1 * num2, and end the case with break.





case'*':
    cout << num1 * num2 << endl;
        break;




, Make case statement for when the user wants to do division. For this case though you have to use an if and else statement in case the user tries to divide by zero, if the number is not zero use cout to output the product of num1 / num2, else if it is zero use cout to output a statement letting the use know the problem.





case'/':
if (num2 != 0)
    cout << num1 / num2 << endl;
else
    cout << ""ERROR \nCannot divide by zero"" << endl;
        break;




, Include the default statement within the switch structure. Default statement lets the user know when variables enter are not the correct operators. End the switch after the default statement.





default:
cout << ""Illegal operation"" << endl;
}




, Go to the build menu on the top of the screen and click build program, then press ctrl 5 on the keyboard to run it. If there are errors the compiler will show their location.

Install Visual C++ 2010 Express.,
Set up a new project.,
Few different setup steps.,
Using Namespace std.,
Creating the rest with explanation.,
Cleaning up and building.,
Testing the program.",How to Create a 'Hello World' Console Application in Visual C+," This program is a compiler and IDE combo for creating C++ programs. We will be using only a small bit of its possibilities to create this 'Hello World' program.;
, In the top-left of the window is a picture of a window with a star in the corner. Click on that to open the new project creation wizard. Select ""Win32 Console Application"" and in the name box, type in whatever you want. On the next pop-up, click finish.

, When you click finish, the page that appears after will be the source code of your program. To comply with C++03 standards, change the 'int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[]) {' to 'int main() {'. Now on the left, expand the 'Header Files' folder and open 'stdafx.h' in a new tab. Place the line '#include <iostream>' after the line '#include <tchar.h>' to allow access to the standard in/out streams (basically, allows user input and output to the console).

, Back at the main .cpp file, place 'using namespace std;' after the line '#include ""stdafx.h""'. This tells the compiler to automatically assume that for every command, that the standard library is being used, transforming what would normally be 'std::cout<<x;' into 'cout<<x;'

, Okay, now that everything is set up, go to the main function ( int main() ). This is a special function that is the first thing ran every time the program is called, and from which the rest of the program stems. Create a new line and write 'cout<<""Hello World"";' underneath 'int main() {'. What this does is output the string literal ""Hello World"" to the standard output stream, which is the console window. The command is ended with a trailing semicolon to tell the compiler that that is the end of the command. To keep the program from closing before the output can be seen, also add the line 'cin.get();'. This waits for the user to press enter before continuing the program (aka returning 0).

, Make sure that after 'cin.get();' you preserved the 'return 0;' and curly brace, because these are crucial to the program (the return function shows that the program worked correctly, and the ending bracket signals the end of the function's contents). Once you are sure that everything is done correctly, press to begin the build process.

, Open your projects file (usually found at ""C:\Users\<yourname>\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Projects"" in Windows 7) and find your program (it will be in the file with the same name you gave it). Open the debug file, then run the .exe file inside and check the results. You should have the text ""Hello World"" printed to a console screen.

, When opened, you will be greeted with a screen like this. You want to click on “New Project” under the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express logo.

, Give it any name you want. Choose a location to save your program, and make sure that it is easily accessible.


A popup box will appear. Click Next, because you still need to customize some of the settings. Hitting “Finish” will not allow you to do this.

,, To create the new file, go to the top bar and click the ""Project"" menu. After that, click ""Add New Item"". Select the ""C++ File (.cpp)"" option from the list.

, Give it any name you want. The location should be in the project folder by default. After you're done, click Add at the bottom of the window. You will now see an empty document. This is where you will write the code.

, Begin with the basic necessities. To make a comment, put "". IOStream is the library that allows a program to accept inputs from the keyboard and output them to the screen. Below that is the main function. That is where the code will be contained. The ""return 0"" line makes the program exit when it is done.

, We now need to insert the variables that we are going to use for the program. Type the variables you see in the above picture. The ""float"" in front of the variables defines the type of variable it is: a floating point variable.

, We now need to create the user interface for the program. The user can type in their hourly wage and hours they worked. ""Cout"" is what sends the text to the screen. ""Cin"" takes the user input and stores it to the variable. The << (output) and >> (input) between each action helps separate the code so the machine can read it. We need to contain the text we write in a set of double quotation marks ("" ""). This tells the program when the text starts and ends. The ""endl"" ends the line and produces a space between the output and input to help the user read the program better.

, The condition will be if the hours are over 40 so we can calculate the overtime. If the hours are above 40, do this part of the code. If not, do the other part.

, Now we have to include the calculations for the math portion of the code. Standard operation procedures are understood by the program, but we can use parenthesis to make sure we don’t make a mistake. When we take a variable and make it equal to something, it will make that variable equal to what we want it to be. For example, the overtime will be equal the (hours – 40) multiplied by 1.5 to help get the extra time that was spent at work.

, In this step, we set the yearly wage to be equal to the weekly wage * 50. In this article, we're using 50 to represent 50 weeks with 2 weeks of vacation days. Not every workplace provides paid vacation days to their employees.

, We want to output the results to the user. We can type them a message using cout and "" "". To get the weekly wage to output, we can use our cout statement.

, To be able to run the program, you would usually have to build the solution and debug it. For a simple program like this, you shouldn’t run into any trouble. You can use the shortcut ctrl+F5 to start the program without debugging it.

, After pressing ctrl+F5, a black box (more formally, the command line) will come up. That is your program. You can type in any number.

, After filling out the hourly wage and the hours, the program will go line by line. If the hours are above 40 it will do the if-statement, and if not it will do the else statement. It will then display the output to the user.

Before anything else, you are going to need a text editor.,If you have no programming experience, learning C might not be a good idea, for it is known to be a difficult and tricky language.,
Understand that you need to invest a serious amount of your time learning C. Programming is a science that requires a lot of reading, patience, constant practising, versatility and an open mind.

,
Read books that explain C's syntax and lexis.,
Cooperate with others.,
Don't bite more than you can chew.,
Experiment.,
In order to execute your C programs, you are going to need a compiler like GCC.",How to Code in C," Each operating system has its own editors already installed (Windows has Notepad, Linux distributions have Kwrite etc), but consider getting another. Notepad++ is an excellent editor you can use (and not only to write C code).;
,,, Study example algorithms and the use of various libraries.

, Ask more experienced programmers about various programming techniques, tips and tricks in C. There are more than one ways to code the same thing. Some of them are easier, some are more advanced. The way you write your code depends on your programming style.

, Start slowly and steady. Experience and skill comes with time., Download free source code in C and start tweaking things, adding or removing lines etc. See what's happening and try to understand why it happened. No book will magically turn you into a programmer. If you don't practise and experiment, you will never learn.

, Let's say that you have a file named test.c, which you want to compile. Go to the directory of that file and type gcc test.c -o test


gcc: the command that orders GCC to compile your code.
test.c: the name of the file you want compiled.
-o: a flag that stands for output. Tells GCC to actually compile your file.
test: the name of your executable. Once compiled, type test to run it

In order to start writing programs in Java, set up your work environment.,
Any sort of Notepad-like program will suffice for programming in Java.,
Make sure that you have the Java Software Development Kit installed.",How to Write Your First Program in Java1," Many programmers use Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse and Netbeans for their Java programming, but one can write a Java program and compile it without bloated IDEs.;
, Hardcore programmers sometimes prefer to use text editors that are within the terminal such as vim and emacs. A very good text editor that can be installed on both a Windows machine and on a linux-based machine (Mac, Ubuntu, etc.) is Sublime Text, which is what we will be using in this tutorial.

, You will need this for compiling your program.


In a Windows-based operating system, if the environment variables are not correct, you might get an error when running javac. Refer the installation article How to Install the Java Software Development Kit for more details about JDK installation to avoid this error.

"
"
We will first create a program that prints ""Hello World."",
Declare your class and your main method.,
Write the line of code that will print out ""Hello World."",
Put it all together.,
Save your file and open up command prompt or terminal to compile the program.,
Run the program.,
Congratulations, you have made your first Java program!

",How to Write Your First Program in Java2," In your text editor, create a new file and save it as ""HelloWorld.java"". HelloWorld is your class name and you will need your class name to be the same name as your file.

, The main method public static void main(String[] args) is the method that will be executed when the programming is running. This main method will have the same method declaration in every Java program.





public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}




,





System.out.println(""Hello World."");





Let's look at the components of this line:


System tells the system to do something.

out tells the system that we are going to do some output stuff.

println stands for ""print line,"" so we are telling the system to print a line in the output.
The parentheses around (""Hello World."") means that the method System.out.println() takes in a parameter, which, in this case, is the String ""Hello World.""



Note that there are some rules in Java that we have to adhere to:

You must always add a semicolon at the end of every line.
Java is case sensitive, so you must write method names, variable names, and class names in the correct case or you will get an error.
Blocks of code specific to a certain method or loop are encased between curly brackets.



, Your final Hello World program should look like the following:





public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(""Hello World."");
    }
}




, Navigate to the folder where you saved HelloWorld.java and type in javac HelloWorld.java. This tells the Java compiler that you want to compile HelloWorld.java. If there are errors, the compiler will tell you what you did wrong. Otherwise, you shouldn't see any messages from the compiler. If you look at the directory where you have HelloWorld.java now, you should see HelloWorld.class. This the the file that Java will use to run your program.

, Finally, we get to run our program! In command prompt or terminal, type in java HelloWorld. This tells Java that you want to run the class HelloWorld. You should see ""Hello World."" show up in your console.

"
We will now extend our Hello World program to take input from the user.,
Import the Scanner class.,
Inside our main method, instantiate a new instance of the Scanner object.,
Prompt the user for an input.,
Ask the Scanner object to take in the next line that the user types in and store that in a variable.,
Print out a greeting to the user.,
Put it all together and save.,
Compile and run.",How to Write Your First Program in Java3," In our Hello World program, we printed out a string for the user to see, but the interactive part of programs is when the user gets to enter input into the program. We will now extend our program to prompt the user for his or her name and then greet the user by his or her name.

, In Java, we have some built in libraries that we have access to, but we have to import them. One of these libraries is java.util, which contains the Scanner object that we need to get user input. In order to import the Scanner class, we add the following line to the beginning of our code.



import java.util.Scanner;



This tells our program that we want to use the Scanner object which exists in the package java.util.
If we wanted to have access to every object in the java.util package, we simply write import java.util.*; at the beginning of our code.

, Java is an object-oriented programming language, so it represents concepts using objects. The Scanner object is an example of an object that has fields and methods. In order to use the Scanner class, we have to create a new Scanner object that we can populate the fields of and use the methods of. To do this, we write:



Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in);




userInputScanner is the name of the Scanner object that we just instantiated. Note that the name is written in camel case; this is the convention for naming variables in Java.
We use the new operator to create a new instance of an object. So, in this instance, we created a new instance of the Scanner object by writing new Scanner(System.in).
The Scanner object takes in a parameter that tells the object what to scan. In this case, we put in System.in as a parameter. System.in tells the program to scan the input from the system, which is the input that the user will type into the program.

, We have to prompt the user for an input so that the user knows when to type something into the console. This can be accomplished with a System.out.print or a System.out.println.



System.out.print(""What's your name? "");


, The Scanner will always be taking in data on what the user is typing in. The following line will ask the Scanner to take what the user has typed in for his or her name and store it in a variable:



String userInputName = userInputScanner.nextLine();



In Java, the convention for using an object's method is objectName.methodName(parameters). In userInputScanner.nextLine(), we are calling our Scanner object by the name we just gave it and then we are calling its method nextLine() which does not take in any parameters.
Note that we are storing the next line in another object: the String object. We have named our String object userInputName


, Now that we have the user's name stored, we can print out a greeting to the user. Remember the System.out.println(""Hello World.""); that we wrote in the main class? All of the code that we just wrote should go above that line. Now we can modify that line to say:



System.out.println(""Hello "" + userInputName + ""!"");



The way we chained up ""Hello "", the user's name, and ""!"" by writing ""Hello "" + userInputName + ""!"" is called String concatenation.
What's happening here is that we have three strings: ""Hello "", userInputName, and ""!"". Strings in Java are immutable, which means that they cannot be changed. So when we are concatenating these three strings, we are essentially created a new string that contains the greeting.
Then we take this new string and feed it as a parameter to System.out.println.

, Our code should now look like this:



import java.util.Scanner;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print(""What's your name? "");
        String userInputName = userInputScanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println(""Hello "" + userInputName + ""!"");
    }
}


, Go into command prompt or terminal and run the same commands as we ran for our first iteration of HelloWorld.java. We have to first compile the program: javac HelloWorld.java. Then we can run it: java HelloWorld.

;
, This will make it easier to capture keyboard input from the user. Add the library below the stdio.h library:





#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>




, You can use this function to vary the text colors of your output. Colors must be written in all caps, or expressed as a numeral:





#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
 
main()
{
   textcolor(RED); // You could type ""4"" instead of ""RED"", but it is not as readable
}

There are more colors than this. The colors available depend on the installed graphics drivers and current mode. Colors must be written in all caps., Include a cprintf function to display some text in your new color. Use a getch function at the end to close the program when the user presses a key.





#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
 
main()
{
   textcolor(RED); // You could type ""4"" instead of ""RED"", but it is not as readable
   cprintf(""Hello, World!"");
 
   getch();
   return 0;
}




, The C graphics library allows you to draw objects, as well as adjust their color. You can get access to the graphics library by including it at the top of your program:





#include<graphics.h>




, You can use this library to easily capture a user's input. Add the library below the graphics.h library:





#include<graphics.h>
#include<conio.h>




, You'll need to do this before you begin drawing objects, so that the program has access to the system graphics drivers. This will create an area on the screen that the object will be drawn on.





#include<graphics.h>
#include<conio.h>
 
main()
{
   int gd = DETECT, gm;
   initgraph(&gd, &gm, ""C:\\TC\\BGI""); // Change this to the path of your compiler
}




, Before coding in an object, use the setcolor function to define the color of the object you are about to draw:

#include<graphics.h>
#include<conio.h>
 
main()
{
   int gd = DETECT, gm;
   initgraph(&gd, &gm, ""C:\\TC\\BGI"");
 
   setcolor(BLUE); // You can enter ""1"" instead of ""BLUE"" to get the same color, but this is not as readable
}




, For this example, you'll be drawing a rectangle using the rectangle function. You can use any of the graphics.h drawing tools to draw in the color that you set.





#include<graphics.h>
#include<conio.h>
 
main()
{
   int gd = DETECT, gm;
   initgraph(&gd, &gm, ""C:\\TC\\BGI"");
 
   setcolor(BLUE); 
   rectangle(50,50,100,100); // These numbers indicate the location of the left-top and right-bottom corners
}




, Add the getch command and turn off the graphics area as you close the program. Compile it and give it a test run.





#include<graphics.h>
#include<conio.h>
 
main()
{
   int gd = DETECT, gm;
   initgraph(&gd, &gm, ""C:\\TC\\BGI"");
 
   setcolor(BLUE); 
   rectangle(50,50,100,100);
 
   getch();
   closegraph();
   return 0;

Using regular expression: The following method with return true is the IP Address is valid, else it returns false.,
Using split method of String: The method described above can also be written in a simple way as follows
public boolean validateIPAddress( String ipAddress ) {
String[] tokens = ipAddress.split(""\\.",How to Validate an IP Address in Java,"
public boolean validateIPAddress( String ipAddress ){
final Pattern ipAdd= Pattern.compile(""b(?:(?:25|2|??)

if (tokens.length != 4) {
return false;

for (String str : tokens) {
int i = Integer.parseInt(str);
if ((i < 0) || (i > 255)) {

}
}
return true;

Use the standard null check code.,
Test for any value but NULL.,
Write the NULL first to avoid errors (optional).,
Test whether the variable is true.,
Set a pointer before checking for NULL.,
Pay attention to functions that could return NULL.,
Understand that NULL is 0 but you should always use NULL instead of 0 when working with pointers for clarity.",How to Check Null in C," The following is the most obvious way to write a null check. We'll use ptr in this article as the name of the pointer you're checking.


if(ptr == NULL)
{
   // code if pointer is NULL
} else {
   // code if not NULL
};
, Sometimes it's more convenient to test for inequality instead. No surprises here:


if (ptr != NULL) {
   // code if not NULL
}

, The main disadvantage to the PTR == NULL method is the chance that you'll accidentally type ptr = NULL instead, assigning the NULL value to that pointer. This can cause a major headache. Since testing for (in)equality treats the operands symmetrically, you can get exactly the same result by writing if (NULL == ptr) instead. This is more typo-resistant, since an accidental NULL = ptr creates a simple compile error.


This looks a little awkward to some programmers, but it's perfectly valid. Which approach you use just depends on personal preference, and how good your compiler is at detecting the if (ptr = NULL) error.

, A simple if (ptr) tests whether ptr is TRUE. It will return FALSE if ptr is NULL, or if ptr is 0. The distinction doesn't matter in many cases, but be aware that these are not identical in all architectures.The reverse of this is if (!ptr), which will return TRUE if ptr is FALSE.

, One common mistake is to assume that a newly created pointer has a NULL value. This is not true. An unassigned pointer still points to a memory address, just not one that you have specified. It's common practice to set newly created or newly freed pointers to NULL to make sure you don't use this unhelpful address by accident.



Avoid this mistake:
char *ptr;
if(ptr == NULL)
{
//This will return FALSE. The pointer has been assigned a valid value.
}

Instead write:
char *ptr = NULL; //This assigns the pointer to NULL
if(ptr == NULL)
{
//This will return TRUE if the pointer has not been reassigned.
}

, If a function can return NULL, think about whether this is a possibility, and whether that would cause problems later in your code. Here's an example of the malloc function using the null check (if (ptr)) to ensure it only handles pointers with valid values:


int *ptr = malloc(N * sizeof(int));
if (ptr) {
   int i;
   for (i = 0; i < N; ++i)
      ptr= i;
}

, Historically, C represented NULL as the number 0 (that is, 0x00). Nowadays it can get a bit more complicated, and varies by operating system. You can usually check for NULL using ptr == 0, but there are corner cases where this can cause an issue. Perhaps more importantly, using NULL makes it obvious that you are working with pointers for other people reading your code."

Using StringTokenizer : The StringTokenizer is from the package java.util.StringTokenizer and the code snippet is as follows:StringTokenizer st =new StringTokenizer(""string tokenizer example"");
System.out.println(""tokens count: "" + st.countTokens());
// iterate through st object to get more tokens from it
while (st.hasMoreElements()) {
String token = st.nextElement().toString();

Run the program.",How to Print an Array in Java3," For a two-dimensional array, you will have both rows and columns that need to be printed out. Enter for ( i = 0; i < rows; i++) for the rows and for ( j = 0; j < columns; j++) for the columns.

,, Different compilers have different ways to accomplish this task. You may be able to go to ""File"" and then ""Run."" You may also have the option to simply click the ""Run"" icon in your toolbar. Your elements will be printed out in a line or column in the lower window of Java.

Open the Java coding object that requires serialization or create one from scratch.,
Select the object in Java that you want to serialize.,
Enable object serialization in Java by making the MyObject class to implement the java.io.Serialize interface.,
Now your object is serializable, that means that it can be written by an output stream, like this:


The following code lines illustrate how to write MyObject (or any serializable object) to a file or disk.,
It can be read like this:




try{
FileInputStream door = new FileInputStream(""name_of_file.sav"");
ObjectInputStream reader = new ObjectInputStream(door);
MyObject x = new MyObject();
x = (MyObject) reader.nextObject();
}catch (IOException e){
e.printStackTrace();
}







,
Execute the serialized object code within the Java program to make sure that it operates effectively (optional).

,Save and close the serialized object in Java.",How to Serialize an Object in Java,";
, In this example, we will call that object “MyObject.”

, Just add the following code line at the beginning of the code, replacing the ""public class MyObject"" line.
public class MyObject implements
java.io.Serializable

,
try{
// Serialize data object to a file
ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(""MyObject.ser""));
out.writeObject(object);
out.close();
// Serialize data object to a byte array
ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream() ;
out = new ObjectOutputStream(bos) ;
out.writeObject(object);
out.close();
// Get the bytes of the serialized object
byte[] buf = bos.toByteArray();
} catch (IOException e) {
}

Type the escape character \.,
Type \"" to display the double quote.,
Continue your code as usual.,
Remember to insert ordinary Java quotes as needed.",How to Print Double Quotes in Java1," As you know, the double quote symbol "" has special meaning in Java (displaying text). Whenever you want to ignore one of these meanings, use the escape character \ (backlash). This character tells the compiler that the next character is part of an alternate instruction.


Make sure you are hitting the backslash key, not the forward slash. The backslash key is next to the } key on most English keyboards.;
, These two characters together are called an escape sequence. Each escape sequence has a special meaning. In this case, \"" just means ""insert a double quote symbol here,"", without interpreting it as the beginning or end of text.


You will need to use this sequence for each individual double quote you want to display.

, The escape sequence does not affect the rest of your code. There is no need to type anything else to return to normal programming.

, One common mistake is to leave out the plain old "" mark in your program. Remember that \"" is just for display, and does not remove the need to encase your display text in quotation marks. Here's an example:


1. The string for displaying ""Hello"" is \""Hello\""

2. To instruct the compiler to print this text, we wrap it in quotes: ""\""Hello\"""".
3. Here's what this looks like in a complete line of code:

"
"
Use char(34) to represent double quotes.,
Place this code outside of the print string.",How to Print Double Quotes in Java2," Java can easily represent ASCII symbols using the char type. 34 is the ASCII code for the "" symbol, so write char(34) to display "" without using its special meaning.


You can look up a symbol's ASCII code by searching for an ASCII code table online.

, If you make the mistake of putting this code inside the string, your program will print it exactly as it appears in your program: char(34). Here's the proper method of displaying ""Hello"" (with the quotation marks) using this method:

Give it a go.",How to Manipulate Strings in Java2," The length of a string is the number of characters that the string contains. For example, the length of the string ""Hello!"" is 6 because it has 6 characters.,






int strLength = str.length();





, Here is a sample program that finds the length of a string.






public class StringManipulation {

Understand what it means to reverse a string.,
Use the reverse method of the StringBuffer class.,
Iterate through the characters in a string in reverse, appending these characters to a StringBuffer at each iteration.,
Write a recursive function to reverse the string.,
Convert the string to an array of characters and then swap the first and last, second and second to last, etc.,
Review your output.",How to Manipulate Strings in Java3," Reversing a string means to switch the ordering of the characters in a string. For example, the reverse of the string ""Hello!"" is ""!olleH"". There are many ways to reverse a string in Java.

, Create a StringBuffer object that takes in the string that you want to reverse as a parameter. Use the StringBuffer's reverse() method and then retrieve the newly reversed string by using the toString() method.






public class StringManipulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = ""Hello!"";
        StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer(str);
        String reversedStr = buffer.reverse().toString();
        System.out.println(""The reverse of the string \""""
                + str + ""\"" is \"""" + reversedStr + ""\""."");
    }
}





, Create a new StringBuffer object initialized with the length of the string that you wish to reverse as the parameter. Then use a for loop to iterate through the string, starting from the last character in the string and ending at the first character in the string. At each iteration, append the character at that index to the StringBuffer. Retrieve the newly reversed string by using the toString() method.






public class StringManipulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = ""Hello!"";
        StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer(str.length());
        for (int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            buffer.append(str.charAt(i));
        }
        String reversedStr = buffer.toString();
        System.out.println(""The reverse of the string \""""
                + str + ""\"" is \"""" + reversedStr + ""\""."");
    }
}





, In the recursive function, the base case / condition is if the string is null or if the length of the string is less than or equal to none. Otherwise, the reverse() method is called again with the string minus the first character, and the first character is tacked on at the end. So if we passed in the string ""Hello!"", the first reverse() call after that will have the parameter ""ello!"".






public class StringManipulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = ""Hello!"";
        String reversedStr = reverse(str);
        System.out.println(""The reverse of the string \""""
                + str + ""\"" is \"""" + reversedStr + ""\""."");
    }
 
    private static String reverse(String str) {
        if (str == null || str.length() <= 1)
            return str;
        return reverse(str.substring(1)) + str.charAt(0);
    }
}





, characters. First convert the string to an array of characters by using the toCharArray() method on the string. Get the index of the last character in the array, which is equal to the length of the array minus one. Then iterate through the array, swapping the ith character and the indexOfLastChar - ith character at each iteration. Finally, convert the character array back to a string.






public class StringManipulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = ""Hello!"";
        char[] charArray = str.toCharArray();
        int indexOfLastChar = charArray.length - 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < charArray.length/2; i++) {
            char temp = charArray;
            charArray= charArray;
            charArray= temp;
        }
        String reversedStr = new String(charArray);
        System.out.println(""The reverse of the string \""""
                + str + ""\"" is \"""" + reversedStr + ""\""."");
    }
}

Understand what it means to trim white space in a string.,
Use the trim() method of the String class on a String object to trim the white space.,
Try an example.",How to Manipulate Strings in Java4," Trimming a string in Java means to remove the leading and trailing white space in the string. For example, if you have the string ""

     

Hello, world!

          

"" and you want to have it say ""Hello, world!"" without the white space in the beginning and in the end, you can trim the string. The String class provides a method to trim() which returns a copy of the string with leading and trailing white space removed or the original string if it has no leading or trailing white space.

, Note that the trim() method will throw an exception if the string is null. The trim() method will not change the contents of the original string because strings in Java are immutable, which means that a string's state cannot be modified after it is created. Rather, the trim() method will return a new string that has its whitespace trimmed off.






String trimmedStr = str.trim();





, Here is a sample program that trims the white space of a string:





public class StringManipulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = ""         Hello!   "";
        String trimmedStr = str.trim();
        System.out.println(""Original String is \"""" + str + ""\""."");
        System.out.println(""Trimmed String is \"""" + trimmedStr + ""\""."");

Understand what it means to split a string.,
Use StringTokenizer to tokenize the string.,
Use the String class's split() method.,
Use regular expressions to split the string.,
Review your output.",How to Manipulate Strings in Java5," Splitting a string in Java means to split a string by a certain delimiter into an array of substrings. For example, if I split the string ""red,blue,green,yellow,pink"" with a comma as the delimiter, I would get the array { ""red"", ""blue"", ""green"", ""yellow"", ""pink"" }. Here are three different ways to split a string.

, Import java.util.StringTokenizer. Then create a new instance of a StringTokenizer with the string to tokenize and the delimiter as parameters. If you do not enter the delimiter as a parameter, the delimiter will automatically default to white space. After you have the StringTokenizer, you can use the nextToken() method to get each token.







import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;
 
public class StringManipulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = ""red,green,blue,yellow,pink"";
        StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(str, "","");
        int numberOfTokens = tokenizer.countTokens();
        String;
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfTokens; i++) {
            splitArr= tokenizer.nextToken();
        }
        System.out.println(""\nOriginal String: "" + str);
        System.out.println(""Split Array: "" + Arrays.toString(splitArr) + ""\n"");
    }
}





Before Java 1.4, the StringTokenizer class was used to split strings in Java. But now, the use of StringTokenizer is discouraged and the use of the split() method in the String class or the use of the java.util.regex package is encouraged.

, The split() method will take in the delimiter as a param and return an array of sub-strings that are the same as the tokens from the StringTokenizer.






import java.util.Arrays;
 
public class StringManipulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = ""red,green,blue,yellow,pink"";
        String[] splitArr = str.split("","");
        System.out.println(""\nOriginal String: "" + str);
        System.out.println(""Split Array: "" + Arrays.toString(splitArr) + ""\n"");
    }
}





, Import java.util.regex.Pattern. Use the compile() method of the Pattern class to set the delimiter and then give the split() method the string that you want to split. The Pattern will return an array of substrings.






import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
 
public class StringManipulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = ""red,green,blue,yellow,pink"";
        String[] splitArr = Pattern.compile("","").split(str);
        System.out.println(""\nOriginal String: "" + str);
        System.out.println(""Split Array: "" + Arrays.toString(splitArr) + ""\n"");
    }
}

Run the program.",How to Use I/O Streams in Java4," Create a class that implements Serializable interface. Name the class however you'd like, but in this article we will name it WikiHowian.




public class WikiHowian implements Serializable {
 
}




, Since WikiHowian class represents a person, we will create two String variables for first and last name and an int variable for age.




public class WikiHowian implements Serializable {
  private String firstName, lastName;
  private int age;
}




, The constructor will contain firstName, secondName and age parameters, corresponding to the private variable types.




public class WikiHowian implements Serializable {
  private String firstName, lastName;
  private int age;
 
  public WikiHowian(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
  }
}




, Overriding toString will, later on, allow us to print the object to the console easily.




public class WikiHowian implements Serializable {
  private String firstName, lastName;
  private int age;
 
  public WikiHowian(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
  }
 
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return firstName + "" "" + lastName + "", "" + age;
  }
}




, You can add throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException declaration to the method signature to avoid adding the catch block to the try-with-resources block.




public class WikiHowian implements Serializable {
  private String firstName, lastName;
  private int age;
 
  public WikiHowian(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
  }
 
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return firstName + "" "" + lastName + "", "" + age;
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
 
  }
}




, Try-with-resources block will automatically close streams for us.




public class WikiHowian implements Serializable {
 
  private String firstName, lastName;
  private int age;
 
  public WikiHowian(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
  }
 
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return firstName + "" "" + lastName + "", "" + age;
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try () {
 
    }
  }
}




, In the constructor of the created input stream, create FileOutputStream and specify an arbitrary file name inside its constructor. In this article, we will name it file.txt.




public class WikiHowian implements Serializable {
 
  private String firstName, lastName;
  private int age;
 
  public WikiHowian(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
  }
 
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return firstName + "" "" + lastName + "", "" + age;
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try (ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(""file.txt""))) {
 
    }
  }
}




, In the constructor of the created input stream, create a FileInputStream and specify file name from the previous step inside its constructor. In this article, we named it file.txt.




public class WikiHowian implements Serializable {
 
  private String firstName, lastName;
  private int age;
 
  public WikiHowian(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
  }
 
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return firstName + "" "" + lastName + "", "" + age;
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try (
        ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(""file.txt""));
        ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(""file.txt""))
    ) {
    }
  }
}




, Choose first name, last name and age arbitrarily.




public class WikiHowian implements Serializable {
 
  private String firstName, lastName;
  private int age;
 
  public WikiHowian(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
  }
 
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return firstName + "" "" + lastName + "", "" + age;
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try (
        ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(""file.txt""));
        ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(""file.txt""))
    ) {
      WikiHowian wikiHowian = new WikiHowian(""John"", ""Doe"", 23);
    }
  }
}




, Exactly, you can write the complete object to the output stream. The object, as it implements Serializable interface, is serialized into ones and zeroes, and stored in the file.




public class WikiHowian implements Serializable {
 
  private String firstName, lastName;
  private int age;
 
  public WikiHowian(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
  }
 
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return firstName + "" "" + lastName + "", "" + age;
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try (
        ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(""file.txt""));
        ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(""file.txt""))
    ) {
      WikiHowian wikiHowian = new WikiHowian(""John"", ""Doe"", 23);
      out.writeObject(wikiHowian);
    }
  }
}




, Same way the object was written to a file, we read it from the file and, thanks to overriding toString method, easily print it to the console.




public class WikiHowian implements Serializable {
 
  private String firstName, lastName;
  private int age;
 
  public WikiHowian(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
  }
 
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return firstName + "" "" + lastName + "", "" + age;
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try (
        ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(""file.txt""));
        ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(""file.txt""))
    ) {
      WikiHowian wikiHowian = new WikiHowian(""John"", ""Doe"", 23);
      out.writeObject(wikiHowian);
      System.out.println(in.readObject());
    }
  }
}




, Add a catch block to the try-with-resources block, catch IOException and ClassNotFoundException. In case of an error, print the stack trace to the console.




public class WikiHowian implements Serializable {
 
  private String firstName, lastName;
  private int age;
 
  public WikiHowian(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
  }
 
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return firstName + "" "" + lastName + "", "" + age;
  }
 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try (
        ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(""file.txt""));
        ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(""file.txt""))
    ) {
      WikiHowian wikiHowian = new WikiHowian(""John"", ""Doe"", 23);
      out.writeObject(wikiHowian);
      System.out.println(in.readObject());
    } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}




, Object is transformed (serialized) into ones and zeroes, and written to a file. Afterwards, ones and zeroes are read and constructed back into an object.

Use the reverse method of the StringBuffer class in the JDK.,
Appending to a StringBuffer: StringBuffer is an apt choice to create and manipulate dynamic string information.,
A recursive function can also be used to reverse a string.,
CharArray can be used to reverse as follows:
public String reverse(String str) {
if ((null == str) || (str.length() <= 1)) {
return str;
}
char[] chars = str.toCharArray();
int length = chars.length - 1;
for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
char tempVar = chars;
chars= chars;
chars= tempVar;
}
return new String(chars);
}
",How to Reverse the String in Java1," The code snippet for reverse method is as follows:
public String reverse(String str) {
if ((null == str) || (str.length() <= 1)) {
return str;
}
return new StringBuffer(str).reverse().toString();
}

, Reversal using StringBuufer is also an option.
public String reverse(String str) {
if ((null == str) || (str.length() <= 1)) {
return str;
}
StringBuffer reverse = new StringBuffer(str.length());
for (int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
reverse.append(str.charAt(i));
}
return reverse.toString();
}
}

public String reverse(String str) {
if ((null == str) || (str.length() <= 1)) {
return str;
}
return reverse(str.substring(1)) + str.charAt(0);

Create an instance of JTree.
,Create a JScrollPane and specify the tree as the object to be scrolled.,Add the tree to the scroll pane.,Add the scroll pane to the content pane.,
Use the example for learning purposes.",How to Make a Jtree in Java,",,,, The following example illustrates how to create a tree and handle selections.

The program creates a DefaultMutableTreeNode instance labeled ""Options"". This is the top node of the tree hierarchy.
Additional tree nodes are then created, and the add() method is called to connect these nodes to the tree. A reference to the top node in the tree is provided as the argument to the JTree constructor.
The tree is then provided as the argument to the JScrollPane constructor. This scroll pane is then added to the content pane.
Next, a label is created and added to the content pane. The tree selection is displayed in this label.
To receive selection events from the tree, a TreeSelectionListener is registered for the tree. Inside the valeChanged() method, the path to the current selection is obtained and displayed. //Demonstrate JTreeimport java.awt.*;import javax.swing.*;import java.awt.event.*;import java.swing.tree.*;/**/public class JTreeDemo extends JApplet{JTree tree;JLabel jlab;public void init() {try {SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(new Runnable() {public void run() {makeGUI();}});} catch(Exception exc) {System.out.println(""Can't create because of""+exc);}}private void makeGUI() {//Create top node of treeDefaultMutableTreeNode top=new DefaultMutableTreeNode(""Options"");//Create subtree of ""A"".DefaultMutableTreeNode a=new DefaultMutableTreeNode(""A"");top.add(a);DefaultMutableTreeNode a1=new DefaultMutableTreeNode(""A1"");a.add(a1);DefaultMutableTreeNode a2=new DefaultMutableTreeNode(""A2"");a.add(a2);//Create subtree of ""B""DefaultMutableTreeNode b=new DefaultMutableTreeNode(""B"");top.add(b);DefaultMutableTreeNode b1=new DefaultMutableTreeNode(""B1"");b.add(b1);DefaultMutableTreeNode b2=new DefaultMutableTreeNode(""B2"");b.add(b2);//Create the treetree=new JTree(top);//Add the tree to a scroll pane.JScrollPane jsp=new JScrollPane(tree);//Add the scroll pane to the content pane.add(jsp);//Add the label to the content pane.jlab=new JLabel();add(jlab,BorderLayout.SOUTH);//Handle tree selection events.tree.addTreeSelectionListener(new TreeSelectionListener() {public void valueChanged(TreeSelectionEvent tse) {jlab.setText(""Selection is ""+tse.getPath());}});}}

public class RockPaperScissors {
    public RockPaperScissors() {
 
    }
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
 
    }
}


;
, We could use strings to represent rock, paper, or scissors, but an enumeration allows us to predefine our constants which means that using the enumeration is a better design. We will call our enum type Move with the values ROCK, PAPER, and SCISSORS.





private enum Move {
    ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS
}




, These classes will represent our players in the game. You may choose to make these classes public. The User class will be the class that prompts the user for either rock, paper, or scissors, so we will need to write a getMove() method. The Computer class will also need to have a getMove() method so that the computer can also make a move. We will put placeholders in these methods and implement them later. The User class will require a constructor that sets up the Scanner object to take in the user input. We will put the Scanner as a private field for the user and then initiate it in the constructor. Since we are using the Scanner class, we need to write an import statement for it at the top of our code. The Computer class does not require a constructor, so we do not need to write one; when we initiate the Computer object, we will just be calling the default constructor. Here is what our RockPaperScissors class looks like now:





import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class RockPaperScissors {
    private enum Move {
        ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS
    }
 
    private class User {
        private Scanner inputScanner;
 
        public User() {
            inputScanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        }
 
        public Move getMove() {
         // TODO: Implement this method
            return null;
        }
    }
 
    private class Computer {
        public Move getMove() {
            // TODO: Implement this method
            return null;
        }
    }
 
    public RockPaperScissors() {
 
    }
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
 
    }
}




, This method will return a random Move. We can get an array of Move enumerations by calling the values() method: Move.values(). To choose a random Move enumeration in this values array, we need to generate a random index that is an integer between 0 and the length of our values array. To do this, we can use the nextInt() method of the Random class which we need to import from java.util. After we have gotten the random index, we can return the Move of that index from our values array.





public Move getMove() {
    Move[] moves = Move.values();
    Random random = new Random();
    int index = random.nextInt(moves.length);
    return moves;
}




, This method will return a Move corresponding to what the user has input. We will expect the user to write either ""rock"", ""paper"", or ""scissors"". First, we need to prompt the user for an input: System.out.print(""Rock, paper, or scissors? ""). Then use the nextLine() method of the Scanner object to get the user input as a string. We need now need to check if the user has submitted a valid move, but we can be lenient if the user has misspelled a word. So we will only check if the first letter of the user input is either ""R"" (for rock), ""P"" (for paper), or ""S"" (for scissors), and we won't care about the case because we will first use the toUpperCase() method of the String class to make the user input string all uppercase. If the user has not entered a remotely correct input, we will prompt the user again. Then, depending on what the user has put in, we will return a corresponding move.





public Move getMove() {
    // Prompt the user
    System.out.print(""Rock, paper, or scissors? "");
 
    // Get the user input
    String userInput = inputScanner.nextLine();
    userInput = userInput.toUpperCase();
    char firstLetter = userInput.charAt(0);
    if (firstLetter == 'R' || firstLetter == 'P' || firstLetter == 'S') {
        // User has entered a valid input
        switch (firstLetter) {
        case 'R':
            return Move.ROCK;
        case 'P':
            return Move.PAPER;
        case 'S':
            return Move.SCISSORS;
        }
    }
 
    // User has not entered a valid input. Prompt again.
    return getMove();
}




, The user should be able to play the game over and over again. In order to determine whether the user wants to play again, we need to write a playAgain() method that returns a boolean telling the game whether the user has determined to play again or not. In this method, we are using the Scanner that we had previously initiated in the constructor to get a ""Yes"" or a ""No"" from the user. We will only check if the first letter is 'Y' to determine whether the user wants to play again. Any other input will mean that the user does not want to play again.





public boolean playAgain() {
    System.out.print(""Do you want to play again? "");
    String userInput = inputScanner.nextLine();
    userInput = userInput.toUpperCase();
    return userInput.charAt(0) == 'Y';
}




, Now that we have finished writing the User and Computer classes, we can focus on working on our actual game. Create private fields for the User and Computer classes in the RockPaperScissors class. We will need to access these fields to access the getMove() methods when we're playing the game. In the constructor for the RockPaperScissors class, initiate these fields. We will also need to keep track of the score in userScore and computerScore fields, which we need to initiate as 0 in the constructor. We need to keep track of the number of games as well, which will also be a field initiated as 0.





private User user;
private Computer computer;
private int userScore;
private int computerScore;
private int numberOfGames;
 
public RockPaperScissors() {
    user = new User();
    computer = new Computer();
    userScore = 0;
    computerScore = 0;
    numberOfGames = 0;
}




, We need to write a compareMoves() method that returns 0 if the moves are the same, 1 if the current move beats the other move, and -1 if the current move loses to the other move. This will be useful for determining the winner in the game. To implement this method, we will first return 0 if the moves are the same and therefore we have a tie. Then write a switch statement for returning 1 or -1.





private enum Move {
    ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS;
 
    /**
     * Compares this move with another move to determining a tie, a win, or
     * a loss.
     * 
     * @param otherMove
     *            move to compare to
     * @return 1 if this move beats the other move, -1 if this move loses to
     *         the other move, 0 if these moves tie
     */
    public int compareMoves(Move otherMove) {
        // Tie
        if (this == otherMove)
            return 0;
 
        switch (this) {
        case ROCK:
            return (otherMove == SCISSORS ? 1 : -1);
        case PAPER:
            return (otherMove == ROCK ? 1 : -1);
        case SCISSORS:
            return (otherMove == PAPER ? 1 : -1);
        }
 
        // Should never reach here
        return 0;
    }
}




, This method will be the playing of the game. Start out by putting a simple System.out.println in the method.





public void startGame() {
        System.out.println(""ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS!"");
}




, In the startGame() method, use the getMove() methods from the User class and the Computer class to get the user and the computer's moves.





Move userMove = user.getMove();
Move computerMove = computer.getMove();
System.out.println(""\nYou played "" + userMove + ""."");
System.out.println(""Computer played "" + computerMove + "".\n"");




, Use the compareMoves() method from the Move enum to to determine whether the user won or not. If the user won, increment the user score by 1. If the user lost, increment the computer score by 1. If there was a tie, do not increment any of the scores. Then increment the number of games played by one.





int compareMoves = userMove.compareMoves(computerMove);
switch (compareMoves) {
case 0: // Tie
    System.out.println(""Tie!"");
    break;
case 1: // User wins
    System.out.println(userMove + "" beats "" + computerMove + "". You won!"");
    userScore++;
    break;
case -1: // Computer wins
    System.out.println(computerMove + "" beats "" + userMove + "". You lost."");
    computerScore++;
    break;
}
numberOfGames++;




, If the user wants to play again, call startGame() again. Otherwise, call printGameStats() which will print out the statistics of the game. We will write this method in the next step.





if (user.playAgain()) {
    System.out.println();
    startGame();
} else {
    printGameStats();
}




, This method will display the statistics of the game: number of wins, number of losses, number of ties, number of games played, and percentage of games won by the user. The percentage of games won is calculated by the (# wins + (# ties/2))/(# games played). This method uses System.out.printf to print out formatted text.





private void printGameStats() {
    int wins = userScore;
    int losses = computerScore;
    int ties = numberOfGames - userScore - computerScore;
    double percentageWon = (wins + ((double) ties) / 2) / numberOfGames;
 
    // Line
    System.out.print(""+"");
    printDashes(68);
    System.out.println(""+"");
 
    // Print titles
    System.out.printf(""|  %6s  |  %6s  |  %6s  |  %12s  |  %14s  |\n"",
            ""WINS"", ""LOSSES"", ""TIES"", ""GAMES PLAYED"", ""PERCENTAGE WON"");
 
    // Line
    System.out.print(""|"");
    printDashes(10);
    System.out.print(""+"");
    printDashes(10);
    System.out.print(""+"");
    printDashes(10);
    System.out.print(""+"");
    printDashes(16);
    System.out.print(""+"");
    printDashes(18);
    System.out.println(""|"");
 
    // Print values
    System.out.printf(""|  %6d  |  %6d  |  %6d  |  %12d  |  %13.2f%%  |\n"",
            wins, losses, ties, numberOfGames, percentageWon * 100);
 
    // Line
    System.out.print(""+"");
    printDashes(68);
    System.out.println(""+"");
}




, In the main class, initialize an instance of the RockPaperScissors class and call the startGame() method.





public static void main(String[] args) {
    RockPaperScissors game = new RockPaperScissors();
    game.startGame();
}




, Now that we have gone through all the effort of writing the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, it's time to compile and test everything out!

The best is to use a single short word that must be a noun (""a name of thing"").,
Always start the class name with capital letter (this is different from how the variables are named).

,
Do not use underscore to separate multiple words in a Java class name (it is a rule of C++ programming).

,
Only use all uppercase names if they directly come from the known abbreviation (URL, UUID and so on).

,
Always place a class into some package.

",How to Name a Class in Java," Do not use a single verb or single adjective.


The selected word should reflect the purpose of the class.
If it is not possible to name the purpose of the class clearly with a single noun, add more words using Camel casing (like BorderLayout). Adjectives are best suitable as extra words as they naturally give more information about the noun.;

Initiate an integer variable called howManyDice and assign it to the integer the user inputs:


int howManyDice = in.nextInt();

,
Print out the question: “How many sides do each dice have?”,
Initiate an integer variable called howManySides and assign it to the integer the user inputs:


int howManySides = in.nextInt();

,
Create a for loop that iterates once for every dice the user wishes to create.,Call the roll method from Dice and display it in the loop to get all the results.,
Check that the loop looks similar to the following code:


for (int x = 0; x < howManyDice; x++) {theDice= new Dice(howManySides); int result = theDice.roll(); System.out.println(""Roll of dice #"" + (1 + x) + "": "" + result); }

,
Run the program!",How to Make a Dice Simulator Using Java,", Name it DiceSimulator. If it makes a main class automatically, call that class DiceTester.

,


In this Dice file, import the random package: import java.util.Random;


,,,,,

If DiceTester is your main class, go straight to DiceTester instead.

,,,,,,,

Within this loop, you construct each Dice object by using the for loop variable x and passing the variable howManySides.

, You can open this window by clicking the Project Properties button above the preview pane, or by clicking File → Properties. This will open a new window which will allow you to adjust all of the details of your project.


You can set the project properties before you start editing your video.

, At the top of the Video tab, you will see a Template drop-down menu. There will be a large list of templates to choose from, but if you are rendering in HD there are only a couple you need to pay attention to.


If you are filming in NTSC (North America), select ""HDV 720-30p"" for 720p or ""HD 1080-60i"" for 1080p.
If you are filming in PAL (Europe), select ""HDV 720-25p"" for 720p or ""HD 1080-50i"" for 1080p.
The main difference between NTSC and PAL is the framerate (29.970 vs. 25).
If you are shooting at a higher framerate than NTSC or PAL standards, such as 60 fps, choose the appropriate template for the resolution you want.

, If you are rendering 1080p video, you will want to change the field order for your frames. Click the ""Field order"" drop-down menu and select ""None (Progressive scan)"". This will result in smoother video.

, After selecting your template, look for the ""Full-resolution rendering quality"" drop-down menu. Ensure that it is set to ""Best"".

, Most modern digital footage is shot in progressive mode, so there is no need for deinterlacing. Click the drop-down menu and select ""None"". Any other method could result in unwanted scanlines in the final video.


If you are rendering in 1080p, select ""Blend Fields"" as most 1080p footage still uses interlaced frames.

, This will help reduce the chance of small black bars appearing around the edge of your finished product.

, Once you are finished configuring your custom template, you can save it for easy access later. Enter in a name to help you remember it into the Template field, and then click the Save button. Your custom template will be added to the list, allowing you to quickly select it again.

, Here you can adjust your audio settings for your project. There are a few things you'll want to check in order to ensure the best-sounding video possible.


Sample rate (Hz) - This should be set to 48,000, which is DVD quality.
Resample and stretch quality - This should be set to ""Best"".

, Now the your project properties have been set, you can choose how you want to render it for the final product. You can find the ""Render As"" button in the toolbar or in the File menu.

, In the Render As menu, you will see a list of available formats in the Output Format section. There is a lot of discussion about which formats work best, but in general there are three formats that are considered the best for HD video:


MainConcept AVC/AAC (*.mp4;*.avc)
Windows Media Video (*.wmv)
Sony AVC/MVC (*.mp4;*.m2ts;*.avc)
MainConcept will result in the fastest rendering times if you are using GPU acceleration.
Sony AVC is the best option for older versions of Vegas.

, For example, if you want to use MainConcept, expand it to display all of the different templates available under that format. Choose the one that matches your video the best.


For MainConcept, if you are making a 720p video, choose ""Internet HD 720p"". If you are making a 1080p video, choose ""Internet HD 1080p"".
For Windows Media Video, if you are making a 720p video, choose ""6 Mbps HD 720-30p"" (NTSC) or ""5 Mbps HD 720-25p"" (PAL). If you are making a 1080p video, choose ""8 Mbps HD 1080-30p"" (NTSC) or ""6.7 Mbps HD 1080-25p"" (PAL).

, Click the Customize Template... button to open a new window with all of the template settings. Note: This is different than your Project Properties template, and the following settings apply to MainConcept only.


Uncheck the ""Allow source to adjust frame rate"" box. This may help prevent some stuttering in the final project.
Ensure that the ""Frame rate"" drop-down menu matches what you set in the Project Properties window.
Adjust the bitrate for smaller file sizes. If you want the final project to be smaller, lower the average bit rate at the bottom of the window. This will result in a lower-quality video. 720p can go as low as 5,000,000 for the average and 10,000,000 as the maximum.
Change the ""Encode mode"" drop-down menu to ""Render using GPU if available"". This will force the program to use the GPU to help rendering, which can significantly speed up the process.
If you are using the Windows Media Video format, and are making a 1080p video, check the ""Image size"" drop-down menu in the Custom Settings window. By default, WMV selects 1440 x 1080, which will result in a skewed image. Set it to ""(Keep Original Size)"" and then set the ""Pixel aspect ratio"" menu to ""1.000 (Square)""., Once you've set all of your rendering options, it's time to start processing the video. Click the Render button at the bottom of the ""Render As"" window to begin the process. A progress bar will appear, and you will see the frame counter beneath the preview window advance as the rendering occurs.


Rendering in HD can take a significant amount of time. Video length, rendering options, and computer specifications all have an impact on the total rendering time."

Import the Scanner class.,
Initialize a new Scanner object by passing the System.in input stream to the constructor.,
You can now read in different kinds of input data that the user enters.",How to Get Input from a User in Java1," You can either choose to import the java.util.Scanner class or the entire java.util package. To import a class or a package, add one of the following lines to the very beginning of your code:




import java.util.Scanner; // This will import just the Scanner class.
import java.util.*; // This will import the entire java.util package.



;
, System.in is the standard input stream that is already open and ready to supply input data. Typically this stream corresponds to keyboard input.




Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in);





, The Scanner class supports getting primitives such as int, byte, short, long in addition to getting strings. Here are some methods that are available through the Scanner class:

Read a byte - nextByte()

Read a short - nextShort()

Read an int - nextInt()

Read a long - nextLong()

Read a float - nextFloat()

Read a double - nextDouble()

Read a boolean - nextBoolean()

Read a complete line - nextLine()

Read a word - next()


Here is an example of a program that uses different methods of the Scanner class to get different types of input:




import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class ScannerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initiate a new Scanner
        Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in);
 
        // Testing nextLine();
        System.out.printIn(""\nWhat is your name? "");
        String name = userInputScanner.nextLine();
 
        // Testing nextInt();
        System.out.print(""How many cats do you have? "");
        int numberOfCats = userInputScanner.nextInt();
 
        // Testing nextDouble();
        System.out.print(""How much money is in your wallet? $"");
        double moneyInWallet = userInputScanner.nextDouble();
 
        System.out.println(""\nHello "" + name + ""! You have "" + numberOfCats
                + (numberOfCats > 1 ? "" cats"" : "" cat"")
                + "" and $"" + moneyInWallet + "" in your wallet.\n"");
    }
}





"
"
Handle input exceptions.,
One way is to use a try-catch block to handle the InputMismatchException.,
Another way to make the user input foolproof is to only take in next lines from the Scanner.",How to Get Input from a User in Java2," An InputMismatchException is thrown when the user enters data that doesn't match with the requested type. For example, if the user enters a String when an int is asked for, the program will throw an InputMismatchException and exit. There are several ways to handle this exception and resolve this problem so that your program can be foolproof.

,




import java.util.InputMismatchException;
import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class ScannerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initiate a new Scanner
        Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in);
 
        // Testing nextLine();
        System.out.print(""\nWhat is your name? "");
        String name = userInputScanner.nextLine();
 
        // Testing nextInt();
        boolean validInput = false;
        int numberOfCats = 0;
        while (!validInput) {
            System.out.print(""How many cats do you have? "");
            try {
                numberOfCats = userInputScanner.nextInt();
                validInput = true;
            } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
                validInput = false;
                userInputScanner.nextLine();
            }
        }
 
        // Testing nextDouble();
        validInput = false;
        double moneyInWallet = 0.0;
        while (!validInput) {
            System.out.print(""How much money is in your wallet? $"");
            try {
                moneyInWallet = userInputScanner.nextDouble();
                userInputScanner.nextLine();
                validInput = true;
            } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
                validInput = false;
                userInputScanner.nextLine();
            }
        }
 
        System.out.println(""\nHello "" + name + ""! You have "" + numberOfCats
                + (numberOfCats > 1 ? "" cats"" : ""cat"")
                + "" and $"" + moneyInWallet + "" in your wallet.\n"");
    }
}





Note that we have to import java.util.InputMismatchException in order to use the InputMismatchException class.
We are using a while loop to ask the user the same question until the user enters the correct input.
Adding userInputScanner.nextLine(); in the catch part of the try-catch ensures that the Scanner acknowledges the ""enter"" key press from the user and functions as a way to clear the input buffer.

, This way, we can ensure that everything that the Scanner returns is a String object and won't create any exceptions. Then, to convert the strings to integers or doubles, we can use the Integer and Double wrapper classes.




import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class ScannerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initiate a new Scanner
        Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in);
 
        // Testing nextLine();
        System.out.print(""\nWhat is your name? "");
        String name = userInputScanner.nextLine();
 
        // Testing nextInt();
        boolean validInput = false;
        int numberOfCats = 0;
        while (!validInput) {
            System.out.print(""How many cats do you have? "");
            String input = userInputScanner.nextLine();
            try {

, Finding the sum of two numbers means the simple addition of both the numbers.


Create a separate variable to store the value of the sum. This can be of the type int.
The formula to find the sum is:Sum = First Number + Second Number

To get these parameters (inputs) from the user, try using the Scanner function in Java.

Be persistent.,
Be patient.,
Reframe how you think about challenges.,
Keep your eye on the big picture.",How to Think Like a Programmer1," When you begin a large project, you must steel yourself for what often adds up to hours of work. Besides the initial programming process, you will have to painstakingly examine every dash and apostrophe during your debugging process. Programming can be difficult, but by committing yourself at the outset to seeing your project through to the end, you’ll be able to complete it.Push yourself to get your programming right.
Use short mantras or phrases to encourage yourself. For instance, tell yourself, “Failure is not an option” or “I will do what it takes to succeed.”;
, Programmers engage in time-intensive work. To think like a programmer, avoid losing your patience or giving up in despair. Cultivating patience will help you stick to what you’re doing and help you avoid sloppy programming.For instance, when you’re frustrated with your programming or other activity, get up and take a walk. Sometimes getting some fresh air or having even a brief change of scenery can help you decompress and approach your task with renewed energy.
Breathe in and out slowly. Close your eyes and breathe in through your nose for three seconds. Breathe out slowly through your mouth for five seconds.

, Successful programmers will learn to look at a challenging piece of code or a difficult programming project as an opportunity to learn and grow. Instead of allowing yourself to be tortured by a challenge or difficult experience, try to enjoy it.When you’re stuck on a programming challenge, try to think about it as a puzzle to be solved, rather than as an impossible, painful chore.If you’ve done a great job programming something, pause to congratulate yourself and take pride in your work.

, Programming is always done in the service of some larger goal. Software programming is intended to make great software. Computer programming is meant to create a functional computer. But it can be easy to fall into the trap of trying to make your programming so fluid and beautiful that you only stop when it’s perfect, not when it’s usable. Always program with high standards for both function and form, but learn to recognize when you’ve programmed something that is functionally complete.Thinking like a programmer means getting your task or project done, and not necessarily getting it done in the prettiest possible way.
Don’t make great work the enemy of good work.

"
"
Start as soon as possible.,
Break problems into smaller steps.,
Review your work.,
Use past experience to guide your future work.",How to Think Like a Programmer2," Programmers think that it’s best to jump right into a given programming task immediately, then clean up their work later. If you’re not entirely sure how to go about developing your perfect programming plan, that’s okay. Just start developing the parts you know how to do and fill in the rest later. To think like a programmer, avoid hesitation and doubt and get to work., Programmers think in chunks. For instance, instead of seeing a single undifferentiated project or piece of code, they segregate their work into various sections and subsections. To think like a programmer, find a way to subdivide your tasks and develop a step-by-step process to complete each element of the project.For instance, you might develop a software system by first developing system functions, then developing data entities, then debugging.

, Thinking like a programmer means double-checking what you’ve done. In programmer lingo, this process is known as debugging. Remind yourself upon completion of a task to double-check what you’ve done for errors or mistakes. Run your code through a debugging program, and if you encounter any snags, re-read your code line by line, scanning for errors until you find what the problem is., Don’t rush from project to project without thinking about your experiences. After completing one piece of programming, reflect on what you learned and what you struggled with. Look for opportunities to use the solutions you discovered in one programming challenge in other contexts.Sometimes you can transfer whole chunks of code into other programs or contexts.
Don’t just use your past experiences to sharpen your skills. If you’re a freelance programmer, use what you learned on one project to decide what sort of programming you’re best suited to and what sort of clients you want to work with. You might realize, for instance, that you feel better programming for a nonprofit whose cause you believe in than you do for a random corporation.

"
"
Think creatively.,
Develop a desire to improve your skills.,
Ask for help if you need it.",How to Think Like a Programmer3," Instead of using a standard development tool in a standard way, find ways to experiment and stretch the boundaries of what the programming framework or coding language can do. For instance, instead of coding images to appear as just images, use an image as your web page’s background.You might not be able to flex your creative muscles in your classes or workplace. Work on side projects of your own at home that you can really throw yourself into. This will keep fresh ideas flowing, and prevent you from getting bored.

, Always aim to level up your abilities. Look for projects that test your skills, or try to develop your own programming projects at home. Spend time learning more programming languages. For instance, if you only know C++, try to learn Java. These new programming languages will not only help make you more marketable to clients, but they will also help you broaden the way you think about programming and the possibilities it holds., When programmers are truly stuck, they look for advice or guidance from others who have been there before. Whether that means talking to a colleague who has more experience with your particular programming problem or consulting a programming forums, never discount the wisdom and assistance of others.Learn how to ask the right questions, too. In conversation with your colleagues, don’t just refer to the problem you’re having – refer to the end goal you’re trying to accomplish, too. Your fellow programmers might be able to provide an easier way to get your code to do what you want it to.Check out online programmer communities like Ruby on Rails and Stack Overflow.

, Internet Explorer is the only browser that supports VBScript, as it is a proprietary Microsoft product. You will need Internet Explorer installed in order to see your VBScript in action.


Since Internet Explorer is only supported on Windows, you will have the best results if you program on a Windows computer.

, There are several important basics that it will be helpful to know before you dive too deep into coding.


Use ' (apostrophe) to designate a comment. Any line that starts with an apostrophe is designated as a comment and is not processed by the script. Use comments often to help other developers, and yourself, figure out what the code is doing.
Use _ (underscore) to extend the end of a line. The end of a line of code is typically designated by simply moving to the next line, but if the line becomes very long and needs to wrap to the next line, place a _ at the end of the unfinished line to indicate that the line continues on the next line.

, VBScript exists within HTML websites. In order to see your VBScript working, you will need to create an HTML file that you can open in Internet Explorer.


If you have IE version 11 or higher, you need to switch on emulation for IE10 because IE11 does not support VBscript by default. If so, add this tag to the top of your vbscript code: <meta http-equiv=""x-ua-compatible"" content=""IE=10"">

Open your code editor and enter the following:<html>
<head>
<title>VBScript Test</title>
</head>
<body>
 
</body>
</html>






, When creating a webpage with VBScript, you need to let the browser know that the script is coming up. Insert the tag into your HTML source:




<html>
<head>
<title>VBScript Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<script language=""vbscript"" type=""text/vbscript"">
 
</script>
</body>
</html>





, If you are writing VBScript for an ASP server, you can indicate that the script is starting by using a special tag:




<html>
<head>
<title>VBScript Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<%
 
%>
</body>
</html>





, This command is what displays content to the user. When using the write command, the designated text will be displayed in the browser.




<html>
<head>
<title>VBScript Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<script language=""vbscript"" type=""text/vbscript"">
document.write()
</script>
</body>
</html>





, In the parentheses, add the text that you want to be displayed on the screen. Enclose the text with quotation marks to designate it as a string.




<html>
<head>
<title>VBScript Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<script language=""vbscript"" type=""text/vbscript"">
document.write(""Hello World!"")
</script>
</body>
</html>





, Save your code as an .HTML file. Open the saved file using Internet Explorer. The page should display Hello World! in plain text.

, Variables allow you to store data to be called upon and manipulated later. You need to declare variables using dim before assigning values to them. You can declare multiple variables at once. Variables must start with a letter, and can be up to 255 characters long. Below, we are creating the variable ""age"":




<html>
<head>
<title>VBScript Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<script language=""vbscript"" type=""text/vbscript"">
dim age
</script>
</body>
</html>





, Now that the variable has been declared, you can assign a value to it. Use the = sign to set the variable's value. You can use the Write command to display the variable on the screen to ensure everything is working




<html>
<head>
<title>VBScript Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<script language=""vbscript"" type=""text/vbscript"">
dim age
age = 30
document.write(age)
</script>
</body>
</html>





, You can use mathematical expressions to manipulate your variables. These expressions work much like basic algebra. All of your variables, including the answer, must be declared before using them.




<html>
<head>
<title>VBScript Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<script language=""vbscript"" type=""text/vbscript"">
dim x
dim y
dim sum
x = 10
y = 5
sum = x + y
document.write(sum)
'the page will display ""15""
</script>
</body>
</html>





, An array is essentially a table that can contain more than one value. The array is then treated as a single variable. Like variables, the array needs to be declared first. You must also indicate the number of values that the array can store (including 0 as the first number). You can then call on the data stored in the array later.




<html>
<head>
<title>VBScript Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<script language=""vbscript"" type=""text/vbscript"">
Dim names(2)
Dim mother
names(0) = ""John""
names(1) = ""Jane""
names(2) = ""Pat""
mother = names(1)
</script>
</body>
</html>





, You can create an array with multiple dimensions to store more data. When declaring the array, you will indicate the number of rows and columns contained in the array.




<html>
<head>
<title>VBScript Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<script language=""vbscript"" type=""text/vbscript"">
Dim table(2,2)
'This will create a 3x3 table
table(0,0) = ""A"" 
table(0,1) = ""B""
table(0,2) = ""C""
table(1,0) = ""D""
table(1,1) = ""E""
table(1,2) = ""F""
table(2,0) = ""G""
table(2,1) = ""H""
table(2,2) = ""I""
</script>
</body>
</html>





, There are two types of procedures in VBScript: sub and function. These two types of procedures allow your program to perform actions.Sub procedures can perform actions, but cannot return a value to the program.
Function procedures can call other procedures as well as return values.

, You can use sub procedures to create tasks that your program can all on later. Use the Sub and End Sub statements to enclose the sub procedure. Use the Call statement to activate the sub procedure




<html>
<head>
<title>VBScript Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<script language=""vbscript"" type=""text/vbscript"">
Sub mysubproc()
        document.write(""This was written in a sub procedure"")
End Sub
 
Call mysubproc()
'This will display the message written in the sub procedure
</script>
</body>
</html>





, A function procedure allows you to perform commands and return values to the program. Function procedures are where the meat of your programs functionality will occur. Use the Function and End Function statements to designate the contents of the function.




<html>
<head>
<title>VBScript Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<script language=""vbscript"" type=""text/vbscript"">
Function multfunction(x,y)
multfunction = x*y
End Function
 
document.write(multfunction(4,5))
'This will use your function and insert 4 and 5 into the x and y variables. 
'The result will be printed on the screen.
</script>
</body>
</html>

Test and adapt your new code.,
Feel free to play around with the code and find what works for you.",How to Program a VEX Robotics Clawbot," You can download RobotC for free here: http://www.robotc.net/download/vexrobotics/

, Go to File/New/New File. You could also use a 'Competition Template' if you are planning on using this code in a competition. But if you are just testing your robot, 'New file' works., Go to the motors and sensors set-up page (robot/motors and sensors). When the box pops up enter in your motor name (anything you want but stick with things like front right and lift) into the corresponding port number. Use the drop down on the right to select the type of motor you are using and check whether you need it reversed or not. You can use trial and error to find out if it needs to be reversed or not., You will want to make sure that all of the code to control your motors is inside some type of infinite while loop. This will make your program run smoothly as is is constantly checking to see if the controller is requesting a motor to move.




task main(){
        while(1==1){
}
}




, If you have four motors for your wheels you can set up your motors two on each side. The code looks like this:




motor= vexRT;
motor= vexRT;
motor= vexRT;
motor= vexRT;




This is taking a specific motor and assigning it to a channel; in this case, either 3 or 2. These are the y axis on the joysticks. The code automatically takes the position of the joystick and gives the wheels appropriate rpm (rotations per minute)., This will raise and lower the arm that your claw is on.




        if(vexRT==1){
                motor=127;
        }else if(vexRT==1){
                motor=-127;
        }else{
                motor=0;
        }




It is saying: If Btn5U is being held down lift motor rotate forwards (clockwise) at the speed of 127 rpm. Then- If that isn't happening is Btn5D being pressed, if that is true then rotate the motor backwards (anti-clockwise). If none of that is happening, don't turn the motor at all.,




        if(vexRT==1){
                motor=127;
        }else if(vexRT==1){
                motor=-127;
        }else{
                motor=0;
        }




This code looks a lot like the lift code but, instead of Btn5U and Btn5D it uses Btn6U and Btn6D. This means that you use a different set of buttons on your controller for the lift and claw. The other difference is that this bit of code activates the motor 'claw' rather than the motor 'lift'., After you have your code completed compile and download it onto your clawbot (Windows - F5).

You can change the buttons that activate the motors and change the rpm of the motors. The fastest the standard 393 motors can go is 127rpm.

, There are other ways to make the same thing happen using robotC but the above is the easiest to create edit and understand."

Create one final printout prompt line of code to show the finalTotal.",How to Create a Tip Calculator in Java,"


To download Netbeans, go to the Netbeans.org website and press the big orange button on the top right of the page that says Download.
Since the tip calculator is a relatively simple application, you only need to download Java SE (standard edition). Once you finish downloading the.exe file, run its pop up the NetBeans installer. The standards options in the installer are sufficient for this program, so you can download the standard edition without fear of not having a required components for the program.;
, You can find it at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/jdk-netbeans-jsp-142931.html


In there you can specify the JDK appropriate for your respective machine.

,


Go to the dropdown menu at the top left that says File and select New Project.

, On the prompt that follows, in the categories, select Java and in the projects select Java application; these are usually highlighted by default. Click Next.


Give your project a name. Leave the Dedicated Folder check box unchecked and the Created the Main Class checkbox checked.
With that, finish up and then you’ve created your project.

,


Below the line that reads public static void main(String[] args), create the following variables:

double total;
int tip;
double tipRatio;
double finalTotal;


Whether they are in different lines or the same line one after another doesn’t matter.
These are what they call instance variables. They are basically references for a value will be stored in the memory of the program. The reason you name the instance variables this way is to link them to what you will be using them for. e.i the finalTotal variable is used for the final answer.
The lack of capitalization in “double” and “int” and the semicolons (;) at the end of the words are important.
For reference, int are variables that are always whole numbers, i.e 1,2,3… etc, while doubles have decimals in them.

, At the top of the page, right below the line package (name of the project) and above the @author owner line, type: import java.util.Scanner;

, While it doesn't matter what line of code the object is created, write the line of code right after the instance variables for consistency's sake. Making a scanner is similar to creating other kinds of objects in programming.


Its follows the construction as follows: “Class name” “name of object” = “new” “Class name” (“Path”);, excluding the quotations marks.
In this case it'd be: Scanner ScanNa = new Scanner (System.in);

The keyword “new” and the “System.in” the parenthesis are important. The ""new"" keyword basically says that this object is new, which probably sounds redundant, but is needed for the scanner to be created. Meanwhile “System.in” is what variable the Scanner objects attached to, in this case System.in would make it so that the variable is something that the user types in.

,


System.out.print(""Enter total, including tax : $"");
The quotations for the line in parenthesis are important.
Essentially, this line of code makes word print out on the console once the program is run. In this case the words would be “Enter Total, including Tax: $”.
The quotations around the sentence in the parenthesis are needed to make sure Java knows that this is a sentence, otherwise it’ll consider it several variables that don’t exist.

, In the next line of code, you make use of the scanner and one of the variables you created earlier. Look at this line of code:


total = ScanNa.nextDouble();
The ""total"" is the variable from before, and ""ScanNa"" is the name of your Scanner object. The phrase ""nextDouble();"" is a method from the scanner class. Basically its means that the next double type number that is inputted will be read by that scanner.
In short, the number read by the scanner will be used by the variable Total.

, Then use the scanner to save a number in the variable named tip, similar to the last two steps. Here it’s some code for reference:


System.out.print(""Enter % to tip: "");
tip = ScanNa.nextInt();

,


Type tipRation = tip/100.0; to turn the whole number representing the tip percentage into an actual percentage.
Note that the .0 in 100.0 is required, as in this situation the variable named “tip” is an integer, i.e a whole number. As long as one of the two numbers in the equation has a decimal, the end result will be a double with decimals. If both of the numbers where whole numbers though, it’d cause a computation error.

, The following equation speaks for itself.


finalTotal = total + (total * tipRatio);

, You can use a bit more specialized version of the print method called printf to make it a little more fancy:


System.out.printf(""Total with %d%% as tip: $%.2f\n"", tip, finalTotal);
The letters preceded by % correspond to the variables that are separated by commands after the printed sentence; they are linked in terns of the order of the variables and the letters. In this case %d is linked to ""tip"" and %.2f is linked finalTotal. This is so that the console will printout the variables that were scanned or calculated rather than something pre-determined.
The double % sign after %d its so that the console will actually printout the percentage sign; otherwise it'd cause an error because of the way the printf method works.

public class NetworkAppExample {
 
}


;
, Create a main method and declare it might throw exceptions of Exception type and any subclass of it - all exceptions. This is considered a bad practice, but is acceptable for barebone examples.




public class NetworkAppExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
 
    }
}




, This example will use local host address and an arbitrary port number. Port number needs to be in a range from 0 to 65535 (inclusive). However, port numbers to avoid range from 0 to 1023 (inclusive) because they are reserved system ports.




public class NetworkAppExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String host = ""localhost"";
        int port = 10430;
    }
}




, Server is bound to the address and port and listens for incoming connections. In Java, ServerSocket represents server-side endpoint and its function is accepting new connections. ServerSocket does not have streams for reading and sending data because it does not represent connection between a server and a client.




import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
 
public class NetworkAppExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String host = ""localhost"";
        int port = 10430;
 
        ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(port, 50, InetAddress.getByName(host));
    }
}




, For logging purposes, print to the console that server has been started.




import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
 
public class NetworkAppExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String host = ""localhost"";
        int port = 10430;
 
        ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(port, 50, InetAddress.getByName(host));
        System.out.println(""Server started."");
    }
}




, Client is bound to the address and port of a server and listens for packets (messages) after connection is established. In Java, Socket represents either a client-side endpoint connected to the server or a connection (from server) to client and is used to communicate with the party on the other end.




import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;
 
public class NetworkAppExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String host = ""localhost"";
        int port = 10430;
 
        ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(port, 50, InetAddress.getByName(host));
        System.out.println(""Server started."");
        Socket client = new Socket(host, port);
    }
}




, For logging purposes, print to the console that connection has been attempted.




import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;
 
public class NetworkAppExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String host = ""localhost"";
        int port = 10430;
 
        ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(port, 50, InetAddress.getByName(host));
        System.out.println(""Server started."");
        Socket client = new Socket(host, port);
        System.out.println(""Connecting to server..."");
    }
}




, Clients will never connect unless server listens for and accepts, in other words establishes, connections. In Java, connections are established using accept() method of ServerSocket class. The method will block execution until a client connects.




import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;
 
public class NetworkAppExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String host = ""localhost"";
        int port = 10430;
 
        ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(port, 50, InetAddress.getByName(host));
        System.out.println(""Server started."");
        Socket client = new Socket(host, port);
        System.out.println(""Connecting to server..."");
        Socket connection = server.accept();
    }
}




, For logging purposes, print to the console that connection between server and client has been established.




import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;
 
public class NetworkAppExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String host = ""localhost"";
        int port = 10430;
 
        ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(port, 50, InetAddress.getByName(host));
        System.out.println(""Server started."");
        Socket client = new Socket(host, port);
        System.out.println(""Connecting to server..."");
        Socket connection = server.accept();
        System.out.println(""Connection established."");
    }
}




, Communication is done over streams and, in this application, raw streams of (connection from) server (to client) and client need to be chained to either data or object streams. Remember, both parties need to use the same stream type.


Data streams




import java.io.DataInputStream;
import java.io.DataOutputStream;
import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;
 
public class NetworkAppExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String host = ""localhost"";
        int port = 10430;
 
        ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(port, 50, InetAddress.getByName(host));
        System.out.println(""Server started."");

        DataOutputStream serverOut = new DataOutputStream(connection.getOutputStream());
        DataInputStream serverIn = new DataInputStream(connection.getInputStream());
    }
}






Object streams
When multiple object streams are used, input streams have to be initialized in the same order as output streams because ObjectOutputStream sends a header to the other party and ObjectInputStream blocks execution until it reads the header.




import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;
 
public class NetworkAppExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String host = ""localhost"";
        int port = 10430;
 
        ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(port, 50, InetAddress.getByName(host));
        System.out.println(""Server started."");
        Socket client = new Socket(host, port);
        System.out.println(""Connecting to server..."");
        Socket connection = server.accept();
        System.out.println(""Connection established."");
 
        ObjectOutputStream clientOut = new ObjectOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());
        ObjectOutputStream serverOut = new ObjectOutputStream(connection.getOutputStream());
        ObjectInputStream clientIn = new ObjectInputStream(client.getInputStream());
        ObjectInputStream serverIn = new ObjectInputStream(connection.getInputStream());
    }
}




Order as specified in the code above might be easier to remember - first initialize output streams then input streams in the same order. However, another order for initialization of object streams is the following:




ObjectOutputStream clientOut = new ObjectOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());
ObjectInputStream serverIn = new ObjectInputStream(connection.getInputStream());
ObjectOutputStream serverOut = new ObjectOutputStream(connection.getOutputStream());
ObjectInputStream clientIn = new ObjectInputStream(client.getInputStream());






, For logging purposes, print to the console that communication is ready.

, In this application, Hello World text will be sent to the server either as bytefor data streams and String for object streams.


Data streams
Using data streams, serialization is done by converting objects into primitive data types or a String. In this case, String is converted to byte[] instead of written using writeBytes() method to show how it would be done with other objects, such as images or other files.

, Write data to the output stream and flush the stream to ensure the data has been written entirely.


Data streams
Length of a message needs to be sent first so the other party knows how many bytes it needs to read. After the length is sent as a primitive integer type, bytes can be sent.

, Read data from the input stream and convert it. Since we know exactly the type of sent data, we will either create a String from byte[] or cast Object to String without checking, depending on the stream used.


Data streams
As length was sent first and bytes afterward, reading has to be done in the same order. In case length is zero, there is nothing to read. Object is deserialized when bytes are converted back into an instance, in this case, of String.

, Connection is disconnected when one party closes its streams. In Java, by closing the output stream, associated socket and input stream are closed, as well. Once a party on the other end finds out connection is dead, it needs to close its output stream, as well, to prevent memory leaks.

, Logging enabled us to know if the application was successful or not. Expected output:




Server started.
Connecting to server...
Connection established.
Communication is ready.
Message sent to server: Hello World
Message received from client: Hello World
Connections closed.
Server terminated.




In case your output is not like the one above, which is unlikely to happen, there are a few solutions:

If the output stops at the line Connection established. and object streams are used, flush each ObjectOutputStream immediately after initialization because headers, for some reason, were not sent.
If the output prints java.net.BindException: Address already in use, choose a different port number because the one specified is already used.

Make your frame implement the ActionListener interface.,
For every button, check box or other control that you have created, invoke its method .addActionListener, passing your frame (this) as parameter.

,
Override ActionListener's abstract method, actionPerformed(ActionEvent event).,
JTextArea has a method .setText(""myText"") which seems good as the way to program some visible response on your action.

",How to Create a Swing GUI in Java2," This will allow your class to listen to components' activities.

,, In this method, you should put if statements checking where does the action event come from. This if statement should have a condition that says something like ""if (event.getSource() == button1)"". This checks where the event came from and if it came from your button. Inside the if statement, do whatever needs to be done when your button is pressed.

If NetBeans is not on your desktop, locate it in your computer's application list. If you have not installed NetBeans then follow the directions above to install it.
, Go to the top left corner and click on the New Project icon. Alternatively, click on the “File” tab on the top left corner and click on “New Project”.

, Once you have clicked on the new project icon, a pop up appears.


Under Categories: select ""Java"".
Under Projects: select ""Java Application"". (These should be selected by default.)
Click Next.

,


In the project name section, type Balloon.
Make sure the ""Create Main Class"" box is checked. This auto-generates a main method, which you need to use to run the program (we will discuss more in the next step). Do not check the ""Use Dedicated Folder for Storing Libraries"" box.
Press Finish to create the new project. Now you are ready to write the project's code.

, Before beginning this step, delete the grey comment sections. In order to create the balloon object, you must first create its parameters, also known as the instance variables. Variables are addresses that store your data, and methods can be thought of as “functions” that can be called to perform tasks. (The main method is a special one that is run automatically when the “Run” button is pressed on Netbeans or on other IDEs.).


In the body of the main method, public static void main(String[] args), type private String name; and on the next line type private int altitude.

String and int are examples of data types. A ""String"" is used for variables that store text while an ""int"" is used to store integer numbers.
The ""private"" modifier simply makes sure that no objects outside your file can access the variables used with it.
Remember, it is very important that you include a semicolon (;) at the end of the code statements that you add for this program or it will not work. (Note that the semicolon is only used at the end of a statement, not necessarily the end of a line. The lines you will be adding for this program are complete statements, though you will later run into statements spread out over multiple lines.)

, Return to the main method public static void main(String[] args) and after, within the brace ({), create your balloon object by typing:


Type Balloon myBalloon = new Balloon(); as shown above.
This constructs a Balloon object that has variables you can access by typing myBalloon.<variable name>..

, Parameters, or arguments, are necessary to construct your object. You will use the instance variables that you defined before for this step.


As hinted by their names, the String will hold the name of the balloon and the int will hold the altitude of the balloon (in inches). Press ↵ Enter on your keyboard and type: myBalloon.name = “Balloon”;. This code assigns the value ""Balloon"" to your balloon's name variable. If you want to name your balloon differently, you can replace ""Balloon"" with any name you'd like (make sure that you keep the quotes around the name, though, because those let the compiler know that your value is a String and not a variable name).
Press ↵ Enter again and then type: myBalloon.altitude = 100;. Once again, you can replace 100 with any integer number. More advanced objects will usually contain safeguards to prevent values that do not make sense (such as negative altitudes).

, :


Press ↵ Enter and type System.out.println(""Your balloon name is: "" + myBalloon.name);

Press ↵ Enter and then type the next line: System.out.println(""Your balloon altitude is: "" + myBalloon.altitude + "" inches"");

The System.out.println() method takes a String and prints your statement to the screen in a new line (hence the “ln”, or ""line"" in the method name.)
Note that the ‘+’ in the code serves to join, or concatenate, the two Strings. In the second print statement, the '+' converts the altitude (an int) into a String so it can join it with the other Strings and print it.

, Click the Run icon at the top of your screen. It looks like a green “play” symbol:

, The results should be printed in the output console directly below the editing window, and your output should look like the above image (but with the name and altitude identical to the values you entered).


You may be given an error message popup. If you are, something went wrong along the way. Make sure that your statements match those in the pictures throughout the above instructions because one typo can make the entire program stop working. Make sure to include semicolons!
If no results/incorrect results are printed, but the output says ""build successful"", you probably did not add the print statements properly. Go back to to that step and follow those instructions again.
If your output came out as shown above with no error messages, congratulations on creating your balloon object!

",How to Add Two Numbers in Visual Basic.NET," Programmers can do this either by defining the numbers as constants or variables. Variables are desired over constants for many reasons, mainly because they can be changed easily. For example, a variable can be changed by a user entering a number in a visual text box, whereas a constant cannot.


Defining items in Visual Basic requires a ""dimension"" command, abbreviated as ""dim"". To define your two numbers as integers, write the following code ""above the fold"" in the initial load sequence before functions are described: dim A as integer, dim B as integer. Here, A and B will be your two numbers.;
, After dimensioning the two numbers, you'll need to either enter values for them in code, or provide instructions for users to populate them during the program. A simple command like A = 5 is sufficient.

, Write this code into the same pre-functional prefix code: dim C as integer

, With the above example, your code is this: C = A + B

, You can include a visual text box to display the sum and create a command like: textbox1.text = val<c>

, Add the variable C back into other equations for more functionality within the program. There are many ways that programmers can take advantage of an added number to further influence outcomes within an executable program.


Run the program to catch bugs. Sometimes, small errors can produce bugs. Run the program and any available diagnostics to make sure the program works and values the sum correctly.

Use an apostrophe to mark the beginning of your comments.",How to Add Comments in Visual Basic," Programmers have several different main purposes for comments that determine the exact format and style of what will be included in the comment.


Consider code module comments. Module comments are higher-level comments that usually describe the overall purposes of the code module, as well as other information like copyright, authorship and more.
Assess the need for procedure comments. Various functional code procedures should also be commented. Procedure comments relate to the specific functions of code, and they help to alert other programmers about the exact results of a procedure according to how it is written.;
, Some types of comments, like procedure comments, also come in different forms. Understand these different uses in order to add the right kinds of comments to your program.


Assess the use of purpose comments for procedures. These describe what the procedure does.
Consider the use of function return value comments. These will help others to understand what values are returned by procedure.
Include conditional comments. Conditional comments can describe possible error conditions and error handling, as well as conditions that must be met for code to work properly.

, There's also the issue of how you will add comments to specific lines of code.


Utilize left-handed comments. These comments start at the left of the screen and continue the whole way across a line. Commonly, the coder needs to arbitrarily end the comment near the right side of the screen, go down to a new line and continue the comment.
Use in-line comments. In-line comments have an apostrophe directly after a piece of code and are placed on the same line.

, This is the key step for actually writing comments into code. The apostrophe is the specific text protocol that the Visual Basic compiler recognizes for comments. Without this, the computer will try to read the comments as code.

What is Function ?,
How to declare Function ?,
How to call Function ?",How to Call a Function in VB,"


Use a Function procedure when you need to return a value to the calling code.
A function itself has a type, and the function will return a value to the calling subroutine based on the code that it contains.;
,


You can define a Function procedure only at module level. This means the declaration context for a function must be a class, structure, module, or interface, and cannot be a source file, namespace, procedure, or block.
A function is declared the exact same way as a subroutine, except using the ""Function"" keyword instead of ""Sub"".
Function procedures default to public access. You can adjust their access levels with the access modifiers.

,


You call a Function procedure by using the procedure name, followed by the argument list in parentheses, in an expression.
You can omit the parentheses only if you are not supplying any arguments. However, your code is more readable if you always include the parentheses.
A function can also be called using the Call statement, in which case the return value is ignored.
To return a value, assign a value of the proper type to the function's name, as if it were a variable.

If the date being compared is after the date argument, a value greater than zero is returned. If the dates are equal, a value of 0 is returned.

, You will need to create each date object before you can start comparing them. One way to do this is to use the SimpleDateFormat class. It allows for easy entry of date values into date objects.






SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(""yyyy-MM-dd""); //For declaring values in new date objects. use same date format when creating dates

Do an equals comparison.",How to Compare Two Dates in Java4," It is also possible to directly compare the point of time of two dates, although any of the previous approaches are likely to be more readable and so preferable. This will be a comparison of two primitive data types, so it can be done with ""<"", "">"", and ""=="".

, Before you can compare the dates, you must create long integers with the data from the previously created Date objects. Luckily, the getTime() method will do most of the work for you.






long time1 = getTime(date1); //declares primitive time1 from date1
long time2 = getTime(date2); //declares primitive time2 from date2





, Use the less than symbol (<) to compare these two integer values. Since time1 is less than time 2, the first message should print. The else statement is included for proper syntax.






if(time1 < time2){
System.out.println(""date1 is before date2""); //will print since time1 <time2
}
else{
System.out.println(""date1 is not before date2"");
}





, Use the greater than symbol (>) to compare these two integer values. Since time1 is greater than time 2, the first message should print. The else statement is included for proper syntax.






if(time2 > time1){
System.out.println(""date2 is after date1""); //will print since time2 > time1 
}
else{
System.out.println(""date2 is not after date1"");
}





, Use the symbol to check for equality (==) to compare these two integer values for equality. Since time1 is equal to time3, the first message should print. If the program gets to the else statement, that means the times are not equal.if(time1 == time2){
System.out.println(""the dates are equal"");
}
else{
System.out.println(""the dates are not equal""); //will print since time1 != time2
}

 Run the project!",How to Create a Java Class in Netbeans to Compute the Area of a Triangle Using Heron's Formula,",, Under categories select Java and under projects select Java Application. Then click Next. 
, The one here is named ""Heron"". Then click Finish.

You can choose any file destination for this project.


,

 By default the Projects tab will be open. With the projects tab open, select the ""+"" (or drop down icon) to the right of your ""Heron"" project within the Projects tab.

 You will then see two more items, the Source Packages and Libraries.

 Click the + to open the Source Packages (or drop down icon).

 Right click , select New > Java Class.


, Remember that it must start with an uppercase letter.

 Click Finish. You are now ready to write the code.


,

 It is good to make them private and you will also want to give them a type of double so that you can get decimals for more accuracy.

 Give your instance variables each their own unique name. Make it something literal, for example, mine was side1, side2, side3.

 Insert the instance variables under the bracket after Heron.

 private double side1;

 private double side2;

 private double side3;




,

 Under the instance variables, create a comment section listing the parameters.

 To make a long comment, type /** and then hit ↵ Enter. This will create a multi-line comment.

 Type the parameters in this space.

 Create a triangle, given the lengths of the side:

  @param side1 length of a side

  @param side2 length of another side

  @param side3 length of the other side




,

 Create a public constructor so that when you create an object in your tester class, it will have the 3 parameters you established earlier.

 Your constructors parameters should all be set to type double.

 It should read:  public Heron(double side1, double side2, double side3) {

 Now create “this” statements to link to the parameters. Type these after the bracket and then close the bracket.


,  

 Create a mutator method that uses Heron's formula.

 Set the method to public and give it a type double.

 Give the method a name of your choosing, like getArea. Make sure to use camel case meaning the first word is lowercase and the second is uppercase.

 It should read:  public double getArea( ) {

 You need a variable that calculates half of the perimeter. To do this, give it a type double and a name, like ""halfPerim"". Set it equal to a formula that would return half of the perimeter of a triangle. In this case,  halfPerim = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2

 Now you need to create the formula that actually gives us the area and uses Heron's formula. You will also give this a type double and set area equal to the formula.

 Heron's formula: Area=(s∗(s−a)∗(s−b)∗(s−c)){\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\sqrt {(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))}}} where s{\displaystyle s} is equal to half the perimeter, and a{\displaystyle a}, b{\displaystyle b}, and c{\displaystyle c} are the side lengths.

 double area = Math.sqrt(halfPerim *(halfPerim - side1) * (halfPerim - side2) * (halfPerim - side3));

 The last step is to create a return statement. Use return area and then close your bracket.


,

 Create a public string to return the lengths of each side of the triangle:

 public String toString( ) {



 Make sure the S in string is capitalized and then after the brackets insert your return statement:

  return side1 + "", "" + side2 + "", "" + side3



 Then close your bracket and your class is now complete!  


, It will be your Main Class that will run the file.

 Create a tester class to show that your Heron class is properly functioning.

 To create another Java Class, you can repeat the same steps in Part 1 of this tutorial; the only difference is that when in the ""New Java Application"" window, you will check Create a Main Class and name your new class HeronTester, because your files can’t have the same name. This class will be saved in the same folder as your 'Heron"" class.

 Click Finish and now you can write the tester code.


,

 Before you start the code, you should import the swing class in order to be able to input data and easily change it.

 The swing class is: import javax.swing.JOptionPane

 This needs to be placed at the very top above public class HeronTest

 If you are unsure where to put this line of code, you can put it on the very first line above all of your other code.


, By default, when you created a new java class and checked the box to create the main class, NetBeans will automatically generate the code necessary to consider it the ""main"" class. If you don't see the code, you can follow these instructions.





 To create a main method, after the bracket type: public static void main(String args) {

 This makes it the first method that will be read and in this case, it is the only method to be read.


,

 Insert statements to get the lengths of the sides from the user and store them in side1, side2, and side3.  This is where we will use the swing class to create boxes to input information.

 Type the following lines of code below to create input boxes when you run the program.

 String input = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(""Enter length of side 1 "");

 double side1 = Double.parseDouble(input);

 vString input2 = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(""Enter length of side 2 "");

 double side2 = Double.parseDouble(input2);

 vString input3 = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(""Enter length of side 3 "");

 double side3 = Double.parseDouble(input3);




,  

 To do this, Type the name of the object with a capital, the name of this version of the object (can be any name you want) to make it look like the line below:

 Heron heron = new Heron(side1, side2, side3);



 To get the line to print we need to use a System.out.println statement:

 System.out.println(""A triangle with sides of "" + heron.toString() + ""...\n...has area of "" + heron.getArea( ));




, 

 Click the green arrow at the top. (Or right click anywhere in the code and hit Run). A box should pop up saying “Enter length of side 1”. Enter a number and repeat the process for sides 2 and 3.

 You should then get an output stating “A triangle with sides of x, x, x… ...has area of x”.

Use null as an unknown value.,
Use null as a condition for ending a process.,
Use null to indicate an uninitiated state.",How to Check Null in Java," A single “=” is used to declare a variable and assign a value to it. You can use this to set a variable to null.


A value of “0” and null are not the same and will behave differently.
variableName = null;;
, A “==” is used to check that the two values on either side are equal. If you set a variable to null with “=” then checking that the variable is equal to null would return true.


variableName == null;
You can also use “!=” to check that a value is NOT equal.

, The result of the expression will be a boolean (true or false) value. You can use the boolean value as a condition for what the statement does next.


For example, if the value is null, then print text “object is null”. If “==” does not find the variable to be null, then it will skip the condition or can take a different path.

, It is common to use null as a default in lieu of any assigned value.



string() means the value is null until it is actually used.

, Returning a null value can be used to trigger the end of a loop or break a process. This is more commonly used to throw an error or exception when something has gone wrong or an undesired condition has been hit.

, Similarly, null can be used as flag to show that a process has not yet started or as a condition to mark to be beginning of a process.


For example: do something while object is null or do nothing until an object is NOT null.

Plan your program.,
Write the code.,
Calculate the percentage.,
Display the percentage to the user.",How to Calculate Percentage in Java," Though calculating percentage isn't difficult, it is always a good practice to plan your program before beginning to code. Try finding the answers of the following questions:


Is your program going to handle large numbers? If yes, then try thinking about ways in which your program can handle large range of numbers. One way of doing this is using a float or long variable instead of int.;
, To calculate percentage, you will need two parameters:


The total score (or the maximum possible score); and,
The obtained score whose percentage you wish to calculate.

For example: If a student scores 30 marks out of 100 in a test, and you wish to calculate the percentage marks scored by the student, 100 is the total marks (or the maximum possible score). 30 is the obtained score whose percentage you wish to calculate.


The formula to calculate percentage is:Percentage = (Obtained score x 100) / Total Score

To get these parameters (inputs) from the user, try using the Scanner function in Java.

, Use the formula given in the previous step to calculate the percentage. Make sure that the variable used for storing the value of percentage is of type float. If not, the answer may not be correct.


This is because, the float data-type is 32 bit single precision that even considers decimals in mathematical calculations. Thus, using a float variable, the answer for a mathematical calculation like 5 / 2 (5 divided by 2) will be 2.5

If the same calculation (5 / 2) if done using an int variable, the answer will be 2.
However, the variables in which you stored the total score and obtained score can be int. Using a float variable for the percentage will automatically convert the int to float; and the total calculation will be done in float instead of int.



, Once the program has calculated the percentage, display it to the user. Use the System.out.print or System.out.println (to print on a new line) function, in Java, for this.

A method is the equivalent of a function in languages like C which helps in code reusing.,
The word public before the method name means that the method itself can be called from anywhere which includes other classes, even from different packages (files) as long as you import the class.,
The second keyword, static means that the method belongs to the class and not any instance of the class ( object ).,
The last word before the method name is void.,
When calling a method that returns something, you can use what it returns.,
Some methods require a parameter.,
Methods can also have multiple parameters, simply separated by commas.",How to Call a Method in Java," A set of statements make a method, and this method can be invoked through other statement. When invoked (called) , all the statements that are a part of the method would be executed. For instance, look at this method: ""public static void methodExample() {}"". It currently has no code in it, but there are three keywords before the method name. There is public, static, and void.;
, There are three other words that can replace public. They are protected and private. If a method is protected, then only this class and subclasses (classes that use this as a basis to build off of) can call the method. If a method is private, then the method can only be called inside the class. The last keyword is really not even a word. This is if you had nothing in the place of public, protected, or private. This is called the default, or package-private. This means that only the classes in the same package can call the method.


, Static methods must be called using the class name: ""ExampleClass.methodExample()"". However, if the keyword static was not there, then the method can be invoked only through an object. For instance, if the class was called ExampleObject and it had a constructor (for making objects), then we could make a new object by typing ExampleObject obj = new ExampleObject();, and call the method with ""obj.methodExample();"".


, The word void means that the method doesn't return anything (it does not return anything when you run the method). If you do want a method to return something, then simply replace the word void with a data type (primitive or reference type) of the object (or primitive type) that you wish to return. Then just add return plus an object of that type somewhere toward the end of the method's code.


, For example, if a someMethod() returns an integer, then you can set an integer to what it returns with ""int a = someMethod();""


, A method that requires a parameter of an integer would look like someMethod(int a) When using a method like this, you would write the method name, and then an integer in the parentheses: someMethod(5) or someMethod(n) if n is an integer.


, If the method someMethod required two parameters, int a and Object obj, it would look like ""someMethod(int a, Object obj)"". To use this new method, it would be called by the method name followed by an integer and an Object in parentheses: someMethod(4, thing) where thing is an Object.

Set default close operation.",How to Close a Window in Java1,", Default close operation is set using the setter method inside the JFrame class setDefaultCloseOperation that determines what happens when the close button is clicked and takes the following parameters:


WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE - Closes the frame and terminates the execution of the program.

WindowConstants.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE - Closes the frame and does not necessarily terminate the execution of the program.

WindowConstants.HIDE_ON_CLOSE - Makes the frame appear like it closed by setting its visibility property to false. The difference between HIDE_ON_CLOSE and DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE is that the latter releases all of the resources used by the frame and its components.

WindowConstants.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE - Does nothing when the close button is pressed. Useful if you wish to, for example, display a confirmation dialog before the window is closed. You can do that by adding a WindowListener to the frame and overriding windowClosing method. Example of the custom close operation:

More with buttons: To make the buttons do something look up actionListener()

",How to Make a GUI Grid in Java," This is rather simple. Turn on your IDE and create a new project. Call it what ever you wish. The example will be buttongrid.


This name doesn't really matter at all since it's just the file name that it will be given.;
, Create a new class and name it what you want. The example will be buttongrid. For an Eclipse user you will want to tic the box called public static void main(string[] args), so you won't have to type it when you start.


This name is more important than the previous one because it will have to be as single word or else it won't be usable.

, This brings all of the information you will need to write your code to this code. You'll need to import javax.swing.JFrame, javax.swing.JButton, and java.awt.Gridlayout. These are put before the beginning of the class, somewhere on lines between 1 to 3, the order they're on there doesn't matter.

, The constructor makes a new instance of the buttongrid class allowing many different button grids to all have separate information. All constructors need to be named the same as their class. Constructors don't need anything before it, but 'public' is often put there for ease of reference. Constructors are often placed as the first method in a class, so it goes right after the class name, it must, however be placed within the class. The buttongrid constructor needs parameters, which are put in brackets after the name of the constructor. The parameters in this example are integers 'x' and 'y'.

, To make sure it can be referenced outside of the ButtonGrid constructor method you place it out side of that method, but within the class. Most variables are named at the top of the class right before the constructor. To create a new frame you type: JFrame frame = new JFrame();
Inside the constructor method we need to make sure that all of the buttons are put in the grid layout. To do this we set the layout of frame by typing: frame.setLayout(new GridLayout(x, y));
Not necessarily mandatory, but to make the frame close when you hit the 'x' button in the top right hand corner we need to add the line: frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
To make the frame a proper size so everything fits we need to run the pack command: frame.pack();
Lastly for the frame we need to make it so it's visible: frame.setVisible(true);

, So right below the line where you create frame create the buttons: JButtongrid; The two sets of square brackets are there to say that the JButton's in the grid are kept in a two-dimensional format, if there were only one set of square brackets then it would simply be a line of JButton's, which still works, it's just easier to reference which button is being created or interacted with when it's two-dimensional.
The JButton's have been named, but we still have to say how many buttons there are. You need to add a line of code in the constructor that sets the amount: grid=new JButton;
Now that it's been determined that there will be a certain number of buttons, each must be created. The easiest way to do this is with two for loops, one for the x-axis, one for the y-axis. Inside the two loops we make a new button, and for ease of reference the example puts text inside each button so we know which button in the two-dimensional array is where. To create a button, inside the loop you need to put grid= new JButton (""(""+x+"",""+y+"")"");

, Inside the loop we need to put the buttons onto the the frame with a simple command: frame.add(grid);

, In your main class type: new ButtonGrid(3,3); The two threes make is a 3 by 3 grid, and any two positive numbers can be put in there.

Check your prediction.",How to Use Python List Comprehension," I recommend the interactive prompt while you're practicing it. To open IDLE, go to the Start Menu > Python (version number, mine is 2.6) > IDLE (Python GUI).

, To do this, we write a variable name, like foo, followed by an equal sign for assignment, a left bracket, then a series of values separated by commas, and finally a right bracket. Example: foo = . This is called a list.

, Write foo2 = . This runs a for loop which goes through each item in another list, string, dictionary, tuple, or other data type. The item before the for loop puts that item inside our new list. Press enter.

, Type: print foo2. If you have python 3.0, type print(foo2). Press enter, and the list should look like: . Now, if you're thinking, ""Why would I do that? I could've just done foo2 = foo!"", then you're right. But list comprehension gets way better. Read the following and you will soon see how powerful and useful list comprehension can be.

, Retype the foo2 line, and add the following to the end: if len(item) > 5. It should look like: foo2 = . What everything to the right of the if statement does is check if the number of letters in the item, (John, John2, Did I mention John), is greater than 5. If it isn't, then it doesn't add it to foo2. Len() just checks the length of a datatype. Len(foo) would be 3 because it has 3 items in it. So, foo2 = , right? (Remember, John and John2 are 4 letters long, which is less than 5.);
, Type print foo2, and your result should be . You can use if statements at the end to make sure you get the right value!

, Go under the Python 2.7 folder and click on “IDLE (python GUI). It should pop up with a python shell like this.

, In the upper left hand corner click file and on the drop down click on “New File”. This will open an untitled file where you will write your program.

, To be able to use turtle graphics you need to import them to your program. You this in the first line of your code. You simply type “from turtle import *” like so. To give your program randomly generated colors, on the next line you need to type “import random”.

, To have graphics in your program you have to create a screen for them to be displayed in. You do this by creating a variable (it is best to name the variable screen) and setting it equal to the function “Screen()”. The screen size also needs to be set. On the next line you take the variable name you made for your screen and use the screensize function. For example: screen.screensize(400,400,”black”). Inside the parentheses is setting the height, width, and background color of the screen.

, Much like the previous step with the screen you set a variable (best named pen to save confusion) equal to the function “Pen()”. On the next line you set the speed of the pen using the speed function in the same fashion as the last step, however instead of using “.screensize” you use “.speed”. Inside the parentheses you set the speed (to create the pattern quickly, try setting the speed to 75).

, The cool geometric pattern that you get in this program is made from many squares being drawn in the screen. You need to create a variable named “size” and equal it to 20 which will be used to set the size of these squares

, To get the desired geometric pattern you need to keep the pen creating squares, you do this through repetition which is what a for loop is for. This is done by writing on the next line of code “for i in range(150): “. What this does is setup the program to run something 150 times, for this case it will be used for drawing squares 150 times which will result in a cool geometric pattern. (All steps after creating the for loop will need to be inside the for loop. This is done simply by hitting the tab key and indenting. However it should automatically do this for you after creating the loop.)

, To give the pattern randomly generated colors you need to do the following. On the next line create a variable named “r” and set it equal to “random.randint(0,225). Repeat this step two more times using the variable names “g” and “b”.

, Now that there are three variables generating random numbers you need to store them in a variable. In the next line of code make a variable named “randcol” and set it equal to “(r,g,b)” .

, To give your program access to colors you have run the color function. To run the color function all you need to do is type on the next line of code “colormode(255)” and move on to the next line.

, Using the pen you created earlier you will set its color. You do this by writing “pen.color(randcol)”. This will now give your pen a random color when it draws out the pattern.

, To get the desired effect you will need to type “pen.circle(size,steps = 4)”. In step 7 you created a variable “size” which is used here. Then the “steps = 4” part is what creates the square.

, The cool pattern comes from turning the pen in every iteration of the loop. You turn the pen by writing on the next line of code “pen.right(55)”. This makes the pen turn right at 55 degrees every time through the loop.

, Part of the cool pattern is that the square keeps getting bigger. You do this by writing the last line of code “size = size +3”. So every time through the loop it increases the size of the square by 3.

, Your program should like it does here.To see the cool geometric pattern all you have to do is hit “f5” on your keyboard.

Create an Array object like this:




var aValues = new Array();



;
,
Pass the array size as a parameter if you know ahead of time how many items it will contain:




var aValues = new Array(20);





,
Use either of these two methods to populate the array with bracket notation, similar to how it is done in Java:




      var aColors = new Array();
      aColors= “red”;
      aColors= “green”;
      aColors= “blue”;





,Understand that an array dynamically grows in size with each additional item.,
Specify values as arguments, creating an Array object with a length equal to the number of arguments.,
To access a particular item, use square brackets enclosing the position of the item to retrieve.,
Determine the size of an array with the length property.,
To add another item to the array defined previously, place the value in the next open position, since the array grows and shrinks automatically:




      var aColors = new Array(“red”, “green”, “blue”);
      alert(aColors.length); //outputs “3”
      aColors= “purple”;
      alert(aColors.length); //outputs “4”





In this code the next open position is 3, so the value “purple” is assigned to that position.,
Place a value in position 25 of this array and ECMAScript fills in all positions from 3 to 24 with the value null, and then places the appropriate value in position 25, increasing the size of the array to 26:




      var aColors = new Array(“red”, “green”, “blue”);
      alert(aColors.length); //outputs “3”
      aColors= “purple”;
      aColors(arr.length); //outputs “26”





,
Define an Array object by using the literal representation, which is indicated by using square brackets () and separating the values with commas.",How to Use an Array Class in JavaScript,",,,, For example, the following line of code creates an array of three strings:




var aColors = new Array(“red”, “green”, “blue”);






As in strings, the first item in an array is in position 0, the second is in position 1, and so on.

, For instance, to output the string “green” from the array defined previously, you do this:




alert(aColors); //outputs “green”





, Like the same property in strings, the length property is always one more than the position of the last item, meaning that an array with three items has items in positions 0 through 2.




      var aColors = new Array(“red”, “green”, “blue”);
      alert(aColors.length); //outputs “3”





, This addition changes the length of the array from 3 to 4.

,, For instance, the previous example can be rewritten in the following form:




      var aColors = ;
      alert(aColors.length); //outputs “3”
      aColors= “purple”;
      alert(aColors.length); //outputs “26”






Note that, in this case, the Array class is never mentioned explicitly. The square brackets imply that the enclosed values are to be made into an Array object. Arrays declared in this way are exactly equal to arrays declared in the more traditional manner.

Run mona.py.,
Troubleshoot your program.",How to Make a Self‐Writing Mosaic Program in Python," This is the base picture you will be using to create your mosaic. Note the picture's dimensions in pixels as this will be important for your code later.


Save it as ""mona.jpg""
The image is 743px by 1155px. Ensure sure the it saves as this size or else the mosaic will not be drawn properly.;
, Name the file ""makeMona.py""; this file name is for your own reference., For this program, you'll need the Pygame module to display your image and the Math module in order to perform your adding functionality.





from pygame import *    #Import Pygame
from math import *      #Import Math





, Before you can start mapping the image, you must create the display screen that the image will appear on and load in Mona Lisa.


display.set_mode((743,1155)) is how you set your display. (743,1155) represents the screen size; note that it is the exact same size as your Mona Lisa image in pixels.





screen = display.set_mode((743,1155))   #Set your display size
m = image.load(""mona.jpg"")    #Assign a variable name to your base image and load it
screen.blit(m,(0,0))     #Blit your image m into the top right corner






, Within your makeMona program, you will set up the new file you will be writing to.

Variable mon is your reference to the mosaic file. Within the quotations, you declare the file name ""mona.py"". The ""w"" declares that you will be writing to the new file.





mon = open(""mona.py"", ""w"")  #Create your mosaic file






, You can now start writing to mona.py. Here you will import your modules and set your display size.


mon.write signifies that you are now writing the following code to your new file. Your display size will be the same as the Mona Lisa image.





mon.write(""""""from pygame import *   
from math import *
 
screen = display.set_mode((743,1155))
"""""")    #To write to mon, you use triple quotes to isolate the desired code






, To confirm that your image was properly loaded into your program, you will display the image onto the screen.






running = True  #Tell the program to run
display.flip()  #Displays the image





, You can now start parsing the image into small rectangles to create the mosaic. To get the best mosaic effect without distorting the image, you will map every 5 pixels into a rectangle


mon.write(""draw.rect(screen,""+c+"",(""+str(x)+"",""+str(y)+"",4,4))\n"") is the most important line to note. The breakdown is as follows:

draw.rect(screen,""+c+"", signifies that you will draw your mosaic piece (individual rectangles to your screen, then appending ""c"" relates to str(screen.get_at((x,y))), which is how you map the colour at each pixel location.
The ""x"" and ""y"" in (""+str(x)+"",""+str(y) represent the location of your rectangle. You use str() because you need the program to read these x and y values as strings (because you are inside your triple quotes, which is all string formatting).
The 4,4 in +"",4,4))\n"") represent the dimensions of each rectangle in your mosaic. ""\n"" is your newline character, which tells the program to go to the next line and start writing the next line of code.





for x in range(0,743,5):    #For every 5 pixels in the x direction from 0-743
    for y in range(0,1155,5):   #For every 5 pixels in the y direction from 0-1155
 
        c = str(screen.get_at((x,y)))   #Get the pixel colour at every x,y pair
        mon.write(""draw.rect(screen,""+c+"",(""+str(x)+"",""+str(y)+"",4,4))\n"") #Write your pixel location to mona.py in the shape of a rectangle
    mon.write(""display.flip()\n"")   #Display the image






, As with any Pygame program, you must include your ""while running"" loop in mona.py.





mon.write(""""""running = True
while running:
    for evnt in event.get(): # checks all events that happen
        if evnt.type == QUIT:
            running = False
 
quit()"""""")  #Finally, you write your pygame ""while-running"" loop, which will allow the graphics module to run
mon.close() #Saves and closes mona.py





, Your main program makeMona.py is now complete. Here is all the code together.

screen.blit(m,(0,0))        #Blit your image m onto the top right corner
 
mon = open(""mona.py"", ""w"")  #Createy your Mosaic file
mon.write(""""""from pygame import *

    for y in range(0,1155,5):   #For every 5 pixels in the y direction from 0-1155
 
        c = str(screen.get_at((x,y)))   #Get the pixel colour at every x,y pair
        mon.write(""draw.rect(screen,""+c+"",(""+str(x)+"",""+str(y)+"",4,4))\n"") #Write your pixel location to mona.py in the shape of a rectangle
    mon.write(""display.flip()\n"")   #Display the image

            running = False
 
quit()"""""")  #Finally, you write your pygame ""while-running"" loop, which will allow the graphics module to run
mon.close() #Saves and closes mona.py





, If you go to wherever your makeMona program is saved, directly below it you will find your new program file mona.py.


If you open this file, you will see hundreds of lines of code. Magic! This code is each individual piece of the mosaic. Each line represents a new rectangular piece of Mona Lisa.
It may take several seconds to open; this is normal because it is such a big file.

, If everything up to this point is looking good, your last step is to run your program and behold your new Mona Lisa mosaic.

, It's easy to make small little mistakes once you're implementing the code for your own mosaic. Here are some common issues people run into and how to resolve them.


Where is my new program? - After running the main program, the new one should appear in the same file location as the main program.

My new program isn't running - All code you wrote for the self-writing program is contained in triple quotes. Review all of the code inside of these quotes throughout the program and ensure you didn't miss things like colons, closing brackets/quotes, or indentation formatting.

Why is the image distorted? - This can be a result of your display size. Ensure that your display size in display.set_mode() all throughout your code is the same.

You should download the latest version available, which was 3.4 at the time of this writing.
OS X and Linux come with Python already installed. You will not need to install any Python-related software, but you may want to install a text editor.
Most Linux distributions and OS X versions still use Python 2.X. There are a few minor differences between 2 & 3, most notably the changes to the ""print"" statement. If you want to install a newer version of Python on OS X or Linux, you can download the files from the Python website.;
, Most users can install the interpreter without changing any settings. You can integrate Python into the Command Prompt by enabling the last option in the list of available modules., While you can create Python programs in Notepad or TextEdit, you will find it much easier to read and write the code using a specialized text editor. There are a variety of free editors to choose from such as Notepad++ (Windows), TextWrangler (Mac), or JEdit (Any system).

, Open Command Prompt (Windows) of your Terminal (Mac/Linux) and type python. Python will load and the version number will be displayed. You will be taken to the Python interpreter command prompt, shown as >>>.


Type print(""Hello, World!"") and press ↵ Enter. You should see the text Hello, World! displayed beneath the Python command line.

, Python is an interpreted language, which means you can run the program as soon as you make changes to the file. This makes iterating, revising, and troubleshooting programs is much quicker than many other languages.


Python is one of the easier languages to learn, and you can have a basic program up and running in just a few minutes.

, You can use the interpreter to test out code without having to add it to your program first. This is great for learning how specific commands work, or writing a throw-away program.

, Python is an object-oriented language, meaning everything in the program is treated as an object. Also, you will not need to declare variables at the beginning of your program (you can do it at any time), and you do not need to specify the type of variable (integer, string, etc.).

, Open your Command Prompt or Terminal. Type python at the prompt and press ↵ Enter. This will load the Python interpreter and you will be taken to the Python command prompt (>>>).


If you didn't integrate Python into your command prompt, you will need to navigate to the Python directory in order to run the interpreter.

, You can use Python to perform basic arithmetic with ease. See the box below for some examples on how to use the calculator functions. Note: # designates comments in Python code, and they are not passed through the interpreter.





>>> 3 + 7
10
>>> 100 - 10*3
70
>>> (100 - 10*3) / 2   # Division will always return a floating point (decimal) number
35.0
>>> (100 - 10*3) // 2   # Floor division (two slashes) will discard any decimal results
35
>>> 23 % 4   # This calculates the remainder of the division
3
>>> 17.53 * 2.67 / 4.1
11.41587804878049




, You can use the ** operator to signify powers. Python can quickly calculate large numbers. See the box below for examples.





>>> 7 ** 2   # 7 squared
49
>>> 5 ** 7   # 5 to the power of 7
78125




, You can assign variables in Python to perform basic algebra. This is a good introduction to how to assign variables within Python programs. Variables are assigned by using the = sign. See the box below for examples.





>>> a = 5
>>> b = 4
>>> a * b
20
>>> 20 * a // b
25
>>> b ** 2
16
>>> width = 10   # Variables can be any string
>>> height = 5
>>> width * height
50




, Once you are finished using the interpreter, you can close it and return to your command prompt by pressing Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Ctrl+D (Linux/Mac) and then pressing ↵ Enter. You can also type quit() and press ↵ Enter.

, You can quickly create a test program that will get you familiar with the basics of creating and saving programs and then running them through the interpreter. This will also help you test that your interpreter was installed correctly.

, ""Print"" is one of the basic functions of Python, and is used to display information in the terminal during a program. Note: ""print"" is one of the biggest changes from Python 2 to Python 3. In Python 2, you only needed to type ""print"" followed by what you wanted displayed. In Python 3, ""print"" has become a function, so you will need to type ""print()"", with what you want displayed inside the parentheses.

, One of the most common ways to test a programming language is to display the text ""Hello, World!"" Place this text inside of the ""print()"" statement, including the quotation marks:




print(""Hello, World!"")





Unlike many other languages, you do not need to designate the end of a line with a ;. You also will not need to use curly braces ({}) to designate blocks. Instead, indenting will signify what is included in a block.

, Click the File menu in your text editor and select Save As. In the dropdown menu beneath the name box, choose the Python file type. If you are using Notepad (not recommended), select ""All Files"" and then add "".py"" to the end of the file name.


Make sure to save the file somewhere easy to access, as you will need to navigate to it in the command prompt.
For this example, save the file as ""hello.py"".

, Open your Command Prompt or Terminal and navigate to the location where you saved your file. Once you are there, run the file by typing hello.py and pressing ↵ Enter. You should see the text Hello, World! displayed beneath the command prompt.


Depending on how you installed Python and what version it is, you may need to type python hello.py or python3 hello.py to run the program.

, One of the great things about Python is that you can test out your new programs immediately. A good practice is to have your command prompt open at the same time that you have your editor open. When you save your changes in your editor, you can immediately run the program from the command line, allowing you to quickly test changes.

, Flow control statements allow you to control what the program does based on specific conditions.These statements are the heart of Python programming, and allow you to create programs that do different things depending on input and conditions. The while statement is a good one to start with. In this example, you can use the while statement to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to 100:




# Each number in the Fibonacci sequence is 
# the sum of the previous two numbers 
a, b = 0, 1
while b < 100:
        print(b, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a+b





The sequence will run as long as (while) b is less than (<) 100.
The output will be 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89

The end=' ' command will display the output on the same line instead of putting each value on a separate line.
There are a couple things to note in this simple program that are critical to creating complex programs in Python:

Make note of the indentation. A : indicates that the following lines will be indented and are part of the block. In the above example, the print(b) and a, b = b, a+b are part of the while block. Properly indenting is essential in order for your program to work.
Multiple variables can be defined on the same line. In the above example, a and b are both defined on the first line.
If you are entering this program directly into the interpreter, you must add a blank line to the end so that the interpreter knows that the program is finished.



, You can define functions that you can then call on later in the program. This is especially useful if you need to use multiple functions within the confines of a larger program. In the following example, you can create a function to call a Fibonacci sequence similar to the one you wrote earlier:def fib(n):
        a, b = 0, 1
        while a < n:
                print(a, end=' ')
                a, b = b, a+b
        print()
 
# Later in the program, you can call your Fibonacci
# function for any value you specify
fib(1000)





This will return 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987


, Flow control statements allow you to set specific conditions that change how the program is run. This is especially important when you are dealing with user input. The following example will use the if, elif (else if), and else to create a simple program that evaluates the user's age.age = int(input(""Enter your age: ""))
 
if age <= 12:
        print(""It's great to be a kid!"")
elif age in range(13, 20):
        print(""You're a teenager!"")
else:
        print(""Time to grow up"")
 
# If any of these statements are true
# the corresponding message will be displayed.
# If neither statement is true, the ""else""
# message is displayed.





This program also introduces a few other very important statements that will be invaluable for a variety of different applications:


input() - This invokes user input from the keyboard. The user will see the message written in the parentheses. In this example, the input() is surrounded by an int() function, which means all input will be treated as an integer.

range() - This function can be used in a variety of ways. In this program, it is checking to see if the number in a range between 13 and 20. The end of the range is not counted in the calculation.



, The previous example used the ""less than or equal"" (<=) symbol to determine if the input age met the condition. You can use the same conditional expressions that you would in math, but typing them is a little different:


Conditional Expressions. Meaning
Symbol
Python Symbol



Less than
<
<



Greater than
>
>



Less than or equal
≤
<=



Greater than or equal

==

 !=



, These are just the basics when it comes to Python. Although it's one of the simplest languages to learn, there is quite a bit of depth if you are interested in digging. The best way to keep learning is to keep creating programs! Remember that you can quickly write scratch programs directly in the interpreter, and testing your changes is as simple as running the program from the command line again.

There are lots of good books available for Python programming, including, ""Python for Beginners"", ""Python Cookbook"", and ""Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science"".
There are a variety of sources available online, but many are still geared towards Python 2.X. You may need to make adjustments to any examples that they provide.
Many local schools offer classes on Python. Oftentimes Python is taught in introductory classes as it is one of the easier languages to learn.

, Then enjoy the mass of pseudo-random digits you have created! Useful, right? Maybe not so what's next?

, At this point you need to choose a value for the highest point in your range. The number generated will not go above this point. Let's go with 7 for the purpose of this article. All you do now is multiply your generated random number by your desired high point. So; Math.random() * 7 essentially. alert() the output and take a look.

, If only life were that simple. Fortunately, JavaScript provides another useful method of the Math object called floor(). This method rounds the number down to the nearest whole number. Notice the emphasis on down. Even if the value is above .5, floor() will still lower it. The line in your script should now look something like Math.floor(Math.random() * 6). Once again, check your output using alert() or similar. Try it a few times. You will get a range of 0-6; but what if we wanted 1-7?





, Now it's time to set a lower limit to our range. You do this simply by adding onto zero to bring you to your desired lowest point. To show this clearly, we can change our old 0-6 script into the 1-7 script we've always dreamt of; Math.floor(Math.random() * 6 + 1). You don't need any extra brackets because multiplication is always performed before addition. As we've done before, check how it went. The full line, if you've been following the example, should look like this: alert(Math.floor(Math.random() * 6 + 1));. It looks confusing but hopefully it isn't so much now.

, As a final example, if you were looking to create a range of 3-9 for a script, you would multiply the result of Math.random() by 7. Once you've given it the old Math.floor() treatment you can add 3 on (remember, count up from zero) and voila!

You can write it in a notepad document but you will probably want an editor designed for programming such as Notepad++ (Windows), Atom (Mac) or Notepadqq (Linux). However any basic text editor does work.;
, You will need two files: one in HTML that is read by the browser and one in JavaScript that is the game.

, Because you only need two files, you don't need any sort of complex filing system. As long as the two files are in the same level of the same folder it will work. So save both of your files in the same place.


To save as html add a .html extension. Us a .js extension for the JavaScript file.Set up code in your files. The JavaScript file requires no setting up but the HTML does. In your HTML document add the following code:





<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
        <head>
                <title>Page Name</title>
                <script src=""quiz.js""></script>
        </head>
        <body>
 
        </body>
</html>






This is the basic set up for almost any page in HTML.


<!DOCTYPE html> defines the code as HTML to the browser.

<html> tells the browser that everything in that section is written in HTML unless specified otherwise.

<head> is a section that holds information about the page such as the title.

<title> is the name that shows up in search results and the name on the tab.

<script scr=""quiz.js""> is linking the JavaScript file to the HTML file.

<body> holds everything that is visible on the page itself.



, First you will create a function called start. The rest of your game code will go in this function. This is so you can start your game using a button on your HTML page. The following code creates this function:







var start = function(){
 
}





This code creates a variable(var) named 'start':var start. This variable is a function.

A variable is a key word that has a bit of data assigned to it, in this case a function.
A function is a section of code that can be 'called'. When it is called it runs the code inside its {}. This is so that you don't have to write out the same thing more than once.



, These variables will/do contain data such as: the score, the question, and the user input. They go inside the start function's {}.







var correct = 0;
var incorrect = 0;
var question = ""none"";
var input = ""none"";
var answer = ""none"";






correct: This is how many questions the user has answered correctly.

incorrect: This is how many questions the user has answered incorrectly.

question: This is the question that the user will be given, it will change for each new question.

input:This will hold the user's answer or their 'input'.

answer: This will hold the correct answer to the question.
Note: when you use a variable you don't need to write var, you do this only when making the variable.

, The ask function asks the user the var question through a prompt. A prompt is a pop-up box that requires the user to type their answer into the box.







var ask = function(){ 
                input = prompt(question);
};





Ask is a variable which is a function.
The function sets the variable input to the response of the prompt containing the variable question.
So in summary: The function asks the user a question in a prompt. The users response is then set to the variable input. So input is the answer that the user put.

, The score function reacts to whether the users input is correct or not. It then responds appropriately.







var score = function(){ 
        if(input == answer){ 
                correct = correct+1;
                alert(""correct"");
        }else{
                incorrect = incorrect+1;
                alert(""incorrect"");
        }
};





The variable score is a function.

if the variable input is equal to the variable answer(this is correct) the variable correct it equal to itself plus one.
And it gives the user an alert that reads: 'correct'.

else the variable incorrect is equal to itself plus one.
And it gives the user an alert that reads: 'incorrect'.
In summary: this function checks if the users input is the same as the answer, meaning it is correct. If there is a match then the amount correct goes up one and it alerts the user that their answer was correct. If there wasn't a watch the amount of incorrect goes up one and it alerts the user their answer was incorrect.

, This will make writing up the next bit easier.







var lazy = function(){
        ask();
        score();
};





The variable lazy is a function.
When run it calls two functions: ask(); and score();.
In summary: This function just calls two other functions. It means when you want to call both 'ask' and 'score,' you don't have to call them separately; you can just call 'lazy'.

, This could say anything. This code is a basic welcome. You don't need to have a welcome but it can be nice for the user.






alert(""welcome to my quiz, you will be answering 10 questions."");





, The following code demonstrates how.







question = ""What is the matrix?"";
answer = ""There is no spoon"";





The single = assigns the thing on the right to the variable on the left. This means that the variable question now holds the text(string)""What is the matrix?"". And the variable answer holds the text(string) ""There is no spoon"".

, This function calls the functions 'ask' and 'score'.







lazy();





The function 'ask' asks the user the question and saves the users input to the variable input. The function 'score' checks if the users input matches the variable answer and changes the variables 'correct' and 'incorrect' appropriately.

, First change the variable 'question' to your new question. Then change the variable 'answer' to the correct answer to your new question. Then run the function ask.

, This could involve telling them there score or the percentage of questions they got right.

How many they got correct:




alert(""Well done, you got "" + correct + "" out of 10"");





, At the very beginning you created a function named 'start'. You want to make the quiz start on the click of a play button. In the HTML body tag add the following code.







<button onClick=""start()"">play</button>





This adds a button to your page with the word 'start' on it. When the user clicks on it it will run the function 'start'. This function contains the code of the game.

, Using the
tag you can add plane text to your web page. You could warn the user that the answers are case sensitive or tell them to have a nice day. Fell free to add whatever you want to.

, Does it work how you expect?

, You could add more questions or messages, edit the HTML to make the page look nicer.

The plus side to online IDEs are you don't have to worry about platform compatibility.;
, JavaScript is a programming language that is mostly found interlace within HTML code. So, lets start there, HTML code begins with the declaration of the doctype at the top of the file. Followed by a HTML tag which encompasses the HTML document and a body tag which will display what is to be seen on the client-side of the browser.


In this instance, the code uses a p tag, where the ""p"" stands for paragraph. JavaScript allows the p tag to be looked at as an element along with the use of the ID attribute which defines the element further.
Next, using the script tag tells the browser where the scripting code will reside it can either be implement within the tags or externally. This is where the array code will be written.

, Arrays are used to store multiple values. Let's write some code that will store an array of colors.


The name of the colors are wrapped in quotes which tells the JavaScript code that these are strings and the commas separate the strings from one another. The brackets are used to place a border around the context of the array.

, Here, the ID attribute comes back into play by using ""document"", which is used to write information to the browser screen into a HTML element.


JavaScript also has a function called getElementById which does as the function states retrieves an ID element.
Also, adding the property innerHTML either retrieves or replaces the element.

, Gives the exact amount of values within the array.

Create an HTML page.,
Create a JavaScript script.,
Add a script tag.,
Respond to user events.,
Manipulate content.,
Deal with any problems that come up.",How to Get Started Using Javascript," Create an HTML page with some buttons and content. A sample page is given below. If you do not know how to write basic HTML, read How to Create a Simple Web Page With HTML first.


Here's the page:




<html>
  <head>
    <title>My first dynamic web page!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button id=""button_1"">Click Me!</button>
    <div id=""div_1"">Content 1</div>
    <button id=""button_2"">Click Me Too!</button>
    <div id=""div_2"">Content 2</div>
  </body>
</html>





You should see a page like this:





;
, Create a file; let's name it ""dynamic.js"", put this in the same folder as your web page HTML. Here's the sample script with an explanation:






// the ""function"" keyword creates a block
// of code that can be executed by name
//
// event is a ""parameter"" that will be ""passed""
// to this function later, meaning that the
// function block will have access to it
//
// ""event"" holds information about the event
// that triggered this function, more on that later
function click1(event){
}
 
function click2(event){
}





, Now that you've created your script, you'll want to add a script tag in your HTML. Adding this tag allows your page to run the code you'll place in your script. Here's the new HTML:






<html>
  <head>
    <script src=""dynamic.js""></script>
    <!-- we want to make sure our page is aware of the script we created above -->
    <title>My first dynamic web page!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button id=""button_1"">Click Me!</button>
    <div id=""div_1"">Content 1</div>
    <button id=""button_2"">Click Me Too!</button>
    <div id=""div_2"">Content 2</div>
  </body>
</html>





, JavaScript is an event-driven language; it is built around responding to user events, and taking actions based on those events. In JavaScript, you add ""event handlers"" to different parts of the page, and these ""handlers"" are triggered by user actions, which then triggers your code. You can add event handlers in two ways:



Using HTML

You can add event handlers using event attributes on the HTML elements. In this case, we want to add click events. Notice that the events reference the function names above.





<html>
  <head>
    <script src=""dynamic.js""></script>
    <title>My first dynamic web page!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- the onclick event is mapped the functions above -->
    <!-- notice how we use ""pass"" event to the function -->
    <button id=""button_1"" onclick=""click1(event)"">Click Me!</button>
    <div id=""div_1"">Content 1</div>
    <button id=""button_2"" onclick=""click2(event)"">Click Me Too!</button>
    <div id=""div_2"">Content 2</div>
  </body>
</html>







Using JavaScript

Adding events in JavaScript is recommended. Adding events in HTML tends to mix the code with your layout, which is not a good practice. Here's the changes required to add those events:





function click1(event){
}
 
function click2(event){
}
 
// just pass the name of the function
document.getElementById(""button_1"").onclick = click1;
document.getElementById(""button_2"").onclick = click2;





, Once you have handlers set, you'll want to respond to these user actions. Generally, you'll want to output some sort of content to the user based on the actions they've taken. To do this, we'll have to add a few things to our function definition:






function click1(event){
  // var declares a new object, like event, that we can use
  // notice that ""div_1"" corresponds to the id property of
  // the div in the html above
  // el will refer to the content in the div above
  var el = document.getElementById(""div_1"");
  // innerText is a property of html elements
  // which holds the text that the user sees
  // text must be surrounded by quotes
  el.innerText = ""You clicked my button!"";
}
 
function click2(event){
  // event.target gets the element which triggered this function
  event.target.innerText = ""You clicked me!"";
  var el = document.getElementById(""div_2"");
  el.innerText = ""You clicked my button too!"";
}





These functions will change the text you see in those divs we created earlier.

Here's the expected result of clicking the first button:





And then the second:





, There are a couple things that could go wrong while you follow the steps in this article. Here are a few of those and what to do if you encounter them:


Your web page doesn't display properly. Make sure that your page is valid HTML. There are websites which can check this for you and let you know where there may be errors.
Your code isn't doing anything. You'll need to ""debug"" issues in the JavaScript scripts. For Google Chrome, press ++to bring up the console, which should alert any errors to you. From here, you'll need to search these errors on StackOverflow or some other site to get assistance. The shortcut is for Internet Explorer.
Sometimes this just means that you've made a simple misspelling. Be sure to check for these before you dig too deep.
You also may need to Enable JavaScript first.
This may also happen in some browsers because the content must be ""served"" to the browser to be rendered correctly. If you can't debug the issue, then you may have to set up a web server like IIS to host the site locally. This is out of the scope of this article.

, In the search box, type “JavaScript” to search for the option. You’ll see “javascript.disabled.”

, Right mouse click on “javascript.disabled” and click toggle in the dropdown menu. The value will change to “true,"" and the text will be bolded.

 ;
,
Use the question mark (?),

As in the if statement; not adding the : and the value after that, the statement will still work.",How to Create JavaScript Conditional Operators,", and the colon (:) to create a conditional statement. After the question mark (?) you have two statements divided up by the colon (:). The first statement (before the colon) will be executed if the condition is true and the second (after the colon) if the condition is false.


For example: (#1)
This illustrates the short-hand way of creating the following ""if"" statement:　　x = (numberOne == 1) ? true : false;
Normal one:　　if(numberOne == 1){　　　　x = true;　　}else{　　　　x = false;　　}
An even shorter way of writing that would be:　　x = (number == 1);For example: (#2)
If x is true, then doThis().
Normal:　　if(x){　　　　doThis();　　}
Shorthand:　　(x) ? doThis() : 0;
Even shorter:　　x && doThis()For example: (#3)
If x is false, then doThis().
Normal:　　if(!x){　　　　doThis();　　}
Shorthand:　　(!x) ? doThis() : 0;
Even shorter:　　x || doThis()

The JavaScript becomes less recognizable due to removing whitespace and shortening variable names (just a few of the things minifying will do to your source code).;
, This may help identify problems before your code is compressed and/or minified by pointing out common errors. There are some online analyzers like JSLint or JSHint.

, The best thing is to try a variety of services and programs to see what works and what gives you the best compression ratio. Some of these tools are online such as JSCompress, Dean Edward's packer, Google Closure Compiler, or the YUI Compressor.

, After you minify the source code you will want to put it into your project. Remember to keep the original code so you can make changes if (and when) a bug is found.

, If you don't test your code, you're going to have a bad time. This is because minified code is significantly different from your original code. It is important to double-check that the functionality is exactly the same.

Download the required software.,
Unzip these three files.

,
Install three software one by one.,
Install MySQL.,
Install Apache.,
Open your web browser and type ‘localhost’ as the address.,
Unzip the PHP file and copy it to the C disk.,
Find the file named ‘httpd.conf’ at ‘C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\conf’.,
Open the htdocs folder at ‘C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2’.,
Open your web browser and enter ‘localhost/test.php’ as the address.",How to Install PHP on a Windows 7,"


Download PHP at www.php.net/  
Download Apache at http://www.apache.org/  
Download MySQL at http://www.mysql.com/   ;
,, First MySQL, then Apache, and PHP last. MySQL is a database software which contains data. Apache is a server and PHP is the language that you will learn and use.

, Remember the username and password you entered because you can’t enter your database system without the username and password. Follow the instructions step-by-step. Install MySQL first because MySQL don't need to configure the environment. You just follow the instructions and you can install it correctly.

, Open the file and follow the instructions. Do not change anything because if you do, you have to change a lot of things in the future. That will cause you problems if you are a beginner at all this.

, If it shows ‘It works!’, that means you have successfully installed the Apache. Then you can go on to the next step.

, Rename the folder as ‘php’. It’s easy to remember when so named.

, Edit it with Notepad++. Add two important sentences at the end of file: ‘LoadModule php5_module C:/php/php5apache2_2.dll’ ‘AddType application/x-httpd-php .php’. Do not forget to save the file. Close the notepad and restart the Apache.

, Create a new file called ‘test.php’. Open it with Notepad and enter the following contents: Don't forget to save.

, If the browser shows your PHP version and other things, that means you have successfully installed the whole PHP. Now you can start to use and learn PHP on your own computer.

First, if you want to do this through packages just type yum install php-mbstring php-mailparse and skip down to editing ini files sections below.,
Go to (or create) a temporary directory and get the extension: wget http://pecl.php.net/get/mailparse You should end up with a file named mailparse-X.Y.Z.tgz, where X.Y.Z is the version.,
Unpack the code:

tar zxf mailparse-X.Y.Z.tgz
(you obviously need to replace ""X.Y.Z"" with the proper version number, per above)

,
Go to the package directory:

cd mailparse-X.Y.Z

,
Prepare the package for compilation with your version of PHP:

phpize

,
Configure the package for compilation:

./configure

,
Compile:

make

,
Install:

make install

,
Find out where mbstring's ini file resides:

rpm -q -l php-mbstring

,Look for an ini file in the output of the command above; edit that file and comment out the line reading ""extension=mbstring.so"" (prepend a semicolon),
Tell PHP that you want it to use extensions mbstring and mailparse in the proper order: edit file /etc/php.ini and add the following lines at the end of section Dynamic Extensions:

extension=mbstring.so
extension=mailparse.so

,
Restart Apache:

service httpd restart

,(Optional) delete or clean up the temporary directory you created at step 1.",How to Install Mailparse in PHP Under Fedora," This was best way in Fedora22.

,

wget http://pecl.php.net/get/mailparse
You should end up with a file named mailparse-X.Y.Z.tgz, where X.Y.Z is the version.

Create a new database.,

Create a database user.,

Create the hit_counter table.,

Create a new file called ""HitCounter.php"".,

Stub out the HitCounter class.,

Write the constructor.,

Write the public functions.,

Fill in the remaining helper methods.,

Create a new file to use your hit counter.,

Include the file containing the HitCounter class.,

Call the views processor.,

Display your view counts.,

Test your hit counter.",How to Make a PHP Hit Counter," If you already have a database, username, and password, you can skip this step. If you do not have access to a MySQL console, you'll want to enter this query in phpMyAdmin or another online query tool. If your web host provides you with a username and database already (and you have no control over creating more), use those and skip this step.
, If you're at this step, then it is assumed you are logged into MySQL with a root account and want to create a separate user to access the hit counter. If this does not apply, use whatever username you already have for accessing the database. Be sure to use your own credentials, not the ones used in this example. Grant the user permissions to your database., This table will keep track of the number of hits we get. Use the table structure as shown in the image., This file will contain a class you can include in other PHP scripts when you want it to log a hit., Create local class members to hold your credentials and the database connection info., In the constructor, you should establish the database connection and initialize the hit counts at zero., These methods can be called from any other script that instantiates the HitCounter class.

Add a method for processing views. This method gets called on every page load that should be counted towards a hit.
Add a getter for the total views. This will get called in places where you want to show the total view count.
Add a getter for the unique hits. You'll call this where you want to show the unique view count.

, These methods do the brunt of the work for the hit counter. They're marked private so that they can only be used internally.


getData() retrieves the current view counts from the database. If there isn't any data, it sets this data to zero.

isNewVisitor() determines whether the visitor has already visited our website in their current session

visit() increments the total hit counter, and increments the unique visitor counter if the user has not visited the website in their current session.

, This should be an actual page you intend the visitor to see. If you already have a website, this should be the front facing PHP script (usually index.php). Basically, any PHP file that is accessible from the web and you want to use to update the counter., It's recommended to use require_once over include., This will tell the hit counter to update the counts. It's also necessary to get the current counts for display., You can choose to show either the total number of hits or only the unique hits. It can be embedded anywhere HTML it output by the PHP script., Your hit counters should now increment appropriately when you view your web page. If you keep refreshing, your total hit count will increase but your unique session count will stay the same. This is good."

Collect the necessary information which is important to display the actual month, and highlight the actual day.,
Determine what day was the first day, how long is the month, and, of course, which is the actual day, with the above information.

,
Use the PHP built-in function: getdate().,
As next step we need to fill to following lines.,
As semi final step we need to add the rest of the month to the last line.,
The complete code using the CSS is the following: <tbody></tbody>

01

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-


<tbody></tbody>

02
<html>

<tbody></tbody>

functionshowCalendar(){


<tbody></tbody>

09

    // Get key day informations.",How to Create a Calendar in PHP," Besides this, you want to display the actual month and year as well. To do this you'll need 3 special day inputs:


The actual day
The first day of the actual month
The last day of the actual month;
,, Without parameters, this function returns the actual day information in an array as follows:<tbody></tbody>

01
Array

<tbody></tbody>

02
(

<tbody></tbody>

03

   => 40


<tbody></tbody>

04

   => 58


<tbody></tbody>

   => Tuesday


<tbody></tbody>

12

   => June


<tbody></tbody>

13

   => 1055901520


<tbody></tbody>

14
)

To get the last day of the month with get date we need to try to get the 0. day of the next month. So the code to get the information looks like this:<tbody></tbody>

1
<?php

<tbody></tbody>

2

    $today    = getdate();


<tbody></tbody>

3

    $firstDay= getdate(mktime(0,0,0,$today,1,$today));


<tbody></tbody>

4

    $lastDay  = getdate(mktime(0,0,0,$today+1,0,$today));


<tbody></tbody>

5
?>

Step 3.To display a calendar we need a table with 7 columns for the days of the week. The number of lines depending on the number of days and the first day of the month. However we need a header line with month and year information, a subheader line with the name of the days.<tbody></tbody>

1
<?php

<tbody></tbody>

2

    // Create a table with the necessary header informations


<tbody>Now that you have the header of the table, fill the first row. It is not so easy as you cannot just write 1 in the first cell, 2 in the second and so on. It only works if the first day of the month was Monday, but what if not? To decide this we need the day item from the firstDay array. With this information we can fill the cells with a space if needed. The code to do this is the follows:<tbody></tbody>


3

    echo'';</tbody><tbody>"";</tbody>


4

    echo' 



'.$today."" - "".$today.""



<tbody>';</tbody>


5

    echo'






<tbody>';</tbody>

6

    echo' 

Mo
Tu
We
Th

<tbody>';</tbody>

7

    echo' 

Fr
Sa
Su

<tbody></tbody>

8
?>









01
<?php


<tbody>';</tbody>


02

    echo'






<tbody></tbody>

03

    for($i=1;$i<$firstDay;$i++){


<tbody>';</tbody>

04

        echo'

 

<tbody></tbody>

05

    }


<tbody></tbody>

06

    $actday= 0;


<tbody></tbody>

07

    for($i=$firstDay;$i<=7;$i++){


<tbody></tbody>

08

        $actday++;


<tbody>"";</tbody>

09

        echo""

$actday

<tbody></tbody>

10

    }


<tbody>';</tbody>

11

    echo'


<tbody></tbody>

12
?>

, It is a bit easier, we only need to know how many full week we have and fill some table rows as follows: <tbody></tbody>

01
<?php

<tbody></tbody>

02

    $fullWeeks= floor(($lastDay-$actday)/7);


<tbody></tbody>

03

    

<tbody></tbody>

04

    for($i=0;$i<$fullWeeks;$i++){


<tbody>';</tbody>


05

        echo'






<tbody></tbody>

06

        for($j=0;$j<7;$j++){


<tbody></tbody>

07

            $actday++;


<tbody>"";</tbody>

08

            echo""

$actday

<tbody></tbody>

09

        }


<tbody>';</tbody>

10

        echo'


<tbody></tbody>

11

    }


<tbody></tbody>

12
 

<tbody></tbody>

13
?>

, In this case it is quite easy: <tbody></tbody>

01
<?php

<tbody></tbody>

02

    if($actday< $lastDay){


<tbody>';      </tbody>


03

        echo'






<tbody></tbody>

04

        for($i=0; $i<7;$i++){


<tbody></tbody>

05

            $actday++;


<tbody></tbody>

06

            if($actday<= $lastDay){


<tbody>"";</tbody>

07

                echo""

$actday

<tbody></tbody>

08

            }


<tbody></tbody>

09

            else{


<tbody>';</tbody>

10

                echo'

 

<tbody></tbody>

11

            }


<tbody></tbody>

12

        }


<tbody>';</tbody>

13

        echo'


<tbody></tbody>

14

    }


<tbody></tbody>

15
?>

Step 7.To make the calendar little bit nicer we will introduce some CSS design. The CSS file is very simple:<tbody></tbody>

01
table {

<tbody></tbody>

02

    width:210px;


<tbody></tbody>

03

Review your integer variables.",How to Write PHP Scripts," This is the program you will be using write and edit your code.


NotePad can be accessed on any version of windows using ⊞ Win + R > Notepad.
TextEdit can be accessed on Mac by going to Applications > TextEdit.;
, A section of PHP code begins and ends with bracketed PHP tags (“<?php” “?>”). “Echo” is a very basic statement (an instruction to the computer) in the PHP language that will output text to the screen. The text you want to echo must be enclosed in quotation marks and end in a semi-colon.


The code should look something like <?php echo “Hello World!”; ?>.

, This is done by navigating to File > Save As...


In Notepad, add .php to the end of the filename and enclose in double quotations. This ensures the file will not be converted into a basic text file by Notepad. Without the quotation marks, the file will become hello world.php.txt. Alternatively, you can select the drop down menu under Save as type and change it to ""All Files (*.*)"" which will leave the name exactly how you type it and the quotes will not be needed.
In TextEdit, no quotations marks are necessary, but a popup will appear asking you to verify that you want the file saved as .php.
Make sure you save the file to your “server’s” document root directory. Typically this is the folder named “htdocs” in your Apache folder on Windows, or /Library/Webserver/Documents on Mac, but can be set by the user manually.

, Open your preferred web browser and type this address in the address bar using the name of your php file: http://localhost/hello world.php. Your browser window should display the echo statement.


If you receive an error message, make sure you typed the code correctly as shown above, including the colon.
Also make sure that your file is saved into the correct directory.

, The “<?php” and “?>” tags tell the PHP engine that everything between them is PHP code. Everything outside the two tags is treated as HTML and ignored by the PHP engine and sent to your browser the same as any other HTML. The important thing to recognize here is that PHP scripts are embedded inside regular HTML pages.

, Statements are used to tell the PHP engine to do something. In the case of an echo statement, you are telling the engine to print what is inside the quotes.


The PHP engine itself never actually prints anything to your screen. Any output generated by the engine is sent to your browser as HTML. Your browser does not know that it's getting PHP output. As far as the browser is concerned, it's getting plain HTML.

, Adding HTML tags can alter the output of the php statement. The “<strong>” “</strong>” tags will add bold formatting to any text placed inside of them. Note that these tags appear on the outside of the text, but inside of the quotations marks of the echo statement.


You want your code to look something like:
<?php?
echo ""<strong>Hello World!</strong>"";
?>

, Go to File > Save As… and save the file as ""helloworld2.php”, and open it in your browser by using the address: http://localhost/helloworld2.php. The output is the same as before, but this time the text is in bold.


Make sure you save the file to your “server’s” document root directory. Typically this is the folder named “htdocs” in your Apache folder on Windows, or /Library/Webserver/Documents on OSX, but can be set by the user manually.

, Remember, statements need to be separated by a semicolon.


Your code should look something like:
<?php
echo “Hello World!”<br>;
echo “How are you doing?”;
?>

, The page will display two echo statements, listed in order, on two lines. Notice the “<br>” on the first line. This is HTML markup to insert a line break.


If you didn't add this, your output would look like this:
Hello World!How are you doing?

, To manipulate data, be it numbers or names, you need to store the data in a container. This process is called declaring the variable. The syntax for declaring a variable is “$myVariable = “Hello World!”;”


The dollar sign ($) at the beginning tells PHP that $myVariable is a variable. All variables must start with the dollar sign, but the name of the variable can be anything.
In the above example, the value is ""Hello World!"", and the variable is $myVariable. You're telling PHP to store the value at the right of the equal sign, into the variable at the left of the equal sign.
A variable containing a text value is known as a string.

, Referring to a variable in the code is known as a call. Declare your variable, then echo the variable instead of typing out the text.


Your code might look something like:
<?php>
$myVariable = “Hello World!”;
echo $myVariable;
?>

, Go to File > Save As… and save the file as “myfirstvariable.php”. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/myfirstvariable.php and the script will print the variable. The output looks the same as printing plain text, but how it was achieved is different.


Make sure you save the file to your “server’s” document root directory. Typically this is the folder named “htdocs” in your Apache folder on Windows, or /Library/Webserver/Documents on OSX, but can be set by the user manually.

, Variables can also contain numbers (known as integers), and then those numbers can be manipulated using simple mathematical functions. Start by declaring three variables called “$mySmallNumber”, “$myLargeNumber”, and “$myTotal”.


Your code should look something like:
<?php
$mySmallNumber;
$myLargeNumber;
$myTotal;
?>

, Give an integer value to “$mySmallNumber” and “myLargeNumber”.


Note that integer values do not need to be contained in quotation marks. That will cause numbers to be treated as a text value like the “Hello World!” variable.
Your code should look something like:
<?php
$mySmallNumber = 12;
$myLargeNumber = 356;
$myTotal;
?>

, Rather than doing the math yourself, you can call the two variables in the “$myTotal” variable. Using a mathematical function, the machine will calculate the sum for you. To print the variable, you need only add an echo statement that calls the variable after the declaration.


Any change to either integer variable would be reflected when printing the “$myTotal” variable with echo.
Your code should look something like:
<?php
$mySmallNumber = 12;
$myLargeNumber = 356;
$myTotal = $mySmall Number + $myLargeNumber;
echo $myTotal;
?>

, Your browser window will display a single number. That number is the sum of the two variables called in the “$myTotal” variable.

, Using a variable to store text allows you to call that variable any time you want to use the store value instead of constantly typing out the contained text. It also allows for more complex manipulation of the stored data moving forward.


The first variable, $myVariable, contains a string value; ""Hello World!"". Unless you change the value, $myVariable will always contain the value ""Hello World!"".
The echo statement prints the contained value of $myVariable.

, You have explored basic manipulation of integer variables by using a mathematical function. The resulting data can be stored into another variable. This is only the beginning of what can be accomplished with these variables.


The two variables, $mySmallNumber, and $myLargeNumber are each assigned an integer value.
The third variable, $myTotal, stores the added values of $mySmallNumber and $myLargeNumber. Since $mySmallNumber holds one numeric value, and $myLargeNumber holds a second numeric value, this means $myTotal holds the value of the first number added to the second number. This value can change with alterations to either of the included variables.

Get two vinyl turntables.,
Choose two songs that you know very well.,
Adjust your headphones so that they cover one ear and play track B.,
Cue track B on the first beat of a bar.,
Start track B so that it lines up with the beat of track A.,
Speed up or slow down one of your tracks to correct any lag.,
Figure out which track is faster or slower than the other.,
Speed up or slow down the pitch of track B to match the tempo of track A.,
Wait 20 seconds to see if the tracks start drifting apart again.,
Try to match the pitch of the two songs before track A has finished.,
Stop track B and cue it again.,
Wait for the mixing point.,
Lift your finger off the track B record to start it at the correct beat.,
Mix the two songs using the channel faders.,
Start the same process with the next song.",How to Mix Music Using Beatmatching," You will need to use both at the same time in order to beatmatch your two songs.


If using CD players then you will also need two. You will need two CD players in order to play two songs at the same time and work to beatmatch them.;
, These are the songs you will first try to beatmatch. It is best to choose two songs that you know well because it makes it easier when first learning how to beatmatch. It is also best to choose two songs of the same genre with similar beats per minute (BPM)(+/-5 BPM) and the same time signature as these will be easier to beatmatch as a beginner.


Most house songs will have a 4/4 time signature and around 120-130 BPM.

, This is so that you can hear track A through the speakers and track B through the headphones. Track A would be the song playing to the audience and track B would be the next song in the set if you were performing.


You should also turn off or cover up the BPM and waveform readers with sticky notes. The point of this exercise is to learn how to beatmatch by ear so using these readers would be cheating.

, Find the first beat of the song by starting to play the song and then stopping the record as soon as you hear the first beat. Then turn the record back and forth through the beat position to locate it precisely. Cueing the record means that the needle is slightly behind the beat position.


On a CD player play the track and then press pause as soon as you hear the first beat. Rewind a little using the seek buttons or jog wheel to find the point just before the first beat. You may also set a “cue point” for future use by pressing the Cue button just before the first beat of the track.
Although most professional CD decks claim to start instantly there will always be a slight delay between pressing play and the track actually beginning to play. You will have to get used to your individual CD player and adjust your cue point accordingly.
Some songs have a buildup or lead-in at the beginning so you may have to move past that to get to the first beat.

, Remove your finger from the record to start track B. It is best to start on the first beat of a bar or, even better, a phrase so that the flow of both tracks happen simultaneously.


A bar is a group of repeating beats with the first beat usually sounding heavier or having a slightly different sound. There might be a sudden snare kick, a new baseline or start of a synthesizer lead.
A phrase is a set of bars that repeat, as in a chorus. House music almost always will have 32 beat phrases, but 8 and 16 beat phrases are also common.
On a CD player you will start track B by pressing the Play/Pause button.

, If you have started track B slightly off from the beat of track A then you will need to either speed up or slow down track B to get its beats to match.


To speed up the track you can either give the record a slight push near the edge of the center label or twirl the spindle clockwise using your index finger and thumb.
To slow down the track you can gently touch the outer edge of the record with your finger.
If the records get further apart after your correction then you corrected in the wrong direction! Simply correct in the opposite direction to fix the problem.
On a CD player you can either use the Pitch bend button to speed up or slow down the track or rotate the jog wheel if the CD decks have them. Rotating the jog clockwise will speed up the track while rotating counterclockwise slows down the track. Both the Pitch bend buttons and jog wheel may vary considerably between different models so you should familiarize yourself with whichever player you will be using., Pick an easily recognizable sound in track B that plays once or twice per bar. As you play track B at the same time as track A concentrate only on this sound and listen to where it falls on track A. You should start to notice that it either falls behind or races ahead of where it should be on track A.


Although it is easy to notice that the tracks are not at the same tempo, it may be difficult to determine which one is going faster or slower than the other.
After a time the tracks will be so far apart that it becomes confusing to determine which is slower or faster. If this occurs stop track B and cue it to start over again.

, Use the pitch control slider to speed up or slow down track B. If you have not corrected enough and the drift still occurs then continue moving the pitch slider in the same direction. If you have gone too far and over-corrected then the correct pitch is somewhere in between your two pitch values and you can push the pitch slider in the opposite direction to find the perfect pitch.


On a CD player you will adjust pitch (called “pitch bending”) in the same way as on a vinyl turntable. The only difference is that you will be able to see a very accurate pitch percentage in the display, which can help with adjustments.
If the tracks get so far apart that you can no longer tell which is faster or slower, then stop and cue up track B once more. This will happen a lot at the beginning; be patient and try again., If they do not drift until after 20-30 seconds that you have successfully beatmatched.


Beatmatching perfectly (lasting minutes or more without drifting) is very hard to attain and not necessary. If after 20-30 seconds the two tracks begin to drift you can always adjust them a bit more. Once you play an actual party you will be so good at noticing the differences that you will adjust any misalignments before dancers even hear them.

, You should try to match track B to track A before track A is finished so that you can transition to the next song during a performance.


It is ok if you are unable to do this in the beginning, simply restart track A and try again.

, You have matched the tempos of the two songs by keeping track B in your headphones. To play track B over the speakers you will need to stop track B and cue it again by finding the first beat on the record.


On a CD player you can press the Cue button again. Since you have already set the cue point earlier this brings you back to that point and you then press pause.

, It should be a beat near the end or before the break of the live song at the beginning of a bar or phrase. Preferably there will be no vocal at this point of the song because vocal can cause even beatmatched songs to sound jumbled or conflicting.

, The tracks should be at the same tempo so if you notice that there is a lag then slow down or speed up the record by pressing the turntable disc with your finger or lightly pushing it to accelerate it. Now the beat from the cued song will sound exactly when the beat from the live one does. The audience will hardly feel they're two different songs, especially if they're in the same key.


On a CD player press Play to begin track B.
At first track B will still only be playing in your headphones. You will want to correct any errors in terms of lag at this point.

, Bring the volume of track B up until both are playing in the speakers. Make sure there's a reasonable time during which both songs are playing (at least 15 seconds) and then slowly fade out track A. As you crossfade, no one will know when track A is finished, and they will have the feeling that only the vocals have changed.

, Now you can repeat the beatmatching process with the next song in your set by placing the new vinyl or CD on deck A. This time you will be beatmatching the new song to track B.

You can even edit many simple clips on smartphones and tablets now using apps like Vee for Video or Magisto. Your choice really depends on what you want to do with your video clip:


If you want to add or splice clips, add basic titles and/or music, apply a basic effect, or trim the intro and outro, free software will be fine. You can even use a collection of free, online editors, like YouTube's editor, for short clips.
If you want to add special effects or transitions, fine-tune the color or lighting, or want tight control over your edits, you should use professional software.

Mobile software often uploads easily to Youtube or Vimeo, and allows you to quickly shoot, edit, and post a clip that only requires light touch up.;
, Always keep a copy of your original video, untouched, in case something happens while editing. Most editors even save new copies every time they edit the clip, allowing them to keep old versions if something happens.

, All video editing software has a timeline where you order the clips for your final video. If you've only got one clip to edit, you still must pull it into your timeline to edit it.

, Basic video editing is rather intuitive. You physically move, stretch, and cut the clip together in the timeline, which then plays the clips exactly as shown. If there are more two clips stacked, the top clip will always play. While each program is a little different, you can search for a quick tutorial video online to teach you the basics of your software if you get lost.

, When the clip is done, you can hit ""File"" → ""Import"" to bring in music, or click on ""Effects"" or ""Filters"" to play with some fun special effects. Save these changes for when the movie itself is done -- you want to make the major changes before the cosmetic ones.


Remember that you cannot use copywritten music, like a pop song, without permission if you plan on selling your video or using it for profit., Again, these will change based on the software you're using. Place the titles on the very top of the video, effects, and music in the timeline -- this keeps them from being affected by the rest of the changes you've made.


Place your titles in the upper or lower third of the screen for a professional look.

, Usually, you click ""File"" → ""Export"" to send your video out into the world. While you have a wide variety of options available, the most common video file extensions are .mov, .mp4, and .avi. These three formats can play on YouTube, Vimeo, and most other streaming sites and computers.


Some programs only have a ""Save As"" button, which brings up a menu that allows you select your video type."

That said, the term has come to mean mostly high-end, quality video editing software with robust features and controls. You should use what is comfortable to you. Options include:



DaVinci Resolve: A new, free, and open-source video editing program. It may keep changing, but the price is enough to make it worth trying.

Adobe Premier: One of the classics, Premier works well on Mac and PC. If you use other Adobe products, like Photoshop, you may find Premier easy and intuitive to get used to.

Final Cut X Pro: This specific version of Final Cut was considered the industry standard for a long time, though it has gotten weaker with updates. Very popular for Mac computers.

Avid: The standard of many professional film editors, Avid has all the functionality of its competitors and an interface made to work on the project with a large team., What is it your clip is trying to say? Does it tell an actual story or plot? Is it just a funny event you saw the other day? Is it a powerful speech you captured? Figure out what the purpose of your video is -- how do you want to change the viewer's mood when they finish watching? Good editors highlight this idea and use it to guide all of their editing decisions.


What is the main point, image, or idea of the video? How can you bring it front and center?
This doesn't mean all videos need a story -- they just need a central idea or image to anchor everything.

, If the shot, moment, or image isn't adding anything to the story, ditch it. For good video clips, every single frame needs to seem intentional -- this isn't a movie, this is a short scene that needs to hold a viewer's complete attention the entire run-time.


If you're only using one continuous camera feed, you can still mask over mistakes or slow moments with well-placed text or music., Flashy, obnoxious transitions are the hallmark of many poor editors. Ditch the snazzy flashbulb and stick to simple fades, dissolves, and hard cuts (no transition at all) when switching between clips. If you want to use a fancy effect, use it to transition in and out of the clip at the very beginning and end.Never use the novelty cuts and transitions, like ""Star Wipe."" They just distract from your actual video.

, The rule of thirds comes from photography, and is used to compose great frames for film or photos. Mentally divide the frame with two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, so you have nine even boxes on your image. The rule of thirds states, simply, that the best images place items on these lines. When titling or adjusting the image, try to line up your text, the horizon, and special effects with these imaginary guidelines., The purpose of a good editor is to disappear, and this is doubly true for a short video clip. Use a basic color correcter, like your program's ""color balance"" effect (they all have one) to make the footage smooth and attractive. Then lower the volume on the music so that you can still hear the camera audio. Make sure that, when played together, the sound is not too loud. Remember -- you want people focused on content, not why the music is too loud or the video looks ""too blue.""


Audio needs to be faded in and out, just like video, to sound natural., If you're only recording simple, one-take clips, then this doesn't need to apply. But, for all other shoots, knowing that you'll be editing a video later should make you a much more diligent camera person. Some things to consider include:


Always shoot run-in and run-out footage, or 5 seconds of nothing before and after shot. This gives you crucial editing footage to splice with other shots.
Take a few shots of ""coverage,"" or the setting around you, that you can cut to hide any mistakes in the footage.
Never skimp on audio. If you can, use a dedicated microphone instead of a camera mic, or simply record a few minutes of background noise in your location to edit over mistakes later."

You can stack them in boxes or folders, allowing you access to them. They're a great resource of inspiration when needed. Even Starbucks gives out creative weekly mini-newspapers. You can also do this online. Download work which you like. Make a new Map on your computer and name it 'Inspiration'. Save everything you like there. Every time you're stuck or have no idea what to add more into your work, you can always look in your 'Inspiration' map.;
, Having an extensive book collection is essential to learning. Try to buy a new book at least every few weeks. Look for a range of inspirational, educational, fun, and technical topics.

, You will learn a lot by reading other designers' blogs.The web in an invaluable resource of information -- take advantage of it and actually use it.

, These will teach you new techniques, and will expose you to new methods and useful tricks. Work through them and then apply the learned techniques to your own designs. There are a lot of great tutorial sites out there. You can also find some on personal blogs. Constantly improve your skills by looking for tutorials and completing them.

, Starting a blog will make you more aware of the design community and make you more analytical toward your own work. If you blog well enough, you may also attract attention in the community.

, As a freelance designer, joining an online design community is a must. Not only does it keep you up-to-date in the design world, but is also great for feedback and critique. Being your own boss is great, but not having anyone to answer to as a freelancer also has its down sides. If you work alone, there is no one to criticize your work and help you improve. A site you might like to become a part of is DeviantArt. There you can.


Collaborate with other designers.






Enter competitions and contests, that will motivate you to become better.
Seek comments and advice from other designers to see where you can improve, your own assessment may not be the best.
Seek out designs that pique your interest and find tutorials that explain the techniques involved; you can also contact artists and ask about their techniques.
Critiques. It’s so helpful to artists when someone critiques their work. Even reading critiques of other designs is helpful.

, Photos solve the problem of not being able to take home designs you like. Camera phones are great for this. Just snap a photo and file it away for later. You can use Evernote for this type of thing; pictures of building designs, textures, shapes of shadows on walls, etc. Take photos of anything that interests you from a design standpoint.


Photography is also good for exercise in composition, lighting, and color, and your photographs can fuel your artistic designs.
Remember to respect copyrights when taking photos. In particular, do not reuse or republish others' copyrighted content without permission.

, Create a fake brand for a company. Design logos, stationery, brochures, websites, the whole nine yards. It’s good to do this once in a while because it keeps design fun and lets your creativity run wild without limitations. It’s often easy to get caught in a rut when clients start dictating and your work no longer remains ""yours"".

, Get as much information about them as you can and re-brand them. Logo, business cards, letterhead, mock website. It keeps you on your toes. Plus, you might even end up using it in your portfolio. Or, donate free design work to local community organizations, school groups, whoever. they’ll appreciate it, and designing an effective community meeting flier or something gives you great experience and feedback on effective, moving work.

, Don't want to create a fake brand to design? Try redesigning other people’s projects. This helps you evaluate what ""they"" did wrong and what you could do better.

, It is important to keep your old work. It will help you see if you’re moving forward and improving your skills. Instead of throwing away or deleting old projects, try reworking them.

, Every few months, make it a point to attend lectures of other designers speaking at local schools and universities to learn new things.

,, Attending lectures and events is a great way to meet other designers. You should always try to search out the designers that have more experience and talent than you do. It’s hard to admit someone else is better than you, but networking with people of higher skill levels will push you to work harder and learn more.

, Many local colleges allow you to register for classes without enrolling full-time. It will not only teach you some new things technically, but also put you back in a classroom of your peers.

, You can learn a lot from asking questions to experienced designers and design studios. You can also get answers to questions your design school could never answer.

, Experiencing new cultures and seeing their artwork opens your mind to a whole new world. It is good for inspiration.

, Sketching helps you work through ideas quickly and without limitations of design software. Sketching is a most excellent way to quickly explore ideas and concepts. You can sketch for multiple hours and work out lots of possible variations to the design at hand. This is an essential step in the design process. It will save you time to work through concepts on paper before going to the computer. The process of sketching then moves into digital drafts. Remember, draw first, click later. "

Use links effectively.,
Send your press releases out a few minutes past the hour.,
Send your press release to the right publications.,
Leverage technology.,
Consider using a distribution service.",How to Distribute a Press Release1," One of the easiest ways to give your press release the largest possible audience is by linking to several outside sources in the text of your release, like this: Add a Link to WordPress. It takes practically no time to do and it helps you in several ways. For example:It gives you credibility with the audience in general. If you link to the websites of opinion leaders in your industry, you associate yourself with them in the minds of your audience.
It enhances your SEO , or search engine optimization. The presence of links to a website and from a website lets Google and other search engines know how reputable your website is and how high it should show up in the results of web searches.;
, People like to think in round numbers, and writers of press releases and reporters are no exception. Practically, it means almost everyone sends out their press releases on the hour. With everyone sending out press releases at the same time, they all tend to get lost in the crowd.To avoid this effect, send out your releases eight or nine minutes past the hour, when the rush has died down.

, Some companies are so large virtually any press release they send out will be covered in some way, but most businesses are lucky to get much press coverage at all. In order to maximize the chances of your press release turning into actual news coverage, you need to make sure you’re sending it to the kinds of publications that will think it is newsworthy. Most small businesses aren’t able to send their press releases directly to CNN and get coverage from it. A better strategy is to research the influential blogs and magazines in your industry and target those. If you’re lucky, larger news sources pick up the story, but if everything plays out as expected, you’ve still got your press release into the hands of the publications that matter to your industry.
For example, if you run a firm specializing in 3-D printing and you're rolling out a new innovation, don't waste your time sending your press releases to USA Today, CNN, and the New York Times. Instead, send them to web magazines like 3Ders.org and 3DPrint.com, which specialize in 3D printing related news.If you do reach for a national audience, send the press release off to Popular Mechanics or Science instead.

, Distributing press releases effectively is multi-step process, and a great deal of it involves correspondence. You’ll want to keep track of friendly reporters, which press releases generate the best press in the right publications, and much more. This can be time consuming, and if you want to both distribute press releases effectively and do other things with your time, an email-marketing service would be an excellent way to do both.One of the most widely used email marketing services is Mailchimp, and you can actually use it for free if you have less than 2000 subscribers and send less than 12,000 emails per month. You can build an email list, see who’s opening your emails, and even how your number compare with other similarly situated companies.

, There are a number of press release distribution services, and level of service they offer varies considerably. While some are barely more than glorified bulletin boards, others are extremely sophisticated, offering writing services, tracking, media contacts and targets, and much more.Generally, you’ll get what you pay for, and many commentators question the wisdom of using a paid service at all if your business is small. Nonetheless, you should be aware that distribution services are out there. Some are helpful, some are free, but rarely are they both.

What might stand out the most and be noticed? Some people are good at singing, some people are good at drawing exactly what they see in front of them, and others excel at talking about a variety of issues.;
, After making a considered analysis, select the most interesting activity in which you often engage and truly love.

, Broaden your horizons by surveying similar efforts by others– in person, on the internet, and, possibly, by taking on a coach who is well-versed in the finer points of the activity or skill you have targeted. Make it a primary goal to learn new dimensions and gain as much of knowledge of the activity as you can and from different sources.

, Compare yourself with the most honored person in the field and closely examine the areas of special expertise that sets this person above all others. Your target could be a famous artist, singer, public speaker, or something different and unique.

, These are the extra competencies which supply the luminary with panache, setting them above all others. When you compare yourself you will find something extra or special in that person with whom you compare yourself. Seek to add these to your skill set by targeting those areas specially.

Use targeted, personal appeals.,
Give your core publications a competitive advantage.,
Suggest placement ideas.,
Follow up.",How to Distribute a Press Release2," Instead of sending out mass email blasts to hundreds and thousands of reporters and publications, cultivate 10-100 reporters who cover the beats relating to your industry. Try to speak to each reporter personally. Reference or comment upon articles they wrote about similar subjects before you inundate them with press releases. For example, send off a short email like this: ""I saw your article about the bio-applications of 3-D printing, and I thought it was great. I'm in the industry, and you were right on the specifics. There's some stuff that's even more exciting in the pipeline. I'll keep you posted.""
While you’re finding reporters who can be of value to you, figure out how you can be of value to them as well. Self-interest is just as powerful a motivator for a reporter as it is for you, after all.

, When you’ve identified the publications and reporters who are of the most use to you, find ways to nature those relationships. Among the easiest is to give them access to the press releases before anyone else—a head start.This is a technique known as “embargoing” a story. If you aren’t familiar with journalistic practices, it might seem unfair, but it’s widely accepted.

, When it comes to work, easier is almost always better. This applies to a well-known outlet and a new one equally, and it will make any reporter’s job a little easier if you give them an idea or two on how the story could be placed or an angle from which to write it.Make doubly sure to do this when you’re trying to grow your media foot print. If you’re reaching out to a new media outlet, make their job easy—tell them how you think your press release fits into their publication.

, If you want to create effective press releases in the future, you need to know whether the one’s you’re writing today are effective. The easiest way to do that is by following up. If a press release you write becomes the germ of a reporter’s story, contact them a week or two after it ran and see how the story did. See if there were any particular aspects of the story that played well, so you can tailor future press releases to those concerns.Following up is also a tried and true method for helping keep your professional relationships with reporters alive. It doesn't have to be anything fancy. For instance, ""I saw your piece last week, and I thought it was great. I noticed you got a chance to use a few things from our press release in it. You getting any feedback that sticks out?""

"
"
Remember that your press release tells a story.,
Integrate multimedia.,
Explain to the audience what’s in it for them.",How to Distribute a Press Release3," One of the typical shortcomings of new press-release-writers is stylistic—they tend to write a press release as if it was a memo. That is, they tend to write a dry, matter-of-fact document more suited to office consumption than public consumption. This is a mistake. A press release should be written like a hybrid of an advertisement and a news story; it should be pithy, catchy, and informative. The best case scenario for your press release is this: the reporter who reads it thinks it’s a newsworthy topic, runs out of time to write a story about it, and puts their name on what you wrote, giving you complete control over the message. If what you’ve written is good enough, there’s a (very slim) chance that could happen. If you write something dry and filled with jargon, it never will.

, The eye is drawn to a picture to a greater degree than it is to text, and as a consequence, visual aids work in press releases just as well as they do in any other type of written media. Tastefully integrated photographs, images, and videos are all great ways to get more eyes that matter reading what you want them to read.The effect of adding images and video is considerable—18% and 55% greater views on average, respectively.

, Understand that even if you advertise, your press release might be the way a lot of viewers learn about your good or service, whether the reader is a member of the press or a member of the public. As a consequence, you need to explain to the reader what they stand to gain by diverting their attention from whatever else is vying for it, and reading your press release. After every press release, your reader should be able to easily explain what is new, why it is unusual, and why they should care. Tweak it until you’ve satisfied those conditions.

Into cell range L17087:L17090 from top to bottom, enter A, B, C, D. What you're doing is setting the Side Letter of 4 sides to each sphere number down the left column of the number of sides in the top row, 4 in this case. The next case is 8 sides as indicated by the value 8 in cell M17086. From the top down, enter A, A, A, B, B, C, C, D -- a total of 8 letters. Now to add another letter of each type in subsequent series. So go to N17088 and enter ""=N17087"" into that cell and copy that cell and paste it to cell range N17087:AA17150. Thus are made copies of whatever entry is made to the cell above. Now, it's just a matter of changing the cell letter at the right time. So if, for example, there is to be one more A under 12 than under 8, you type a B after adding one more A in the column, and add a C after adding one more B in the column, and enter a D after adding one more C in the column, and after there is one more D, you hit delete, and the rest of the column entries go to zero. The zeros were cleaned up by deleting them all -- your preference. Here are pictures of both the LikelyStory and LOOKY vlookup tables necessary for completing this article:

Make use of helper articles when proceeding through this tutorial:

See the article How to Create a Spirallic Spin Particle Path or Necklace Form or Spherical Border for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation.",How to Acquire the Black Mosaic Tile Image via Excel," Depending on which version of Excel you're using, when you get to the steps concerning creating the new chart, you'll either use Chart Wizard and a Chart page will be created for you, or you will cut and paste the chart from the Data sheet. Furthermore, the steps below have been copied to a large extent from Make a Square of Spherical Helixes, so if you'd like to save some time and have completed that article, you can do a SAVE AS on it to a new workbook, title it appropriately, and save it to a logical file folder. Look for the words MODIFIED or NEW to indicate changes from the original text.

,, Make the cell borders bold and individual in the color of your choice. Do Insert Name Create in Top Row. In p, in cell G1, Insert New Comment, ""0,P to P,P then P,P to P,0, then P,0 to 0,0, then 0,0 to 0,P."" That forms a square when we Fill in series., M2: .65., Command Select A3:B3 and Insert Name Define name BASE to cell $B$3. Command Select C3:D3 and Insert Name Define name SPHEROIDS to cell $D$3. Command Select E3:F3 and Insert Name Define name TIP to cell $F$3. Command Select G3:H3 and Insert Name Define name SHRINK to cell $H$3., Select cell range A4:M4 and Align Center and Underline text., In column B, select cell range B6:B2877. With cell B6 as the active highlighted cell, input the formula, without quotes, ""=B5"" and then do Edit Fill Down. The constant 1314.82 should appear now in the range from B5 to B2877, as the formula copied the value each time from the cell just above itself., Input the following formula without quotes into cell A5: ""=IF(ODD(SPHEROIDS)=SPHEROIDS,0,TIP)"". The value 64,540.88 should appear. Do Format Cell Number Custom without the brackets and widen the column if need be., The value -968,113.19 should appear in cell A1444 and the value -969,458.73 should appear in cell A1445. By multiplying the top times 2, we took care of both the negative as well as the positive values while decrementing  each time with the negative sign., Do Edit Fill Down. We multiply by pi/180 to convert to degrees from pi radians. The value in (ROW()-5) relative to C5 is 0; therefore, we are taking the cosine of 0., Do Edit Fill Down. The value 1.0000 should appear in cell C1445 and the value 0.0000 should appear in cell D1445 after selecting range C5:H1445 and Cell Format Number for 4 decimal places., Do Edit Fill Down. That is a zero at the very end, not an OH. We will not be using Multer1 or Multer2 -- they are used for warping and other effects inside or outside this formula. Basically, this is the formula for a spherical helix in a ring defined by adding C5 instead of G5, but by adding G5 we're creating a square instead. ""GMLL"" stands for ""Golden Mean Long Leg"" and it has a tendency to keep things proportionate no matter how much they're scaled up or down in size, so each term is multiplied by this factor. Notice that for the x values, the basic scheme is SIN*COS*COS. We are raising to the power of N, currently set to 1, which you may play with and note the interesting effects of the N=.5 or N=2 or N=3 on the space inside of 1^2 in the graph space. It would seem that what they taught us about 1 raised to any power equaling 1 is not true, when in fact it is, but it sure doesn't seem that way here., This would form a ring of spheres if we added D5 instead of H5 near the end of the formula because columns C and D, being the cosine and sine, form a circle. That option might necessitate a Factor of .125 and of course new Edit Fill Downs for the formulas in columns E and F. Notice that for the y values, the basic scheme is SIN*SIN*COS. The final COS element is the Z or 3rd dimension for both E and F. The graph is a fractal and is neither truly 2-dimensional nor 3-dimensional per the actual staining medium on the paper. You may think of it like an architectural drawing where the height dimension has been taken down to nearly zero, but not quite zero., There are 4 sides of the square to do in about 2324 cells, so that's 581 cells per side (I should have stopped at 576 if you want to correct things). We're going to do one side at a time: first the x's, then the y's., Enter to O2 w/o quotes ""=2880/SPHEROIDS"" and do Insert Name Define Name SpheroidSurroundRows to cell $O$2., Select cell range G6:G585 and with cell G6 as the highlighted active cell, enter the formula ""=p/(SpheroidSurroundRows*SPHEROIDS/5)+G5"". Do Edit Fill Down. Select cell range H5:H585 and with cell H5 the highlighted active cell, enter the formula ""=p"" and Edit Fill Down. This completes the first part of the graph or the first side, from ""0,P to P,P"". Select cell range G5:H365 and Format Cell Border Black Bold Outline., Do Edit Fill Down. Select cell range H586:H1161 and with cell H586 as the highlighted active cell, enter the formula, ""=-p/(SpheroidSurroundRows*SPHEROIDS/5)+H585"" -- the minus sign is very important. Do Edit Fill Down. Select cell range G586:H1161 and Format Cell Border Red Bold Outline. This completes the second side, from ""P,P to P,0,""., Select cell range H1162:H1746 and with cell H1162 as the active highlighted cell, enter the formula, ""=0"". Do Edit Fill Down. This completes the third side of the square, from ""P,0 to 0,0"". Select cell range G1162:H1746 and Format Cell Fill Canary Yellow and Border Bold Dark Blue., Select cell range H1747:H2330 and with cell H1747 highlighted and active, enter the formula ""=p/(SpheroidSurroundRows*SPHEROIDS/5)+H1746"" and do Edit Fill Down. The last fourth leg or side of the square is done, ""0,0 to 0,P."",,,,,, And those are all zeroes at the far right hand end of each formula, not OH's.,

Edit Go To cell range Q5:Q68 and enter 1 into cell Q5 and do Edit Fill Series Columns Linear Step Value 1, OK.
Edit Go To cell range R5:R68 and enter .125 and Edit Fill Down.

, It's much easier having the original formula or value right there as pasted from the copy from the formula bar than trying to find it in this article. I urge you to do that now while you check for errors against this articles inputs, as it shows no errors. If you do have errors, see also the WARNINGS section below about how to fix them if they are not obvious. And a column full of zeroes should be considered an error as well, if it's the entire column. Please also bear in mind that some variables have been set up to play with later -- it's just that we're at the basic level at this point. Some variable could probably be better named, eg. Power for N, or ShrinkorExpand for Shrink.,

Check x of p and y of p: Edit Go To cell range G5:H2330 and do Charts from the Ribbon or Chart Wizard, All/Other, Scattered - Smoothed Line Scatter. The result should be a direct square from {0,1} thru each side of 1 unit length up to point {1,1} and back to {0,1} (approx.) {0,1} actually occurs in cells G2322:H2322, but the discrepancy doesn't matter and has to do with what the spheroids need to come out looking right anyway, not a straight line. If that chart checks out OK, delete it, otherwise use it to correct the formulas in the x of p and y of p columns.
Edit Go To E5:F2330 and do Charts from the Ribbon or Chart Wizard, All/Other, Scattered - Smoothed Line Scatter. Copy or Cut the resulting chart and paste it to the upper left hand corner of the Chart worksheet. Do Chart Layout and get rid of Axes, Grid lines and Legend. Grab the lower right hand corner and expand the chart into a nice large square shape at about J45. You must wait until the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow before you can grab and resize the chart.
Do menu item Chart Add Data and in response, click on the Data worksheet and select cell range K5 to L2877. Mine never works right. I get two series, neither of which is right, There's a green one that has spheroids, so I click on that and edit its formula in the formula bar until it reads, ""=SERIES(,DATA!$K$5:$K$2887,DATA!$L$5:$L$2877,2)"" (make sure both say 2887). Then click on the other series and delete it. Click in the plot area.
Do menu item Chart Add Data again and in response, click on the Data worksheet and select cell range M5 to N2877. Mine never works right. I get two series, neither of which is right, There's a green one that has spheroids, so I click on that and edit its formula in the formula bar until it reads, ""=SERIES(,DATA!$M$5:$M$2877,DATA!$N$5:$N$2877,3)"" (make sure both say 2887). Then click on the other series and delete it.

Click in the Chart Area surrounding the Plot Area and do Chart Layout Chart Area Format Selection. 3-D Format: Top should be Hard Edge 16 pt Width 16 pit Height. Depth and Surface Surface should be Dark Edge. Fill should be black. Shadow should be checked and Outer 45 degrees black 100% size, 4 pt blur, 111 pt distance and 57% transparency (or so).
Do Chart Layout Series 1 Format Selection. Color is Black, smoothed line, 2.5 pt, 0% transparency; Shadow is checked 21 degrees Outer Color 2nd lightest Grey, 100% size, 4 pt blur, 20 pt distance, 57% transparency; Glow and Soft Edges should be 3rd grey down, 2 pt size, 0& transparency, 1 pt soft edges. Change order: Move down to 3 or bottom.
Do Chart Layout Series 2 Format Selection. Color is color wheel, darkened, about 5.6 from center slightly to left (7-10%) from direct blue and color bar at right is down at about 57-60%, so this is a dark blue, kind of muddy, tending a bit more towards green than violet and not all the way out at the edge RGB is 22, 46, 109. Line weight is 3 point, smoothed line., no shadow, glow is yellow 1 pt transparency 1% soft edges 0 pt. Order is topmost, # (furthest backgrounded).
Do Chart Layout Series 3 Format Selection.. RGB is 24, 18, 32 color wheel very dark violet purple (near black) -- on the violet chart bar it's about 90% towards the bottom and halfway out in the very dark dark purple circle. Smoothed Line, Line Weight 2.5 pts. Shadow is checked Outer 315 degrees yellow 100% size, 4 pt blur, 3 pt distance and 0% transparency. Glow and Soft Edges is White, 2 pt size, 25% transparent, 0 pt soft edges.

Use this method for simple collages.,
Open the background image first.,
Open the image you want to superimpose.,
Select the circular selection tool.,
Click and drag around the portion of the image you wish to transfer.,
Soften the edges of the selection (optional).,
Once you find a selection you're happy with, copy and paste it onto the background image.,
Re-position and re-size it to scale.,
Use File → Save As to save the result under a new name.",How to Overlay Pictures1," Follow this method to put together simple pieces of photos into one image, quickly and easily. This method is not for convincing photoshop jobs, but may be what you're looking for to create a fun holiday card or similar amateur creation without taking a lot of time.


For best results, download free photo manipulation software such as GIMP, Paint.NET, or Pixlr. If you happen to own professional software such as Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro, you can of course use them, but purchasing them is not at all necessary.
Because this method requires only a few tools, you can use this method with simple software not mentioned above, such as Windows Paint. However, you may not have access to a ""feather tool"" to create a more attractive result, and without ""layer"" functionality, it will be easier to mess up and cover portions of your photos you meant to keep.;
, This is the image that will serve as a background for the image or images you will superimpose. Use your photo editing software to File → Open it.


Use File → Save As to save it under a new name if you want to keep the original version. You can also do this after you're done, but if you do it in advance there's no risk of forgetting and overwriting your file.

, You will transfer part of this image on top of the background image. Use the same program to open the second image in a new pane. For this one, you'll definitely want to File → Save As now under a new name to avoid altering the original.

, You should see a grid of buttons with different images on it, usually to the left of the screen. These are your tools. Click the circle or oval made of dashed or dotted lines, usually located near the top of the list.


You can hover you mouse cursor over a tool and wait for the name to appear to confirm your selection. It may be called ""ellipse selection"", ""ellipse select"", or a similar name.
If you can't find that selection tool, you can use the rope ""lasso tool"" or the square ""rectangle select"" tool instead.

, Drag around the person, animal, or other piece of the image you want to overlay onto a different background. Try to find a selection that looks attractive, with the subject centered and no incongruities included (like someone else's arm coming in from the side).


Most photo manipulation programs come with a Invert Selection command, which selects everything except what you currently selected. This is handy for seeing what your selection looks like by itself: use Ctrl + Shift + I (or command + Shift + I on a Mac) to invert selection, then Edit → Cut to remove everything but the image you'll be transferring. Be ready to Edit → Undo so you can try different selections.
If you dislike every selection, you may need to follow the steps for Overlaying a Detailed Image.

, The resulting image may have harsh or strange-looking edges, which can make the final result seem unnatural or obviously manipulated. You can adjust this by using a ""feather tool"" or ""feather setting"" to soften the edge, but be aware that different programs require you to access the feather ability in different ways:


In Photoshop, right click the selection and click Feather.In Gimp, use the top menu: Select → Feather.In Paint.NET, you will need to download the Feather Plugin and open that plugin's menu to use this tool.
In Pixlr or Paint Shop Pro, click the selection tool and alter its feather setting before making a selection.In any program, you should see an option to enter a numeric amount determining how extreme the feathering effect will be, measured in pixels. Start with 1 or 2 pixels for this method to avoid losing fine details.

, You can do this with the Edit → Copy and Edit → Paste commands, making sure to select the desired background image you opened earlier before pasting.


If everything but the selection gets copied, you need to use the Invert Selection command a second time to get back to the original selection.

, Select the move tool, which looks like a cursor arrow or a four-point compass, then click and drag the superimposed image to the desired location. If you need to change the size of the overlaid image, follow these steps:


Go to File → Free Transform (or hit Ctrl + T) to transform the image.
A box should appear around the superimposed image; click and drag the sides and corners to change the size and shape. To maintain the proportions, hold Shift while clicking and dragging a corner.
If the wrong thing moves, make sure you’re on the right layer by going to View → Layer or Window → Layer, then clicking the layer that contains the superimposed image.

, Make sure that you've selected the image that contains the final result before saving. It should be in front of any other images.


You can add additional pictures to this picture in the same way, no matter how many times it's been altered.
In order to change which pictures are placed over or under other photos, reveal the Layers menu with View → Layers or Window → Layers on the top menu, then drag each photo thumbnail higher or lower on the list. The lowest layer should always be the background image, while the highest layer will always show up in full on top of everything.

Search for (or take) pictures of cats.,
Think of a caption.,
Try finding cats in positions that look as if they have an 'invisible object'.,
Open up the desired cat picture with Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, place your desired ""capshun"" on the picture in Impact font, Bold it, colour the text white and enable a black outline around it.

,
You're done!",How to Make a Lolcat," Get several of them and choose which one would look funny with 'captions'. If you use someone else's image, make sure to ask for permission, or if it's a Creative Commons image, give them credit appropriately.;
, Remember that spelling/grammatical errors are deliberate. This ""language"" is sometimes called lolspeak, kitteh or kitty pidgin. You may be able to find some translators online.Try these caption templates (replace the blanks with your desired noun/verb):
""IM IN UR ___, ___-ING UR ___""
""IT ARE ___, I HAS IT""
""OH NOES! MAH ___ IT ARE ___!""



, Put a caption describing what is the 'invisible object'. A good (existing) example would be ""invisible bike.""

,, Now send to friends or post on forums for the world to view your creation! Many lols will come forth!

Take the familiar equation y = Kx^2 and rotate it about the origin.,
Do this by making a substitution of two new variables (X and Y) using equations like this:

x = cos(t)*X + sin(t)*Y
y = -sin(t)*X + cos(t)*Y
where sin and cos are the sine and cosine functions from trigonometry, and t is the angle by which you are rotating the parabola, and where you'll let X and Y vary between -5 and 5, being sure that 0 is one of the values as well.

,, Double click on Excel (either the green X on the dock or the app title in the folder) and select File New Workbook.,, Doing so will select the entire worksheet. Format Cells Number Number to decimal places 2, show comma. Format Cells Alignment Center., The cell beneath it will become the Defined Named Variable Factor1, which will be used to factor the parabola's size of the x coordinate, eg. if you want to cut all the x values in half, you would enter .5 into cell A2;
Enter to cell B1 the label, Factor2. This will be used to factor the y coordinates.
Enter to cell C1 the label, ParaVertex X. Used to control the vertex.
Enter to cell D1 the label, ParaVertex Y. Also used to control the vertex.
Select cell range A1:D2 and Insert Name Create Names in Top Row. This will assign the labels as Defined Variable Names to the cells A2 to D2.
Enter to cell A2 the value, 1;
Enter to cell B2 the value, 1;
Enter to cell C2 the value, 5;
Enter to cell D2 the formula, =5+5-1.79; (w/o the ending semi-colon)

, This will create the defined variable name K for cell G4, which can now be used in a formula. Select cell G4 and enter the value 5 into it.

,, Do Charts, All, Scatter, Smooth Lined Scatter. A chart will appear atop your worksheet. Drag it off to the right just past the data, out of the way, then hover over the bottom right corner until the cursor turns into a double-headed arrow, then pull the chart down and to the right to expand it.

Your chart should show a very thin parabola, like the fiber of an iris muscle of the eye somewhat, extending from about {5,5} down to {253.10, -158.31} on the left branch and to {253.10, -158.65} on the right branch. It's good that it's so thin, but it's much too long in the x direction to use within our eye & iris chart; we need to factor the x coordinate by 253.1*n = 6 or so, so n = 6/253.1 -- perform that computation by entering it below the data as =6/253.1, and then copy it and paste it to cell A2;
Now the parabola is still slanted, which is what you want, and which is dependent on both the size and plus or minus status of angle t and value K ... but it is now too wide open, and the vertex has shifted from where it's being reported at {5, 5} slightly;
By taking the total difference of the max and min of the y values in column B, i.e. 5.93- -2.61, you arrive at a total height of the curve of 8.55; you want it to be more like .55, so you create another little formula algebraically to adjust Factor2, which is .55 = n*8.55, so you enter =.55/8.55 into cell B2;
The curve still displays as wide, but that's because Excel shortened the y scale range of the chart dramatically. Click on the vertical axis and set the maximum to 10 and the minimum to 0.0 -- there now, that's better. And the iris fiber extends out to the right about 5 units. But its vertex has moved up to {5, 8} and you want it more like {5, 5} (we can be more exacting later), so you need to subtract 3 from ParaVertex_Y in cell D2 -- do so now.
OK! Success! That's beginning to look like where you want to begin your iris fibers!
Try doubling the angle t to 80 -- see how thin it gets? You would think that, since 80 degrees is twice the angle that 40 degrees is, the opposite effect would have occurred, but now try half of 40, 20 for angle t in cell C4. It widens the parabola instead of thinning it. The reason for that is all the constraints we've put on the curve in this author's opinion. Nor is the curve any longer at much of a slant, but falls pretty much along the x axis. Clearly, this is going to take some tinkering with to be useful but there it is, in the rough, the slant parabola.
Change K to .09 and watch the X scale become a great deal shorter in fact. This means you are now capable of creating ""cascading parabolas"", though not yet in a fractal, multiple way. That will come with the next article, hopefully! Enjoy!

Use File → Save As to save the result under a new name.",How to Overlay Pictures2," This method will instruct you to use the ""magic wand"" tool, which quickly removes sections of your picture in a particular color so you can isolate the portion you want to transfer. However, this will work much better on images with a simple one color background with little shading, or when transferring portions of an image with a strong outline to set it apart from the background.


If the portion you want to remove is on a complex background, you may need to skip straight to ""Choose a selection tool"" in this method and outline the piece you want to transfer by hand.
For a quick and easy method without making a convincing photo merge, see Overlaying Photos Quickly.

, The best way to overlay pictures is to use photo manipulation software. If you don't own a professional program such as Photoshop or PaintShop Pro, you can download a free alternative like Pixlr, GIMP, or Paint.NET.


If you use a Mac, search your computer for GIMP before downloading one of these programs. You may find your computer came with it already installed.
Of the free alternatives, GIMP is the most similar to professional programs.If you're only interested in overlaying photos, the other free programs may be simpler to use.
Before you try to use software not listed here, make sure it supports layering. Do this by searching for ""Layers"" in that program's Help menu, or reading the features description on the program's website.
This method will not work for MSPaint, Windows Paint, or Inkscape.

, This is the picture that will serve as the background for the smaller picture you add on top of it.


If double clicking the image file doesn't take you to the photo editing program, you may need to open the photo editing program first and use the File → Open command from the top menu to select the image file.

, This is the one that contains elements that will be superimposed onto your background. If you go to File → Open from within your photo-editor, it should open the second image in a new image pane automatically, leaving your first one intact. From here on out, you can toggle between the two, clicking and dragging one off to the side slightly if it makes each pane easier to see. You can also resize each pane by dragging the bottom right corner.


The easiest image to work with is one in which the object you are selecting contrasts sharply with the background.

, Go to File → Save As and change the name of this image to anything you like. Now you can edit this image without destroying the original.


You need to select Save As and change the name in order to create a duplicate file. If you only click Save, or click Save As but fail to change the name of the file, you will still be working on the original.
Once you have the new file, remember to save changes to it frequently with File → Save to avoid losing your work.

, Click the image of the magic wand on the grid of tool images on the left hand side. This is a tool that allows you to select large swaths of color within a certain color range simply by clicking on any part of the image; the pixel you select will establish a baseline for the color range being selected.


The magic wand image looks like a glowing light at the end of a stick. If you aren't sure whether you've chosen the right tool, keep your cursor over the image for a couple seconds until the tool name appears.
In GIMP, this is called the ""fuzzy select"" tool, but has a similar image.

, The settings should appear above the image when you select the tool. Make sure that the “Contiguous” box is checked so you only remove groups of nearby pixels, instead of pixels in that color range from anywhere in the image. Adjust the tolerance in accordance with how uniform the background is and how much it contrasts with the image you wish to select: low tolerance will limit the amount of color selected and is good the fore- and background are similar colors, whereas high tolerance will result in a broader color selection and is good for images with sharp contrast.

, First, click a color in the undesired portion of the image to select an area in that color. You should see a flashing line outlining the area you've selected. Hold down Shift or Ctrl as you click additional areas until you've selected most of the unwanted area immediately surrounding the image to be transferred.


You will most likely need to adjust the tolerance a few times as you go, using the settings on the magic wand tool. Adjust it to a lower tolerance if it selects pieces of the image you want to transfer, and higher tolerance if it selects tiny areas.
Click Edit → Undo whenever an undesirable selection is made. This should undo the result of your last click, not return to the original image. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard: press Ctrl + Z on a Windows computer, or command + Z on a Mac.
If you cannot successfully select sizeable portions of the undesired section without including pieces of the image you want to transfer, you probably need to skip straight to ""Choose a selection tool"" and manually trace your image with the lasso tool.

, The resulting image may have harsh or strange-looking edges, which can make the final result seem unnatural or obviously manipulated. You can adjust this by using a ""feather tool"" or ""feather setting"" to soften the edge, but be aware that different programs require you to access the feather ability in different ways:


In Photoshop, right click the selection and click Feather.In Gimp, use the top menu: Select → Feather.In Paint.NET, you will need to download the Feather Plugin and open that plugin's menu to use this tool.
In Pixlr or Paint Shop Pro, click the selection tool and alter its feather setting before making a selection.In any program, you should see an option to enter a numeric amount determining how extreme the feathering effect will be, measured in pixels. Start with 1 or 2 pixels for this method to avoid losing fine details.

, You can also use the Edit → Cut command on the top menu. It's a good idea to do this periodically as you select pieces of the picture, instead of trying to select the entire area at once and deleting it in one go. This makes it easier to avoid mistakes and do a thorough job.


Once you've only got a small amount of unwanted picture left around the part of the image you want to transfer, you may want to zoom in for greater detail before trying to delete it. The Zoom In button looks like a magnifying glass with a ""+"" inside it. You may also find this command in the top menu: View → Zoom.
When you delete a selection, that portion of the image may appear as a ""checkerboard"" pattern or as a solid color. Either way, the overlay should work fine.

, Usually near the top of the tool list, these look like a square, circle, and rope lasso. The square and circle tools select a portion of the image in that shape, while the lasso tool can be traced in any shape. The lasso tool makes it easier to avoid undeleted portions of the background if there are still some near the image you're trying to transfer.

, If you've deleted the background around the image, make sure not to include any undeleted portions. You can safely include portions of the solid color or checker colored background that replaced it; they will not be selected.


If you were unable to remove a complex background with the magic wand tool, zoom in with the top menu command View → Zoom and slowly trace the image you want to transfer with the lasso tool. This may take several minutes to achieve accurate results. After copy-pasting your first selection onto the new background, you will probably need to use the lasso tool again to cut away excess areas you included by accident.

, This can be done with keyboard commands (Ctrl + C to copy, Ctrl + V to paste), or the Edit Menu. If the image still looks too ""sharp"" or unnatural, undo the paste and increase the amount of feathering by a few pixels.


See instructions directly above, labeled ""Soften the edges"", in order to learn how to feather the selection.
If you're sure you pasted your image but you don't see it, open the Layers Palette by going to Window → Layer or View → Layer. You should see a layer with a thumbnail image that looks like the image you pasted, on top of a checkerboard pattern. Drag this layer up to the top of the layer list to ensure it is placed on top of, rather than beneath, the background image.

, Select the move tool, which looks like a cursor arrow or a four-point compass, then click and drag the superimposed image to the desired location. If you need to change the size of the overlaid image, follow these steps:


Go to File → Free Transform (or hit Ctrl + T) to transform the image.
A box should appear around the superimposed image; click and drag the sides and corners to change the size and shape. To maintain the proportions, hold Shift while clicking and dragging a corner.
If the wrong thing moves, make sure you’re on the right layer by going to View → Layer or Window → Layer, then clicking the layer that contains the superimposed image.

, Make sure you are saving the final superimposed image. Don't accidentally select the pane that contains nothing but a chopped-up image missing the piece you transferred.

Pixlr offers a free online editor as well as a basic editing app for desktop and mobile. You may also upgrade to a more advanced version of the product with a regular subscription.


Pixlr Editor is the company’s web-based application. Go here to launch Pixlr editor: https://pixlr.com/editor/

Pixlr Express is the company’s web, iOS, and Android application.You can download it for free from the Google Play or Apple App store, or by going to https://pixlr.com/express/.;
, The quality of your final, edited product is dependent upon the resolution, or pixel count, of the original image. Pixlr strongly encourages its users to start every editing project with the highest resolution version of the image possible. This is especially true if you intend to blow-up the photo—as you increase the size of a low resolution image, the white space between pixels increases, causing the picture to appear distorted. To upload a picture with:


Pixlr Editor, click on the “Browse” button, select the JPEG file, click “Ok” or find an image on the web by clicking the “Open URL” button.Pixlr Express, click on the “photos” button and choose an image from your phone or tablet’s library. You may also capture a new image to edit by clicking on the “camera” button.

, A file’s size is determined by its pixel count—the higher the pixel count, the larger the file. Emailing, uploading, and downloading large JPEGs is a slow process. Resizing your image to a smaller pixel count will allow you to share your pictures faster.


To resize the picture using Pixlr Editor, select Adjustment > Resize. Change the pixel dimensions to the desired size, keep the “Aspect Ratio” locked, and click “Apply.”
To resize the image with Pixlr Express, click “Done” and then select “Resize.” Alter the pixel dimensions to the desired size, keep the “Aspect Ratio” locked, and click “Apply.”, Cropping allows you to easily remove unwanted portions of a photo. Cropping an image will also reduce the file’s size.


To crop your image using Pixlr Editor, select Adjustment > Crop. Manually alter the width and length of the bounding box. Click outside of the picture. If you are happy with the new dimensions, click “Yes” in the dialog box that appears.
To crop your picture using Pixlr Express, select Tools > Crop. Key in the desired pixel dimensions or select one of the pre-set size options from the drop down menu., This filter is only available for free with Pixlr Editor or with a subscription to Pixlr. Select Filter > Denoise. The word “Denoise” will flash above the photo, indicating the the image’s noise, or visual distortion, was reduced. Continue to reduce the noise until you achieve the desired results.


You can not control how much noise is reduced at one time., This feature is only available for free through Pixlr Editor. Pixlr’s clone stamp tool allows you to capture and replicate portions of an image. With this tool, you can copy and paste individual pixels or entire objects. Since the stamp can capture and replicate multiple colors, this tool is wonderful for eliminating or reducing mosquito noise from areas with fine details.


Zoom in until you can see the individual pixels. Select View > Zoom In.
In pixlr, the stamp is applied with a brush. Select the brush tool and adjust its settings. Choose a soft edge brush from row two and reduce the opacity. The soft edges and low opacity will allow you to blend the colors together.
Select the clone stamp tool—it is located directly below the paint can icon. Move your cursor to the exact location you would like to capture and replicate. To activate the clone stamp, windows users must hold down Alt and Mac users must hold down ⌘ Command. As you hold down the key, click on the area. Release the key and mouse.
To apply the stamp, move your cursor to the area you would like to touch up and click. Repeat as needed.
Throughout the process, zoom in and out to examine your work.

, Pixlr provides users ways to alter and enhance an image. You may use the “Color” tool to adjust the image’s hue, saturation, lightness and vibrance. If the image is over or underexposed, you can alter the pictures contrast or brightness with the “Contrast” tool.To access these tools in Pixlr, select Refine > Color or Refine > Contrast.
To access these tools in Pixlr Editor, select Adjustment > Color or Adjustment > Contrast.
To access these tools in Pixlr Express, select Tools > Adjustment > Color or Tools > Adjustment > Contrast.

, Pixlr is equipped with multiple brush-like tools and filters that are capable of erasing minor flaws or altering the entire picture. These tools include:


Sharpen: use this tool to sharpen soft edges
Blur: use this tool to soften harsh edges
Smudge: use this tool to blend pixels together
Sponge: use this tool to “soak up” color or “saturate” color
Dodge: use this tool to increase the image’s brightness
Burn: use this tool to add shadow, or contrast, to your picture
Spot Heal: use this tool to remove blemishes and scratches
Bloat: use this tool to create a concave effect
Pinch: use this tool to produce a convex effect
Red Eye Reduction: use this tool to remove red eyes

, With Pixlr’s effects package, you can transform each pixel in your image. Every effect tool uses math to alter the appearance of individual pixels. Pixlr offers nine different effects. Each effect has several sub-effect options. The categories include:


Atomic, Creative, Default, Soft, Subtle, Too Old, Unicolor, and Vintage., Once you have finished editing your image, select File > Save As, click the “Save” button, or pick “Save Image.” If you are using Pixlr or Pixlr Editor, a dialog box will appear on the screen. In Pixlr, you will have the option to rename the image, choose the “Files of Type”—choose JPEG— and determine where you would like to save the image. Once you are done, click “Save.” In Pixlr Editor, you will have the option to rename the file. Before the image is saved, the program will prompt you to select the “Image Quality.”


High-quality images are less compressed—the pixels retain more data. This results in a large file and a crisp picture.
Low-quality images are more compressed—the pixels contain less data. This creates a small file size and a less crisp, or more pixelated, picture."

Look again at the chart of the rose patterns.,
The key to the answer lies in the fact that Nature herself uses these as Limiting Forms of various plants -- the same type of plant generally has the same type of pattern.,
The shape and size of the flower/petals is important in selecting the type of pollinators they need.,


Suppose instead that one wants to add detail and be creative -- make flowers that are unique art creations, Logically, one will start with a known pattern and then deviate from it along the way because one wants basic likeness and detailed differentiation.,
It was done by setting k - n/d = 15/1 as the table was first expanded rightwards.,The formula used in E2 was ""=(COS(I2*G2*PI()/180)*SIN(G2*PI()/180))-(COS(ConstantRadius*G2*PI()/180)*SIN(G2*PI()/180))"" and,The formula used in F2 was ""=(COS(I2*G2*PI()/180)*COS(G2*PI()/180))-(COS(ConstantRadius*G2*PI()/180)*COS(G2*PI()/180)), which was then,Edit Fill Down to E2:F3661, and create the chart, adding unique effects.,Observe that the petals are parabolic at their tip but then meet at the center due to needing 15 of them, and they have repetitious petals near their outer ends due to the .95 k setting.,
Use data markers.,You were shown above the simpler charts of a circle and one with waves bordering it.,Think of sine and cosine as being capable of producing circles, waveforms, cycling forms and curves.,By multiplying by an increment like t, the sine or cosine function, with results between 1 and -1, increments and decrements in an orderly manner.,
Observe that Nature is conservative with resources yet quite expansive in production of biodiversity -- Nature tries many possibilities, so her ""use"" of ratios when the numerator/denominator varies within integers that are simple and less than 10 generally, and produces fairly simple patterns.,Perceive that various shapes may be more appealing than others to specific pollinators.,
Perceive that these shapes and their number are in the minority, generally speaking, out of all the flowering species in an a given area.,Perceive that a plant that has a ""new formula"" may attract interest it might not otherwise, as likeness is not particularly ""competitive"", or in a unique harmonious position, whichever way one chooses to look at the situation.,
So, somewhere in the DNA is a ""creative element"" that can try new ""formulations"" of shape, number, color, etc.,
These genetic alterations are divisible into groups and individuals by humans, who typify plants into genera and classes and families, etc.,We start with the simple and move to the complex -- thus, the 3-leaved plants are known better than obscure species where the sepals are barely separable from the petals in form and/or function.,
One of the ways we collect into groups is by analyzing the shapes, i.e.,
Curve Analysis is a difficult discipline.,

, There are certainly resemblances to floral limiting forms among those in the diagram. By ""limiting forms"", what is meant is that flowers probably grow according to phyllotaxis and Phi, and are generated by iterative fractal formulas growing both larger and more detailed as edges are approached, but that the overall limiting forms of many flowers resemble these trigonometric images. Math and computer simulations are coming closer and closer to true-to-life imagery based on 1) the knowledge of how plants actually grow, and 2) keener mathematical modeling of the growth processes. You may want to study more about ""phyllotaxis"" if this interests you, or if closest packing does.

To make the image to the right of the k=n/d data table showing the various rose forms it generates, substitute into cell H1 the term ConstantRadius and Insert Define Name ConstantRadius to cell H2, and input the value 6 to cell H2.
Then enter to cell E2 without quotes, the formula, ""=(COS(I2*G2*PI()/180)*SIN(G2*PI()/180))-(COS(ConstantRadius*G2*PI()/180)*SIN(G2*PI()/180))""
Then enter to cell F2 without quotes, the formula, ""=(COS(I2*G2*PI()/180)*COS(G2*PI()/180))-(COS(ConstantRadius*G2*PI()/180)*COS(G2*PI()/180))""
Edit Go To cell range E2:F3661 and do Edit Fill Down.
This formula adaption creates inner bud petals which are more realistic of some actual roses and flowers. k has been set to ""=Q10"", w/o quotes. Q10 has yellow fill.
Formatting of the colorful chart on right:

Line is smoothed, 0% transparency, 1 pt., firetruck red.
Glow is firetruck red, 30 pt size, 50% transparent, soft edges are 0 pt. -- it is because of the ""inner petals"" that the glow seems to pertain to the entire petals, with no show-through of the plot area formatting.
There's no market style (no markers).
There's no Shadow.
Plot Area: Fill is Gradient Radial Centered 43% Exxon blue, 100% canary yellow; no Glow, no Shadow, no 3D Format, Line = Automatic.


This file was moved to a new worksheet and retitled Rose3.xlsx

, PI()/180 converts from radians to degrees (the default is radians, or 180/PI()).
Chart the series after doing Edit Fill down in cell range E2:F3661. Your chart should resemble the following:





The formatting for this chart is Glow 30pt, Transparency 57%, Soft Edges 0 pt, in Red.



, Then close your eyes. What do you see? The mind has stored within in it Ideals/Models of what geometric patterns flowers most resemble. How does the mind do this? Does it calculate them? Does it remember them from various art designs? Or are they hard-wired deep in our DNA?
, While none of these patterns are 3D and not that realistic therefore, we recognize them anyway. That is another key point: that we are able to translate for 3 dimensions to 2 rapidly should tell us we have a focusing/filtering method that can strip away unnecessary detail., For example, large petals and flowers will attract pollinators at a large distance and/or that are large themselves. Collectively the scent, color and shape of petals all play a role in attracting/repelling specific pollinators and providing suitable conditions for pollinating. Some pollinators include insects, birds, bats and the wind., That sort of Pattern Creation in human imagination is what makes for tool-making, design work of all kinds, role play, etc. It's part of Nature finding new niches for Life to exist in possibly. Above is a flower that was generated that looks nothing like any other flower., ConstantRadius was then set to .95,,,,, Some background shows through. The idea of partially transparent flowers was appealing.,,,, Various pollinators prefer or dislike various plants, and have developed various coping strategies, one of which is the general shape of the flower, another is the number of petals and yet another is the size of each petal. This point generally does not apply for reliance on the wind to provide pollination, except the stamen(s) require exposure, and likewise for the female receptor organ(s). Plants can seem to be very preferential in the pollination species/method they ""employ"", as has evolved for their niche over time in a vast array of choices for the pollinators.,, Plants evolve to be therefore ""competitive"" viewed one way, or ""in harmony"" with all the other variations in their environment.,, by being a ""mutant"". It may find a way to ""mute"" another species' popularity., One of the ways we do this is by the pattern we perceive the plant has as compared with other plants. Over time, we have come to know certain plants are friendly or harmful to our visual, digestive, olfactory, tactile and other senses.,, the curves of the plant's various parts, especially its leaves and petals., It is an area that deserves more study and focused effort, now that we have the advantage of large number-crunching computers and methods such as Bézier Curve theory. Please see the article How to Acquire Bézier Curves Using Excel.,,

See the article How to Create a Spirallic Spin Particle Path or Necklace Form or Spherical Border for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation.",How to Acquire an N Helix with Spheroids Image," Otherwise, open a new Excel workbook and create 3 worksheets (except Chart if you are using Chart Wizard): Data, Chart and Saves. The following article then is a copy, with modifications, of *How to Create a Spirallic Spin Particle Path or Necklace Form or Spherical Border, since both workbooks derive from the same workbook, ""THE Garthwaite Curve"".


In Preferences General, set Use R1C1 checkbox to off.
Under View, set show row and column headings to On or checked and show gridlines. Show scroll bars and sheet tabs and outline symbols and zero values. Show formula bar by default and show status bar. It is very important to show the formula bar.

,,

Into cell A1, type AjRows.
Into cell B1, type GM (for Golden Mean).
Into cell C1, type Factor1.
Into D1, type KEY.
Into cell E1, type Number. 

, Into cell A2, input 2880 (as the number of adjusted rows in the data-set). In cell B2, input the formula ""=-(1-sqrt(5))/2"" (without quote marks). This is the Golden Mean or Ratio or Proportion, known since Euclid's time, such that a:b as b:(a+b), and is quadratic and has many special properties -- it's used because it maintains in proportion the square of a number to the number such that for the Pythagorean Theorem, a given Pythagorean triplet will grow in constant proportion to itself, and since the sine and cosine functions are Pythagorean functions, it applies to them as well. In cell C2, input .125 or ""=1/8"". Into cell D2, input w/o quotes ""=IF(Spheroids<=24, Spheroids*VLOOKUP(Spheroids,LOOKER2,2)*2,Spheroids"". Into cell E3, type 1.,

Into cell A3, type Tip.
Into cell B3, type Base.
Into cell C3, type Spheroids.
Into cell D3, type ShrinkExpand.
Into cell E3, type PiDivisor.
Into cell F3, type Thickness.
Into cell G3, type ShrinkExpand2
Into cell H3, type Variable.

,,

Into cell A4, input ""=Base*12/(VARIABLE*1)*PI()"" -- the empty parentheses for pi are correct. Do Insert Name Define name as Tip for cell A4.
Into B4, input 1712, which is 2^4 * 107 (where 2^4 means 2 raised to the power of 4).
Into cell C4, type 120 for now -- the lookup table that is going to be prepared is set to take any number of spheroids up to 150.
Into cell D4, type 2 for now. Setting up another plot column set of data with ShrinkExpand set to a different value will insert or surround one circle of spheroids with another one.
Into cell E4, input 180. Differentiating this variable creates special effects.
Into cell F4, type 2.
Into cell G4, type 2.
Into cell H4, type 1.

, Do the same for cell range A4:G4 please., Generally, viewing 4 decimal places will inform one of the differences in the sine and cosine function results.,

Into cell A5, type Base t.
Into cell B5, type c.
Into cell C5, type Cos (for cosine).
Into cell D5, type Sin (for sine).
Into cell E5, type Main X.
Into cell F5, type Main Y.
Into cell G5, type Second X.
Into cell H5, type Second Y.

,

MODIFIED Into cell B6, input the formula, ""=(Base*24/Spheroids)"". Into cell B7, type ""=B6"". Do Edit Go To cell range B7:B2886 and do Edit Fill Down.
Into cell A6, input ""=If(odd(Spheroids)=Spheroids,0,Tip)"". This formula states that if the number of spheroids input is odd, result=0, else result=Tip (where Tip was defined above as 12*PI()*B4 or 1712, for a total of 64,540.8795). In the case of the result becoming 0, the column will decrement to twice Tip, negatively from 0. The number of spheroids charted will be odd, eg. 31.

, The value in cell A2886 should be decremented to -64,540.8795 if spheroids is even (eg. at 32), else it will equal 2*-64,540.8795. Please see Note 6 in the Tips section regarding differentiating cells A7 and A6 because their formulas are different.,

Do Edit Go To cell range C6:C2886 and input into cell C6 the formula, ""=Thickness*Spheroids/KEY*(COS((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))"" (without the quotation marks, as always). Do Edit Fill Down. By taking the cosine of the cell 6 rows up from cell C6, we are taking the cosine of 0 to begin with, then in subsequent rows, take the cosine up to 360 and in cycles then to 2880+6. 2880/360=8. So there are 8 cycles. Number is a variable for getting partial circle effects like animation motion likenesses when a fraction because the next piece, *PI()/PiDivisor. converts from pi radians to degrees and vice versa. Recall that PiDivisor is set to 180 degrees. Multiplying by Factor1 is taking back the 8 by 1/8th.
Do Edit Go To cell range D6:D2886 and input into cell D6 the following formula: ""=Thickness*Spheroids/KEY*(SIN((ROW()-6) *Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))"". Do Edit Fill Down.

, Do Edit Go To cell range E6:E2886 and input into cell E6 the following formula: ""=((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*COS(A6)*GM)+U6)/ShrinkExpand"". Do Edit Fill Down.

Do Edit Go To cell range F6:F2886 and input the formula ""=((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*SIN(A6)*GM)+W6)/ShrinkExpand"". Do Edit Fill Down. You may notice the z-dimension has been omitted.

, Do Edit Go To cell range G6:G2886 and input into cell G6 the following formula: ""=((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*COS(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+C6)/ShrinkExpand2"". Do Edit Fill Down.

Do Edit Go To cell range H6:H2886 and input into cell H6 the formula ""=((SIN(A6/(B6*2))*GM*SIN(A6)*GM*(COS(A6/(B6*2)))*GM)+D6)/ShrinkExpand2"". Do Edit Fill Down.

, While the sheet will now produce the chart wanted, for small numbers of spheroids like 1 or 2 or 3, they cannot appear in a ring properly. A solution for that contingency has been worked out.

Do Edit Go To cell range I6:I155 and input 1 into cell I6 and then do Edit Fill Series Columns Linear, Step Value 1 and blank stop value; press OK. That should input the series from 1 to 150 in that cell range.
Do Edit Go To cell range J6:J155 and input into cell J6 .125 and then do Edit Fill Down. That will input the constant value of .125 in that cell range.
Do Edit Go To cell range K6:K155 and input ""=I6*$K$35/$I$35"" and do Edit Fill Down and then input the value .125 in cell K35.
Do Edit Go To cell range I6:K155 and Insert Name Define Name Looker. Format Cells Border Red bold Outline. Input Looker in cell J5, font bold red.
Go to Factor1 cell C2. Input the formula, ""=VLOOKUP(ABS(Spheroids),Looker,IF(Spheroids<=24,3,2))"". If that next to last number is changed from 3 to 2 in the VLookup Formula just given, it will always return .125, otherwise it will adjust for the number of spheroids input the value of Factor1 (so that will no longer be an available variable). Change the font of cell C2 to dark blue italic or something red or something that helps one remember not to change it.

,

Select cell L5 and enter LOOKER2 into it.
Edit Go To cell range L6:29 and input 1 into L6 and do Edit Fill Series Column Linear Step Value 1, OK.
Enter the following numbers down from cell M6 to M29: 24, 16, 8, 4, =PI(), =PI(), =PI(), 2 from M13 to M21 and enter 1 from M22 to M29.

,

Enter HELIX DATA into cell N1.
Enter X Stretch into cell T1. Font red.
Enter Y Stretch into cell W1. Font red.
Enter 5 into cell T2 and format fill yellow font red and do Insert Name Define name X_Stretch to cell $T$2.
Enter 5 into cell W2 and format fill yellow font red and do Insert Name Define name Y_Stretch to cell $W$2.
Enter ±6π or +/- 6 pi into cell Q4.
Enter the column headings into row 5: N5: a; O5: c; P5: n; Q5: t; R5: (i); S5: z; T5: X1; U5: 90 degrees X2; V5: X3; W5: Y.
a, c, n: Enter .3 to cell N6, 3 into cell O6 and 1 into cell P6. Select N6:P6 and Format Fill yellow for input. Enter ""=N6"" into cell N7 and copy it and paste it to cell range N7:P2886.
t: Select cell Q6 and enter ""-6*PI())"". Go to cell Q2889 and enter 6, font red, size 14, fill yellow. Go to cell Q2888 and enter ""=PI()"". Go to cell Q2887 and enter ""=Q2889*Q2888"" w/o quotes and do Insert Name Define Name Destiny to cell $Q$2887. Edit Go To cell range Q7:Q2886 and enter into cell Q7 w/o quotes the formula ""=Destiny*2/2880+Q6"" and Edit Fill Down.
(i): Leave column R blank for now. More will be said in Tips.
z: Edit Go To cell range S6:S2886 and enter w/o quotes into S6 the formula ""=Q6/(2*PI()*O6)"".
X1: Edit Go To cell range T6:T2886 and enter w/o quotes into T6 the formula ""=X_Stretch*(N6*COS(Q6+(2*PI()*R6)/P6)+S6)"".
90 degrees X2: Edit Go To cell range U6:U2886 and enter w/o quotes into U6 the formula ""=(T6-0.3-S6)"". This is the column currently accessed by the chart.
X3: Edit Go To cell range V6:V2886 and enter w/o quotes into V6 the formula ""=-1*(T6+0.3+S6)"". This is changed in The Tips section below when creating a Double Helix is accomplished.
Y: Edit Go To cell range W6:W2886 and enter w/o quotes into W6 the formula ""=Y_Stretch*(N6*SIN(Q6+(2*PI()*R6)/P6)+S6)"".
Edit Go To cell range N1:W2889 and Format Fill very light blue and Border Deep Purple bold Outline.

, Do that now for cell C2 until you see the red corner flag and remember to do it for all the other formulas later please. The Abs() Absolute function allows one to input a negative number of spheroids; the effect will be to flip the graph 180 degrees horizontally (from left to right or right to left), as one can tell with an odd number of spheroids., Have a blank worksheet ready to copy a new chart into and expand and format it at will.

Do Edit Go To cell range E6:F2886. Press the Charts button, All, or Chart Wizard. Select chart type Scatter Smoothed Line Scatter. Command c copy it and access the new worksheet and command v paste it into the new worksheet. Your chart should look like the example above except for detailing and the arc above has yet to be added. Adjust the chart size by dragging the bottom right corner until you get a square plot area. Get rid of the Vertical and Horizontal Axes, Legend and Gridlines via the Chart Layout tab. Clicking on the plot area will give access to the gradient style; the setting for that are Plot Area Fill Gradient Radial Centered Far Left White, 30% Ultramarine Blue, 55% Deep Navy Blue, no Line, Shadow, Glow or 3-D Format. Double-clicking on the chart plot line itself will give access to changing that under Format Selection of Chart Layout: set Series 1 Line to Ultramarine Blue, smoothed line, weight 1 pt. Glow is medium dark muddy red wine 1 pt 0 transparency 0 pt soft edges. Shadow for the line is checked, Perspective, 248 degrees, dark navy blue 33% size, 0 pt blur, 72 pt distance and 11% transparent. Chart Area Fill Gradient is Radial Centered left 41% White and fully right 100% Hot Pink Fuschia.
Click in the Plot Area and do menuitem Chart Add Data and in response to the query go to Data worksheet and select cell range G6:H2886. Sometimes this does not come out right and has to be edited in the formula bar of the Chart worksheet. Click on the newly plotted series and edit in the formula bar until it reads as follows: ""=SERIES(,Data!$G$6:$G$2886,Data!$H$6:$H$2886,2)"". With it selected and Chart Layout active, do Format Selection for Series 2, Line Dark Brown with a hint of red, smoothed line, 0% transparency, line weight 1 point, No Shadow or Glow, etc.

,, Somehow it comes out wrong sometimes and one must click on the new chart series in the Chart worksheet and type in G's for E's in the plot series in the formula bar -- then it's OK., They should be separate with the first series inside the second series. Select a good color for the second series and line thickness should probably be set to 1 for each.,,

, The .25 is for 1440*.25 = 360. 17280/12=1440. So we are taking 1/12th of 1/4 or 1/48th of 17280 = 360, the degrees of the trig function cosine for a circle. PI()/180 converts radians to degrees. (ROW()-6) in row 6 = 0, so we start off taking the cosine of 0, which is 1, and multiplying it by 17. 17 is twice the Stretch factor, and if I recall rightly, is 1/2 the radius of the ring (the Stretch factor operates from each sphere's center). However, Shrinker is also involved, as you'll see later.
Adj Sin: Edit Go To cell range B6:B17285 and enter into B6 w/o quotes the following formula,""=17*SIN((ROW()-6)*0.25/12*PI()/180)+17""and Edit Fill Down, which is different than the above one for cosine by the addition of 17 to it. All in all, that give us 4*8.5, and that is the radius, as I recall.
Indicator: Select cell C6 and enter 1. Edit Go To cell range C7:C17286 and enter w/o quote the formula, ""=IF((ROW()-7)/MAGIC=INT((ROW()-7)/MAGIC),1,IF((ROW()-7)=0,1,0))"" and Edit Fill Down. This formula says, 'Take a look at the row I'm in, divide it by the number of rows per sphere (MAGIC) and if that number is an integer, return a 1, otherwise if I'm in the next-to-top row also return a 1, otherwise, return a 0.' So now there is an indicator of where 1 sphere ends and the next one begins, no matter how many spheres the user selects to chart.
Randy: Edit Go To cell range D6:D17286 and enter into D6 w/o quotes the following formula,""=RANDBETWEEN(0,10)/100"" and Edit Fill Down. Warning: Make calculation Manual before adding this variable or column into your formulas, especially as a factor, as it can take 20 minutes to calculate and draw the new chart. It is not currently employed, but a copy of its formula has been saved at the bottom of the x and y formulas. Edit Go To cell range D6:D17285 and Insert Name Define Name Randy to cell range $D$6:$D$17285.

Edit Go To cell range E8:E17285 and enter w/o quotes into E8 the formula ""=IF(C8=1,2*PI(),2*PI()/MAGIC+E7)"" and Edit Fill Down. You may notice on the data chit the column heading states 2π but I am now recommending nπ as I noticed it works a 4π at the bottom of the worksheet just fine. It was built to increment just to 2π and begin again, so that is news to me and I have corrected my column heading.
z1_: Edit Go To cell range F6:F17285 and enter w/o quotes into F6 the formula ""=CEE*COS(AYE*E6)"" and Edit Fill Down. Edit Go To cell range F6:F17285 and Insert Name Define Name z1_ to cell range $F$6:$F$17285.

Edit Go To cell range G6:G17285 and Insert Name Define Name Adj_x1 to cell range $G$6:$G$17285. This makes a constant adjustment as if one were referencing a new center of every new sphere from Adj Cos, else it takes the value just above itself.

Edit Go To cell range H6:H17285 and Insert Name Define Name Adj_y1 to cell range $H$6:$H$17285. This makes a constant adjustment as if one were referencing a new center of every new sphere from Adj Sin, else it takes the value just above itself.
x: No z: Edit Go To cell range I6:I17285 and enter w/o quotes into I6 the formula ""=SHRINKER^2*(Stretch_x1*(((BEE^2-CEE^2*COS(AYE*E6)*COS(AYE*E6))^0.5 *COS(E6)))+Adj_x1)"" and Edit Fill Down. This is the x part of the heart of the sinewave sphere formula from the text, without the z dimension added or multiplied in, which is why it took me so long to discover how to make it work.
y: With z: Edit Go To cell range J6:J17285 and enter w/o quotes into J6 the formula ""=SHRINKER^2*(Stretch_y1*(((BEE^2-CEE^2*COS(AYE*E6)*COS(AYE*E6))^0.5 *SIN(E6))+z1_)+Adj_y1)"" and Edit Fill Down. This is the y part of the heart of the sinewave sphere formula from the text, with the z dimension added in, which is why it took me so long to discover how to make it work.

Play around with additional effects.",How to Overlay Pictures3," Open the Layer menu with View → Layer or Window → Layer and select the layer containing the superimposed image. You can now explore many options for altering its appearance.


There are many photo manipulation programs and they each organize their large variety of options differently. To find the common suggestions below, or experiment with your own effects, try the Filter and Layer menus.

, More subtle transparency can also make several superimposed images look better, if you used the Quick overlay method. This is a simple additional adjustment that requires little work.


Near the list of layers, which you learned how to view in an earlier step, there should be a box labeled Opacity. Here you can enter a number from 0 (invisible) to 100 (completely opaque), or adjust a slider to change the transparency gradually.

, The Drop Shadow effect adds a new shadow layer beneath the object to make it appear part of the background, although you may need to follow the suggestions below to make it appear more natural.


In GIMP, this option is found under Filter → Light and Shadow.
In Photoshop, find it through Layer → Layer Style → Drop Shadow.
Select the shadow layer to adjust it. If necessary, use the Filter → Blur command to make the shadow less sharp.
You can use the Edit → Free Transform command to change the shadow's position and shape to match the direction of light in the background photo.

, There are countless additional effects in each major photo manipulation program. Play around with the Blending Options to make the superimposed photo appear more natural, or with any of the effects elsewhere for silly or artistic alterations.

, Enter your e-mail address and choose an account password, then click “Download Now.” Scroll down to “Topaz DeJPEG” and choose your operating system (Windows or Mac). The download will begin, and your trial license key will be sent to you via email.



Close Photoshop. If you use Adobe Photoshop, you’ll need to close it before running the DeJPEG installer. This step is not necessary for users of other programs.

Run the installer. Double-click the downloaded installer file to start the trial. Enter the trial license key (sent to your email) when prompted, then click “Install” to begin the installation.

, Before you can use the plugin, you’ll need to add the DeJPEG filter folder to your program. The full path to the DeJPEG plugin folder is Program Files >> Topaz Labs >> Topaz DeJPEG 4.



Photoshop: Photoshop users can skip to the next step, as DeJPEG automatically installs to the Photoshop plugins folder.

Paintshop Pro: In the File menu, select “Preferences,” then “File Locations.” Choose “Plugins” on the left side of the screen, then click the “Add” button. Navigate to the DeJPEG plugin folder, then click “OK.”

Photo Impact: Open the program and press F6 on the keyboard. Choose “Plugins” from the list, then click the “…” button at the end of the first empty plugin folder on the list. In the folder list, select the DeJPEG plugin folder, then click “OK.” Restart Photo Impact before attempting to use the filter for the first time.

IrfanView: Open the program, then expand the “Image” menu. Click “Effects,” then “Adobe 8BF Filters.” Choose “Add 8BF filters” from the menu. Now, navigate to the DeJPEG plugin folder, then click OK.

, Open your JPEG in your typical photo-editing software, then launch the DeJPEG tool:



Photoshop: In the Filters menu, choose “Topaz Labs,” then “DeJPEG 4.”

Paintshop Pro: In the Effects menu, choose “Plugins,” then select “Topaz DeJPEG.”

Photo Impact: Open the Effect menu, then select “Topaz DeJPEG.”

IrfanView: Open the Image menu, click “Effects,” then “Adobe 8BF Filters.” Choose “Topaz DeJPEG” from the filter list.

, Click the magnifying glass (+) to zoom in to a portion of your image where compression artifacts are apparent.

, The DeJPEG default presets are located on the left side of the screen. Click each default preset to have its settings applied to the preview of your image. Notice how each preset improves or disrupts the quality of the image. Choose the preset that best perfects your JPEG image. It’s okay if it’s not perfect, there are still more settings to tweak.

, Select “Luminance” from the options beneath “Preview Display mode.” Now click “Main” to view several options to fix the details left out by the preset.



Reduce Artifacts: First, move the slider all the way to the left. Now, gradually move the slider the right while examining the detail in the preview pane. As you move the slider to the right, the edges may soften, but noise and checkerboarding will disappear. Keep moving to the right until you’ve found a pleasing balance.

Sharpen: This slider should help redefine the edges softened by the Reduce Artifacts slider. As you move this slider to the right, the sharpness will increase.

Sharp Radius: This slider should be used in conjunction with Sharpen tool. Experiment by moving this slider to the left and right until the edges look clear and the artifacts are gone.

, If the colors in your image seem to have been affected by the previous tools, switch to Color mode by selecting ""Color"" under Preview Display Mode.



Smooth Color: Move this slider to the right and left until you are satisfied with the image in the preview pane.

Clear Edge Radius. If you want to adjust the detail of the colors at the edges, click to the ""Advanced"" settings, then raise ""Clr Edge Radius"" slider. Use this tool with the Edge Threshold slider until you’re happy with the image.

Adjust Saturation. If the colors appear weak, move the ""Saturation"" slider to the right to increase color levels.

Add grain. Try using the ""Add Grain"" slider to make the image appear more natural. Move the slider to the right to increase the amount of grain.

, Before saving your work, click the magnifying glass (-) until you can see the entirety of the image in the preview pane. If you don’t like the results, continue working with the presets, luminance and color settings until you’re satisfied with the entire photo.

, You may need to wait a few moments for the filter to apply.

Consider what quality you actually need the image to be.,
Zoom in for a closer look.,
Locate the “Reduce Noise” filter.,
Adjust noise reduction options.First, place a check in the box that says “Preview” so you can see your changes in real time.,
Minimize mosquito noise and colorblocking in large areas without much fine detail.,
Use the rubber stamp/clone stamp tool in areas with great fine detail.,
Repeat your use of these tools until you are satisfied with the results.,
Save the image as a high quality JPEG or a PNG, which supports more colors.",How to Improve Jpeg Image Quality3," Fixing the fine details of a low-quality, compressed JPEG takes quite a bit of time and dedication.


If you’re pressed for time or don’t have Photoshop, see the Topaz DeJPEG method.

If you want to improve images for use in apps like Facebook or Instagram, this method won’t be as helpful as using an app with filters. Pixlr contains free filters that can disguise imperfect JPEGs. If you want to make your photos pop and don’t care about compression loss, give Pixlr a try.

, Open your JPEG in Photoshop, then zoom in by clicking the magnifying glass (+) at the top left of the toolbar. Continue clicking this button until the percentage at the bottom left corner of the screen says “300%.” Notice the blocks and compression discolorations that appear at this close level.

, Open the “Filter” menu, select “Noise,” then “Reduce Noise.”

,



Strength: This number will reflect the desired degree of noise removal; it should be higher for JPEGs of lesser quality. Drag the slider to the right to see the effect of raising the strength setting.

Preserve Details: A lower percentage will make the picture blurrier and softer, but will also reduce more noise.

Sharpen Details: You may want to compensate for a low Preserve Details setting with a higher Sharpen Details setting, as that will make the edges of your image clearer. Make sure ""Remove JPEG artifact"" is checked.
Once you’re satisfied with the preview image, click “OK” to save the new image.

, (E.g., human skin, cheeks, hair.) Your goal is to make the different color transitions in the image to be as smooth as possible. Leave important details in specific objects (e.g., eyes, ears) for the rubber stamp/clone tool, which will be covered shortly.



Zoom into the image until you can clearly see the colorblocks (tiny colored squares) in the area you're working with.

Use the eyedropper tool to select a color near the colorblocks that you'd like to remove.

Select the brush tool. You will essentially be lightly painting over the colorblocks. Set the brush hardness to 10%, opacity to 40%, and flow to 100%.

Using one-clicks, ""dab"" the paint brush over the colorblocks. Don't hold the cursor down and paint--it will appear unnatural. Feel free to switch colors liberally to accurately match the colors, shadows, and highlights of the original picture.

Lower the brush opacity to 10% for smoothing over transition areas, such as where the eyebrow meets the skin. You'll want to pick colors from both the skin and the eyebrow to dab over this transitional space. Because of the low opacity, any changes that you make will be incremental and thus appear natural, so don't be afraid of dabbing skin color on the eyebrow edge and vice versa.

,(E.g., eyes, teeth, insect wings.) Because it's hard to pick one color that would be appropriate for dabbing with a brush in these areas, we can compensate for that by using the rubber stamp to get an exact match of colors. The rubber stamp allows you to select an area of the image that you can literally stamp and replicate elsewhere on the image.



Click the rubber/clone stamp while pressing the Alt key until the cursor turns into a crosshair. Select an area immediately next to a color block or other compression artifact, but avoid the colorblock. You wouldn't want to stamp any compression artifacts.

Set the brush size to what's appropriate for dealing with the compression artifact -- you probably want to stay between 1 and 10 px. Set the ""hardness"" to a value between 10 and 30% and ""opacity"" to 30%. Use the same one-click ""dabs"" to fix blocks that are the wrong color. Frequently re-select the area you would like to be stamped (by holding down the alt key) as you move across the image.

Reduce the opacity for transitional areas. Incorrect blocks of color sometimes interfere with the shape of the image (note where parts of the iris are not a smooth round shape but rather interrupted by protruding lines). You may have to use dabs to essentially re-draw edges damaged by incorrect colorblocks.

, Periodically zoom out to 100% to view results across your entire image.

, You don't want your efforts to be wasted with another round of compression.


In Photoshop, go to File >> Save for Web & Devices.

In the drop-down menu, select ""JPEG"" and set the quality to a value between 80 and 100. Note that higher quality entails a larger file size.
Alternatively, select ""PNG-24"" to save your file as a PNG. PNGs typically are larger than JPEGs, but they do not heavily compress images.

Have a copy of your bill in front of you.,
Decide what you consider to be an acceptable resolution of the dispute.,
Have a pen and paper ready.,
Contact your service provider.,
Explain the charges in dispute to the customer care specialist.,
Request a credit.,
Call again if you are unsuccessful the first time.",How to Dispute Your Cell Phone Bill1," Before contacting your service provider, have a copy of your bill in front of you so that you can refer to the specific parts of the bill that you wish to dispute. Your bill also contains important information, such as your account number, which your provider may ask you for verification purposes. If you have signed up for paperless billing, you should be able to download your bill online and print out a copy or have an online version of the bill in front of you before contacting your provider.;
, If you are disputing a charge, you may be happy with a partial reduction of the charge or you may feel that the provider must remove the charge completely. If the charges you are disputing are valid and are there due to an oversight on your part, be reasonable in your expectations and remember that you may only receive, at best, a partial credit.

, Be prepared to write down the name of the customer service representative when you call your provider. Also log the time and date of your call so that you have a record of your calls made to the provider should you need this information later in the process of disputing your bill. Having pen and paper ready is also useful for writing down any important information (such as a promise to waive the disputed charges) that the customer service representative provides to you.

, Find out your service provider’s customer service number, which is usually a toll-free number. Call this number to contact the provider and go through the automated system to reach a customer care specialist. You may also have the option of chatting with a customer care specialist online, as in the case of ATT.Choose the method with which you are most comfortable.

, The call will usually begin with a series of questions, such as what your name and account number is, and will continue with a series of security questions for verification of your identity. Once the specialist has asked you such questions, calmly explain why you are calling and refer the specialist to specific parts of the bill you are disputing. Always try to be polite and avoid being accusatory. The customer care specialist is there to help you and may be more sympathetic to your case if you are polite. This is especially important if the charges you are disputing are due to a fault of your own

., After explaining the issue to the customer care specialist, request that she waive the charges in dispute. If the disputed charge is there because of a fault on the part of the service provider, she should normally waive the full amount. If the charges in dispute are due to an oversight on your part (e.g. you forgot to sign up for an international data roaming plan and used your cell phone data abroad), then the provider may issue a partial courtesy credit.

, If you are unsuccessful in convincing your service provider to reduce or waive the disputed charges according to your expectations, try again. Call at another time and you might be connected to a customer service specialist who is more sympathetic to your case. Note, however, that the representative will generally have in front of her notes made by the representative to whom you previously spoke, and will be aware of what the representative told you the first time and the outcome of that call.

Consider binding arbitration.,
Read your contract or service provider’s website for information on the process of arbitration.,
Present a strong case.",How to Dispute Your Cell Phone Bill2," If calling your service provider has not resulted in a satisfactory outcome, you can seek to resolve your billing dispute through binding arbitration. Cell phone contracts in the United States generally contain a provision allowing for binding arbitration. Arbitration proceedings are similar to court proceedings except arbitration is less formal and uses a third party known as an ‘arbitrator’ instead of a judge. The arbitrator gives an award after hearing evidence from both sides. The arbitrator’s decision is generally binding and subject to limited review by courts., Your contract will generally contain information about binding arbitration, but you can also access this information on your service provider’s website. Read this information carefully so that you know what procedure to follow if you are considering arbitration to resolve your dispute.


If you are an ATT customer, click here for information on binding arbitration.
If you are a Verizon customer, click here for information on binding arbitration.
If you are a T-Mobile customer, click here for information on binding arbitration.
If you are a Sprint customer, click here for information on binding arbitration.
If you are a Bell Mobility customer, click here for more information on binding arbitration.

, Arbitrators can make a decision on written documents presented by both sides, and by doing so, you can avoid an in-person hearing. In-person hearings can be time consuming and inconvenient, and presenting a strong case by clearly setting out your arguments in a written document can be easier than doing so in an in-person hearing."

Consider going to Small Claims Court.,
Research the laws of your state regarding small claims.,
Complete the necessary forms to initiate the suit.,
Attend your hearing.,
Present a strong case.",How to Dispute Your Cell Phone Bill3," If calling your service provider does not yield the desired result, consider taking your claim to a small claims court. A small claims court is part of the state court system in the United States. In this court, a person can sue for monetary damages up to a certain amount stipulated by state law. There is no need for an attorney (you can represent yourself), and the applicable rules of evidence are generally simple rather than complex., It is important for you to research the laws of the state in which you are resident regarding small claims actions because the process involved and the rules may vary from state to state. In Texas, for example, you can sue in a small claims court if the amount in dispute is up to $10,000while the upper limit in Connecticut is $5,000.While the amount in dispute on your cell phone bill is likely to fall within the upper limit stipulated by most states for small claims actions, there have been reported cases of international roaming charges exceeding thousands of dollars.Know what specific rules apply to small claims actions in your state.

, Follow your state’s rules on the forms required to initiate a small claims suit. In Illinois, e.g., to initiate a small claims lawsuit, you must visit the courthouse where a small claims clerk will provide you with the necessary forms (i.e. a summons and a complaint form) to initiate the lawsuit.You can find a useful repository of all the rules on small claims in every American state and links to the official government websites that contain information on how to file and what forms are required in your particular state by visiting this website.

, Go to your hearing with your attorney if you have hired one or by yourself if you are representing yourself. Bring all the evidence necessary to present a strong case (e.g. your cell phone bill, the facts of your case, promises made to you by customer care specialists).

, To present your strongest case to the judge, be sure to get to the heart of your argument quickly. The judge will likely have heard dozens of cases similar to yours, and you need to present a strong case that does not lose her attention. You can present a strong case by describing the events that led to your dispute and offer concrete evidence that supports your claim against your service provider."

As of June 2008, this feature is offered by T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. , If there are some messages you want to receive from the Internet (airline schedules, hotel reservations, etc.), then some providers will allow you to create a unique alias, blocking all messages that are not addressed to your alias. This filters out spammers, who usually find their targets by sending text messages to random numbers (1234557890@txt.company.com). Give your alias address only to the people and website you actually want to receive messages from. As of June 2008, this feature is offered by AT&T, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile., If the reply-to address isn't your alias and someone replies to your message or e-mail, their message will get blocked because it wasn't sent to your alias.

, Have people text message you at that address, and have all the e-mails from that account forward automatically to your phone.

Let the hobbyists do the work for you.",How to Program a Police Scanner," When you purchase a scanner at an electronics or hobby store, it should come with a brochure that will provide the details for its particular make and model.


Each scanner make and model is set up a bit differently, so it's a good idea to follow individual directions.;
, Various regional agencies use different frequencies or ""channels"" for communication purposes, and you can find the frequencies for the agencies you would like to follow in your area.


A frequency is the number you will need to program in your scanner to listen to the specific service provider you would like to hear. Since scanners work by radio waves, you can only receive signals from local frequencies, just as you can only listen to local radio stations that broadcast in your area.
To find local frequencies, search online for the information, or inquire at the retailer where you purchased your scanner.
You can also try www.radioreference.com, which is searchable by city. Once you've located your city, you can choose frequencies that you are interesting in receiving, which can include businesses, airports/aviation, utilities companies, news media, schools, and many other types of agencies.If you're interested in national frequencies, check out www.dxing.com/scanfreq.htm, where you'll find a list of frequencies like the National Guard and the National Weather Service.
As you find frequencies you want to program into your scanner, write their reference numbers in a list. You'll need the list to be easily accessible as you program the scanner, so place the list where you can see it.

, You can go ahead and turn it on now to make sure that its working with no problems.


Because you have not yet programmed any local frequencies, don't be surprised if you only hear white noise. This is totally normal.

, Depending on your scanner model, it might be labeled ""Prog"" or ""PGM.""


This button may be located in a variety of places on different scanner models. Ask your retailer to show you the location if it is difficult to find, or look at your user manual.

, You may need to hold down the button briefly to activate the programming function.


Look at the top of the screen. On most models, you will see ""CH"" flashing on the display, to indicate it is ready to program a channel.

, A channel is where you store your frequencies in order to easily access them when you need them. Think of it like the preset buttons on your car radio.The channel number is a 3-digit number used to store your frequencies.

, You should do this directly after you have entered your channel number, as this will locate that particular frequency within that particular channel.

The frequency number is usually five or six digits long and contains a decimal point. Use the numeric keypad to enter the digits. For example, if your number is 123.456, you will press the keys in that order: 1-2-3-decimal-4-5-6.
You can organize the channels and their frequencies as you like, but one method is to use a particular channel for emergency agencies like police, fire, etc.; another channel for local news media; another channel for utilities companies; etc. Keep a running list of where you put everything to make it easier to find later.

, You should do this directly after you have entered the channel followed by the frequency.


Now the frequency you entered is in that channel.

,


After entering the MAN, 110, MAN sequence, your channel and frequency should appear.
Re-program the scanner if the test was unsuccessful by using the same process.
Repeat the process with all frequencies you would like programmed in your scanner until you have the frequencies organized among the channels to your liking.
When you are finished programming the scanner, hit your programming button (""Prog"" or ""PGM"") again to exit programming mode.

, Because a handheld model relies on batter power, you will need to fully charge it before you begin the process of programming in frequencies.


You will also need to connect the antenna.
Use the time while the scanner is charging to locate and write your list of frequencies, as you would if you were programming a base model.

, Press the button that is labeled ""Manual"" to manually enter frequencies.


After you hit ""Manual,"" enter the channel number you wish to use, followed by ""Manual"" again.
Alternately, if you do not have a list of frequencies or just want to explore a bit, you can hit the ""SCAN"" button and the scanner will scan available frequencies.

, Just as with a base model, you will enter the digits you wish to use within the channel you are working in.


The frequency number is five or six digits and contains a decimal point. Use the numeric keypad to enter the digits. For example, if your number is 123.456, you will press the keys in that order: 1-2-3-decimal-4-5-6.

, To store the frequency, you press ""E"" or ""Enter"" after you are done entering the digits of the frequency.


When the display flashes, you will know you've successfully stored that frequency.
If the scanner does not flash but instead beeps, it means you've already entered that frequency elsewhere (either in the same or a different channel). You can hit ""Enter"" again to go ahead and store it a second time.

, Depending on how you plan to use it, one or the other is likely a better fit for your needs.


You might prefer something that is portable like a walkie-talkie if you plan to use it at work, in the car, or away from a particular room or location.
On the other hand, a tabletop model tends to have a higher quality, does not require batteries or charging, and can often hold more channels.

, There are more and less expensive ones, but the difference is not in quality of sound but rather in the amount of frequencies you are able to program.


If you are a beginning hobbyist, you probably don’t need hundreds of channel, but even the basic models usually have at least 200. But if you want to upgrade to a better model, a more expensive type is likely to hold more channels and frequencies., Actually, it matters more. The size and placement of your antenna will determine the range of frequencies and their clarity.


To upgrade an existing scanner, consider purchasing a longer or larger antenna or placing it higher. This can help you receive a clearer signal.

, There are many websites online where you can check out purchasing guides based on the specifications of various scanner manufacturers and models, so take advantage of these great resources as you make your selection:


Check out www.advancedspecialties.net/scannercomp.htm, which has charts that compare the most popular manufacturers.

Find live frequencies.,
Memorize some of the basic frequencies.,
Find an aeronautical sectional chart.,
Find the closest airport on the chart.,
If the airport is uncontrolled (no tower) or the tower operates part time, a C in a circle after a frequency number will be used to denote a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF).,
All controlled airports will be denoted by blue circles, while uncontrolled airports are magenta.,
Some airports have AWOS (Automated Weather Observing System), ASOS (Automated Surface Observing System), or ATIS (Automated Terminal Information Service) frequencies listed on the chart.,
If you have access to an airport/facility directory, you can find more frequencies than those available on the chart.,
If a controller gives a pilot an instruction, he or she will prefix it with the aircraft's identification number.,
After the flight number, the controller will give an instruction such as ""enter downwind."",
Sometimes, controllers will ""hand off"" a pilot to another frequency.,
Operations at uncontrolled airports are much less formal.,
Learn the phonetic alphabet.",How to Listen to Your Local Air Traffic Control," Obtain a radio scanner that is capable of receiving frequencies between 118.0 and 136.975 MHz. You can also listen to air traffic control facilities from around the world at websites including liveatc.net, globalair.com, airnav.com and radioreference.com;
,


121.5 is the emergency frequency. If there is some sort of emergency, pilots will transmit on it. You could also hear an emergency locator beacon on this frequency if a plane crashes.
122.750 MHz is the frequency for general aviation air to air communications
123.025 MHz is the frequency for helicopters air to air communications
123.450 MHz is the ""unofficial"" frequency for air to air communications
Search 122.0-123.65 for Unicom (uncontrolled airports) and air to air communications.
Search 128.825-132.000 MHz for ARINC frequencies (airlines, corporate aviation and general aviation calling ahead for fuel, parking, and other requests).

, You most likely want to be looking for a chart of your local area from the closest airport. Older versions of these charts will usually work just fine. Online sectional charts for your local area are available on www.skyvector.com

, Airports are denoted by blue or magenta circles, with lines inside representing runways. Next to the circle is a block of text with the airport name and information about that airport. The control tower frequency is denoted by CT - 000.0, where the following numbers indicate the frequency used by ATC. For example, the frequency for Wittman Regional airport in Oshkosh, WI is CT - 118.5.

, A star will be after the tower frequency to denote that airport as having a part time tower. At this type of airport, pilots communicate directly with one another and tell each other their position and intentions.

, Airports with runways over 8,000 feet (2,438.4 m) are not enclosed in circles and simply have a diagram depicting the runway layout, which is outlined in blue (controlled) or magenta (uncontrolled).

, These are automated or repeating broadcasts that provide pilots with weather and airport information as they prepare to land or depart.

, At larger airports, pilots receive their flight plan clearances from a ""clearance delivery"" frequency, communicate on taxiways with a ""ground"" frequency, and get takeoff and landing clearance from the ""tower"" frequency. Once pilots are airborne, they will talk to an ""approach/departure"" frequency, and once in route, they might even talk to a ""center"" frequency. If you are lucky or live close enough to an airport, you might be able to receive several of these frequencies.

, For commercial flights, this will just be the flight number, such as United 2311. A smaller aircraft is identified by the number on their tail.

, This instructs the pilot to enter the traffic pattern at a specific location. The pilot will then read back the instruction, so the controller can verify that it was understood correctly.

, An example would be a controller saying, ""November-12345, contact Approach on 124.32, good day."" Once again, the pilot will read back the instruction.

, Most of the time, pilots will broadcast blind transmissions to anyone on the frequency, announcing their position or intentions. Words like ""upwind, crosswind, downwind, base, and final"" denote specific positions in the traffic pattern.

, Pilots and controllers use it to communicate letters, since they can often be confused. You might also hear someone use ""niner"" to communicate ""nine,"" ""fife"" to communicate ""five,"" or ""tree"" to communicate ""three.""

Listen in to what is happening on this frequency.",How to Listen to Air Traffic Control Feeds on LiveATC,";
, You can search by airport code or, if you know the frequency that the airport is at (if it's a more local airport that doesn't have a big tower) place that frequency into the box just below that longer textbox. Then click the tinier magnifying glass to begin the search.


You can't search by airport name at this time - it's only the three lettered identifier that you can use.
There is a section on the LiveATC webpage that lists New feeds, but that doesn't change very much, very often.

, You may come across various listings of towers at airports, or approach or departure frequencies at some and some are even frequencies for ground control, like those you might find between the pilot and the person at the flight desk. There are other more federal-affiliated frequencies at the federal desk of the area in the regional office that could be listed at some airports. You'll just need to know what you are looking for listening to, to see if it matches.

, If you'd like to listen in your web browser on your computer that has Flash (such as either Adobe Flash or Macromedia Flash) installed, locate and click the ""Listen"" button next to ""(in browser, requires Flash)"". Alternatively, you can use the Listen button next to ""(launches your MP3 player)"" for listening on a mobile device. The last option will launch in Windows Media Player on a Windows PC or tablet. The link below this is the link for the audio archives.


Look at the table below these links to find out which frequencies these feeds map to.
Recognize that these feeds are fee-free and don't require much thought to find the station you are looking for. Although the LiveATC mobile app costs money in the AppStore or Google Play Store, using the website is free and sometimes can even get you more choices than what is available on the app.

, Most often, these frequencies should be split-band (where you can hear the same transmission on both of your speakers at the same time), but there is the occasional frequency that plays one half of the transmission on one speaker and another separate transmission on the other speaker (much like DCA/Ronald Reagan National and some as you listen in with both speakers on and listening).

As time goes on more law enforcement agencies are migrating from old analog systems to newer digital transmissions that can increase scanner radio costs significantly to decode properly. If those agencies are of little interest - a great deal of money can be saved.
, Purchase a scanner frequency directory from Radio Shack or book store. These books are often sold by region of interest and may also be further reduced in size instead of displaying all licensed services (taxicab, business, ham, etc.) to just police, fire & EMS services. Google is also great free source for this information. A Google search for ""scanner frequencies Boston"" results in a number of links for Boston, MA. Substitute your city or town, county or state for ""Boston"" in the search box., If the services in the area(s) of interest have frequencies in the 800 Mhz (MHz = megahertz) range, additional options will likely be required to listen to those services. More on this later in the 800 Mhz section., There is probably a Radio Shack store (or similar) fairly close to just about everyone and these are great places to at least view and hold these radios. Unfortunately, few Radio Shack stores have personnel that really know about scanners, and may not be a very good source for information. Do your own investigation and compare features, costs, available options, etc., Look up terms and phrases used in the features of the scanner. Most radios offer one or more bands of tuning: 25 - 30 MHz CB & 10 Meter Ham Band, 30 - 50 MHz VHF Low Band, 50 - 54 MHz 6 Meter Ham Band, 88 - 108 MHz Commercial FM, 108 - 137 MHz Aircraft Band (AM mode), 137 - 144 MHz Federal Government, 144-148 MHz 2 Meter Ham Bands, 148 - 174 MHz VHF High Band, 216 - 405 MHz UHF Military Air Band, 406 - 420 MHz Federal Government, 420 - 450 MHz 70 centimeter (27.6 in) Ham Band, 450 - 470 MHz UHF Band, 470 - 512 MHz UHF ""T"" Band, 764 - 775 MHz 794 - 806 MHz and 806 - 960 MHz 800 MHz Band (no cellular) and lastly, 1.24 - 1.3 GHz Ham Band. Some examples below:

If interested in monitoring Boston's Logan International Airport Approach frequency on 133.0Mhz, the radio must be capable of AM mode (not NFM type used by most other services or WFM for commercial broadcasters) and tuning the 133.0 MHz frequency.
If interested in listening to commercial FM broadcasters, the radio will need to be able to tune 88 MHz through 108 MHz in WFM (Wide band FM)
If interested in listening to Police on 42.4 MHz, or 460.15 MHz, etc. the radio will need to be capable of tuning the frequency and the very common NFM (Narrow band FM) mode.
If given an older non-programmable scanner, it is likely tuned by crystals. Years ago, crystals were available for purchase by specific frequency. If 42.40 Mhz was to be monitored, a 42.40 MHz crystal (sometimes called ""rocks"") needed to be purchased and installed into an open jack in the radio. If 8 channels were to be scanned, it would require 8 crystals. About $5 to $7 was an average price for a single crystal, so quite a few dollars could be spent just for frequencies. Moving to a new city would probably require buying a whole new set of crystals. Thankfully, programmable radios put an end to the crystal radio.

, As mentioned above, programmable radios replaced the crystal radios of years ago. Digital programming made having 50, 100 and even 1,000 channel radios inexpensive to own. A simple memory location programmed with a frequency that could be entered by the keyboard made programming free - but sometimes a bit more cumbersome. Managing more than a dozen or so frequencies can become challenging. So much so, that some radios come with or offer as an option, hardware and / or software that allows near painless programming via computer. The larger the number of frequencies programmed into the radio, the more desirable this option becomes. An added plus is the ability to add a 6 (or more) character alpha-numeric to provide a name for the frequency., Google located a bunch of frequencies in your area. A scanner book provided even more. But is that all there is? Absolutely not. Many frequencies aren't listed. Some because they are not licensed - others because they are clandestine and others still - because they weren't included in the directory or no one has found them yet. The ability to scan all frequencies in a range is a helpful tool to locate unpublished users of frequencies. When scanning a range - or even those saved in the scanner, the ability to scan at a very high rate of speed is helpful. Assume that even if there were no transmissions, it took a minute or two to scan from channel 1 to channel 100 and start again, how many transmissions were not heard on channel 134? The scan stayed on each channel about 1/2 second, but if it stayed only 1/10 sec, it could have scanned all the channels five times instead of just once., A base, mobile or portable radio? This is largely a matter of personal preference. Some places however, restrict the usage of scanners in vehicles. Be sure to check with local authorities in your area before installing such a radio in a vehicle. Technology in power conservation and battery life have made portable scanning more desirable than ever. But carrying such a radio will often draw looks, questions and even theft. Obviously, using a portable radio should be used with an earphone - which can make understanding transmissions even more difficult. Some portables are geared towards auto racing fans, these radios make it easy to assign a channel with a team's frequency and labeling as the car number - making identification that much easier. Base radios not have to worry about batteries failing as they are plugged directly into an outlet. Audio on base units are usually superior to portables as the speaker is usually much larger and has more power available to it. Displays are usually lit the entire time and for the most part offer more memory locations to store frequencies and even alpha-numeric tagging with the name of the service such as BOSTON PD F2 OPS (Boston PD F2 Operations), rather than just displaying 460.4500 (some portables support alpha-numeric tagging, too)., You can't listen if you can't hear it. Nearly all of these radio types can have the supplied antenna changed to one that will perform better. Keys points to remember are to have the antenna up as high as possible and keep a high quality / low loss feed line or coax cable between the antenna and radio as short as possible. Choose an antenna that is ""matched"" to the frequency bands programmed. If the radio only has VHF-Low and VHF-High frequencies and an antenna that is designed for UHF and 800 MHz, changing to a VHF-Low antenna should improve reception. Mismatched antennas will probably not affect local services adversely, but could make the difference when trying to monitor services 2,3 or more communities away., Some scanners provide for the control of a tape recorder. When a scan is stopped, the radio closes a switch that starts an external tape recorder in record mode. When scanning resumes, the recorder stops until the next time. An entire day's of transmissions could be reduced to an hour or two of seemingly non-stop dialog."

Open the box and unbox all the items, including the item and antenna, power cord(HomePatrol-II doesn't contain one, but there's a workaround described later), the holder/dock and most other parts.,
Peruse the Quick reference guide (that is included in the box with the device) and read your owner's manual to your HomePatrol device.,
Connect the antenna to the device.,
Place the batteries that came with your device into the HomePatrol device.,
Place the scanner stand on a flat surface in an uncrowded room/corner where signals and reception will tend to be good.,
Place the HomePatrol on this scanner stand so that the antenna is on the left side of the device and facing you.,
Power the device for charge.,
Power the device on for the first time after the full fourteen hour charge.,
Set the device up on the screen.,
Accept the fact that the device will need a few moments to initialize and install the nearest frequencies to your device every time you turn it on, but the wait is definitely worthwhile.,
Recognize some of the channels it programs into the device, that you don't want to hear/scan/listen to.,
Set the volume control.,
Set the squelch.,
Add or subtract more services.",How to Set Up a Uniden HomePatrol," Find the USB cord to connect the scanner to the computer for programmer there along with any firmware updates to the device.;
, All HomePatrol's have a owners manual, but their manual can only be found online (especially for the HomePatrol-II). Both contain valuable information on how this device can be operated once you set it up as well as information all scanner users must know about listening to transmissions. Use this page to find your device's manual (use ""HomePatrol-II if you own one or type ""HomePatrol"" if you own the previous version and select the product that best looks like your device (including color cover design), The placement of the antenna is located on the left side of the device towards the top. Turn the antenna, so the antenna sticks upwards and not the initial sideways position. If you've bought a HomePatrol-II, this stick should be bent into the correct V-shaped way.

, If your device's originally batteries stop working correctly, you can place a pair of rechargeable double-A batteries into the device and have it charge for the full 14 hours without using. The batteries serve as the ""juice"" when the device is off it's charging cord and away from a power source, and can help provide some backup in cases of emergencies when the power goes out unexpectedly.


Don't use non-rechargeable batteries. They don't last for too long - even when the device is fully off and not functioning...and they don't recharge too when the juice runs out.
Turn the device over to the back.






Unlock the battery door. There's a tiny switch that anyone with tiny fingers can flick (a thin edge to a key can also help). There are symbols that look like a pad lock if you look at the device closely.
Open the battery door.






Place the batteries into the device. If you want to make sure the power cord actually sticks to it's intended use, use either the batteries that came with the device, or rechargeable ones at all times.






Replace the battery door to the back of the device.






Lock the battery door again.

, Test out where in the room this is. If you don't receive much (or any) activity, move the device someplace else and try again. Try on mediocre-high locations near windows, but even where windows just don't exist, you may need to try elsewhere in the room.

, You will feel a click-like feeling when it's securely placed in it's cradle. The cradle is provided to make sure the device doesn't move around a lot (which can sometimes be a pain when trying to find the best place to here signals and stations.)

, Plug in the device's USB cord on the top (if running on a HomePatrol-II) and secure it to the wall via a USB converter plug (with the traditional USB-end) and let it charge for the minimum 14 hours. HomePatrol-II has a color-coded light that says ""CHARGE"" in the bottom left corner of the device near the device's speaker. The USB cord location plug-in point to the device is on the side (top right).

For those on the older first-generation HomePatrol, you can plug in the power cord to the right side of the device towards the middle.

, The power button is at the top of the device. Hold it down for a few seconds (but no more than 10 seconds), until you here a beep sound and either ""Welcome to HomePatrol"" displays. If you've bought the newer HomePatrol-II and you are moving the batteries (which were charged in the HomePatrol first gen, your device will still need this 14 hour charge, and the red light will not go to green until this is complete for the first time)

, The rest of this part of the process can be set up right on the device itself, as it has a touch screen display.


Press the Proceed button on the bottom of the device. Uniden wants you to install their software and will tend to do everything in their power to get you to take care of this. The device will alert you at the start to install it, but you can press Proceed at least the minimum six times and run this software installation at a better time later. Uniden calls this software Sentinel. You'll have to do this six times, if you'd like to skip this step which you will eventually need to do to get accurate software and the weekly (for HomePatrol-II) database updates as well as firmware updates (on occasion, sometimes yearly or biyearly).






A copy of the software's installation files can be found in a zipped folder at this page, though the software package folder's file can also be found under it's skin when it's plugged into your computer with it's USB cord. And as long as you update its database every few weeks, you'll never run out of the correct data for which your device carries the frequencies of.
Don't ignore any firmware updates that are needed on the device. Firmware updates are major fixes to problems the device has been confirmed to encounter but was fixed by Uniden after it was shipped from the factory.


Press the Proceed button at the bottom of the sixth page, to enter the next step of initialization.






Fill in the owner card on the device using the keypad that will come up, if you don't want the device saying ""Welcome to HomePatrol-II"" or ""Welcome to HomePatrol"" everytime you begin the device. You can only fill in up to six lines of text with the non-Qwerty keyboard on the right side of the device.






Press the Next Line button at the bottom of the screen when the device's information has been fully entered on each line. You'll need to know your name, and at least part of your address (two entry lines devoted to this), a phone number, and potentially your email address.








Press the Finish button when you are satisfied that everything is entered correctly.






Set the time zone where the device is located or will be operated in. Make sure the device is set to the correct time zone.






Set the device's time and date manually, by typing in this data on the next screen. The date will be set as MM/DD/YYYY. It will adjust for the 2007 DST time update dates, but this will adjust if the date and time is properly set initially.






Press the Accept button, when you are satisfied that everything is entered correctly.








Set the device's location. Set it up by zipcode for best results at first. You're best and easiest bet is to do this by zip code, but you can choose whatever you feel is right.






Before you can enter your zip code, it will ask for the country of origin. However, the device will only recognize zip codes from either of the two known countries: USA and Canada. Tap the correct entry.


Fill in the zip code data that it requests using the keyboard on the device's screen






Press the Accept button, when you are satisfied that everything is entered correctly.







, Wait for the device to fully program the device for nearby frequencies including any frequencies in nearby states where your states are bordering.

, Understand the process for which you must remove these items. Tap the button at the right of the frequency/set you'd like to remove.


Tap ""Avoid"".






Tap the Avoid Permanently button, if you'd like to always avoid this frequency when scanning the airwaves.

, THe volume button is on the top of the device near the left hand side., Although Uniden sets their squelch rather low, to get more transmissions, turn this up to a medium level. Touch the Squelch button, then press the up and down buttons (that were originally used to turn the volume up and down) until the orange bar on the screen is about half-way up. As soon as that is at that point, leave the screen go and it will set from there and the box will go away., There are two things you will want to manage in terms of stuff you can listen to (for those who just bought the device and not the additional trunking information service card stuff - for those who listen as a hobby). One is for regional systems (tap the menu button and select Set Service types, select your services; three services are selected at start up) as well as some additional national services that are affected (tap menu, tap advanced, tap Set Nationwide Systems then select your systems by tapping on them).

Be careful, though. The more systems you select from both, the longer the search will take and the less likely the scanner will stop later on the intended frequency.
Once done on each screen, and back out to the main menu, tap ""Listen"" in yellow to go back to listening to the police transmissions.
Don't enable the ""National Weather Service - USA"" listing. The scanner will always stop on the Weather station every turn of the dial, and by ""avoiding"" it, will cause some major symptoms that won't allow you to listen to it with the correct way. Open the Menu and select ""Weather Mode"", touch Monitor NOAA Weather, wait for it to find the closest station and you got yourself a weather radio also like the pros and scanner enthusiasts - all devoid of the Federal stations of Weather and the weather frequency problem.

Find an RSS creation program.,
Create a new feed.,
Add an image to your feed.,
Add content to your feed.,
Create the XML file.,
Publish the feed.,
Submit your RSS feed.",How to Create an RSS Feed1," There are a couple options when it comes to RSS services. You can use a web service to automatically create and update your RSS feed for a monthly fee, or you can download an RSS feed program and update your feed manually. Popular programs include:RSS Builder – A free, open-source RSS creation program that allows you to create RSS files that you upload to your website. It can also automatically manage the RSS feed on your website without having to upload the file each time
Feedity and rapidfeeds – These are web services that allows you to manage multiple feeds with automatic updates. You will not need to manually update your feed when you update your website’s content. Feedity will generate an RSS file without having to input each item.
FeedForAll – A paid program that will allow you to create RSS feeds to upload to your website. It also has specialized tools for creating podcast feeds for iTunes.;
, Once you have chosen your service, create your first feed. The process will differ from program to program, but the general idea is the same for almost all of them. All feeds will need to have some basic metadata:


Create a title for the feed. This should be the same as your website or podcast.
Enter in the URL for your website. This will help viewers link back to your homepage.
Enter a description of the feed. This should be no more than a sentence or two describing the general content on the feed.

, You can add an image that represents your feed. The image file will need to be uploaded to your website in order for it to load. Adding an image is optional, but highly recommended for podcasts.

, Once you’ve entered your podcast’s information, it’s time to start populating it with content. Enter within the title of the article, blog post, podcast episode, etc. Enter in the URL that links directly to that content, as well as the publishing date. For Feedity, enter in your website URL and your content will be automatically populated.


Each entry should have a short but sweet description. This is what your readers will see before they choose to click your entry in their RSS readers.
The GUID is a unique identifier for your content. Most of the time, you can place the URL in this field as well. If both pieces of content are located at the same URL, they will need unique identifiers.
You can add Author information and comments.
Add a new entry for each piece of content that you want to broadcast.

, Once you’re done entering in all of your content into your feed, you need to export it to an XML file. This XML file will allow visitors to subscribe to your RSS feed.

, Upload the XML file you’ve created to your website and place it on your homepage. Some sites will create an URL to your feed that you can place on your website instead.


For RSS Builder, you can enter in your website’s FTP information to have your feed automatically updated whenever you edit it. To do this, click the FTP button in the top toolbar, click the New Site button, and enter in your FTP information. When you’re ready to update the XML file on the website, click the Publish Feed button.

, There are a variety of aggregate sites that you can submit your RSS feed to. These sites collect articles from similar interests, and can significantly increase your viewership. Search for RSS Feed Directories that match the interests that your feed addresses and submit the URL to your feed’s XML file.


If your feed is a podcast, you can submit it to iTunes so that iTunes users can search for it and subscribe through the program. Your podcast will need to be approved in order for it to show up in searches."

",How to Use the Swype Keyboard on an iPhone," If you yourself can't spell the word correctly, how can the iPhone device learn what you are trying to say correctly to it, in turn?;
, Since you do this when writing the word with a pen, Swype thought about it and you must do this same thing when writing a word from the keyboard. Don't just tap each letter like you would have with the standard integrated iPhone keyboard.

, However, don't make unnecessary corrections unless the keyboard is so far off on what you were trying to say than it would be best to begin over again with that word. (Hence, although each scenario is different, if you are trying to type dippers but the keyboard keeps wanting to place another word in it's place, you may want to correct the word by replacing portions of the word by letters, or tap the word from the predictive text bar above the keyboard since most-often this word will be in this bar since ""dippers"" isn't normally a commonly-used word, but there are others that are more commonly typed in the former word's place, instead.)

, With just a few steps, it's easy to get this keyboard activated and ready for use.


If you intend to be able to add the degree symbol, make sure that the English standard keyboard is still available (as you'll later learn). However, if you don't intend to use it...ever...leave the English keyboard off.

, Otherwise, the iPhone won't open to it's Swype keyboard, but will open to whatever entry method it requires for that type of entry box.


Realize that Swype isn't set up to work with the text-based password field. The iPhone will switch back to it's standard keyboard instead in these cases, just because of the way this third-party keyboard works and the way Apple designed third-party keyboards to run. (Swype stores your ""conversation"" in its internal memory of what it learns through your actions on it's keyboard screen including words you added to it's custom dictionary. In addition, it recognizes that people don't want their passwords stored on the device, even if you told their device that it was okay to store your password.)

, Place your finger on that letter.

, If and when you need to vary the line (such as when the letters duplicate next to each letter) follow along in this article as these differences are described below. The line you draw doesn't have to be perfectly straight for the keyboard to understand, but the lines must touch within each letter of the key without overshooting the letter for the keyboard to understand and be correct.


Unlike the Swype for Android keyboard, the Swype for iPhone keyboard won't try to interpret and display the intended interpretation in real-time, but is storing it's potential interpretation behind the scenes until you finish your Swype pattern.

, Wait for the screen to update and the word to be shown to you., This keyboard sometimes has problems putting the correct word up if the OS was updated and the keyboard app hasn't been updated, and the words it puts up will look awful awkward.


If it is incorrect, look at the predictive-text bar above the keyboard for the corrected word, or other words that could have been those you tried to Swype into. You will only get three possible words, but sometimes three is all the cases you'll ever need.

,,, However, don't let the loop lap overtop of any other letter on the keyboard drop or continue above any other key on the keyboard. Keep the circle looped on the one letter only.

,, Wait for the screen to update and the word to be shown to you.

, Whether it's ""a""(inside a sentence) or ""I"", the capitalization won't matter as you can let the keyboard change it's case by itself to meet most often used usages.


Allow the keyboard to auto-correct the word ""I"" if you intentionally misspell it (if you keep it lowercase, it'll fix your entry, and therefore you'll become a little faster on this keyboard).

,, Unlike the Swype keyboard for Android, you can't Swype from the Shift key to the first letter or use most of the methods that are described in the Android keyboard method for Swype. For words where the capital doesn't begin at the direct beginning of the word (e.g. ""iPhone""), you'll have to type it in as if it was a new word or let it correct for words that are already pre-existing in it's dictionary.

, Either draw the line or tap the letters to get this to write out the word. Swype the word from the first letter to the last, not worrying too much about the letters and their cases, as the first letter will be capitalized. Swype through the remainder of the letters as if you were typing the remainder of the Swyped word.

, Use the same single character tapping method of letters to tap your words in as the method used with the integrated one just performed on this keyboard instead. Tap the letters at a moderate pace, but try to not make any mistakes in the meantime.


If after typing your word letter-for-letter, the word you newly-typed doesn't display in the persistence search bar, enter a space using the Spacebar of the keyboard, as doing so will trigger the addition of words feature on your Swype keyboard.

, Most often, the word you type in, will be the left-most option in the grey bar slightly above the keyboard. This keyboard relies on predictive text to the maximum extent, so that bar will always be present.

, Not only will it add the word to the dictionary, it'll keep the word where you typed it until you next delete it from the document page you typed it on.

,, Whether its a letter with the German umlaut or a letter with a right-facing Spanish accent mark, these types of letters can be found hidden away on each of the letters starting at the letter best describing the letter on the keyboard itself. You'll see a dialog box pop up with other keys that can be accessed by using that key.

,, (Tapping the Spacebar after this type of word is crucial.)


However, be careful, sometimes it will try to change it back to the word it still best thinks is your word which might not even be it, but after several rounds of ""no""-changes, try continuing onto the next word without deleting the last word in it's entirety, go back to the word and backspace out until the word with the accented character will be needed and retype the remaining correct letters of the word, forgetting to add the ""new"" incorrect thought up partial spelling addition to be added to the dictionary.

, If it doesn't have any letters before the symbol, you may skip this step and continue onwards.

, This button will bring up the most-commonly needed numbers and symbols portion of the keyboard.

, Typing words with symbols aren't traditional words, so typing these out longhand is about the only way Swype can interpret a word with this type of format.

,


For other keys that aren't on the initial keyboard of most-commonly used characters, you can tap the ""#+="" key. if the symbol you are looking for isn't in the list of keys of the most commonly used symbols that was originally present in the original symbol keyboard.

If it still isn't in the list of symbols, try holding down each of the keys for a few brief seconds to see if there are any related keys that are associated, but backspace if you accidentally add one that shouldn't have been added. Although Swype for iPhone at first didn't use this method of symbols, they found that some symbols could best be found in lists hidden away from view.


Symbols such as the degree character are only available in the standard Apple keyboard, until Swype decides to add it to it's keyboard instead. By holding down the 0 key in the Apple keyboard, you'll find this sign.

, It doesn't have to be a text message, but just something where text can be entered, is all it needs to be.

, You'll see three additional options.

,,, For those wanting an ""inverse"" color scheme, the color scheme called ""Dark"" option is the closest keyboard, though ""Earth"" and ""Sun"" also give out an inverse feel of reversing the effects of the white keyboard. Sand gives the keyboard a rather distinct look, but tries to keep the area light.

Start by deciding what are the types of hosting you are going to provide.,

Plan your bandwidth purchases.,
Consider investing in power.,
Think about hardware purchases.,
Consider licensing purchases.,
Know about support team costs.,
Make your presence felt among web hosting business and competing.,
Always be a part of existing discussions on various forums.,
Deciding on various online marketing strategies such as SEO, SEM, running a Google AdWords campaign can also provide you with an option of creating a larger client base.

,
These are a few major aspects of any web hosting business.",How to Start a Web Hosting Company," This can vary from shared hosting to dedicated server hosting to colocation facilities. Categorize the products that you have knowledge about and then decide on the range of products you can handle.;
, Research your competitors to figure out what services they offer at what prices. Choose prices and plans that will be competitive in the market, but keep your prices fair for both your company and your consumers.

, This can be a WHMCS panel through which all your website orders and client handling can be optimized, or something similar.

, Bandwidth is a major constraint that all hosting providers have to look at since it is at the core of any hosting business. For this reason, it's crucial to tie down an ISP who can provide you with a bandwidth at a reasonable price with service level agreements of 99.99% uptime with IP pools.

, Buying bandwidth is one of the most important aspects of your business strategy, as this well enable you to decide on your sales techniques as this is the most important resource in the web hosting business. To start off, a purchase of Bandwidth of about 10Mbps will allow you around 1000 VPS accounts, so decide on your whole budgeting based on the bandwidth.

, Your hosting accounts will have to be online 24/7, and therefore will be in the higher ranges of power consumption. Think about how you'll keep these accounts live, even in the case of emergencies. With these considerations in mind, power should be an important chunk of your investment.

, Getting hardware as per you clients' requirements and balancing various accounts on them will be critical for Dedicated, VPS and Shared hosting businesses, since most of the providers do not charge any installation cost for them. If you can get the best deals for hardware purchases then you can save a major sum from your investment.

, A provider will have to decide on the product line that he is getting into, for example : clients require cPanel with their Linux VPS accounts for which the license cost is variable from one provider to another depending on deals with cPanel.net, so having a pricing range for all such license purchases in sync with the bandwidth calculations (shall provide you a cost per client) and strategy of deciding product share (Dedicated vs VPS vs Shared Hosting) in your business will provide you with a complete overview of pricing ranges.

, Managing 10 accounts, starting off, will not be an issue for you. But once your business grows and there are hundreds of tickets that need resolution, you will need a strong support team. Since support is one thing that clients look at in the most minutest of details, and most of them going for monthly contracts will keep you on your toes with respect to longevity of accounts that provide you recurring incomes. So, keeping aside a small amount to get in system administrators as and when your client base increases is a sound strategy to have for sustaining your business.

, Once you have streamlined and decided on your business strategy comes the most exciting part, competing. You will need to be a competitive provider, keeping your existing clients happy, getting in new clients and making your presence felt in web hosting communities and forum.

, Use web hosting talk or web cosmo forums, etc. to make your online presence felt. Always have something constructive to say, since these forums are a powerful marketing tool for your business and say a lot about your business.

,, One thing you must note, that all these constraints are really important from a customers point of view, since in hosting, stability and support along with guaranteed uptime are the most crucial parameters.

You should search for Apache using the command 'yum search httpd' . This will probably show you a lot of results, however some of these things are modules or addons. The main one to look for looks like 'httpd.i386' or similar. Now you can install it with 'yum install httpd.i386';

, The MediaWiki offers data output in the form of JSON, JSONFM, PHP (serialized format), PHPFM, WDDX, WDDXFM, XML, XMLFM, YAML, YAMLFM, and RAWFM. The formats suffixed ""FM"" are pretty-print in HTML.

, The MediaWiki API supports the following actions:


help - See the help screen
login - Login to MediaWiki
opensearch - Implement the opensearch protocol. (Not all MediaWiki installations have this).
feedwatchlist - Return a watchlist feed.
query - Has a variety of options. See the MediaWiki API documentation for them.

, Besides the standard actions, MediaWiki supports different queries and lists, such as listing pages that contain a link to another article, number of recent changes diffs, contributions, etc.

, The GET method may also work.

,, The edit token is used to determine edit collisions and avoid overriding another edit already done (This is used in rollback as well.). Keep in mind it is easier for things to go awry if you are acting with the user interface of the wiki. Be mindful of any regexes you use to make sure that they will only do the intended result.

, The results will be sent to you in an HTTP response, which can be read by many parsers. Take extra care of the format you choose. Make sure you use the appropriate parser for that format. It is usually a good practice to explicitly state the format to MediaWiki even if it has a default format that you want to use.

Design a travel portal which is striking.,
Try to provide the index of all contents that can be found on other pages of the website.,
Provide the information of all the destinations in short form.,
Provide the users with information about any discounts and deals.

,
Provide readers with various options for doing things after reaching their destination.,
Provide information about safety and precautions.,
Add links from each page to the others.,
Post the various feedback and testimonials of happy customer.",How to Make Your Own Travel Portal," Make the front page attractive, using a few pictures of the various destinations you, as a travel agent, deal with. Avoid overcrowding it with images, as this will confuse readers and can increase site opening time, making users irritated.;
, This will help simplify the work of the hopeful traveler.

, The travel portal must be informative enough about the destination readers are looking for. Provide brief information about the location, climate, best time to visit, food and other stuff relevant to each place. The best option to attract people is to tell about the main attractions of each place are and how they can visit them.

,, This helps the user enjoy their own planning freedom, as apart from receiving their accommodation booked from the agent, they can opt for various travel guides that may help them when they get there. This can fetch your agency extra money, as well as increasing your good reputation.

, Explain also how your company provides security; doing this can create reassurance for users.

, Don't make readers do all the hard work.

, Doing this can attract lot of users, as it will be a kind of recommendation of your website. Don't hold back from explaining how you have successfully dealt with complaints, either, as this will build a sense of trust in your ability to be responsive to customers.

Install VirtualBox on your Mac.,
Open http://modern.ie in your browser.,
Select the browser/OS combo that you want to test in the Virtual Machine dropdown.

,
In the Platform dropdown, select VirtualBox for Mac.

,
Download the single-file zip archive.,
Once you've downloaded the zip archive file, double-click on it to unarchive.,
Double-click on the .ova file to open it in VirtualBox and import the virtual machine.,
Click ""Import"".,
Choose your new virtual machine in the sidebar and click on the ""Start"" button to launch it and wait for it to boot.

,
In your Mac's menubar, go to Devices → Insert Guest Additions CD image... and follow the install wizard.,
Open up your website in Internet Explorer, and enjoy running Windows on your Mac for free!

",How to Test a Website in Internet Explorer on a Mac for Free," VirtualBox is a free and open-source virtualization platform that will allow you to run Windows on your Mac.;
, This is an official Microsoft website that allows you to download temporary builds of Windows for free, especially for web developers.

,,, The archive file is likely to be in excess of 4 GB, so be prepared for a lengthy download.


You may be able to speed this up slightly by using the CURL download method, which will fetch multiple, smaller, files then combine them into one large archive. To do this, click on the ""Grab them all with URL"" link and follow the directions.

, You should end up with a .ova file (possibly enclosed in several levels of folders). If the resulting file is yet another archive format, your downloaded zip file may have been corrupted due to data loss. Try downloading again.

, In the ""Appliance Settings"" window that appears, confirm that these are the settings that you want to use.


Generally speaking, it's best to double the default RAM allocation if you have enough spare RAM in your Mac. Just remember that when the virtual machine is running, that amount RAM will be unavailable to your Mac.

, This process may take several minutes to complete.


Although it is now safe to delete the .ova file, it is recommended that you keep it. The Windows OS builds are limited to a 30-90 day trial period before they expire and cease to work. Keeping the .ova file will ensure that you can reinstall the virtual machine without having to download the file again.

,, If the virtual machine already has the guest additions installed, this will make sure that it's running the most recent version.

Determine what resource you want to use.,
Figure out how much time you'll need.,
Download a web design program if you haven't already.,
Get started with HTML.,

Learn JavaScript and jQuery.,
Move on to the more advanced languages.,
Make project websites.,
Ask friends or family if they want a website.,
Start your own website.,
Do freelance web design, if you want to.",How to Learn Web Design," Web design is not book design, it is not poster design, it is not illustration, and the highest achievements of those disciplines are not what web design aims for. Although websites can be delivery systems for games and videos, and although those delivery systems can be lovely to look at, such sites are exemplars of game design and video storytelling, not of web design.

, Web design is the creation of digital environments that:


facilitate and encourage human activity;
reflect or adapt to individual voices and content; and
change gracefully over time while always retaining their identity.

, The main resources are websites, videos, and books. Some popular websites are Codecademy and W3Schools. However, there are many more, so feel free to experiment!


Sign up for an account if you've chosen a website. You will be able to save your progress this way.
If you've chosen videos, bookmark all the videos you'll need.
Go to your local library or bookstore if you've chosen the book route. If you want something cheaper (or even free), download eBooks or PDF files.
If you're willing to pay, you might be able to get individualized lessons from a professional web designer.

, You'll need to figure out how to fit this into your day if you're a busy person.

, While Notepad will work, it's a good idea to have a program like Adobe Dreamweaver, Microsoft Expression Web, or KompoZer. There are many, many others, so browse around and get what you like.

, HTML is an absolute requirement for any web designer. Master the concept of tags, classes, IDs, inputs, etc.


The newest version of HTML is HTML5. HTML5 incorporates some new technologies, so that is probably the best one to learn.

XHTML is also an option, but it's a little bit stricter in its rules.

, CSS stands for ""Cascading Style Sheet"". Without CSS, there wouldn't be the pretty designs you see on some websites. HTML is merely the skeleton, but CSS is what makes a website colorful and pretty.


CSS is a bit stricter in its rules. For instance, if you forgot to put a semicolon at the end of each line, you could be in for some headaches trying to figure out what went wrong.

, This is optional for ones that plan to make simple website, but it's essential if you want interactive websites.


If you're going to use jQuery, you really only need a basic knowledge of JavaScript, because jQuery makes things pretty simple.
With jQuery, you can insert widgets like an accordion, a calendar, etc. There are different styles of it, too, so you can pick the style you want for your website.

, There's PHP, MySQL, Perl, Ruby, and some others. Again, this is optional for simple website builders, but very useful for interactive and large websites.


Some of these languages, like PHP, require a test server, so make sure to have an account with a web hosting company or install server software on your computer.

, Just experiment and make websites from scratch. This helps you put your knowledge to work, instead of letting it rust out in your brain.

, You could do it for free to get some experience!

, It can be about whatever you want, but it gives you an opportunity to show your work to the general public.

, Charge reasonable rates and post a portfolio on your site. Your business may eventually grow into a full-fledged company.

Declare variables for the values you want users to input.,
Delete unnecessary chart values.,
Inside the code for the graph, replace the values in the code for the Google chart with the variables declared in Step 3.,
In separate ""div"" tags, outside of the graph script, insert an HTML form with ""form"" tags.,
Insert ""input"" tags between the ""form"" tags in the HTML document.,
Inside the curly braces after function drawChart(), retrieve the user input from the form using ""getElementById(' ')."",
Save the graph and view it in your browser.


",How to Make a Google Chart with User Input," Go to the Google Charts Gallery and find the chart type you would like to place on your website. This article will detail how to implement and customise a column chart. Although a column chart is used for the sake of example, the method this article employs to accept user input is universal to all Google chart types.;
,, These variables must be declared inside the  script tags surrounding the code for the Google chart.  Set these variables equal to default numeric values. These values will be the first numbers displayed when the chart is initially loaded.

, Change the names of the chart axes if you'd like.

, In this example, the variables will be called ""ask"" and ""bid"".

, Inside the first ""form"" tag, set method equal to ""post"", action equal to a hashtag, id equal to ""formvalue"" and onkeyup equal to ""drawChart()"".


Remember to refer to the image below as a reference. The next step will explain out to insert input boxes so that they integrate with your Google chart.

, Inside each ""input"" tag, set the type equal to ""number"", set the name to anything you wish, set the value equal to ""1"" and set the id equal to a non-numeric value other than the variables declared in Step 3. Before the ""input"" tags, type  a word or phrase that describes each input box, followed by a colon. In the picture above, this description word or phase is ""Value 1"" and ""Value 2"".

, Type the ID declared in Step 6 into the parentheses between the apostrophes. Set the variables declared in Step 3 equal to this value. Use the picture above as a reference.

, Codec academy website offers really nice stuff at this from the basics. If you're looking forward to start your own online entrepreneurship, then PHP and MySQL are a very mighty choice for this. Most of the small online business ventures are built in these open source technologies.

, Learning computer programming is nothing less than taking part in the technological evolution of the world. Because, technology we see around us today (for example Android features, Computer Operating Systems such as Windows, Mac etc..) is only the code which finally transforms into the Binary Digits 0 and 1. When you start to study this stuff like you do for non-fiction, you will love it all and that should motivate you enough.

, Any interest/skill without determined practice is like a stove without the fire, you can never cook anything on it. Whenever you can find time, just sit and start practicing to write computer programs from basic level. You can just browse the internet for finding out the various kind of programs to learn programming. But always remember PRACTICE is utmost important in this field as in any other field.

, For developing skills in computer science all you need is a PC, proper compilers (which are mostly available for free), internet. A computer is the costliest item listed above but then it is also a basic requirement for people these days. So, for computer science students or an for enthusiasts who're looking forward to learn the skills, it won't at all cost top dollar to get hands practice with the skill and possibly build a career out of it, unlike other science fields like mechanics, electrical and electronics, chemistry, physics etc., where the learner needs lot of equipment to learn stuff. Of course, those fields too, are very vital for the development of the world.

This will help you determine what type of programming you should pursue, and provide you a good starting point.


If you want to get into web development, you'll have a whole different set of languages that you'll need to learn as opposed to developing computer programs. Mobile app developing requires a different skillset than machine programming. All of these decisions will influence your direction.;
, Regardless of your decision, you may want to consider starting with one of the high-level, simpler languages. These languages are especially useful for beginners, as they teach basic concepts and thought processes that can apply to virtually any language.The two most popular languages in this category are Python and Ruby. These are both object-oriented web application languages that use a very readable syntax.
""Object-oriented"" means that the language is built around the concepts of ""objects"", or collections of data, and their manipulation. This is a concept that is used in many advanced programming languages such as C++, Java, Objective-C, and PHP.

, If you're still not sure which language you should start learning, read through some tutorials for a few different languages. If one language makes a bit more sense than the others, try it out for a bit to see if it clicks. There are countless tutorials for every programming available online, including many on wikiHow:



Python - A great starter language that is also quite powerful when you get familiar with it. Used for many web applications and a number of games.

Java - Used in countless types of programs, from games to web applications to ATM software.

HTML - An essential starting place for any web developer. Having a handle on HTML is vital before moving on to any other sort of web development.

C - One of the older languages, C is still a powerful tool, and is the basis for the more modern C++, C#, and Objective-C.

, While the parts of this step that apply will vary depending on the language you choose, all programming languages have fundamental concepts that are essential to building useful programs. Learning and mastering these concepts early will make it easier to solve problems and create powerful and efficient code. Below are just some of the core concepts found in many different languages:


Variables - A variable is a way to store and refer to changing pieces of data. Variables can be manipulated, and often have defined types such as ""integers"", ""characters"", and others, which determine the type of data that can be stored. When coding, variables typically have names that make them somewhat identifiable to a human reader. This makes it easier to understand how the variable interacts with the rest of the code.
Conditional Statements - A conditional statement is an action that is performed based on whether the statement is true or not. The most common form of a conditional statement is the ""If-Then"" statement. If the statement is true (e.g. x = 5) then one thing happens. If the statement is false (e.g. x != 5), then something else happens.
Functions or Subroutines - The actual name for this concept may be called something different depending on the language. It could also be ""Procedure"", a ""Method"", or a ""Callable Unit"". This is essentially a smaller program within a larger program. A function can be ""called"" by the program multiple times, allowing the programmer to efficiently create complex programs.
Data input - This is a broad concept that is used in nearly every language. it involves handling a user's input as well as storing that data. How that data is gathered depend on the type of program and the inputs available to the user (keyboard, file, etc.). This is closely linked to Output, which is how the result is returned to the user, be it displayed on the screen or delivered in a file.

, Many programming languages require compilers, which are programs designed to translate the code into a language that the machine can understand. Other languages, such as Python, use an interpreter which can execute the programs instantly without compiling.


Some languages have IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) which usually contain a code editor, a compiler and/or interpreter, and a debugger. This allows the programmer to perform any necessary function in one place. IDEs may also contain visual representations of object hierarchies and directories.
There are a variety of code editors available online. These programs offer different ways of highlighting syntax and provide other developer-friendly tools.

, One of the first programs taught for any language is the ""Hello World"" program. This is a very simple program that displays the text ""Hello, World"" (or some variation), on the screen. This program teaches first-time programmers the syntax to create a basic, functioning program, as well as how to handle displaying output. By changing the text, you can learn how basic data is handled by the program. Below are some wikiHow guides on creating a ""Hello World"" program in various languages:


Hello World in Python
Hello World in Ruby
Hello World in C
Hello World in PHP
Hello World in C#
Hello World in Java

, There are thousands of code examples online for virtually every programming languages. Use these examples to examine how various aspects of the language work and how different parts interact. Take bits and pieces from various examples to create your own programs.

, The syntax is the way the language is written so that the compiler or interpreter can understand it. Each language has a unique syntax, though some elements may be shared across multiple languages. Learning the syntax is essential for learning how to program in the language, and is often what people think of when they think about computer programming. In reality, it is simply the foundation upon which more advanced concepts are built.     

, Make changes to your example programs and then test the result. By experimenting, you can learn what works and what doesn't much quicker than by reading a book or guide. Don't be afraid to break your program; learning to fix errors is a major part of any development process, and new things almost never work right the first time., When you're programming, you're invariably going to come across bugs. These are errors in the program, and can manifest virtually anywhere. Bugs can be harmless quirks in the program, or they can be major errors that keep the program from compiling or running. Hunting down and fixing these errors is a major process in the software development cycle, so get used to doing this early.


As you experiment with changing basic programs, you're going to come across things that don't work. Figuring out how to take a different approach is one of the most valuable skills you can have as a programmer.

, Nearly all programming languages have a ""comment"" function that allows you to include text that is not processed by the interpreter or compiler. This allows you to leave short, but clear, human-language explanations of what the code does. This will not only help you remember what your code does in a large program, it is an essential practice in a collaborative environment, as it allows others to understand what your code is doing.

, Mastering a programming language takes time above all else. Even a simpler language like Python, which may only take a day or two to understand the basic syntax, takes lots of time to become truly proficient at. Like any other skill, practice is the key to becoming more proficient. Try to spend at least some time each day coding, even if it's only for an hour between work and dinner.

, By setting attainable but challenging goals, you will be able to start solving problems and coming up with solutions. Try to think of a basic application, such as a calculator, and develop a way to make it. Use the syntax and concepts you've been learning and apply them to practical uses.

, There are lots of programming communities dedicated to specific languages or disciplines. Finding and participating in a community can do wonders for your learning. You will gain access to a variety of samples and tools that can aid you in your learning process. Reading other programmers' code can inspire you and help you grasp concepts that you haven't mastered yet.Check out programming forums and online communities for your language of choice. Make sure to participate and not just constantly ask questions. These communities are usually viewed as a place of collaboration and discussion and not simply Q&A. Feel free to ask for help, but be prepared to show your work and be open to trying different approaches.
Once you have some experience under your belt, consider attending a hack-a-thon or programming jam. these are events where individuals or teams compete against the clock to develop a functional program, usually based around a specific theme. These events can be a lot of fun and are a great way to meet other programmers.

, Try to do things that you don't know how to do yet. Research ways to accomplish the task (or a similar one), and then try to implement that in your own program. Try to avoid being content with a program that ""basically"" works; do everything you can to make sure every aspect works flawlessly.

, Many universities, community colleges, and community centers offer programming classes and workshops that you can attend without having to enroll in the school. These can be great for new programmers, as you can get hands-on help from an experienced programmer, as well as network with other local programmers.

, There are thousands of instructional books available for every conceivable programming language. While your knowledge should not come strictly from a book, they make great references and often contain a lot of good examples.

, Most programming involves basic arithmetic, but you may want to study more advanced concepts. This is especially important if you are developing complex simulations or other algorithm-heavy programs. For most day-to-day programming, you don't need much advanced math. Studying logic, especially computer logic, can help you understand how best to approach complex problem solving for more advanced programs.

, There is a popular theory that becoming an expert takes at least 10,000 hours of practice. While this is up for debate, the general principle remains true: mastery takes time and dedication. Don't expect to know everything overnight, but if you stay focused and continue to learn, you may very well end up an expert in your field., While you can certainly get by with mastering one language, many programmers help their chances of success in the field by learning multiple languages. Their second or third languages are usually complementary to their first one, allowing them to develop more complex and interesting programs. Once you have a good grasp on your first program, it may be time to start learning a new one.


You will likely find that learning your second language goes much quicker than the first. Many core concepts of programming carry over across languages, especially if the languages are closely related.

, While not strictly necessary, a four year program at a college or university can expose you to a variety of different languages, as well as help you network with professionals and other students. This method certainly isn't for everyone, and plenty of successful programmers never attended a four-year institution.

, As you create programs and expand your knowledge, make sure that all of your best work is saved in a portfolio. You can show this portfolio to recruiters and interviewers as an example of the work you do. Make sure to include any work done on your own time, and ensure that you are allowed to include any work done with another company.

, There is a very large freelance market for programmers, especially mobile app developers. Take on a few small freelance jobs to get a feel for how commercial programming works. Oftentimes you can use the freelance jobs to help build your portfolio and point to published work.

, You don't have to work for a company to make money programming. If you have the skills, you can develop software yourself and release it for purchase, either through your own website or through another marketplace. be prepared to be able to provide support for any software you release for commercial sale, as customers will expect their purchase to work.


Freeware is a popular way to distribute small programs and utilities. The developer doesn't receive any money, but it's a great way to build name recognition and make yourself visible in the community.

Gather your supplies.,
Download SD formatter from https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/eula_windows/index.html.,Plug your MicroSD card into an external computer that has internet access.,
Go to https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/ and download the zip file.,
Plug the MicroSD card into the slot your Raspberry Pi.,
Hook up your cables up for video, to your Raspberry Pi now.,
Set up your internet access.,
Set up a mouse and keyboard to manipulate the Kodi interface.,
Plug your micro USB into the slot to turn on your Raspberry Pi.,
Wait for the system to load.,
Uncheck Raspbian.It is not needed and will take up more space then needed to on your MicroSD card.,
Copy the movies or media from where you store them to a removable device (a USB) then place the USB into one empty slots into the Raspberry Pi.

,
Scroll to the left and go to the tab “System”.,Pick and choose your favorite TV shows, movies or media and enjoy",How to Install OpenELEC on a Raspberry Pi," Assuming that you already have your Raspberry Pi, you will have to get a Micro SD card (depending on what version of Raspberry Pi you have).The ‘class’ of micro SD card you will get is based on what you are using it for; the higher the class will result in the speed that is outputted. A class 10 MicroSD will result in 48mb/s. For space or size, some things are a given that you will have to hold your operating system (which is not a lot of space), so if you are just using it for basic computing tasks then an 8 GB is recommended.
You will need a micro USB to power your Raspberry Pi, it needs to at least be 5v powers supply (power block) and it is always a good idea to have a good quality micro USB cable, remember your powering a whole computer; not just a tablet in sleep mode.;
, When the download is finished install the SD formatter and run the program. Make a new volume, make the size the whole SD card and format it. After the download is finished, then unzip the files and place them inside your MicroSD.,, Unzip the file and place the contents of the folder onto the MicroSD card., It is located on the underside on the motherboard. When you place the MicroSD card into slot it will click when it reaches the ideal place., You have some choices, for video you can use the black video cable to hook up older style TVs. There is also a HDMI port for newer style TVs and also if you get a HDMI to DVI-D you can hook it up to almost every style of monitor., Internet access is not required to use the Raspberry Pi but to install Kodi you will need to have internet access. As of the current version there isn’t a Wi-Fi adapter on the Raspberry Pi. It does have a gigabyte Ethernet port though.

Also there is a Wi-Fi dongle that is available for the Raspberry Pi but it does not come with the actual computer unless you have purchased the starter pack off of the website.

, The best scenario is to use a wireless mouse and keyboard because the raspberry pi does not have a lot of power running to it. Because of this, flashy high power consumption gaming mice and keyboards should not be used. Wireless works best because it’s not powered by the actual computer they have batteries or some other power solution running them., There is no switch to flip in on or off., The screen should flash with a spectrum of colour and then you should see the Raspberry Pi logo followed by a small box asking you what operating system you would like to install. If the internet is not plugged in or active then there will only be two options. If it is working then you should see a lot of options for operating system., The only thing you should have checked will be OpenELEC_Pi2. Do NOT pick OpenELEC_Pi1; this is the older version and may not be compatible.

What is your default host triple?
What default toolchain should be used? Here, you can choose between stable, beta and nightly.
Should the PATH variable be modified? If you choose yes, Rust will be added to the PATH automatically, thus eliminating the need to do so yourself.
By pressing enter, you can skip a question and leave it with its default value.

, After the installation is finished, you will be presented with the message ""Rust is installed now. Great!"". This will tell you if the installation was successful., To test to see if your Rust installation was successful, open your terminal and type rustc -V. This command should print out the version of rustc you are using. If you get an error stating that the command was not found, you may need to add the Cargo bin directory to the PATH manually. This folder should be located at ~/.cargo/bin on Linux systems., As a final test, attempt to create a new Rust project using Rusts package manager, Cargo. To do this, run cargo new --bin in your terminal. If all goes well, you should have a new directory with the specified name containing a configuration file and a directory titled ""src"", proving everything is working as it should."

Identify the data that you want to work with.,Refine and decide the programming language that you will be using.,
Decide whether you will need to use a one-dimensional array or a two-dimensional array.,
Understand that a one-dimensional array has an index and an element.,
Declare the array first, just as you would with any variable.,
Initialize the array.,
If you want to have access to each array in order, then you could create and use a loop to do so to prevent repetitive and unnecessary code.",How to Initialize an Array," Do you want to read in sixteen pupil's names? Use five duplicates? Arrays make it so that you don't have repetitive code because you'll be setting several data values into a single variable, instead of assigning each individual data value an individual variable, which in turn makes for efficient coding.,, Two-dimensional arrays are best suited for ""tables of data"", which are of the same type e.g. measurement conversions may be best suited to be stored in a two-dimensional array called ""conversions."" You could think of it like a graph that has a ""Y-axis"" and an ""X-axis""., A single element contains one data item and the index is a number that refers to an array element e.g. ""Steve"" could be an element written in the second index.
, With one-dimensional arrays, only the top boundary needs to be mentioned when you declare it. In that sense, you'll need to mention that, for example, you want to read in '8' data values, which are names of car manufacturers for an example. Therefore, you will need an array of '7' because the array's index starts at '0'i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are eight individual values., This can be done in the same statement that it has been declared in, and the elements can be assigned one at a time.  This is an example in ""Pascal code"":

Var Car: array of string=('Honda', 'Bentley', 'Mercedes-Benz', 'Peugeot', 'BMW', 'Renault', 'Toyota', 'Nissan');   **this declares the array index**

Car:= 'Honda'; **this assigns the array element**
Car:= 'Bentley'; 
Car:= 'Mercedes-Benz'; 
Car:= 'Peugeot';
.. and so on and so fourth.



, This is another example, this time in ""Visual Basic 2005 code"" for a ""console application"":

Dim Car() As String = {""Honda"", ""Bentley"", ""Mercedes-Benz"", ""Peugeot"", ""BMW"", ""Renault"", ""Toyota"", ""Nissan""}**declares the array elements as alphabetical characters**

Dim Index as Integer**declares the array index as a 'whole number'
For Index = 0 to 7**start of the conditional loop, also states the size of the array**
Next
For Index = 7 to 0 Step -1

Console.Writeline(Name(Index))

Analyze the problem clearly.,
Think twice about how to solve that problem.

,
Gather complete requirements.,
Write a thorough implementation plan (or model).,
Comment your code liberally.,
Use consistent naming conventions for variables.,
Organize your code.,
Test everything.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Be prepared for change.,
Start simple and work towards complexity.",How to Improve your Skills as a Programmer,";
,, Take the time to write down what goals the end product needs to achieve, and who your user base will be. Clarity of thought at this stage will save a lot of time down the line.

,


For something small and self-contained, this might be just a basic flowchart or a simple equation.
For larger projects, it helps to break the job into modules, and to consider the following:

What task each module must perform
How data gets passed between modules
How the data will be used within each module


Although gathering and planning requirements can be tedious and much less fun than diving straight into coding, it is even more tedious to spend hours debugging. Take the time to design the flow and structure of your program correctly up front, and you may even spot more efficient ways of accomplishing your goals before you write the first line of code!

, If you think that your code might need explanation, comment it. Each function should be preceded by 1-2 lines describing the arguments and what it returns. Comments should tell you why more often than what. Remember to update the comments when you update your code!

, It will help you keep track of each type of variable, and also what that variable's purpose is. This means more typing than simply x = a + b * c, but it will make your code much easier to debug and maintain. One popular convention is Hungarian notation, where the variable name is prefixed with its type. For example, for integer variables you might use intRowCounter; strings might use strUserName. It doesn't matter what your naming convention is, but be sure that it is consistent and that your variable names are descriptive. (See Warnings below).

, Use visual structures to indicate code structure. For example, indent a code block that sits within a conditional (if,else,...) or a loop (for,while,...) Also try putting spaces between a variable name and an operator such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and even the equal sign (myVariable = 2 + 2). As well as making the code more visually elegant, it makes it much easier to see the program flow at a glance. (See tips on Indentation below).

, Start by testing each module on it's own, using inputs and values that you would typically expect. Then try inputs that are possible but less common. This will flush out any hidden bugs. There is an art to testing, and you will gradually build up your skills with practice. Write your tests to include the following cases:


Extremes: Zero and beyond the expected maximum for positive numeric values, empty string for text values, and null for every parameter.
Meaningless values. Even if you don't believe your end user would input gibberish, test your software against it anyway.
Incorrect values. Use zero for a value that will be used in division, or a negative number when positive is expected or when a square root will be calculated. Something that is not a number when the input type is a string, and it will be parsed for numeric value.

, Programming is not a stagnant discipline. There's always something new to learn, and - perhaps more importantly - always something old to relearn.

, In a realistic working environment, requirements change. However, the clearer you are at the start about the requirements, and the clearer your implementation plan is at the outset, the less likely it is that changes will be the result of poor planning or misunderstandings.


You can take an active role in improving the clarity of the process by presenting your requirements documentation or your implementation plan well before beginning to code. This will help to ensure that what you are planning to create is actually what's been asked for.
Structure the project as a series of milestones with a demo for each block, and manage the process one milestone at a time. The fewer things you need to think about at any given moment, the more likely it is that you will think clearly.

, When programming something complex, it helps to get the simpler building blocks in place and working properly first. For example, let's say you want to create an evolving shape on screen that follows the mouse direction, and changes shape depending on mouse speed.


Start by displaying a square and getting it to follow the mouse; i.e., solve movement tracking alone, first.
Next, make the size of the square relate to mouse speed; i.e., solve speed-to-shape tracking on its own.
Finally, create the actual shapes you want to work with and put the three components together.
This approach naturally lends itself to modular code writing, where each component is in its own self-contained block. This is very useful for code reuse (e.g. you want to just use the mouse tracking in a new project), and makes for much easier debugging and maintenance.

, But often it is published somewhere. Place the URI of the documentation for the algorithm in the comment section for the code. If the URI points to a location that is ephemeral, then copy the information somewhere where the code maintainer can find it.

, Provide a file if possible that tools can open to incorporate the correct settings. As an example Eclipse defaults to using tabs, but tabs are rendered differently on different text editors. Using white space instead of tabs may be preferable but having a file that provides the proper settings for a project.

, Skip lines between code that does different things, and use spaces after semicolons and commas. This will make your code look cleaner and easier to read.

, This makes it so that it's obvious that a chunk of code is separate from another. This can help when writing a long method. Indenting inside if statements and loops will make it easy to read. This technique is called nesting, that is it shows a chunk of code is ""nested"" within another chunk of code, and allows the reader to easily follow the nesting pattern.

, Assume the person reading your code knows nothing about what it's supposed to do. Your comments should explain every step of the way. All of your advanced, confusing, or complicated algorithms should be well commented. Also, try to describe what purpose the code has. For example, instead of writing ""add one to variable,"" say why this is important in the code, as anyone can see it is incrementing the variable, e.g ""increment the number of page hits by 1"".

, Objects should either reference the domain of the problem or standard software artifacts. A List is a List. You may have to create a Customer List which subclasses or implements a List. Variables and function parameters should have descriptive names.

, This tells people who to go to to service the code.

, Write comments to indicate your intent. Over commenting your code will lead to someone deleting your comments.

Make sure you want to do it.,
Find contributors beforehand.,
Pick an existing and approved Open Source license for your project.,
Get hosting.,
Set up a version control system where you store all the codes.,
Do the releases from time to time.,
State that your project is ""Open Source"" and which license it is.,
Set the ""write"" right on the source version control to default as it is on a wiki.,
Don't do all the work yourself.,
Avoid private communications on the developments.,
Make your project known.,
Raise funds offering paid documentation and support.

,
Have someone to carry on the project.",How to Have a Successful Open Source Project," Setting up a new project is easy, but making it running as needed (user feedback, bug reports, requests for enhancement, contribution from other developers) needs a considerable amount of initial contribution of the working code from your side. If all you want is to become a free software hacker, it may be simpler to join an existing project. Think twice.;
, Don't start alone It is easier to find contributors before starting than once the project is created. The reason is that if the project already exists, they will not feel like they own the project. Start discussions on blogs and forums and meet people first.

, Don't try to invent your own Open Source license. Most developers know what ""GPL"", ""LGPL"" ""BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)"" and ""Apache"" mean, what they can do with such code and what they are not allowed to do. License is a complex document and nobody wants to hire a lawyer just to understand all possible interpretations. If the license is written by a person without legal education, it may have unexpected and undesirable interpretations of it.

, It is relatively easy to get free hosting for an Open Source project (SourceForge, Object Web and others). Use this opportunity: this not just saves money, but also puts your project into a place where people are likely to search for Open Source projects.

, Do not skip this step even if you initially work alone.

, During intensive development, the code on the CVS (Concurrent Versions System) does not always stay in a ""ready for production use"" state.

, Although this seems like a very simple thing, it is the most overlooked. Remember that people will only view your project for a few seconds before deciding whether to download it.

, Although you will have to rollback vandalism, it will help you to find new contributors. There are tools like the SVN hooks to automatically filter flooding. You can protect some important code and ban the bad contributors.

, If you have a community going and someone informs you of a bug, ask the community if they would like to fix it.

, Members of the community will think that you are trying to keep them out of the loop.

, Submit your project on blogs and forums. Efficient keywords to search such blogs are: ""(subject) submit site"", ""submit a site"", ""submit your site"", or ""site submission""; (subject) is the subject of your project.

,, One day, you will get bored with your project. Think about who will maintain the project for you in the future.

Know a few things about MATLAB.,
Open MATLAB.,
Create a new Function file.,
Set up your Function file.,
Set up your data.,
Now set up your graph.,
Make sure the final line in your function file is ""end"" and save your file.,
Execute the function.,
View the results.",How to Graph in MATLAB,"



Semi-colon Operator: If a command is followed by a ';' then the output will not be printed on the screen. This is trivial when the output is a short assignment, like y = 1, but becomes problematic if a large matrix is created. Also, any time that an output is desired, like a graph, the semicolon should be omitted.

Clear Command: There are a few useful command window commands. Typing “clear” in the command window after the >> prompt will clear all current variables, which can help if you're seeing unusual output. You can also type “clear” followed by a variable name to clear only the data for that specific variable.

Variable Types: The only type of variable in MATLAB is an array. This means that variables are stored as lists of numbers, with the most basic list containing only one number. In the case of MATLAB, array size does not need to be specified when the variable is created. To set a variable to a single number, simply type something like z =1. If you then wanted to add on to z, you could simply state z= 3. You can then reference the number stored at any position in the vector by typing z, where “i” is the Fifth position in the vector. So if you wanted to get the value 3 from the z example, you would simply type z.

Loops: Loops are used when you want to perform an action multiple times. There are two types of loops common in MATLAB, the for loop and the while loop. Both can typically be used interchangeably, but it is easier to create an infinite while loop than an infinite for loop. You can tell if you have made an infinite loop by the fact that your computer will simply sit there, not outputting anything except what is inside the loop.

For Loops: For loops in MATLAB take the form of: ""for i = 1:n / do stuff / end"" (the forward slash indicates a line break). This loop means “do stuff” n times. So if this printed “Hello” every time it went through the loop, and n was 5, then it would print “Hello” five times.

While Loops: While loops in MATLAB take the form of: ""while statement is true / do stuff / end"". This loop means “do stuff” while the statement is true. Usually the “do stuff” portion has some part that will eventually make the statement false. To make a while loop look like the for loop above, you'd type ""while i<=n / do stuff / end"".

Nested Loops: Nested loops are when a loop is inside of another loop. This looks something like ""for i = 1:5 / for j = 1:5 / do stuff / end / end"". This would do stuff 5 times for j, then increment i, do stuff 5 times for j, increment i, and so on.

, The window should look like this:

, You do not need to complete this step if you are simply plotting a basic function like y = sin(x). If this is the case, skip to step 4. To create a function file, simply select New from the File menu, then select Function from the drop down menu. You should get a window that looks like the following. This is the window where you will write your functions.

, Delete the portion and the ""="" sign. These are only necessary if you want an output value, which isn't necessary for graphing. Change the ""Untitled"" part to whatever you want your function to be called. Insert a variable name instead of ""input args."" I will use ""n"" as the input argument from here onward. You'll use this variable to tell the program how many data points you want. Your code should look something like: You can either delete the parts after the % signs or leave them in, it's up to you, since anything following a '%' is considered to be a comment, and will be ignored by the computer when your function is executed.

, This step can be achieved in one of a few ways depending on what type of data you want to graph. If you want to plot a simple function like y = sin(x), use the simple method. If you have a set of data that is plotted against an increasing x value, such as (1, y1), (2, y2),...(n, yn) but want to use a variable number of points, then use the vector method. If you want to generate a list of points with 3 variables instead of 2, then the matrix method will be most useful.



Simple Method: Decide on the range of x you want to use for your independent variables and by how much you want it to step each time. For example, "">>x = 0 : (pi/100) : (2*pi);"" will set x to a list of values from 0 to 2*Pi with intervals of Pi/100. The middle part is optional and will default to intervals of 1 if it is left out (i.e. x = 1:10 will assign the numbers 1,2,3,...10 to x). Type your function on the command line in the command window. It will look something like "">> y = sin(x);""

Vector Method: Set up a for loop to place values into a vector. Vector assignments in MATLAB follow the form x(i) = 2, where “i” is any number greater than, but not including, zero. You can also reference parts of the vector that already have a value, like x(3) = x(2) + x(1). See the loops section of tips for help with loops. Keep in mind, n is the number you will use to determine the number of data points. Example:

Matrix Method: Set up two nested loops, meaning one loop within the other. The first loop should control your x values while the second loop should control your y values. Hitting tab before the second loop can help keep track of which loop is active at which point. Type your equation inside the second loop, which will be the values given to z. Matrix assignments follow the form x(i,j) = 4, where “i” and “j” are any two numbers greater than zero. Keep in mind, n is the number you will use to determine the number of data points. Example:

,



Simple and Vector Methods: Type plot(x) after your for loop if you used the vector method. If you used the simple method, type plot(x,y) and hit enter, then skip to step 8. The general form of the plot function is plot(x,y) where x and y are lists of numbers. Typing plot(z) will plot the values of z against a list of 1,2,3,4,5, etc.. You can choose the color of the points, the type of line used, and the shape of points used by adding a string following the arguments of plot. This would look something like plot(x,y,'r-p'). In this case, the 'r' would make the line red, the '-' would make a straight line between the points, and the 'p' will make the points appear as stars. The formatting must be enclosed with apostrophes.


Matrix Method: Type mesh(x) after your nested for loops. Make sure you do not add a semi-colon after the mesh or plot statements.

, Skip this step if you used the simple method. Examples of final code for the vector and matrix methods are below.



Vector Method:

Matrix Method:

, This is done by typing name(n) into the command window, where ""name"" is the name of your function and ""n"" is the number of points you want. Example: "">>FibGraph(8)"".

, A window should open with your graph.

MP4 is the most playable format, so it is always selected by default in the Output Settings. If you plan on uploading the video to YouTube or other streaming service, check the box labeled “Web Optimized”
If you are encoding the video to watch on a computer or upload to YouTube, select the Normal or High Profile presets.

, You can click the Preview button to watch a small clip of the video you are encoding. This will let you check the quality before you commit to a long project. Encoding can be a time consuming process, especially if you are encoding high quality video. The preview may take a few moments to create.

, If you are unhappy with the results, you can use the tabs on the bottom to adjust your settings. Each tab relates to a specific aspect of the video.Picture: This will allow you to change the resolution of the video, as well as crop out unwanted edges such as black bars.
Filters: These filters can affect the playback of the video. They can remove layers that make a video look obviously filmed.
Video: This tab lets you change the codec of the video, as well as quality options such as frame rate and video optimization. One of the most important settings on this tab is the Quality section. Here you can adjust the bit rate of the finished file. Higher bit rate files are higher quality but much larger than lower bit rates.
Audio: The Audio tab allows you to adjust the settings for each audio track found in the source video. You can remove unwanted tracks (such as other languages), or adjust the quality of the audio independent from the quality of the video.
Subtitles: This tab will allow you to add subtitle files to videos. These files are usually found with the original video file.
Chapters: You can see the list of chapters in your video file here. These are most typically found in DVD images. You can import custom channel files as well.
Advanced. This tab is usually disabled, and can be enabled by checking the box in the Video tab. This tab will give you much more control over the x264 codec.
Changing preset settings may make the video unplayable in your chosen device. This is especially true if you change the frame rate or the picture size.

, If you have multiple files that you need to encode, click the Add To Queue button after you are finished with your project settings. This will add the project to the list of videos that will be encoded when you start.


You can click the Show Queue button to display a list of the projects you have lined up.

, Click the green Start button to begin encoding the video files in your queue. Encoding will take a significant amount of time, as well as a lot of system resources. Using your computer during encoding will slow the process down and may cause errors in the final product.

, Once you have finished encoding the video, transfer it to your device or open it on your computer. Make sure that the quality suits you, and that there are no errors.

, This will blur the entire image; you’ll work backwards from here.


Play around with different blur radii to create the background effect you want. The larger the radius, the blurrier the image, so if you’re going for a subtle effect, aim low. For example, if you want the background to be very soft and only somewhat identifiable, try a radius of 10. If you want your background just barely blurred, use a radius of .5 or 1.
Make sure you’re working on the top layer when you add the blur.

, Since the original layer is still intact beneath the blurred one, using the eraser tool on your top layer will expose the clear image underneath.


Select the Eraser tool from the toolbar to the left.
Adjust the eraser size as you go. For larger swaths, use a large eraser; for details and edges, use a smaller, more precise eraser.
Adjust the eraser opacity as you go. For large, interior areas, use a high opacity to erase as thoroughly as possible; for edges, lower the opacity to create a softer, subtle effect. Running a low-opacity eraser over the same place multiple times will have a cumulative effect, so err on the side of low opacity where necessary.

If the image you want to emphasize has very straight edges, right-click to change the lasso to Polygonal, which will create straight lines between the points you click.
If there’s a sharp, clear edge between the background and the image you want to emphasize, change the lasso to Magnetic, which will find the edge for you.

, Feathering your edges will make them softer and subtle – and much more forgiving.

, This will help you freehand-select more accurately.

, Be sure to “close the circle” by ending up back where you started and clicking on your origin point. You’ll know your selection is complete once a dotted “marquee” line appears around the edges.


Make sure you’re working on the top layer when you lasso.
To add to an already-completed selection, hold down the Shift key while you continue to select. This is a great way to either modify your current selection or simultaneously select a separate subject.
To subtract from an already-completed selection, hold town the Alt key and select the area you wish to remove, which will then become unselected.

,, This will create a new layer on top of your original one.


Usually, this will paste the copied image directly on top of the original one, which means it might not look like anything has changed. Look at your Layers tab (usually in the bottom right-hand corner) to see if a new layer has appeared.
If this ""Layers"" toolbar is not visible in Photoshop, go to Window and select in Layers the drop-down list.
If necessary, use the Move tool, which looks like a cursor arrow, to drag the newly-pasted foreground on top of the existing image so that they match.

, This is found in the Layers toolbar.

, This will blur the background but not the duplicated image of the subject.


Repeat this Blur More command until you achieve the desired effect. In Photoshop, the Ctrl-F keyboard shortcut will repeat the last filter command.
Alternately, use Gaussian Blur and play around with different blur radii to create the background effect you want. The larger the radius, the blurrier the image, so if you’re going for a subtle effect, aim low. For example, if you want the background to be very soft and only somewhat identifiable, try a radius of 10. If you want your background just barely blurred, use a radius of .5 or 1.

, The easiest way to do this is to look at the History toolbar and undo some of your Blur More commands. Alternately, changing how your layers combine can produce nice effects. To do this:


Try changing the newly copied foreground layer's Opacity. This is visible in the Layers toolbar. A good opacity level to start at is 50%; move up a little at a time until you find a good blend.
Try changing how the layer combines with other layers by changing its property, also available in the Layers toolbar. For example, try Darken instead of Normal for an artistic sketch effect.

, This should be on the same toolbar as the Lasso Tool.


Set the blur tool's strength to somewhere around 33%.
Set your brush size to a comfortable level such as a radius of 5 to 15 pixels. If you don't see a brush size option, select Brushes from the Window menu in Photoshop.
Use the blur tool to touch up the outside edge of your foreground, especially where the image seems pixelated. This will help to create a sense of transition between your foreground and background that is easy on the eyes.

, This will combine your various layers into one.

, Since the original layer is still intact beneath the blurred one, using the eraser tool on your top layer will expose the clear image underneath.


Select the Eraser tool from the toolbar to the left.
Adjust the eraser size as you go. For larger swaths, use a large eraser; for details and edges, use a smaller, more precise eraser.
Adjust the eraser opacity as you go. For large, interior areas, use a high opacity to erase as thoroughly as possible; for edges, lower the opacity to create a softer, subtle effect. Running a low-opacity eraser over the same place multiple times will have a cumulative effect, so err on the side of low opacity where necessary.

Consider setting your camera to a smaller quality setting.,
Set your white balance manually.,
Stop your lens down a little.,
Take a test shot to get the exposure right, if you're on a digital camera.,
Hit your auto-exposure lock, if you have such a thing.,
Take your photos.",How to Create a Panoramic Photo Using Hugin1," Remember that your final image may be many times as large, in each dimension, as a normal image from your camera. Unless you're doing enormous prints (and/or you have near-unlimited processing power, disk space and memory) you don't need to set it to the largest picture it can take (although you may want to not use much JPEG compression, if you possibly can).
, Many cameras (including the ancient Canon D30, used to take the photographs for this article) do not lock their automatic white balance between shots, and have no provision for doing so, even when using auto-exposure lock (see below). Your camera may well decide on a different white balance for different parts of your panorama; consequently, you can easily end up with several photos, with very different white balances, which are a pain to correct in software later on.
So don't use ""Auto"" white balance. Read your camera's manual to figure out how to set it yourself; on some compacts, this may be buried under ""scene mode""-type settings. Don't worry about this if you're shooting film, of course. (You could, of course, shoot in raw and set the white balance when you convert to some more sane format.)
, Most—possibly all—camera lenses exhibit some kind of light fall-off towards the corners, or ""vignetting"", when shot wide-open (there will be some at nearly any aperture, but it is worse when the lens is wide-open). This is especially visible if you're shooting 35mm film or a full-frame digital SLR. Hugin can accommodate for this, to an extent, but it's best to eliminate it entirely.
If conditions permit, try using an aperture one or two stops smaller than wide-open. This has the added advantage that lenses are usually somewhat sharper stopped down, too; it'll help Hugin find the common points between them much easier. (If you don't understand any of this, don't worry about it too much; just fix the vignetting in software later on if you're good with Photoshop and friends.)
, Check your LCD for a correct exposure. As ever with digital cameras: if in doubt, underexpose. You can pull shadow detail out later if you need to, but you can never recover a blown highlight., On Canon cameras, this is the button marked with an asterisk on the back. This will prevent your photos being very differently exposed between shots. Hugin will blend them in such a way that it won't be quite as noticeable, but it's still a good idea nonetheless. (If you're weird, you might like the effect that comes from not using your AE lock; have fun if this is your sort of thing.)
, Remember that Hugin can deal with as many shots as you care to give it, in both directions (up and down). The most important thing is to leave a substantial degree of overlap between shots, perhaps as much as a third. Also be wary of large, blank areas of sky; Hugin may fail to automatically discern common points (""control points"") between the two shots. If you want to be quite pedantic, use a panoramic tripod head; otherwise, ensure that when you rotate your camera, that you do so around the front nodal point. To quote Paul van Walree,
To preserve the perspective during rotation, which prevents a displacement of nearby objects relative to the background (parallax), the axis of rotation should pass through the entrance pupil the position of the entrance pupil can be approximately found by visual inspection. When you look into a lens from the front, the entrance pupil is the image of the diaphragm opening."
"
Open Hugin and Hit the ""Load images"" button.,
Enter your focal length and FOV crop, if needs be.,
Hit ""Align"".,
Check the fit.,
Delete any stray control points.,
Add some control points.,
Go back to the ""Assistant tab"" and hit ""Align"".,
Optimize your panorama.,
Set your stitching settings.,
Hit the ""Stitch now!"",
Go away from your computer for a while.",How to Create a Panoramic Photo Using Hugin2," Select the photos that you took earlier. Hit ""OK"", and wait.
, If you shot this on digital, and intervening software did not strip the EXIF data from your pictures, it should determine this automatically, so don't worry about it too much (in our example, it was shot on a Canon camera fitted with a 29mm manual-focus M42 lens, so it had to be entered manually).
Remember to enter your real focal length and the crop factor of your sensor, not the 35mm equivalent focal length (you can find these out easily enough by a web search). If you shot on 35mm film, then just enter your focal length, and set the multiplier to 1. Divide 35 by the width of your film in millimeters to get the focal length multiplier for other formats.
, The window which comes up is a keypoint generator; it's attempting to find common points between your photos in order to skew them and join them properly. After this, a window will pop up showing you a crudely stitched version of your picture. (Don't worry about the rough edges in this window; the stitching engine will smooth it all out later on.), In the main Hugin window, it will say something like ""Mean error after optimization..."". Look immediately below that. If it says ""very good fit"", or perhaps merely ""good fit"", then you're ready to stitch your photos, and can ignore the next three steps.




, One cause of poorly aligned images is Hugin finding common points between images where none exist. Find these spurious control points and delete them. The control points will be marked with circles. Click once in the center of one, then hit the ""Delete"" button in the lower pane (by default, on Linux at least, this bottom pane is made too small, so you might want to make it larger)., Go to the ""Control Points"" tab. You'll notice that there are two pairs of tabs, numbered. These are the numbers of your photos. Make sure that on both the left and right, you have two different images selected, with some shared point between them. Click on one on the left, then in the identical place on one on the right (see the picture to the right for an example).
Hugin will, by default, automatically fine tune them, so don't worry about being too precise (though it's best to zoom in to 100%, from the drop-down menu on the bottom pane, so that Hugin doesn't need to guess quite so much). Click the ""Add"" button in the lower pane. Add as many as you wish, and repeat this process for each common area between all images.
, If you don't get the desired effect (""very good fit"" or perhaps ""good fit""), repeat the above two steps, and this one, until you get it right. Try more control points, further apart. Once the alignment is right, you might want to hit the ""Straighten"" button in the ""Panorama preview"" window., There is a button on the toolbar to do this; see picture at right. Press it. You can also do this by going to the ""Optimizer"" tab; this will give you finer-grained control over what will be optimized.
, Go to the ""Stitcher"" tab and hit ""Calculate Optimal Size""; this will make your resulting file as big as it should be. Set ""Stitching engine"" to ""nona""; this usually has great results, though doesn't permit outputting PSD files (which may or may not be useful to you), or anything but TIFF files. Set ""image format"" to ""TIFF"".
You may want to use ""multilayer TIFF"" if you ignored the white balance and exposure-locking advice above; this will allow you to correct exposure and white balance individually if your software handles them well (GIMP, at least, does). Alas, this means you'll have to blend each photo into the others, manually, with layer masks. Good luck.

Save your photo in some saner-than-TIFF format (like JPEG).",How to Create a Panoramic Photo Using Hugin3," GIMP or Photoshop, or anything else that can handle huge TIFF files and have a crop tool, will be fine., In the default nona stitcher, with the default TIFF output, you'll end up with large, transparent areas left over from where Hugin had stretched it. Crop all the transparent areas out.
Actually, you should be ruthless about cropping everything; anything that doesn't add to your photo should be removed from it.
, Again, if you ignored the advice about white balance and exposure locking, you'll need to correct this. Our photo didn't need this, but did need a kick up with the colour; exactly how this was done is detailed in How to Make Skies Beautiful with GIMP.

Beware of email messages purporting to come from iTunes.,
Do not click on any link from the email.,
Keep a regular eye on your credit card and PayPal statements.,
Avoid purchasing low-cost iTunes gift vouchers or codes, especially from individuals on online auction or trading sites.,
Consider using a special credit or debit card with a low limit, just for iTunes.,
If your teens have access to an iTunes account, talk to them to make sure they know how to respond with caution.,
React swiftly if you do fall prey to a scam.",How to Avoid Phishing Scams when Using iTunes," While some iTunes emails are legitimate (the weekly music updates, etc.), you can be suspicious the moment these emails begin to contain messages about ""problems"" with your iTunes account.


Look for poor spelling or grammar, or a number of spelling errors, demanding language (e.g., ""you should... or else""), and anything that strikes you as out of the ordinary. Trust your instincts.;
, If there is a need to check out something, go to the iTunes site using your bookmark or through a search, then start looking for the supposed link on the iTunes site. It will be very unlikely that it is there, in which case, you'll quickly realize that you have sidestepped a scam.


Always look at the the URL in the body of the email if it is available. That should tell you a lot. If there is only a hyperlink, do not click on it under any circumstances. Hover over it, and in a bottem-left (sometimes right) corner it will show you the URL.

, Check them online regularly for any unauthorized transactions to iTunes. If you spot anything unusual, respond quickly (see what to do below). It is a good idea to check more regularly than looking at your once-a-month statement if you are using online electronic transactions, whether it's iTunes, or any other online stores.

, If they're too cheap to be true, trust that there is something fishy going on. Some low-cost codes have expiry times within 24 hours – surely that should send up your radar that someone is trying to get something out of you!, That way, if it's compromised, you won't lose an enormous amount.


Alternatively, if you like getting rewards on your credit card purchases, go to a store where they sell iTunes gift vouchers, buy them up on your credit card (double bonus if you get other reward points for shopping at that store), then use the vouchers for downloading. This approach might be slightly more effort but it does offer you a good buffer from phishing scams, provided you do not succumb to passing around any passwords!






For more information, see wikiHow's article Redeem an iTunes Gift Card.



, If they are not sure, suggest they wait until you are free to check out the issue.

, Unless advised by a media release or appropriate adviser, avoid contacting Apple as it is not likely to speed up the process of recouping your lost costs, and Apple will usually only tell you it's your personal responsibility. Instead:


Contact your financial institution immediately and ask for a hold to be placed on your credit card.
Contact Paypal if relevant.
In both cases, ask if chargeback is available, to recoup your losses.
Change your iTunes password immediately. If you have used the same password for anything else, change those as well.

"
Decide on the initial theme.,
Brainstorm about the things that you would like to cover in relation to your theme or subject matter.,
Go over your list of ideas and either expand or contract.,
Speak to what you know best.,
Ask your listeners for ideas.,
Look around at other podcasts, websites, books, magazines, and so forth related to your theme or subject area.",How to Get Ideas or Topics for a Podcast," It's important to keep the podcast theme or subject matter focused, to avoid trying to cover too many areas. For example, if your podcast is about cats, don't roam over and talk about dogs. Or, if your podcast is about dancing, don't start going into the intricacies of singing. If you like more than one area, try to run simultaneous podcasts instead. That said, it is perfectly okay to make comparisons, indeed that could make up an entire podcast session of its own.


If you have a really broad subject matter, such as ""Crazy but true things in science"", clearly you'll have a lot of leeway compared to ""Caring for newts in a temperate climate"". Use your common sense about how widely you roam within your subject matter.;
, Come up with a list of possible things that you'd like to talk about for at least 6 shows in a row. Having a few ideas ahead of the current podcast will help to orientate you and keep your content fresh, and it also stops you from trying to cram in too much information into any one podcast. It's also just a good idea to have a plan. Here is a sample plan for All About Dogs:



Podcast 1: Introduction to the podcast theme, who you are and why you want to discuss dogs, including your expertise. General information about dogs and the perhaps a rundown of future podcast content. After that's out of the way, commence with a small but interesting discussion on dogs.

Podcast 2: Keeping dogs healthy on a nutritious diet. Discussion of the things that are good for dogs, the foods that are bad and things that are toxic for dogs. Ideas for making healthy dog treats. Ways to include enrichment when eating

Podcast 3: Keeping dogs healthy body-wise. Shifting focus away from food onto common dog conditions, disorders and diseases. Noticing basic symptoms of some of the more dangerous and possible diseases, conditions and what to do. How to talk to your vet about dog health.

Podcast 4: Playing with dogs. Finding suitable games and toys for dogs. Ways in which human owners can interact effectively with dogs to ensure they are getting enough play time and enrichment. Making dog toys yourself.

Podcast 5: Exercising dogs. Ways to effectively get dogs into good shape and keep them that way. Exercises that the the human and dog will both benefit from. Keeping safe when exercising at night. Good places to take your dog for exercises.

Podcast 6: Going on vacation with your dog. How to transport your dog, what things to take and where to go. Things you can do together while on vacation. Dangers to be alert to.

, In some cases, you may find you've tried to fit too much into a show, and it might be better broken down into a two- or three-part podcast. That's a good thing as your ideas will go a long way! In some cases, you might find you've got insufficient ideas and you'll need to keep brainstorming some more. In this case, use the existing ideas to build from.

, Do not try to be an expert about things you know nothing about. When that happens, listeners will pick it up and they'll be unimpressed. However, don't despair––this is a great opportunity to bring in an expert and interview her or him and make it easier for those ideas to come in––from someone else! Listeners will love the change of pace and the introduction of expert knowledge from someone additional.

, If you know your listeners personally or you have become well connected with your little posse of valued listeners, ask them what they would like to hear. It's good to have preferences and opinions because that way, you'll know that there are people who are interested and will listen to your Podcast. End a Podcast with an invitation to ask questions and make suggestions. From that you will glean a great deal of wonderful ideas to keep making more podcasts.


Ask family and friends for ideas too. This can be done anytime, simply outline what you're talking about in the podcast and listen to their suggestions. Write them down, to be sure to remember them.

, There will be a lot of ideas in these for you to be inspired by. Moreover, go back in time to revisit old ideas that may be useful again or worthy of revival. Don't limit yourself just to what's current, perhaps you can be at the cutting edge of making old ideas current again!

This is the only official way to transfer content from a computer to an iOS device.

, If you are connecting to a Windows PC for the first time, tap the ""Trust"" button that appears on your iOS device's screen.

, There are several prompts that may appear before you can interact with your device, depending on the state of the device and whether or not you've connected it before.


If you're connecting your iOS device to your computer for the first time, iTunes will prompt you to set the new device up. Don't worry about losing any data, this will only serve to name your device when it is plugged in in the future.
If a new iOS update is available, you'll be prompted to update before you can access your device. You can either click the Download and Update button to update your device, or you can click Cancel to do it later.

, It may take a moment for the button to become clickable. Your device's Summary page will be shown after clicking the button.

, You can sync any of your iTunes libraries to your iOS device, including Apps, Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, Books, and Photos. Clicking the tap in the left menu after selecting your device will open the sync page for that library.

, At the top of the page, you'll see a ""Sync Library"" box that you can check to enable syncing for that type of media. For example, if you select the Music tab, you'll see a ""Sync Music"" box.


If your iOS device already has media on it from another iTunes library, you will be informed that the contents of the device will be erased when you sync your current library. The only way to avoid this is to transfer your previous library to your new iTunes library.

, After enabling syncing for a library, you can choose what you want to sync from it. The options differ depending on the type of media.


Apps - You can easily move apps to and from your device by dragging them between your ""Apps"" list and your devices ""Home Screens"".
Music - You can sync your playlists, artists, albums, or entire genres.
Movies - You can select individual movies to sync, or you can use the ""Automatically include"" menu to have your device automatically sync a selection of unwatched or recent movies every time you sync.
TV Shows - Much like the Movies section, you can choose individual episodes or have iTunes automatically include certain episodes based on whether they've been recently added or have not been watched.

, This is usually caused by the movie being the improper format for your iOS device. Even if you can play the movie in iTunes, it may not work on the device you are trying to sync it to. iTunes allows you to create a new version that will work on your device.


Select the video that you want to sync to your iOS device.
Click the File (Windows) or iTunes (Mac) menu. If you don't see the File menu, press Alt.
Select ""Create New Version"" and select the device that you want to sync it with.
Wait for the conversion process to complete. Make sure to sync the new version when syncing your device.

, This is typically caused by an issue with your iOS device. The easiest way to solve this problem is to completely restore the device to its factory settings.



Click here for detailed instructions on restoring an iOS device.

, If your iOS device is having difficulty syncing a large collection of music, you may get better results by syncing incrementally. Start with one playlist or album and sync the device, then sync the next one, and so on until all of the music you want is on the device.


Another suggestion for fixing this problem is to disable music syncing, sync the device to remove all of the music on it, and then enable music syncing and select what you want to transfer as normal., You can use iTunes to make a backup of your iOS device. This will allow you to restore your device with all of its settings and data should anything ever go wrong with it.

, If you want to make CD for a roadtrip or a mixtape for a friend, you can use iTunes to burn a CD using any of the music in your library.

, Playlists allow you to create custom mixes and organize your music exactly to your liking. Playlists also make syncing the exact music you want to your iOS device much quicker.

, Tired of the ringtone on your iOS or Android device? You can use iTunes to create a ringtone from any song in your library.

, Tastes change, and you may find you don't like some of the music in your iTunes library anymore. You can easily delete songs so that they no longer appear in iTunes, or you can delete them from your computer completely.

, If you're done with iTunes, you can remove it completely from your computer by uninstalling it. You can choose to leave your preferences and library settings on your computer in case you decide to reinstall in the future.

, If you're on a PC, the icon will probably be on the Desktop. If you're on a Mac, the icon will probably be on the Dock (usually at the bottom of the screen).





, Go to Edit; Preferences; General; Import Settings. Write down your current import settings, then change the Import Using setting to MP3 Encoder and change the Setting setting to Custom. Another pop-up window will appear.





, If you are encoding in mono (e.g. for ringtones), set the Stereo Bit Rate to double the bitrate you want to encode at. Otherwise, set it to the exact bitrate you want to encode at. (See the Tips section for the correct bitrate for your purpose.)

, If you require sample rate conversion or mix-down to mono (reducing to one channel), change the Sample Rate or Channels setting respectively. Stereo Mode should be Joint Stereo. Make sure that Use Variable Bit Rate Encoding (VBR) is unchecked; some older players have problems with these files. Then click OK three times to leave the Preferences window.

, Drag a file or files into the iTunes window to add them to your library. (It might take a few seconds.) Then locate the file(s) in your iTunes library: choose View; as List and click on the Date Added heading to sort by date if you have many files already in the library (if the heading isn't already selected). (If the Date Added heading isn't there, go to View; View Options to turn it on.)

, Click on the file(s) once, and then choose Advanced; Create MP3 Version. Depending on the length of the file(s) and the speed of your computer, the encoding can happen instantaneously or it can take minutes. Once the encoding process finishes, iTunes will chime and the progress bar will disappear.

, First, immediately delete your original, unencoded file(s) from the iTunes library by choosing Edit; Delete, Remove, and then Move to Recycle Bin or Move to Trash. Now the top file(s) in your iTunes library (if you sorted by date) should be your encoded file(s). Drag the encoded file(s) out of your iTunes library and then delete the library's copy.

, If you use iTunes to store CDs on your computer or synchronize with an iPod or iPhone, this is very important. Otherwise, you could suffer from reduced sound quality (on any newly imported CDs) that is uncorrectable except if you import again with the correct settings. Also click on the Artist heading of the iTunes library if you sorted by date. This restores the iTunes behavior of playing songs alphabetically.

Use the third-party program to transfer remaining music files.",How to Transfer Music from iPhone to iTunes," iTunes is designed to transfer media to your iPhone, but it isn't really designed to go the other way. This means transferring content from your iPhone into iTunes can be difficult, especially if you're moving to a different computer. You can use iTunes to transfer any music purchases made on your iPhone, but you'll need a third-party program to extract any music files that you added from sources other than the iTunes Store.
, You'll need to make an important change to the settings before connection, so hold off on plugging the iPhone in just yet.

, You can find this in the ""Edit"" menu in Windows or the ""iTunes"" menu in OS X. If you don't see the menubar in Windows, press Alt.

, This will keep your iPhone from erasing itself when you connect it to the blank library. You can close the Preferences menu to save your changes.

, You should see it appear in the row of icons along the top of the window.

, This will start the process of transferring your purchased content to the computer.

, If you're using a computer that you haven't previously used with your iTunes account, you'll be prompted to log in and authorize it. Enter your Apple ID and password to authorize the computer to access your purchased content.

, This may take a while, especially if you've purchased a lot of content. You can monitor the progress at the top of the iTunes window.


Only purchases made on your iPhone will be transferred. You may have made iTunes purchases on another computer or a different device. These can be found by opening the Music section, selecting ""iTunes Store"", and then clicking ""Purchased"".

, If you have music files that were copied to your iPhone but that weren't purchased in iTunes, you'll need to use a third-party program in order to retrieve and copy the files. Be careful when installing third-party programs, as many free ones come bundled with adware. Popular programs include:


iPod Access
TouchCopy
iRepo/TuneJack
Senuti

, When you open the transfer program with your iPhone connected, you'll see a list of all of the songs stored on it. Select the songs you want to move to the computer and start the transfer process. This varies from program to program, but generally you simply select the files and then choose where you want to copy them to. You can then add these copied files to your iTunes library by dragging them into the iTunes window after copying them."

In order to sync purchased videos with your Android device, you will need to remove this DRM.If you're trying to add video files that weren't purchased from iTunes but aren't compatible with Android, click here to move on to the next section.;
, This method will discuss how to remove DRM from your files for free, but the process is significantly more complex than using a paid tool. Popular paid tools include:

, If you want to strip the DRM for free, you'll need to jump through a few hoops first. The best free DRM removal tool, Requiem, hasn't been updated in a few years, and won't work with any version of iTunes past 10.7. You'll need to downgrade if you have a newer version.


Uninstall all Apple software on your computer, including iTunes, iCloud, Bonjour, and any other Apple programs.
Open the iTunes Media Library folder. This can typically be found in C:\Users\Username\Music\iTunes.
Rename iTunes Library.itl to iTunes Library.bak.
Download and install iTunes. You can download the installer from Apple here.
Rename iTunes Library.bak to iTunes Library.itl to replace the newly installed Library file with your original.

, In order to run Requiem, you'll need to install the Java runtime environment. You may already have this installed.


You can download the latest version of Java here. Make sure to not allow it to install the Ask toolbar during the setup process by unchecking the box.

, You'll need to download Requiem from the community forum post here. It will download in .zip format.

, You can extract a .zip file by right-clicking on it and selecting ""Extract here"".

, Requiem will not run if iTunes is running.

, Requiem will automatically start scanning your iTunes library and remove the DRM from any DRM-protected file it finds. This process may take a while, especially for large libraries.


You can remove DRM from individual files or folders by dragging and dropping them onto the Requiem program.

, Requiem will replace the original file with the DRM-free one, and the original will be moved to the Trash or Recycle. Make sure that you test to ensure that the file plays before emptying deleting it completely.

, Videos purchased from iTunes are usually either .m4v or .mov format, neither of which will play on Android natively. You'll need to convert the video files first before syncing them with your Android device. Handbrake is a free, open-source video converter that can quickly convert any video into the proper format.


You can download Handbrake for free from handbrake.fr.
Handbrake can also be used to convert any other video format, such as .mkv, to one compatible with your Android device.

, You can find your videos files in your iTunes Media folder (usually C:\Users\Username\Music\iTunes\iTunes Media).

, Make sure you choose some place easy to find again later.

, If you don't see the Presets panel, click ""Presets"" → ""Show Preset Panel"".


These presets will automatically format the converted video to a format that is playable on your device while sacrificing as little quality as possible.

, This will add the conversion project to the Handbrake queue.

, You can continue to add videos to your conversion queue using the same process above. Make sure to click ""Add to Queue"" for each one.

, Handbrake will begin working through your conversion queue, and you will be able to monitor the progress by looking at the status bar. Converting videos can take a while, especially for full-length movies.


Handbrake will use a lot of your CPU's power while converting, so you may want to avoid doing other tasks on the computer during the conversion process.

, Use a USB cable to connect your Android device to your computer and unlock the device's screen. It should appear as a removable drive immediately.


If you're using an older version of Android, you may have to select ""USB Mass Storage"" from the Notification bar after connecting the device.
Mac users will need to download Android File Transfer here. After installing the program and connecting your Android device, it will appear on your desktop as a removable drive.

, Many devices will not have a dedicated Movies or Videos folder, so you can create one if you don't have one. You can also add the videos to your Pictures folder and you'll be able to open them in your Gallery or Photos app.

, You'll likely need to wait a few minutes for the videos to copy onto the Android device. Copying lots of videos or several large videos may take a while to complete.

, Once the video has been copied, you'll be able to open it on your Android device. Your Gallery or Photos app will usually be able to find the new videos automatically, though you may have to switch to the ""Videos"" section of the app.


If you can't get the videos to open in your Gallery or Photos app, you can download VLC Player for your Android. This app will play nearly any video file and will allow you to browse your phone's storage to select it. You can download VLC for free from the Google Play Store.

Know that it is difficult to get music on iTunes without an aggregator.,
Review a list of Apple-approved aggregators.,
Consider the upfront cost of your aggregator.,
Know if your aggregator takes a percentage of sales.,
Understand how aggregators pay you.,
Compare the extra features from company to company.,
Sign up an aggregator that fits your band.,
Upload your music and album artwork to your aggregator.",How to Sell Your Music on iTunes1," Apple has made it hard to publish your music to iTunes without hiring an outside company called an aggregator. Aggregators convert your songs, communicate with Apple, and handle the legal hurdles of publishing music. If you don’t have an aggregator you can still put music on iTunes if you meet several conditions:


You must have at least 20 albums.
You must buy a Universal Product Code (UPC) and International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) for each song.
You must have a Mac running OS X 10.5.8 or later.;
, There are hundreds of music distribution companies online that promise to put your music on iTunes for you, but luckily Apple has published a list of its preferred aggregators. Look into several aggregators before picking the first one you see on Google.


Popular aggregators include Tunecore, CDBaby, and Catapult.
There are many other popular aggregators that work with iTunes but are not on Apple's list, including ADED.US Music Distribution, RecordUnion, Distrokid, Ditto, and ReverbNation.

, Click on the button labeled “Pricing” on the homepage of most aggregation sites. Music distribution companies charge a flat fee, take a cut of your royalties, or a combination of both. General upfront costs include:


’’’Single Songs:’’’ $10-$15 per song.
’’’Albums:’’’ $20-$60 per album (first year)
Some companies charge annual fees to keep you album on iTunes, usually $40-$50 each year., Apple takes 30% of the revenue from every song sold on iTunes already, meaning you are making roughly $0.70/song before an aggregator takes their share. Usually, companies with low up-front fees take a larger cut (10-15%) while other companies charge an annual fee to keep your music online. Some examples include:


’’’CDBaby and Catapult:’’’ Take 9% off of every song sold, but they have no annual fees.
’’’Tunecore and ReverbNation:’’’ Take nothing for each song, but they charge $50/year.
Companies that take a percentage of royalties usually make you more money if you sell less than 1000 albums., An aggregator is simply a music distribution service that publishes your music on Spotify, iTunes, SoundCloud, and other music services. As such, the aggregator is paid for each of your songs sold on iTunes, and the aggregator then sends you a check.


Some aggregators pay monthly, others bi-monthly, and some weekly. Research your aggregators “royalties report” timeline to find when they will pay you.

, For example, few aggregators will charge extra to put your music on Spotify and other music services. Yet some companies, like CDBaby and Catapult, charge $20 per album to buy a UPC, which is essential to sell on iTunes. Other features to look for include:


’’’Outside Royalties:’’’ Tunecore, for example, will handle TV and film rights for you for a flat fee of $75, while CDBaby will collect royalties from other sites like SoundExchange for free.
’’’iTunes Preorder:’’’ Some companies (CDBaby, LouderFM) offer this for free, while others do not offer pre-orders (Distrokid) or have extra costs (Tunecore).
’’’Reporting:’’’ Almost every aggregator will send you statistics based on how your album or song is selling. Some will send you trend reports each day (Distrokid, Tunecore), while others sent reports weekly or monthly (CDBaby, ReverbNation)., There are a lot of choices , but the biggest decision to make is whether you want to pay annual fees or a percentage of your royalties. After you’ve made that decision you can choose between the features each site offers by checking the “FAQ” and “Services” pages on their website.



New musicians should avoid annual fees. Unless you can sell thousands of copies, you will make more money paying a cut of royalties to a company like CDBaby or MondoTunes. This allows you to keep your music on iTunes forever, not until you the day you can’t afford an annual fee anymore.Established musicians should contact small, niche aggregators. Companies like InGroove and The Orchard only a few bands based on their quality and following. However, this means that they spend more time marketing your band and working with you to maximize sales.Musicians with a large online backing should keep their royalties. Sites that charge annual fees but let you keep royalties are more profitable if you can sell over 1,000 copies a year. These sites are made for mid-range to large bands who can tap into an online community to drive sales.

, Once you’ve chosen the perfect site to handle your music, upload the music and artwork and let them take care of the rest. Most sites get your music onto iTunes within 1-4 weeks, and some boast that they only need 2-3 days.


Send the aggregator the best quality sound and picture files you have – they will convert them to the preferred iTunes format.Some sites, like Tunecore, offer offer custom album artwork if you don't have it.

Wait 2-3 weeks to release your music.,
Use pre-orders to gain momentum online.,
Have an active social media presence.,
Promote your music.,
Attach your iTunes link to everything.",How to Sell Your Music on iTunes2," The albums featured on iTunes are not paid advertisements -- they're chosen by the iTunes staff as ""new and noteworthy"" releases. Getting your picture and album on the front page of iTunes is one of the best ways to drive sales, so set your release date 2-3 weeks after you distribute your music to give the iTunes staff time to hear your songs., Most aggregators allow you to sell pre-orders, which increases your sales when the album drops. Pre-orders allow you to market your music in advance, giving people sound-bites to get excited about. When the album finally comes out, everyone who pre-ordered the album will be talking about you at the same time, creating social media buzz to drive future albums sales.

, Today, a strong online campaign is the best way for anyone at home to sell their music. This needs to be prepared months in advanced. Start a Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and BandCamp page to make yourself accessible to your fans and meet new ones. More important than having an account, however, is using it. The most successful bands post at least once a day, if not more:



Twitter: Try for 3-5 tweets per day.

Facebook: Post at least twice a day.

Pinterest: Post or re-pin another band 4-5 times a day.

Blog: Try to write a post 3-4 times a week.
Connect these accounts for the most success. For example, put your Twitter handle at the bottom of every blog post.

, The only way you can sell you music is if you promote it. Talk about it on blogs, ask friends to write you a review, and play some small concerts in your town to get people talking about you. Try to record 2-3 songs to put online so that people can hear you before they buy.


Ask local coffee shops and bars about playing your music during the week.
Send you music to college radio stations. They will often play your music and are more approachable then commercial stations.

, You need to use your social media presence, music buzz, and concerts to drive traffic back to your album, otherwise you won't get any sales. Make this easy on your listeners by placing a link to your album on your website, blog, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Whenever you are out, be sure to mention the album at your concerts or when you meet interested listeners.

Master your recordings.,
Produce artwork for your album or single.,

Partner with a distributor.,
Choose to have your music appear in the iTunes store.",How to Release Music on iTunes," Mastering represents the final step of the recording and production process. During this phase, the dynamics, volume, and equalization of the recordings are adjusted to near-commercial quality. You can handle the mastering yourself or hire a professional, but don't leave this step out if you want your music to sound its best in digital form.;
, Cover art has long been a major part of releasing music through physical media (like compact discs), but you need to develop artwork even if you are exclusively releasing music digitally. None of the major services, including iTunes, will release your music without corresponding artwork. You can handle the graphic design yourself or contract a professional to design work to your specifications.

, None of the major music distribution services, including iTunes, will sell your album or single without a UPC number - this applies to digital media as well as physical media. If you are having CDs produced, then you can usually buy a bar code from the company duplicating your CDs for less than 50 USD. Some services, such as CD Baby, will allow you to purchase a unique bar code for your album even without using their service to sell your music.

, As an independent artist, you cannot deal with Apple directly; the volume of demand dictates that they only do business with major distributors. These companies will upload your music into their database (often performing mastering work if desired), from which they release the music to Apple to sell in the iTunes store.


When choosing a distributor, make sure that you retain all the rights to your own music. Many of the popular independent distributors, such as CD Baby and TuneCore, will not make any claims to your music.
Compare the fees charged by different distributors. Many services charge around 40 USD to upload an entire full-length album, and then charge around a 10 percent fee per song sold. Choose a distributor with competitive rates.

, When uploading your music to your distributor's website, you will be given the option to have your music appear in several of the major music sales services. Choose the iTunes store, and your distributor will make your music available for download through Apple's service.

Find an Apple-approved aggregator (optional).If you weren't able to get through the previous step yourself, get in touch with an aggregator, or a third-party distributing service that allows you to finish and distribute your music for a small fee.",How to Put Music on iTunes4," Before you send your album through the necessary channels, you need to make sure that it is polished and presentable. Create album artwork for it, edit all the song titles, and add a description if necessary.


Selling your music on iTunes can be fairly simple even for amateur artists, but you will have a great deal of competition to deal with, and your odds of having success will improve vastly if you make sure that your songs are in top condition.
If you have no experience with mastering and do not know how to polish the music up to commercial standards by yourself, hire an engineer or specialist to do it for you.

, Convert the files to WAV, set at a 44.1 kHz sample rate and 16 bit sample size. You can convert your audio files in iTunes by importing them to the library using the WAV encoder, set to custom settings., You also need cover artwork and complete track credits to submit before an online service will help you add your music to the iTunes store.


You must have rights to the artwork.
Aim to make the cover image a JPG file set to 1,000 by 1,000 pixels.

, Before you can sell your album, it needs to have a UPC code. Fortunately, obtaining one is pretty easy. You can obtain one by registering directly with the Uniform Code Council, or you can ask a CD manufacturer or distributor if they offer the service. The latter may prove to be a cheaper option. You can also get a UPC online through various online distributors like CD Baby or DiscMakers, and these tend to be even cheaper options.

, Even if you do not qualify to work with Apple directly, though, you can still work through a third party.

, Check the Apple iTunes application page for a list of approved aggregators. There are many to choose from, each offering different services at different prices, but TuneCore, CDBaby, and Songcast are among the most popular.


These will usually require you to pay a fee, but there are other aggregators like ADEDistribution that also provide a limited free service with few additional services.
When looking for an aggregator, stick with a company that allows you to retain your rights. If you sign over the rights to your music, you will no longer be able to alter or use it as you please.
Aggregators that allow you to keep all or nearly all of the royalties are also considered preferable since you will be able to earn more money off each sale.
Read the fine print. No matter how popular or frequently used an aggregator is, you should read all the fine print about costs, fees, and legal matters before subscribing to the service. If you do not understand the legal aspect of things, find an acquaintance who does or hire a law professional to review it with you."

Think about the flow of the party.,
Make a closing list.,
Put your music together.,
Play your mix.",How to Make a Great Party Music Mix1," Think in terms of demographics: how many people did you invite, and how many do you expect to show up? Is anyone bringing a friend? Will there be drop-ins? What's the age and general situation of your guests? 16-year-old suburban teenagers aren't going to like the same music as 30something professionals. Also, think about how long you want the party to last. A three-hour mix and a six-hour mix call for different strategies.


It's better to overestimate than underestimate when it comes to things like time and number of people. Think in terms of flex room rather than guessing at a specific number.;
, Generally speaking, good party music is upbeat and doesn't require a lot of attention to appreciate. Songs with difficult or complex structures, and songs that shift from very loud to very quiet and back, should be avoided. Sad and depressing songs, no matter how well-liked they might be, don't have a place in a party mix (except possibly at the end, but more on that later).


When in doubt, go with music that has a good beat and a catchy musical hook. Some genres are better at providing this type of music than others: Modern R&B, R&B-influenced pop, dance pop, hip-hop, reggae, and pop-punk are particularly reliable sources. Classical music, singer-songwriter style folk, new age, and melancholy indie rock (like Neutral Milk Hotel and Modest Mouse) should be avoided, in most cases.

, If your music collection is all or mostly digital, collect any extra albums or songs you think you might want to use. If you're working with a physical collection, gather it all in one room. Either way, go through everything you have. Listen to bits of albums and songs, and write down anything that seems like it might make good party music, even if you aren't sure. The goal is to have a nice wide base of songs to work with.

, Most audiophiles have a deep-seated urge to share their new discoveries and lesser-known music with friends, and a party mix is certainly an acceptable place to introduce relatively obscure acts to the people you know. However, the cardinal rule of making a great party mix is to lean more towards songs people will recognize. People just enjoy party music more when they already know how most of the songs go. Remember, being a good host is about making your guests happy, not satisfying your ego.


No more than 15-20% of your final mix should be unknown or obscure music, as a rule. This is flexible, of course, but it's a good rule of thumb for most ordinary kinds of party. Populate the rest of your mix with popular, catchy artists from the past and present, such as Justin Timberlake, OutKast, Beyonce, Hall and Oates, Kendrick Lamar, The Doobie Brothers, Drake, and Michael Jackson.

, If you're working with all digital music, you have two basic choices: shuffle, or no shuffle. A playlist set to shuffle can be more fun for you, since you won't know which song is coming next, but it requires a more careful balance to prevent songs from the same artist playing back-to-back. On the other hand, not shuffling a playlist allows you to set moods for different parts of the night (which would require a separate playlist for each mood if you shuffle).

, If you're using burnable CDs instead, the options are slightly different. Physical media users will have to set songs in a specific order, but can shuffle CDs individually. Combined with only around 80 minutes of audio will fit on one CD-R disc, this means you can combine both methods and play the discs in a set order but with shuffled tracks. You can also simply follow a set order for each disc and song, or (if you have a multi-tray CD player) load up a few discs and shuffle between them.

, Most party mixes go one of two ways: loud and fun from start to finish, or spaced out along a set trajectory. Either method is fine, but if you're not going to shuffle, it's best to go with the second option. Generally speaking, you can set the first half hour or so to be a bit quieter and slower, and plan for a similar break a few hours into the mix. The music should still be fun to listen to, but it can ramp up to a higher energy level slowly.

, No matter which method you choose to pursue, plan to have an hour or so of slow, relaxing music set aside (in a different playlist or on a separate disc). You can put this music on when you're done hosting the party for the night, to encourage people to wrap up and head home. Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon was once a very popular choice for ending the party; other viable options include artists such as DJ Krush, Belle and Sebastian, or the Replacements. Pick music with waning energy and a quieter sound.

, Listen to the beginning of each song in order and be sure you're happy with it. (If you're shuffling, do this anyway to be sure all the songs work well together.) Once you're satisfied, save the mix (digital) or burn it to discs (manual) and you're all set.


If you're playing music from a phone or mp3 player, be sure you have a cable to route the sound through your stereo speakers. These can be purchased for a few dollars at most home electronics stores.

, There's an art to knowing when to start playing. You can start the music as soon as the first guest arrives, but if you wait for a half hour and start when a few more people show up, you'll get a better effect. The starting time ultimately depends on the type of party you're having, and how many friends you expect to show up. Some variations and specific situations are covered in detail below.

Host a dinner party with class.,
Make your mix interactive.,
Create a themed mix.",How to Make a Great Party Music Mix2," If the party you're throwing is a small dinner party for 4-12 people, there's no need to make a huge mix, and certainly no call for danceable music. Instead, help everyone relax and feel elegant by putting on some classic jazz. Not just any jazz album will do; look for famous performers, and lean towards variations on songs rather than original compositions (though these are also fine in moderation). You should only need a few albums' worth of music, at most.


Don't shuffle your jazz; instead, go through each album in turn, from beginning to end, preserving the intended mood.
As for era, stick to the 20 years between 1951 and 1971. Jazz from this period has a classic jazz sound that most people find relaxing and sophisticated.

Consider these albums as useful starting points: Solar Energy, Ray Brown Trio with Gene Harris; Time Out, Dave Brubeck Quartet; Kind of Blue, Miles Davis; Idle Moments, Grant Green.


You can also try an album of bossa nova (such as Antonio Jobim's excellent Wave) or other “relaxed” sounding music, but be careful not to make your guests feel as though they're listening to elevator music.

, This works best with a collection of CDs or LPs, but can be approximated with a digital music player. Before the party, set aside every album that's not suitable for the party, leaving only good party albums out in the main area. Put one on as guests begin to arrive, and leave the albums prominently displayed so that people can look through them. Offer to let people play albums, a few songs (or one side) at a time, one pick per person. Your guests will have another activity to play around with, and you can rest assured that only the chosen albums will be played.


To be safe, don't leave out any albums that would be difficult or expensive to replace if broken. Parties have been the bane of many a breakable item.

, Themed mixes aren't only useful at theme parties; they're also a great way to show off a collection that has some depth, and can provide some additional structure to a more public event (like a neighborhood block party). Simply look at your collection and make mixes of your favorite songs from genres you collect or have a special interest in. You can even make more tightly themed mixes for specific parties, such as a maritime theme or a desert theme. People love it when the music matches up to the theme of the evening.


An early rock, rockabilly, and bebop mix is great for a sock hop or retro-themed gathering.
Funk and classic '70s soul lend a lush, decadent air to any warm summer night.
Split your mix between EDM (Skrillex, Tiesto, the Chemical Brothers) and IDM (Bonobo, Aphex Twin, Modeselektor) to create a soundtrack for a rave. (You can learn to crossfade and match beats to make it feel even more authentic, but that's not covered here).

Before iTunes Plus, all of the music sold on iTunes was encoded using proprietary software called Digital Restrictions Management. DRM allows Apple to track how many computers have decoded the file you downloaded, which is why you must register your music every time you format your hard drive or change computers. There is a limit to the number of computers that can decode a given file.

Mac: Choose iTunes, then Preferences.;

, If you still need to import some songs, you can choose to import and convert them at the same time. The new songs will show up as MP3 files in your iTunes library.


Some older purchased songs may be encoded using a Protected AAC format, which blocks the in-iTunes conversion. You may be able to convert these files using a third-party file converter program or website. You can also convert these files by paying for iTunes Plus.

, Select one or more songs in your library, then select Create MP3 version from the File > Create New Version menu. To convert all the songs in a folder or on a disk, hold down the ⌥ Option (Mac) or ⇧ Shift (Windows). Then, select File > Create New Version > Convert . The Import preference"" should be set to the file encoding format that you chose on the Importing Preferences page. iTunes will prompt you for the location of the folder or disk you want to import and convert., Two copies of the song will show up in your iTunes library: the original M4P file, and the new MP3 file. You should be able to play both files in iTunes.


If you don't want to see both copies of the song file in your iTunes library, move the M4P file somewhere else. Try consolidating unwanted M4Ps into another folder, or removing them from the library but keeping the files on your computer for future use. Consider simply deleting the old file, if you don't think you'll need it.
Be aware that conversions between compressed files can cause a slight loss in sound quality. Consider keeping the M4P files around until you're sure that the sound is still solid."

, Name something like ""DRM Workflow."" You can do this by clicking File, New Playlist. Alternately, click the Plus button at the bottom-left corner of the window.

, Select all of the files found by the smart playlist, and drag them into the new playlist. This will allow you to accurately track your progress while converting the files.

, You can create as many playlists as you like. However, you may find that four is plenty.

, Click on your pre-conversion playlist and select about an hour of music. Starting at the top, select music, while keeping track of how long the selection is at the bottom. Drag and drop this selection to the first playlist labeled ""Disc 1"".


The playlist should be about 18-21 songs for most music. Certain styles of music (e.g. classical, metal, psychedelic, ambient) that are known for long songs may fit fewer songs to each CD. You may need to handle books on tape differently.

, Set the gap between songs to be ""none"" so that there is no extra time taking up storage space between your files. Also include the CD text, which will retain much of the information (but not all) about the songs on the CD.

, When you burn the disk, iTunes may inform you that you are limited to burning 7 discs.Depending on when you purchased the songs, you may not even get this warning. If you do, simply click ""OK"". Allow iTunes to completely burn the CD. This will usually take less than 10 minutes. iTunes will usually indicate that it's finished with a chime.

, For best interoperability, select the WAV file format. However, the WAV format produces very large files since it does not compress any information. Most commercial music players today will also accept the MP3 file format. If you are not sure, select MP3 encoding. To ensure you have the highest quality, select the highest bit rate available. For spoken speech, a lower quality is usually better.

, Importing usually takes 10 minutes. While this is working, you can continue to the next step.

, Make sure that you can tell the difference between your newly imported songs and your existing DRM songs. Go back to your ""Disc 1"" playlist and select all the songs. Right-mouse-click the selection and click ""Get Info"". Most, if not all, of the fields should be blank. Type in ""DRM"" or ""M4P"" in the ""Comments"" section, and then hit OK.

, Once iTunes has finished importing the CD, go to your music collection. Click File, Display Duplicates. Add the ""Comments"" column by right-mouse-clicking the table headers and selecting ""Comments"". Examine the duplicate songs, making note of both the artist and song title. Select the song with ""DRM"" in the comments. Hold down the control button to select more than one DRM song. Scroll down until all the songs you want to delete are selected.


Hit the delete button on your keyboard or right-mouse-click and click Delete. When iTunes asks, choose to have the files moved to your Trash/Recycle Bin.

, If you wish to keep your DRM files, select them from your Trash/Recycle bin and copy them to a new folder. Repeat the steps until you've converted all of the files in question.

AAC: A modern version of the mp3, it offers the small size of an mp3 but with higher audio quality. This is the most common format for an iPhone or iPod and is generally found on Mac machines and products.

While you can still see this in iTunes, you will get only ""Track 1, Track 2, etc."" in any other music player. It is generally more common for Mac users than WAV.

Apple Lossless: A high quality song file that is slightly smaller than AIFF or WAV files but can only be played on Apple programs and devices.

mp3: A small, low quality song file that can be played on any mp3 player, including mp3 CD players or other most other music devices and programs (Windows Media Player, Zune, etc.)

Use multiple CD's. If the playlist is too long, iTunes will give you the option to use multiple CDs. When one is full, it will prompt you to put in a fresh disc before restarting.

Enable your ""Stereo Mix,"" then use any music recording program to record the podcast as you play it. Note: Not all windows computers can do this., Buy a basic 8mm cable (aux cord) and run it from your output (headphone jack) to input (microphone jack). You can then use a recording program, like Audacity or Garage Band, to record the podcast as it plays. Basically, it takes the sound that would go to your headphones and routes it into a microphone, re-recording the file to your computer.

You can also quantize all of the notes simultaneously. To do this click inside the area where the notes are shown, but not on an individual note. Then, ""Adjust to"" should change to ""Enhance Timing"". You can then click to bring up a list of the different intervals. Click on one to quantize the notes.

Stop recording.",How to Convert a VHS to DVD1," A VHS-to-DVD recorder basically gives you a DVD copy of your tape in real time.


DVD recorders cost between $100-$200 at major electronic stores or online. You can also usually find one between $50-$75 in good condition on Ebay.
With a DVD recorder, you don't have a lot of flexibility as far as menus, buttons and chapter settings, but it's the fastest and easiest way to convert VHS to DVD.
If you have a VCR or camcorder with Firewire connections, you can get a DVD Recorder with Firewire connections and transfer tapes at a higher quality. Firewire ports look similar to USB ports, except they are flatter and tapered at the end.;
, Your VCR/camcorder or DVD Recorder may have come with the correct cable to connect to the other, but if not, you'll need to find or purchase one.


Both your DVD Recorder and your VCR should be able to connect to an RCA or S-Video cable. RCA cables are red, white and yellow and connect to their corresponding colored ports on both the DVD Recorder and VCR. S-Video cables have four small, round pin connectors. Check the back of both your devices to see what kind of cable you need. If you don’t have the correct cable, you can find it at an electronic store or online for $5-$10.
If you're using a camcorder, the cable that came with it should connect to your DVD Recorder. If you no longer have it, you can find the right cable at an electronic store or online for $5-$10.
If your DVD Recorder and VCR/camcorder have Firewire ports, make sure your Firewire cable matches them exactly. The number of pins and the shape of a Firewire cable can vary slightly—they aren’t all the same. If you don’t have the correct cable, you can find it at an electronic store or online for $5-$10.

,,, You'll want to start the DVD recorder first so you don’t cut off the beginning of the video.

, As quickly as possible after pressing “Record” on your DVD recorder, press “Play” on your VCR/camcorder.

, Press “Pause” on the DVD recorder and fast-forward the VCR/camcorder through parts you want to edit out. When you’ve reached the end of the portion you want to cut, restart the DVD recorder again and start playing your tape.

, When you reach the end of your video or the end of the portion you want to record, press “Stop” on your DVD recorder.


If you reach the end of your tape and your video stops automatically, your DVD recorder will stop recording automatically.

This method will take several hours of work for one hour of video—but you likely have most of the equipment already, besides the converter. This method also gives you the flexibility to edit the video as much as you want, adding transitions, special effects, music, etc.
Analog-to-digital video converters cost anywhere from $15 to $75 and can be found at electronic stores or online. The more expensive converters come bundled with advanced editing software.

, An analog-to-dv converter has a USB connection on one side, and red, white and yellow RCA cables on the other. Connect the RCA cables to the corresponding colors on the back of your VCR and connect the USB cable to your computer.

, This software comes standard with Mac and most versions of Windows, and is also available for download. There are also more advanced versions that you can purchase, if you’re looking for more advanced movie-making features.


On a Mac, this is iMovie.
On a PC, the is Movie Maker. Movie Maker comes standard in Windows Vista, XP, and 7. Windows 8 and 10 users can download it., This can take a lot of time and hard drive space. Two hours of footage will create a 1Gb - 2Gb MPEG file.


In iMovie, select File > New Movie and select a theme. Then select the “import video” button at the top (this looks like a downward pointing arrow). Follow the prompts to import your video.In Movie Maker, select File > Import from Digital Video Camera, and follow the prompts to import your video.

, Here is where the benefits of this method pay off. You can edit your video and add menus and chapters before burning your DVD.

,


On a Mac, select File > Share > File and save your movie file. You’ll need to download and install burn software if you don’t already have it, such as Burn for OS.. Use this application to export your movie to DVD.
On a PC, you can do this in Movie Maker. Click the menu icon in the top left corner, select Save Movie > Burn DVD. Follow the prompts to burn your DVD.

, This could interrupt the DVD burning process and mess up your movie.


On a Mac, you can do this under System Preferences > Energy Saver. On “Turn Display Off” move the setting to “Never” and select “Prevent Computer from Sleeping Automatically”. Make sure to restore these settings back to the default after you’re finished—your computer does need sleep!
On a PC, go to Start > Control Panel > System and Security > Power Options > Select a power plan > Change plan settings > Change advanced power settings > Advanced settings.

Photoshop
Paint.net
GIMP
Pixen
Aseprite;
, If you want to trace hand-drawn art or don't really like using the mouse to draw on the screen, you can use a tablet and stylus. Wacom is one of the most popular tablet manufacturers.

, You'll want to enable grid mode in whichever software you choose. This will allow you to see clearly where each pixel will go. You can usually access the grid view from the View menu.


You will likely need to configure the grid so that each square represents one pixel. The method for doing this varies from program to program. In GIMP, you can change this from the Image menu (select ""Configure Grid..."").

, Select the Pencil tool in your editing software. In the Pencil's options, choose the single-pixel brush. This will allow you to draw in single pixels., Since you are going to be working on the pixel level, the image size doesn't need to be big. The entire screen in the original Super Mario Bros. game is only 256 x 224 pixels. Mario himself is only 12 x 16 pixels!

, Since you're going to be working with individual pixels, you'll want to zoom very far in so that you can see the grid and where each individual pixel is placed. You may need to zoom in over 800% to clearly see the pixels in the grid.

, This may seem like a simple concept, but if the line is even one pixel off in the middle it will be noticeable. Practice drawing straight lines with your mouse or stylus so you don't have to switch to the line tool every time.

, Curves should occur with regular breaks in the pixel line. For example, a good curve would start with a six-pixel break, followed by a three-pixel break, followed by a two-pixel break, followed by one-pixel breaks. The breaks would then reverse to make the other end of the curve. A bad curve would start with a three-pixel break, followed by a one-pixel break, followed by a three pixel break, or any other odd progression.

, Like the Pencil tool, you'll want to set the eraser to erase one pixel at a time. If the eraser is too large, it will be difficult to erase pixels with precision.

, Will it be animated or static? You can put more detail into a static sprite, but you may want to keep an animated sprite simpler since you will need to redraw parts for the animation. If the sprite is to be used with other sprites, you'll want to maintain an artistic style that connects everything together.

, If you are creating the sprite for a project, determine if there are any size or color limitations. This will be more important when you begin working on larger projects with lots of different sprites.


Most modern systems don't really have any limitations on sprite size and color complexity. If you're developing a game specifically for an older system, you may run into more limitations.

, Try to sketch out the basic concept of the sprite on a piece of paper. This will allow you to see how the sprite will look and make adjustments to the pose or other characteristics. You can use this sketch as the source of your tracing later if you have a tablet.


Make the sketch detailed. Place all of the features that you want to include so that you can get a feel for how the sprite will look as a finished product.

, Either use the sketched outline as a reference or trace the outline using your pad. You can either click and draw to create the outline or place each pixel individually, the choice is yours.


When creating your first sprite use solid black as your outline color. This will make it easy to distinguish. You can manually change the color of the outline later.

, Zoom in and start erasing extra pixels and fixing lines. The outline should only ever be one pixel thick. Use your Pencil tool to insert pixels to help correct mistakes.


Focus on the big details during the outlining process. You can go back and add the small touches later.

, Look at the color wheel to help determine which colors you should use. Colors across from each other on the wheel will be very distinct, while colors in close proximity will look good next to each other.


Choose a set of colors that give your sprite a distinctive look without being too jarring. Avoid pastel colors if possible, unless the entire project uses that style.

, The more color you add, the more distracting your sprite will look. Take a look at some of the most iconic sprites and you'll find that they often only use a few colors.


Mario - The classic Mario sprite uses only three colors that are all closely related.
Sonic - Sonic has more detail than the original Mario, but is still only composed of four colors with varying shades.
Ryu - One of the classic fighting game sprites, Ryu uses large areas of simple colors, with slight shading for definition. Ryu has five basic colors with various shades.

, Use the Fill tool to apply your color choices to your sprite. You're just applying base color at this point, so don't worry about how flat it looks. The Fill tool will replace all the pixels that match the pixel you clicked with your selected color, until boundaries are reached.

, The angle that the light hits the sprite will help you determine where to apply shading for a more realistic and believable effect. While there isn't going to actually be a light, knowing the direction the light is shining is very important.


It may be easiest to shade with the light source coming from far away above the sprite, from either the slight right or slight left.

, If the light source is coming from above, the shading should happen on the ""underside"" of the sprite. Shade any areas that wouldn't be hit by direct light. Just add a few layers of pixels above or below the outlines to add shading.


You can decrease the ""lum"" value of your base color and slightly increase the ""hue"" value to get a good shading color.
Never use gradients. They will look very fake and unprofessional. You can use dithering to mimic gradients (see below).

, Pick a shade between the darkness of the shadow and the original base color. Use this shade to add another layer of shadow between the shading and the base color. This will give the effect of transitioning from dark to light.

, These are spots on the sprite that are being hit the most with the light. You can add highlights by using a shade that is slightly lighter than the base color. Use highlights sparingly, as they can become distracting.

, This is an effect that allows the artist to represent a shift in shade. It allows you to create a gradient effect with only a few colors by alternating pixel placement to create the transitions. The amount and placement of two different pixel colors in a pattern can trick the eye into seeing different shades.Dithering tends to be overused by beginners, so try to avoid using it except in rare instances.

, Pixel art is defined by the noticeable pixels, but sometimes you want to blend the lines to make everything look a bit smoother. Anti-aliasing is the technique that allows you to do this.


Add intermediary colors to the kinks on a curve. Add one layer of intermediary colors around the outline of the curve that you want to soften. If it still looks to rough, add another layer of a lighter shade.
If you want your sprite to look crisp on any color background, do not anti-alias the outer edge of the outline.

, This is the term for coloring the outline similar to the colors used to fill. This will give the sprite a slightly less ""cartoony"" look, as the outline will be a little more natural. Try selective outlining bare skin while using traditional outlining on clothing.Use a shade darker than the base color of the section you are selective outlining. Use the light source to change the shade as you outline, giving the sprite a more natural look. This can be especially useful for skin and muscle tone.
Traditional outlining is good if you need your sprite to stay distinctive on top of a busy background.

, Take a step back and look at your sprite up to this point. Determine if anything looks off, and then go into correct those inconsistencies or errors.

, After you've finished coloring and shading, you can add details such as writing, eyes, additional features, and anything else that could take your sprite to the next level. The attention to detail at the end is what separates amateur from professional pixel artists.

, If you've followed the steps above, you'll have a single static sprite. This is fine as a piece of art, but if you want to make sprites for games they'll likely need to be animated. This means that each frame of animation will have to have its own sprite, with slight changes from the previous frame. The collection of all the sprites used in an animation is called a ""sprite sheet"".


See this guide for detail on animating a sprite sheet in GIMP.
Creating unique and attractive animations for sprites is one way that master pixel artists separate themselves from amateurs. A good animation can breathe a ton of life into a sprite.

, If you want to take your pixel art skills into the video game development world, you'll want to have a solid portfolio to show off to prospective employers. Include several of your best sprites, as well as some animations if you have them. Include a variety of subjects, including characters, scenery, props, and more.

Go to µTorrent's website.,

Search for a torrent website.,
Type your movie's name into the search bar, then press ↵ Enter.,
Locate a healthy torrent.,
Click a torrent to review its feedback.,
Download the torrent.,
Double-click the torrent file to open it in µTorrent or drag the torrent file directly onto µTorrent.,
Wait for your file to download.",How to Download Movies Using uTorrent," Do so by entering http://www.utorrent.com/ into your browser's URL bar.
, It's the button in the middle of the µTorrent page that mentions your computer's operating system (e.g., ""For Windows""). Doing so will prompt µTorrent to begin downloading.

Depending on your operating system, you may need to click Get µTorrent on a second page first.
Depending on your browser, you may first have to click Save or specify a download location before the download will begin.

, This process will vary depending on your computer:


Windows: Double-click the µTorrent file, click Yes when prompted, click Next twice, click I agree, select shortcut options and click Next, click Next again, and click Decline on the recommended programs. Click Finish to finalize the installation.

Mac: Drag µTorrent into the ""Applications"" folder.

, Simply double-click the µTorrent icon to do so. You're now ready to begin downloading movies using µTorrent., It's recommended that you use a supported web browser like Edge, Chrome, or Firefox, since Internet Explorer may be too vulnerable for most torrent websites., Torrent websites are typically hit-or-miss due to legal reasons, so you'll likely need to browse to find a currently operational site rather than relying on any specific torrent website.

One way to find a torrent website is by searching ""torrents"" on Google or a similar search engine and then reviewing the results.

, You'll typically find the search bar at the top of the site, though each site's layout will differ slightly. Searching for your term will pull up a list of matching results.

Using more specific terms (e.g., ""Blair Witch 2016"" rather than ""Blair Witch"") will yield more specific results.

, When downloading a torrent, there are a few things to look for:


Seeders: The number in the ""SEED"" column on the right side of the page should ideally be higher (or roughly equal to) the number in the ""LEECH"" column.

File details: Make sure the file name, category, and any other information in the title matches exactly what you're looking for.

Quality (video only): Look for at least ""720p"" in the title (""1080p"" is ideal) or higher as those files will in the range of DVD quality or greater. Anything lower will have poor quality.

, There are a couple of other things you'll look for here:


Comments: Specifically, look for comments on whether or not the torrent is safe, as well as quality comments.

Rating: Make sure the torrent has a low number of negative reviews and a high number of positive ones.

, Do so by clicking your site's ""Download"" button, which will usually say Download Torrent or something similar (e.g., Download ).

Many Torrent websites have false ads plastered on the page that look like download links but will take you to another site. Make sure the download link matches the format and style of the Torrent site you are using. You can also hover the mouse over the link to view that the link's URL is the on the same domain name as the Torrent website you are currently on using.

, Dropping the file here will prompt the movie file itself to begin downloading to your computer.

You may first have to specify a download location (e.g., your desktop).

, Once the file finishes downloading, you'll see ""Seeding"" appear to the right of the torrent's name. This indicates that you're sharing the data for your movie file to other people who are also trying to download the same movie.

BitTorrent is a P2P (Peer to Peer) network system of sharing files without needing to have the file in a specific location. Instead of download the movie file directly from a website or server, you are downloading it from everyone who is sharing (or ""seeding"") that same movie file all at once.

Add a row, if you prefer, for an employee to enter her hourly rate for regular hours, leave and overtime.,
Finish with a row for total hours multiplied by the pay rate for each category of work and a cell for the week's grand total, which will be the employee's gross pay.

Improve the look of the spreadsheet by using bold print for the labels and shading in the label rows with color.

,, If compensation is confidential and someone other than the bookkeeper and the employee's supervisor will see the time sheet, leave this row off or instruct your employees not to fill in this row.

,,, Most software bundles allow you to send the spreadsheet to the other document and will trim and size the spreadsheet to fit. If not, you must adjust the size of the rows and columns to make the spreadsheet fit.

Consider OpenOffice.org Writer, Microsoft Word, Abiword or Google Docs.,
Start by determining how your document is structured.,
Find the Styles Task Pane in your word processor.,
Apply the appropriate style to each section and subsection heading, according to its importance or level of detail (as you analyzed in step 1 above).,
Apply styles to the next level of detail in the outline: apply the style ""Heading 2"" to the second level of headings!,
Repeat as necessary, going down to the desired level of detail.,
If you are including bullet points or numbered lists, do yourself and your coworkers a favor and avoid using the bullet/numbering buttons in the toolbars.,
View your logically constructed document!",How to Use Styles in Word Processing,";
, Generally, it will have one (or more) main sections with corresponding titles (headings). Each main section will have subsections (again, with corresponding titles, also known as subheadings) that go into greater detail. (If you are starting your document from scratch, preparing an outline of headings and subheadings is an excellent way to organize your thoughts!)

, In MS Word, click on the Format menu and select Styles and Formatting; most versions of Word will use a similar command. In lieu of the task pane, you might also use the Styles toolbar; it is a drop-down field in most Word configurations that displays ""Normal"" by default. In OpenOffice.org click Format then Styles and Formatting (or press F11)

, In the title(s) of your main section(s), place the mouse cursor and select ""Heading 1"" from the Styles toolbar or task pane. Notice that the paragraph is converted to a large, bold typeface.

, Notice that the Heading 2 copy is not quite as large or bold as the Heading 1 copy.

, Unless you are writing detailed technical, scientific or legal documents, you will probably not need to go farther than ""Heading 3"". (As a practical matter, few people can follow a discussion that uses more than four or five levels of headings. If your document needs more than four levels of headings, consider breaking the document up into multiple documents.)

, Instead, use the Styles toolbar or task pane and apply the styles ""List Bullet"" and/or ""List Number"". You can avoid having to insert bullet characters or numbers that way, and the software will usually even retain and update your numbering as you edit your copy.

, This is a clean, tight document that will go through most automated document converters and come out looking as good as when it went in.

If you opened a spreadsheet with data already in place, skip this step.

, This is the number that you looked up earlier. Make sure you plug this number into a cell in a column that you aren't using.

If you were converting dollars to rubles as in the previous example, the currency conversion rate would be ""60.77"".

, The conversion formula is =*$$. For example:

With US dollar values in the ""A"" column starting at A1, rubles planned for the ""B"" column starting at B1, and the conversion rate in cell C1, you would type =A1*$C$1 into cell B1.

, This will enter your formula into the top cell of the second currency's column, which will display the converted value in this cell., Click and drag the top cell in the converted currency's column down until it matches the last full cell in the first currency's column, then release the mouse button. Each cell in the second currency's column should now display the converted version of the first currency column's cells.

For the previous example, you would click and drag B1 down until it lined up with the last cell containing a dollar value in the ""A"" column.

Maintain an organized list of links with information on LaTeX.",How to Use LaTeX for Text Formatting," First of all, using LaTeX is free. There is no need to buy a program, since a myriad of tools are available as free downloads. The choice of an editor is a matter of personal preference and your operating system. If you're using a PC, you probably want to install MikTeX as a beginner, as it provides you with everything you need out of the box.ution you use depends on your computer's operating system. As a GNU/Linux user, you will probably find the texlive package in your repository and you can easily install it through your distribution's package manager. Also for Mac/OSX there are several tools available. One of them is gwTeX. If you want to get started right away, you can also try using an online editor for LaTeX such as writelatex.com.;
, By querying the search engine of your choice for tutorials, you can choose from plenty of tutorials on the internet. There are offline tutorials available as PDF such as The (Not So) Short Introduction to LaTeX2e, plain text tutorials from many universities (e.g. A Tutorial from Cornell or David Wilkins's Primer). For more detailed documentation, you can refer to LaTeX in Wikibooks.

, For example, a PH.D. dissertation written in LaTeX may be a set of files or a single file. The file with the '.tex' extension will be the one containing the actual document. Example documents can be found at these useful sites: IIT Bombay, Univ. of Michigan, and many more.

, What the LaTeX software does is convert a text file (written in its markup language) into a document. This can be a cumbersome step. Once the first build is finished the rest are easy.

, Once the template has been built, it is not difficult to modify it to suit your needs.

, LaTeX is a sophisticated software package and the possibilities are endless. Some sites may treat many aspects of LaTeX, some only a few specific ones.

Delete footnotes, if applicable.",How to Write Footnotes1," Specifically, the superscript for your footnote should go right after the material you’re citing—not necessarily at the end of a sentence. In most cases, the material ends with a period. However, it could also be after a comma, colon, or semi-colon if the cited material doesn’t extend beyond that punctuation. For example:


Doe argues that Jack did not, in fact, jump over the candlestick.

Position the cursor after the period.


Smith describes the Big Bad Wolf as a metaphor for children’s fears, while Jones frames him as a metaphor for punishment.

Position the cursor after the comma first. After you’ve entered that footnote, place the cursor after the period and repeat the process.

Follow the MLA handbook.,
Use parenthetical citations.,
Format titles correctly.,
Type a bibliographic note.,
Create a content note.",How to Write Footnotes2," The MLA Handbook allows for bibliographic notes and content notes. Double-space both kinds. Indent each note five spaces.Make the font size Times New Roman 12-point., Do this for citing sources in the text. After you finish your sentence, but before you place any punctuation, type the last name(s) of the author(s) and the page number(s) you are citing. For example:Jacques-Louis David’s painting The Oath of the Horatii may be analyzed as a binary opposition between masculinity and femininity (Nochlin 4).

, Capitalize each important word in a title. Italicize the titles of books, journals, magazines/newspapers, movies, music albums, works of art, and websites. Place the titles of articles, essays, chapters, songs, and TV shows in quotation marks., Refer to a source on your Works Cited page. Most of the time, you’ll refer to more than one source. Include each author’s last name and page number. For example:1. Several scholars have referred to the influence of color theory on Seurat’s painting. See Kleiner 664 and Herbert 144-145.

, Use this kind of note to discuss material that doesn’t directly relate to your main text. Include information that reiterates or clarifies your argument. For example:1. Popular culture has played a powerful role in the promotion of marriage, motherhood, and housewifery for women. See Friedan 33-41, 58-62 and Faludi 87-238.

Follow the APA handbook.,
Use parenthetical citations.,
Format titles correctly.,
Create a content note.,
Type a copyright note.",How to Write Footnotes3," APA discourages the use of footnotes. They’re only allowed when you need to clarify content or demonstrate copyright permissions. Double-space all notes and format them in Times New Roman 12-point font.

, Do this for all cited material in your main text. Include the author’s last name, the source’s publication date, and the page(s) you’re citing in parentheses. Place the information before the punctuation. For example:The symbolism in dreams arguably extends to jokes and folklore (Freud, 1952, p.111).

, Capitalize only the first letter of a title and subtitle. Italicize the titles of books, journals, magazines/newspapers, movies, music albums, works of art, and websites. Place the titles of articles, essays, chapters, songs, and TV shows in quotation marks.For example, a book title looks like this: And keep your powder dry: An anthropologist looks at America.


, Use content notes to elaborate one small piece of information that would make your main text seem awkward. Make your note as short as possible, preferably no more than a paragraph. If you mention the name of one or more authors, include the publication date of their work(s) that discuses the information in your note. For example:1. Freud (1952) links the symbolism found in dreams to jokes and folklore.

, Use this to demonstrate that you have the author’s permission to use their material. You only need to do this if your quoted or paraphrased material is more than 500 words, if you’re reproducing a visual aid, or if you think it violates the Fair Use clause of U.S. copyright law. Begin the entry with the word “Note.” For example:Note: From “Title of article,” by J. Doe and J. Smith, 2017, Title of Journal, 20, pp. 30-35. Copyright 2009 by Name of Copyright Holder. Reprinted with permission.

Refer to a website.",How to Write Footnotes4," The Chicago Manual of Style uses the author-date (social sciences) and the notes-and-bibliography (NB) systems (humanities).Author-date uses commentary footnotes—very sparingly.NB makes extensive use of discursive and bibliographic footnotes.

, Capitalize all important words in the title. Italicize the titles of books, journals, magazines/newspapers, movies, music albums, and works of art. Place the titles of articles, essays, chapters, songs, and TV shows in quotation marks., Whether you’re using NB or author-date, you should single-space your footnotes. Do not make your font size smaller than 10-point or larger than 12-point. Use a default typeface like Times New Roman or Arial., Discursive notes add information or commentary that isn’t immediately relevant to your main text. You can create them as stand-alone notes or after a citation in the NB format. (Check with your professor or editor for their preference.) For example:1. In this book, I put words like “masculinity” and “femininity” in quotation marks because they are defined by cultural, as opposed to biological, parameters.
2. Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, trans. Alan Sheridan (New York: Vintage, 1977), 196. The Panopticon system trains individuals to conform to rules or norms under the condition that they never know when they are being watched.

Shipman, The Invaders, 15-20.
2. Shipman, The Invaders.

, When you refer to a source two or more times in a row, use the abbreviation “Ibid.” (a Latin abbreviation of ibidem, which means “in the same place”). Follow the abbreviation with a comma and the page number. Don’t use this abbreviation when citing two different sources in a row. For example:1. Shipman, The Invaders, 15-20.
2. Ibid., 35.
The second note shows that you’re citing The Invaders again, but you’re citing different pages.

, Follow the same rules for formatting a book by one author. Include the first and last name(s) of the other author(s) in the same manner as you did with the first author. List the names in the same order as they appear on the title page.1. Jane Smith, John Doe, and Emily Jones, Random Title (Anytown, USA: Anonymous, 2017), 53-57.

, Enter the full name of the first author. Follow it with a comma and the abbreviation “et al” (from the Latin et alii, meaning “and others”). Continue formatting the citation as you would any other book. For example, if Random Title had one additional author, you’d cite it like this:1. Jane Smith, et al. Random Title (Anytown, USA: Anonymous, 2017), 53-57.

, If the author’s name is listed, enter that first. Type the title, followed by a comma. Enter the abbreviation “trans.,” followed by the name of the translator. Finish the entry like any other book. If the author’s name isn’t listed, start with the name of the translator, followed by “trans.” and the title of the book. For example:1. Sigmund Freud, On Dreams, trans.

Judy Sund, “Why so Sad?: Watteau’s Pierrots,” The Art Bulletin 98, no. 3 (September 2016): 321-347.
If the article is electronic, include the date you accessed the article, followed by the 10-digit Digital Object Identifier (DOI) after the page number(s)., If you refer to the same article or essay more than once, enter the last name of the author(s), followed by a comma. Type the main title of the article. Place a comma between the last word and closing quotation mark. Insert the page number(s) you refer to. For example:1. Lamm, “Portraits of the Past, Imagined Now,” 132-135.
2. Sund, “Why so Sad?,” 330.

, If the author’s name is listed, enter that first. If not, start with the title of the article. Place a comma between the last word and the closing quotation mark. Enter the title of the website.

, Select the upper-leftmost cell that you want your pasted data to appear in. Your pasted data will fill up the cells below and to the right of your starting cell.

, In newer versions of Excel, and if your data was properly delimited with tab stops, the cells should fill out appropriately with the correct data. Each tab stop should translate directly into a new cell for the data. If all of your data appears in a single column, there's a good chance Excel's delimiter was changed from tabs to something else, such as a comma. You can change this back to tabs by using the Text to Columns Tool.

, If your tab-delimited data did not paste correctly, you can use Excel's Text to Columns tool to format it properly. To do this, you'll need to select the entire column that contains all of the data you pasted.You can quickly select the entire column by clicking the letter at the top.

, If your data is tab-delimited, check the ""Tab"" box and uncheck any other boxes. You can check different characters if your data was separated by something else. If your data was split by multiple spaces instead of a tab stop, check the ""Space"" box and the ""Treat consecutive delimiters as one"" box. Note that this may cause problems if you have spaces in your data that don't indicate a column division.

, After selecting your delimiter, you'll be able to set the data format for each of the columns that are being created. You can select between ""General"", ""Text"", and ""Date"".

Choose ""Text"" for data that is just text, such as names.
Choose ""Date"" for data that is written in a standard date format.

, Select each column in the frame at the bottom of the window and choose the format. You can also choose not to include that column when converting the text.
